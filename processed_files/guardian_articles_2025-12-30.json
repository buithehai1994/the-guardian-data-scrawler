Noise aboutKeir Starmer’sdurability quietens with MPs being away from Westminster’s tearooms and murmuring corridors, but WhatsApps zing to and fro just as busily: should he stay or should he go?Any party that has fallen so far, so fast would doubt its leader.At minus 54%, Starmer has been declared the “most unpopular PM ever”, a title also held at one time by each of his four predecessors. Given how little Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Starmer have in common, whoever comes next may join their “most despised” club in this time of anti-politician volatility.Internally, Labour wrangles over what’s gained from changing the face at the top and what’s lost in political stability after the mad Tory years of No 10’s revolving door. Post-Brexit referendum, changing PMs four times in eight years all but destroyed the once “natural partyof government”. With everything “unprecedented”, history is no guide, old party loyalties are dying and new parties are making extravagant promises.In the Times, Fraser Nelson, the recent Spectator editor, discourages Labour fromditching its leader, warning it not to “hallucinate about miraculous powers of a fresh face”. A new PM would need a new mandate, he writes: “Without this, cabinet rifts become harder to control; backbenchers harder to tame. Things start to fall apart. Usually, such leaders end up calling an election either to seek a personal mandate (Theresa May) or put the party out of its agony (Sunak). Or just because he can no longer control parliament (James Callaghan).” But everyone cherrypicks from history, and this advice is not from a Labour well-wisher.Disingenuous counselcomes from the Sunday Times: “Labour still does not have a good reason to dump its elected prime minister.” Failure is a good reason.Peter Kellner, pollster and analyst,chooses from historythe example of John Major’s success. Replacing Margaret Thatcher in 1990 after she had sunk to her lowest, his ratings soared to 61% and he scored a fourth consecutive Tory victory in 1992. Major was remarkable only inhis insignificance, butThatcher’s unpopularityhad become an albatross. That’s what Labour’s would-be defenestrators say of Starmer:voters on the doorstepdetest him. The venom against a man who is serious and decent, with animpressive tally of good done, is a mystery to me. He might lack oratory and charisma, he might waver in direction – but after the prime ministers we have just suffered, this sinister detestation springs from a deeper fury against governments and ruling politicians. How long would a new leader’s bounce last?However, if May’s elections return cataclysmic results, with backbench and cabinet in foment and no light on the horizon,Labourmay do what it has never done. To avoid being the first formally ousted Labour PM, Starmer could with elegance and dignity stand down, saying: “I have done my best – time now for someone else.” That never happens, but we live in unprecedented times.When it became undeniable that the 2010 election would be lost, Gordon Brown should have stood aside, enhancing his reputation. A self-effacing Starmer resignation would make selecting the next leader a less damaging drama. The obvious candidates are good – Wes Streeting, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham are all clever and practised – but they all have to prove what “change” means.Don’t bother swapping leader for the optics and oracy. Labour MPs need a united reason why, with neither the dismal dirge ofBlue Labournor a fanciful Corbynite reprise. “Change” has to mean escape from the ill-conceived manifesto by openly declaring: “Since that was written, the world has changed beyond recognition: Donald Trump is president, tearing up alliances; Europe is at war; the global economy is threatened by a gigantic AI bubble; the far right is on the march.” Discard tax pledges that distort budget priorities. Abandon Brexit red lines, freeus to get as close as Europe will agree. Bring in proportional representation immediately to rescue democracy for five-party politics. Cleanse donations from Westminster.The government has been overwhelmed by lack of money, and that won’t change. Considering the Resolution Foundation’sgrim assessmentof its constrictions, a new leader has to say how they would do any better. What new bellows could ignite the embers of growth? Admit the magnitude of the problem with honesty to call out Nigel Farage and Green fantasy accounting. Tell us what government is for – it’s not just a matter of better words.Let me tell you the good things the government has done in 2025 – because it certainly won’t | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIt may be impossible for Labour MPs to agree on either the person or the policies of a new leader. Putsch attempts against Brown failed due to strife over a successor. Cabinet resignations calling publicly for him to “stand aside”, several plots, arebellious letterto all Labour MPs from two former cabinet ministers and a likely challenger disappearing in the crucial plotting hours made good stories: all Labour coverage became about possible assassination. That’s the risk of rumbling, indecisive insurrection.If enough Labour MPs have the nerve, the plan, the organisation and the clarity of purpose, then “’twere well it were done quickly”. Why wait for certain election calamity in May? With no crystal ball, so far it looks to me by no means sure that enough of them will summon the mutual forbearance across factions to agree a new way forward. The measure of successful “change” would be raising Labour’s ratings, seeing off Farage and doing those most difficult things the country needs. If that doesn’t happen, Labour might look back on the achievements of the Starmer era and wonder why they did it.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the most memorable questions and answersPamela Stephenson Connolly on two decades of solving readers’ sex problemsPamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 30 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 12.53 ESTShareMy wife has gone off the idea of a threesome – and I’m guttedMy wonderful new wife is everything I have always looked for in a woman. The issue is that she is openly and proudly bisexual. When we first became involved, she even joked that she didn’t want me getting mad when it was time for her to visit her friend on girls’ trips. A threesome with a bisexual woman has always been my fantasy. She even gave me permission to go online and find a “unicorn” for us. But when I set up a meeting, she didn’t seem to want to follow through with it, so I stopped looking. Recently, on holiday, she made a sexual comment about a girl in a bikini, so I again brought up the idea of a threesome. But she said she might have grown out of that phase of her life and just wants to be with me. She also said that adding another person would ruin the marriage, and I worry that things might change between us if we get together with another girl. I am at a loss as to what to do. If she is truly bisexual, I am worried that if those desires are not met, she may pursue them without me. My only rule is that if she is with a girl, I am also present. Most guys would love my situation – am I making this harder than it is?Listen to your wife. It is true that bringing another person into a relationship can be risky, and needs to be carefully negotiated and managed. And you don’t have to protect her bisexual interests – if she really wants to have sex with another woman, she will make that decision herself. Being bisexual does not necessarily mean one is interested in threesomes. You seem to have assumed it does, but it could be that the last thing your wife wants is to include you during sex with another woman. She implied this early on by saying she did not want you to get upset when she went off on a girls’ trip. It is also possible that your wife really is no longer interested in turning her bisexual fantasies into reality. All this is worth a frank conversation. Make sure you avoid blame or judgment, listen carefully, and help her to feel safe to educate you about her true sexual identity.My boyfriend and I enjoy sex marathons – but is 11 times a day too much?View image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianMy boyfriend and I both have extremely high sex drives – it’s the only relationship for both of us wherewe’re matched in this way. We recently passed 10 times in 24 hours, beating our personal best of eight.On our 11th attempt, it was too painful to go on.Ihave searched for advice on how to either make it hurt less or how long I should take to recover in between, in case that could be contributing to the pain. Is it possible that I amjust doing too much for my body?Sex is supposed to be pleasurable. If it hurts, stop (unless of course you like that – my advice here is not for those who eroticise pain). Nor is sex a competition, or a game of prowess. Take care of your bodies, and consider aspiring to quality of sex rather than quantity. You will have far more satisfying sex if you focus on the giving and receiving of pleasure. Goal-orientedness always diminishes enjoyment. Try to relax together and breathe. What is the point of having bragging rights if your genitals are red-raw? But if you are both intent on some level of achievement, make your goal purely to increase your pleasure levels – which will involve taking far more time to reach orgasm. Attempt just one amazing lovemaking session spread out over 24 hours – always stopping if either of you becomes sore – and you will see why instant gratification is grossly overrated.My girlfriend masturbates after we have sex. Why?I have been in a relationship for nine months. I thought the sex was good for us both, but when we finish she tells me to shower. I wondered why, and now I know – she masturbates. She has done it multiple times; I think she is insatiable. What should I do?Do nothing. Have your shower and let her get on with it. Such behaviour is very common and you need not worry that she secretly dislikes making love with you. Many women crave a second orgasm, especially if she has been super-aroused during intercourse. Perhaps she doesn’t want to bother you for that extra pleasuring, or maybe she is afraid you might think her too demanding. Many people – male and female – find the type of orgasm they have during masturbation (for women, often clitorally focused) to be qualitatively different from what is experienced during lovemaking. They find masturbation produces a deeply satisfying orgasm without the anxiety that can accompany partner sex.Sex with you could be fulfilling for her in myriad ways that cannot be reproduced during masturbation, yet she just happens to want that extra one. You may call that “insatiable”; I would call her “sexually proficient” and you “lucky” that she is so aroused by you. You might also consider the possibility that she is truly multi-orgasmic. If you wish to participate beyond your established lovemaking pattern, ask what exactly she would like you to do for her after you have climaxed. Be prepared to follow orders exactly – or be told to hit the shower.My boyfriend is instantly aroused – and climaxes without touching meEver since I’ve been with my boyfriend of two years, he gets an erection almost instantly when we’re in the bedroom. He then finishes very quickly, without any penetration and sometimes with no stimulation whatsoever. This happens every time. He then almost always finds it difficult to maintain an erection later that night. He is chronically sleep deprived and stressed due to work, and enjoys his alcohol, although we don’t drink when we’re together. I’m quite sure he’s attracted to me and the sex is not bad, but I wish he could maintain an erection more regularly.You are accepting of a great deal. Why? Do you not think you deserve better or have a right to ask for change? Chronic sleep deprivation, alcohol abuse, rapid ejaculation with presumably little pleasure for you … plus the insecurities about attractiveness he is instilling in you. I’m trying to understand why you are putting up with things that are not good for either of you. There are treatments and solutions for all these issues so pay attention to your own needs as well as his and at least make him aware that this doesn’t work for you. You urgently need to educate him about what you want, and gently help him to understand he is getting into very unhealthy patterns of behaviour – sexually and work-wise – that are unnecessary and fixable.I can never achieve orgasm, no matter what my boyfriend doesView image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianI’m a 24-year-old female and I can never achieve orgasm. I feel as if I get close sometimes. Clitoral stimulation seems to help, but I still can’t quite get there. My boyfriend feels as if he’s not good enough because he can’t make me orgasm. I feel broken. What do I do?Many – perhaps most – women orgasm only through very direct clitoral stimulation. Stop trying to achieve orgasm through vaginal coitus alone, and educate your boyfriend about what is real and true for you. Teach him exactly how you like to be touched and try to transfer his misplaced pride in providing orgasm with his penis to the far more useful and appreciated techniques of manual or oral clitoral attention. Encourage him in his efforts, be tolerant of his early mistakes and praise him when he gets it right. It really is your job to share your exact needs with him (as well as listening and acting on his) rather than trying to fit into the mythology of “vaginal climaxing is best”. It is not, but you can also find ways to have him excite you more during intercourse by direct additional manual contact with your clitoris, or you could touch yourself or use sex toys. Male desires for orgasm-to-order are often based on simple inexperience, poor technique, or embarrassment about not knowing what to do. Teach him, and he will be very grateful.My stunning wife makes no effort with our sex life – and I’m losing all interestMy wife and I have been married for several years. Over the past six months, I have felt my overall sexual attraction to her diminishing to the point that, even though she is absolutely stunning (she could be a model, which I am reminded of by strangers almost every time we go out together), I no longer find myself sexually attracted to her. At the start of our relationship, the sex was OK and we were very sexually active for the first two years. I have explained to her that she lacks passion, no matter how much energy I bring. She rarely initiates sex, and when she does, she simply says, “We should have sex tonight,” which is a turn-off. In our last conversation, she said she is just shy. After several conversations, she said she understood what she needed to do and would work on it, but shortly afterwards she asked for sex outright without any real effort with mood or energy, so I just didn’t feel up to it and turned her down again. Two months on, she has settled back into just avoiding it. She is a lovely, caring woman, but my patience has worn thin, which sucks in such a young marriage. I don’t know what to do.When a person feels judged – especially as frequently as you have described – they can lose confidence and withdraw. As a rule, positive reinforcement is the best way to teach a person. In your situation, that would mean praising and rewarding even small achievements and never again finding fault. I suspect she is feeling confused – especially if you have not been sufficiently specific with her about what you like. It is not enough to complain: “You never initiate sex!” Instead you could, say, mention a video you once saw, where a woman unexpectedly walked through the living room wearing “X” or “Y”, then invited a man to follow her upstairs – and ask her to consider doing something similar. Your wife cannot read your mind, and I believe she does not really understand how to be seductive the way you would like. So, she may need very specific requests such as: “Would you mind doing this, saying this, wearing this?” If she addresses any of your requests in even small ways, be sure to praise and reward her amply. Eventually she will regain confidence. But in terms of her own libido, it is up to you to kindly and non-judgmentally encourage her to share her own interests and tastes with you. This might be uncomfortable for her, so do not push – again, praise her and act on anything she does reveal. Your job is to discover how she likes to be pleasured – that is the best way to fix this.Since I admitted to a foot fetish, my wife will no longer let me near her feetI have always given foot massages to my wife, and she has enjoyed them. But since I admitted to having a foot fetish, things have changed. She used to proffer them to me and I would massage them. It feels as if the moment I admitted I got pleasure from it, she saw it as a zero-sum game and withdrew. This wouldn’t matter if she was open and honest, but it’s as if she has put up a wall. Massaging her feet felt like a way to connect. This fetish won’t go away and I don’t want it to. I will indulge it on my own because I am bored with sex always being on her terms. I’m bored with everything seemingly being on her terms.Ingrained fetishes can rarely be ignored or banished. Without an understanding or supportive partner, you will continue to be miserable and frustrated. But sometimes a partner’s avoidance or withdrawal is based on lack of information, or a fear that they are not wholly appreciated. Your wife may even feel uncomfortable and confused about her own role in previously acting out your erotic interest in feet. Try to talk frankly and kindly with her and find ways to help her understand your needs, while also making her feel loved and appreciated. She has her own needs, so ask what you can do to give her pleasure. Longevity between couples with different sexual interests is often based on the ability to negotiate parity in pleasure so that neither feels resentful.My wife says we can only have sex at weekends – and it must be spontaneousView image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianMy wife and I have been married for more than 10 years, but recently our sex drives have gone in different directions. My desire to have sex with her is increasing, but this is not reciprocated. She has said we can have sex only at the weekend, but that it should not be planned as she prefers spontaneity. Given that we have two children with lots of hobbies and activities, as well as our own interests, the opportunities for even planned sex are limited. I find myself getting tense at the thought of no intimacy and it can feel quite stressful as the weekend progresses. Any suggestion that we could do it on a weekday is immediately rejected. I love my wife deeply and find her even more attractive than when we met. But this situation is very difficult and I am not prepared to have an unsatisfying sex life for ever.Sex can become a realm in which a couple plays out a power struggle, and this may be true for you and your wife. Given your busy lives, with the stress and uncertainty of your family responsibilities, I’m not surprised you are feeling frustrated and that you lack options. It is very likely that your wife is making sex impossible because, in reality, she is tired, preoccupied or overwhelmed. Instead of trying to fit in with her demands or negotiating time for intimacy, I think it would be best to take a look at the broader picture – which would ideally be done via couples counselling. There is probably something of an imbalance between you that is being expressed in the sexual arena and it would be important to get to the bottom of it before your sex life can be restored.My husband’s big penis is destroying our sex lifeMy husband has a big penis and every time we have sex my vulva tears. We use silicone lubricant (water-based dried up too quickly) and avoid certain positions, to no avail. That is the only advice I have ever found online and I am too embarrassed to ask my GP for help. This has only been a problem with my husband, not previous partners. Is there anything else we can do to avoid injury? It has reduced our sex life greatly, as it makes me nervous to initiate anything. My husband is very understanding and gentle, and we do oral or manual stimulation, but I miss the intimacy of penetrative sex. We have been together almost 10 years and the tearing is getting worse.Stop allowing penetration until you can fix this. The tearing and pain will probably get even worse; in fact you may already be suffering from vaginismus, which is where your vagina fails to become open and lubricated in preparation for sex because previous pain has set up a protective reflex. There are a number of options to make your sex life comfortable and pleasurable again.First, do not allow the prospect of discussing your husband’s big penis stop you from getting help. You are not alone; many couples have such a problem and fail to receive help for the same reason. You may need treatment for vaginismus or a course of self-dilation – a good sex therapist can help you with this. Most importantly, you must never again allow penetration until you are fully ready and desirous – and confident it can be comfortable.I love my boyfriend, but I really don’t want to have sex with himView image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianI’m 20 years old and I have been going out with my boyfriend for nearly two years. I love him so much and have missed him constantly when we haven’t been able to see each other during the pandemic. However, when I do get the chance to see him, I no longer want to be intimate. I just want to curl up all day and hug. I hate it when he starts to kiss me too much, because I know that means he wants to have sex. I don’t enjoy the lead-up and I feel bad as I never instigate it. Ultimately, I will just do it to get it done with. I just don’t see the point. I have never had an orgasm and now I don’t enjoy being naked or being touched. Despite this, we get on so well and I see a future for us together.It is a mistake to put up with sex when you really don’t want it. Your feelings – including the lack of them – are valid. In just going through the motions, you can set up an emotionally costly habit ofbypassing your true feelings in order to please others. Your needs for comforting touch are just as important as his sexual needs, so do your best to negotiate a more balanced give-and-take between you. It is also important to discover the reason for your general lack of sexual interest. Many people are experiencing low sexual drive at the moment, due to Covid-related fear, anxiety and depression. But if you have never felt attracted to him, and if your lack of interest in sex with him continues over time, that may be a sign that he is simply not for you, or that you might benefit from a sexual wellness check-up.I am extremely attracted to my brother-in-law – and now we’re locked down togetherBecause of the coronavirus, I am staying in my late mother’s home with my husband, his brother and wife, and our young children. This seemed like a good idea, so we could share chores and childcare (two of us are still working, from home, full time). But the situation has become uncomfortable for me because I am extremely attracted to my brother-in-law. I had hoped this feeling would die down, but it has got worse and over the past three weeks I have become aware that he seems to be lusting after me. My husband and I rarely have sex, owing to his lack of interest, which set in after our second child was born, so I am frustrated and afraid that something is going to happen, or that others in the house will pick up on the vibe between us. How can I stop this feeling?Under normal circumstances, erotic tension is increased when there is an obstacle to acting on it. But now you have an extra challenge, because courting danger in non-virus-related ways is a common behaviour during this time. Like many others, you may be unconsciously drawn to a peril that you can control. Recognise this and set firm boundaries. Do your best never to be alone in a room with your brother-in-law. Stop fantasising about him. Increase your bonds with his wife and children. Work to improve your relationship with your husband and try to reawaken your sex life together. Focus on your children, on establishing routine, exercising, calming your mind and keeping your family safe. All this shall pass.My wife said her ex was a better lover than me – and we haven’t had sex sinceView image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianI’ve been with my wife for 20 years. For the first few years we had a fairly active sex life, but suddenly, during an argument, she announced that sex with her former husband was better than with me. Since then we have not had sex. I guess this is because I subconsciously believe that if we do, I will be competing to be better than her ex. I have attempted to discuss this with her but she has closed the door on that possibility. She has also moved into her own bedroom because of my snoring. Is there any way back (or forward maybe)?A statement made in anger by one’s partner that is designed to hurt and humiliate is rarely fully accurate. Try not to take this as the truth. What is most relevant is that your wife has pushed you away and withdrawn … and it’s not really about your snoring. As a couple, you have some vital repair work that needs to be done. I would start by seeking some help for your self-esteem, and learn how to best open the conversation. It is likely that you would greatly benefit from couples counselling. Many people reach an impasse in their relationship, then simply retreat and live in misery from then on. Don’t let this happen to you. Remind your wife that you both enjoyed being together once, and implore her to join you in doing your very best to get that back.I can’t ejaculate during sex. Is it because I masturbate?I enjoy sex with my girlfriend but I can’t ejaculate during sex. We have had sex six times and no matter how much I try I still can’t. Does my masturbation habit cause this?There are a number of possible reasons for this relatively common complaint. First, certain medications can lead to orgasmic problems, so if you’re taking anything, check out the side-effects. Sometimes men who can’t ejaculate are considered “studs” by their partners because they last a long time, but this actually makes such men feel like workhorses and they can become frustrated and resentful. Does this ring any bells? Do you really always enjoy sex with your girlfriend? I wonder if, while thrusting, you’re actually sufficiently aroused to reach orgasm?Your frequency of masturbation is probably not an issue. However, men who have become accustomed to self-pleasuring in a particularly rough way eg using high friction with a towel, sometimes have difficulty climaxing during intercourse, because no vagina feels like that. Seek help from a sex therapist who can make suggestions that are particular to you and could also provide treatment if your difficulty is based on something else, such as fear or anxiety. Finally, instead of worrying about climaxing, concentrate on giving and receiving pleasure; then nature is more likely to take its course.My new sexual partner is too big for me – what can I do?I am a 66-year-old woman 11 years out of a 30-year marriage. My husband left to live with the woman he had been having an affair with, but the marriage hadn’t been right for some years and our sexual activity had diminished drastically. I have a male friend who is the same age as me and we are friends with benefits – only the benefits don’t work. He can’t penetrate me. Either I have shrunk or he is just a big lad (after 30 years of monogamy, I am not exactly au fait with penis sizes). It makes me feel sad and inadequate. We pleasure each other in other ways, but it would appear that penetration is off the table. Before I consult a doctor, what am I doing wrong?You are not doing anything wrong. In fact, it is wonderful that you understand the erotic value of non-penetrative sex. Some men with atypically large penises struggle to find women who can accommodate them, but it is not certain that your friend falls into this category. After a long period of abstinence – and most likely hormonal diminution – some women do experience some vaginal atrophy that restricts penetration with a penis of any size.Consider experimenting with gentle self-penetration once you are aroused through masturbation (use lubrication); this may help you understand your current genital physiology. But most likely, if you want to receive penetration comfortably again, it would be wise to consult a sexual medicine professional who may be able to help. Typical treatments include hormone therapy, sex therapy and vaginal dilation.I met my girlfriend’s parents and realised I had once slept with her fatherView image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianFive years ago, I went through a bi phase and used to sleep around with pretty much everyone that came along, including other men. This changed when I fell in love with my new partner, who is everything to me. I recently met her parents and halfway through lunch realised that I had slept with her father. I was going to propose, but when my partner and her mother were away, he told me to end it with his daughter. I’m obviously in love. Shall I just ignore him, or tell my partner?I am not sure you could ever have a comfortable future with your new partner. To tell the truth would be to court disaster: a probable break-up, plus the risk of a permanent rift between father and daughterandfather and wife. Hiding the truth would lead to toxic secret-keeping that could be equally destructive in the long run. If this whole family was as open-minded and sexually open as you, it might be possible for you to become part of it. However, the father – your former lover – has made it clear that you will not be welcome. Walk away now, and avoid the massive pain that would otherwise be inflicted on your partner, her family and yourself.I masturbate a dozen times a day. Am I addicted?I fear I am addicted to masturbation. If I do not masturbate three or four times a day, I feel incredibly frustrated. On particularly “active” days, I can masturbate upwards of 12 times. I find it very difficult to maintain a relationship because I have very little to no sexual desire and find it extremely difficult to maintain an erection. I have tried to cut down, but going cold turkey affects me negatively. I find myself in an almost drunken stupor, and sometimes this manifests itself in saying inappropriate things to friends and co-workers.Many experts are uncomfortable with the concept of “addiction” being applied to sexuality, since it implies that sex is not essentially a normal and healthy human activity. But the kind of sexual compulsivity that you have described is a serious condition that requires urgent professional treatment.Sex– including masturbation – is normal and healthyunlessit is practised in a way that causes lasting harm or is coercive in any way. And when it negatively affects one’s daily life – as is the case with you – it becomes a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Constant compulsive urges can occur in many forms other than sexual – for example, to touch certain objects such as doors or light switches, to wash one’s hands very often – can be aspects of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). So if OCD is expressed sexually, it is not one’s sexuality per se that is the problem, but rather, a treatable “hiccup of the brain”. Get help from a psychologist, or perhaps join a programme that is based on a 12-step method. Whatever you decide, remember that your basic sexual desire itself is not evil or abnormal; you just need help with the urge to express it excessively and compulsively.I am 25 and have never been kissed. Have I missed my chance?I am 25 and have never had sex. I have never been in a relationship, kissed anyone or even held someone’s hand in a romantic way. It has never happened for me. I feel so much shame about this, as if I have done something wrong. When people ask me why I have never had sex, I usually reply that no one has ever expressed any interest. But I hate the fact that people can sometimes tell I am a virgin without me saying so, and wonder what it is that gives it away.The only sexual experiences I have had, I didn’t consent to. The first time a boy saw me naked was without my consent; I have been groped in nightclubs; men have asked me for sexual favours and told me that they thought of me while masturbating. But no one has ever initiated any consensual intimacy andI have been so scared of doing it wrong that I haven’t either. All of this bothers me more and more as I get older, and I can’t help feeling that I have missed my chance. I have missed the time when people my own age would be patient and understanding with me. How do you go on a date with a stranger and explain that you have never done any of this before?You do not have to reveal anything about your virginity to anyone, ever. At 25, you are still extremely young, and many people will think you are simply discerning and focused on other things. In any case, it is none of their business. But do ask yourself, are you interested in sex, or are you just acting out what you believe is expected, conventional behaviour? Have you ever had a strong sexual desire for anyone, even in fantasy? Have you ever masturbated? If the answer is mainly “no”, then stop torturing yourself by comparing yourself with others. You have a right to be who you are – even if that is someone who simply does not wish to be sexual with anyone, ever. Above all, don’t let peer pressure push you into doing something you don’t want to do. There is no rule that says youhaveto lose your virginity.I love my boyfriend, but I fantasise about being with a womanView image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianI love my boyfriend so much, but our sex is unfulfilling and feels like a chore. I’ve only climaxed with him once in 18 months and our libidos never seem to match. My biggest problem, though, is that I want to be with a woman. I’ve been bi for years, but this straight relationship is the only thing I have, and we are pretty serious. I don’t want to ruin that. At the same time, I long to be with a woman much more than a man and I fantasise about spending the rest of my life with a woman. I can see me doing that with him as well, but I’m not nearly as excited about it. We have talked about our problems, but nothing is changing, even after months of trying. We want to get better, but it is almost as if we physically can’t.Some people in your position are able to negotiate room for another person within their primary relationship, although that can be very challenging for all involved. But if that is not an option for you and your boyfriend, you need to decide what you really want in the long term. You are clearly restless and long to feel more fulfilled with someone, so I wonder what is stopping you from exploring other possibilities? Perhaps you value the stable relationship you have above your need to be who you truly are sexually – but I’m sure it has already dawned on you that not following your true desires could lead to a life of regret and resentment. Try to find a way to learn more about what your real needs are and how they can best be met.I’m scared to tell my new partner about what happens when I orgasmI am 37 and a single disabled mum to 13-year-old twins. I have not had sex in more than 11 years because I urinate when I orgasm. I also don’t feel attractive because of my scars and limitations. Now I’ve started dating a man who is nine years my junior and, while he is a great guy, I’m scared to have sex with him. How can I talk with him about my concerns so we can embark on the next stage of our relationship?Talk to a doctor about your incontinence. There are solutions, and finding one will greatly improve your confidence. I recommend that you approach the subject of your sexual concerns playfully, even seductively. Try to use humour, and keep in mind that when there is strong mutual sexual desire, most limitations can be accommodated. You are the one who knows what your sexual needs are and exactly how to achieve them, and it is important to share that with him once you feel that acting on your attraction for each other is likely or inevitable. Do not expect him to read your mind. He will probably need very specific guidance and, if he is a caring person, he will be grateful for the information and eager to comply. Don’t forget to reciprocate by inquiring about his specific sexual needs and doing your best to meet them.My boyfriend is wonderful and loving, but he has a tiny penisAfter a series of unsuitable boyfriends, I have met a wonderful loving man. However, he has an extremely small penis. He can get an erection and we are able to have penetrative sex, but I often feel little to nothing, although he is a sensitive lover in other ways. I am full of regret that, if this is to be my life partner, I might never be able to enjoy penetrative sex in quite the same way again.Regarding relationships, what exactly is your goal? Is it to find the perfect person, or the perfect penis? Would you accept my word for the fact that neither exists? Your search for complete and utter satisfaction on every scale is likely to lead to disappointment, dissatisfaction and regret. True intimacy and wonderfully loving human connections are partly defined by the ability of each person to see and accept the “failings” of the other, and to accept and share one’s own shortcomings. You are at an early stage in this new relationship, but rejecting an otherwise “wonderful” man on the basis of his penis size may be very unwise, especially since he is a fulfilling lover in nonpenetrative ways. Most nerve endings that help trigger pleasure and orgasm are in a woman’s clitoris, not the vagina. And over time, needs and bodies change, and desire waxes and wanes. When judging a partner’s ability to be satisfying in the long run, the only reliable benchmark is his willingness to learn to please you.My wife and I are suffering ‘lesbian bed death’. Is there any way back?View image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianMy wife and I, both women in our 60s, have been together for more than 20 years. We stopped having sex about 13 years ago, due to a combination of getting a dog (who sleeps with us) and her going through the menopause. I had a bit of a lull in my own libido when I went through menopause about nine years ago, but it came roaring back. She is not interested in sex at all and is also resentful that I have a hoarding problem, even though I’m in therapy for it. I think she may be using that as an excuse to withhold affection (when asked, she doesn’t confirm or deny it). Do you think there is any hope that we can resolve our “lesbian bed death”? We’re in couples therapy, but I don’t think it is helping much.The stance of “withholding affection” can be a fully conscious act or it can be unconscious. In other words, a person might be fully committed to her partner and (in principle) wish to be intimate, yet deeply held resentment arrests that desire. I’m glad you are in couples therapy, as, over time, that could break the impasse between you and heal various issues that may have arisen in the past. Try to avoid labelling your lack of intimacy as “lesbian bed death”, since that catch-all phrase can support a helpless attitude. Your partnership is far from a cliche.During your many years together – for all kinds of understandable reasons – you have mutually made unspoken agreements to allow dogs, menopause and life in general to interrupt your erotic connection without your finding the way back. The fact that your libido has come “roaring back” is a wonderful thing for you, but your partner is clearly not ready. Be gentle, patient, understanding, open, attentive … and do the work.My younger partner wants five-hour sex sessions and I can’t keep upI am a male aged 51 and my partner is 40. Six months ago, she left a loveless marriage. I enjoy the sex but sometimes it can last four to five hours, and she will orgasm on average a similar number of times. I have secretly been using Viagra to help me, but I fear that if I ever say I am tired or don’t want to continue, she will be disappointed or angry.No matter who says “no” (or “no more”) – male or female – it truly means “no” and must always be respected. It is very important to set boundaries. I am not surprised you are using medication to help; one’s ability to become, and remain, aroused can be negatively affected by the psychological effects of feeling pressured to “perform”. There are, however, a number of strategies you could try – for example, using oral or manual techniques, erotic games and role play, or toys. It could also be worth exploring tantric techniques, since some are well designed to prolong erotic sessions in a less performance-oriented fashion. At the very least, have a frank conversation with her that begins with a reaffirmation of the enjoyment you experience, then progresses to explaining that there is a point during these sessions when you stop enjoying them – especially when you feel overburdened by performance pressure – and must insist on taking breaks. Let her know that at such times you need her understanding and respect.I don’t like the way my partner smellsI have been with my partner for more than three years. We have a wonderful relationship and go out of our way to make each other feel held, loved, listened to. We moved in together last year and have a great partnership in the home. We also have regular date nights and the sex remains good. But I don’t like his smell. He doesn’t smell bad, it’s just that his natural odour is not a smell I enjoy. It isn’t his body odour from when he has been running or lifting weights. It’s not conscious, I just have a bodily response that says, “that’s not my thing”. Sometimes, I wonder if this is telling of something deeper. Do you need to be drawn to the odour of the person you love?People have different priorities in terms of what draws them close to a partner. Many are very visually oriented and need attractive presentations. Some are kinaesthetics, so they react best to the feel of a person when they touch. You seem to have a sensibility that is more olfactory, so smell is extremely important to you. In addition, a person’s natural scent carries chemicals such as pheromones that are important elements in the biology of attraction. I wouldn’t be surprised if you have some regrets about setting up home with someone to whom you do not feel physically bonded, but I wonder why you chose to do that? Perhaps it would be advisable to ask yourself some questions, such as: do you like theideaof being with someone like your partner more than you actually like being intimate with him? Have you ever felt a strong attraction to anyone … and liked their smell? Did your partner’s smell appeal to you earlier on in the relationship? If yes, when did it change? Are there fragrances, such as aftershave, that he could use that you would enjoy more? There is also the possibility that your partner’s smell may be linked to a medical condition that requires treatment.

Then perhaps what you need is a bubble tea.That is the philosophy guiding Brother Dong, a Chinese-German volunteer inUkraine. The 52-year-old former officer in China’s People’s Armed Police drives once a month from his home in Frankfurt to collect a haul of tapioca pearls from a warehouse in Berlin. From there he drives across Poland to reach Ukraine.Brother Dong, who asked that the Guardian use his nickname for privacy reasons, is one of a small handful of Chinese volunteers in Ukraine. For him, the tapioca pearls are an opportunity to show his support for a country under siege by China’s biggest ally.For many other Chinese people in Ukraine, support for Kyiv comes from a distrust of authoritarianism. With no way of expressing their political beliefs in China, Ukraine has become a forum in which some Chinese feel they can play a more active role in the global struggle between democracy and dictatorship. But their support comes at a price: harassment from Beijing, for themselves and their families.‘I wanted to do something more meaningful’: the Chinese nationals fighting for UkraineRead more‘We have courage in our blood’Brother Dong opened the first of his bubble tea shops in Odesa in November 2022, crowdfunding more than $12,000, mostly from the Chinese diaspora, to start his business. Now he runs four “Maomi cafes” in different Ukrainian cities, stocking a range of Asian drinks and snacks. The shops are run on a for-profit basis, although he says he is yet to make any money from them.Bubble tea is the unofficial national drink of Taiwan, although it is now popular across China and other parts of east Asia. It comes in a dizzying array of flavours, but the most typical way of drinking it is as a sweetened milky tea containing chewy tapioca “bubbles” made from cassava root.The walls of Maomi are adorned with pictures of Chinese and Taiwanese soldiers – all volunteers – killed in the fight against the Russian invasion. “We do it so they are not forgotten,” said Brother Dong on a video call from Frankfurt. He wants to remind the youths who come for bubble tea: “We, the Chinese, the Taiwanese, have courage in our blood, and we will help you.”Each round trip to collect the pearls can be up to 5,000km, Brother Dong estimates. As well as bubble tea ingredients, Brother Dong carries other supplies that might be useful in Ukraine, especially in the depths of its frigid winter: blankets, gloves, portable heaters. After crossing the border into the western city ofLviv,Brother Dong and a small team of about 10 volunteers, known as the “Odesa Fighting Cats”, distribute the goods across the country, including to four bubble tea shops that Brother Dong has opened since the start of the Russian invasion. The shops are “not a business plan”, he wrote on Instagram recently, but a “belief in leaving a little light in the dark”.View image in fullscreenBrother Dong with the employees of the Maomi cafe in Lviv.Photograph: Katya Moskalyuk/The GuardianBrother Dong is one of a growing band of Chinese volunteers who are lending their support to Ukraine, even as the international community grows increasingly alarmed by Beijing’s support for Moscow in the war effort.China claims to be neutral in the conflict and has called for peace, but its trade with Russia has soared since the start of the invasion in February 2022, and there is mounting concern about Beijing’s support for Moscow’s military operations, particularly through the export of parts needed to make weapons, such as ball-bearings and fibre-optic cables.In Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, such as Luhansk, there arereportsof Chinese businesses opening, such as a Chinese-run school for teaching students Russian. In July, Ukraine arrested a Chinese father and son who weresuspectedof spying on Kyiv’s Neptune cruise missile programme.Those arrests led to Chinese people being treated with more suspicion in Ukraine, volunteers say. Some have been subjected to lengthy checks at the border. But people like Brother Dong and the artistDu Yinghongare determined to win over any doubts the Ukrainian people may have.In October, Du, who left China for Thailand in 2022, travelled to Ukraine “to use my body and my works to support Ukraine”. Painted head to toe in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag, he is travelling around the country to meet local people and show his support for those affected by the war. He also has plans to open an art gallery near Kyiv. “I want to interact with them. In this country, everyone has a slogan that boosts their national spirit:Slava Ukraini,meaning glory to Ukraine. So whenever you say this to Ukrainians, they will reply:Heroiam Slava(Glory to the heroes)”, he said.View image in fullscreenDu Yinghong in Ukraine.Photograph: Du YinghongOne of the aims of this new Chinese diaspora is to draw attention to the ethnically Chinese people killedfighting for Ukraine. The most famous of these is Peng Chenliang, a man from Yunnan province who was killed in 2024. There is also Tseng Sheng-guang, a Taiwanese volunteer, who in November 2022 became the first soldier from east Asia to be killed since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion.But they are also charting their own path away from the diktats of the Chinese Communist party, which oversees a state-run media in which pro-Russia content drowns out anything supportive of Ukraine.‘A violation of human dignity’Brother Dong’s journey began in the 1990s. After leaving China’s armed forces and moving toEurope, he settled in Germany, working as a tour guide. But he held on to his Chinese passport. Even as he raised three children, he would sing the Chinese national anthem to them at home. “Why? Because I was patriotic towards China and the Chinese Communist party.” For Brother Dong, patriotism, loyalty to theparty, and love for his family “were all blended into one”.It wasn’t until the Covid-19 pandemic that Brother Dong started to question his lifelong loyalty to the CCP. When his mother-in-law fell ill, pandemic control restrictions meant that she couldn’t see a doctor or get her medication. His wife, who had travelled to China to be by her side, was kept in hotel quarantine in Shanghai for 15 days, during which time her mother died. “It was an absolute violation of human dignity,” he said. “I never imagined that the party and the government we once loved would do such things. Why couldn’t they let her children see her one last time? I still can’t understand it.”A few months later, Brother Dong applied for German citizenship. Then the war in Ukraine brought thoughts about authoritarianism to his doorstep.View image in fullscreenBrother Dong unfurls a flag with his compatriots who died in the Russia-Ukraine war.Photograph: Katya Moskalyuk/The Guardian“I believe there is some connection between this pandemic and the war in Ukraine … These are actions driven and desired by authoritarian regimes and dictators around the world today. And we ordinary people are often completely powerless to resist such forces.”Having been unable to help people, including his own family, during the pandemic, Brother Dong wanted to channel that energy towards supporting people in Ukraine, whom he sees as being under a similar assault from authoritarianism as the people in China.But in China, publicly declaring your support for Ukraine comes at a price. On a recent trip, Chinese border agents detained Brother Dong for more than four hours and searched his phone (he stresses that he handed over his device voluntarily), interrogating him about his activities in Ukraine, including whether he planned to join the army.When Du, the artist, organised a petition for Chinese people to support Ukraine, more than 200 people signed it. The letter said that they were “a group of peace-loving, justice seeking Chinese people” who “will always support Ukraine”. After delivering the petition to various Ukrainian embassies, several of the signatories received calls from the Chinese police, Du said.But Du is undeterred. Having arrived in Ukraine in the autumn ago, he says he plans to open an art museum to display works inspired by the war.And Brother Dong, now armed with the protection of a German passport, says he wants to continue supporting Ukraine through peaceful methods.“Although I cannot go to the battlefield or take up arms,” he said, “I still hope to do everything I can to help the mothers and children of Ukraine,” who remind him of his own mother, thousands of miles away.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsUkraineChinaRussiaEuropeAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hours earlier, four young locals had been wrangled into being live presenters at their quiet village Sunday school. Despite dead air and awkward line delivery, it was the poor transmission quality that made the stars – Michelle Hornby (31), Jonathan Brown (27), James Warburton (25) and Deborah Cowking (21) – apologise and cut the inaugural broadcast. But Cowking, not realising they were still on air, slipped past the censors and summed up the evening’s vibe perfectly: chaotic, amateur and unrelentingly British.This was TheTelevisionVillage – a first-of-its-kind social experiment from 1990 that had the Lancashire village of Waddington “watch, make and become” television. For a short spell in the early 90s, the Ribble Valley was worth a fortune, as Granada Television shipped £3m worth of cutting-edge TV equipment to the rural hills of north-west England. Hidden cameras were set up in villagers’ living rooms to record viewing habits, day and night. Meanwhile, Channel 4 filmed the entire thing for a six-part documentary series. All of this was to monitor how people would react when the number of channels made the leap from four up to 30 – offering everything from sport, film and even porn, with villagers having access to terrestrial, cable and satellite channels, including from Europe and the US.View image in fullscreenWorth a fortune … Granada Television shipped £3m worth of cutting edge kit to the tiny Ribble Valley.Photograph: Courtesy George Francis LeeBut one of the new channels caught the village’s attention more than any other: Waddington Village TV. Granada felt that local programming and local TV stations would be the future, so they gave villagers a station they had control over to see how popular it would prove. With dedicated presenters and sets put together with old settees and gaffer tape, the DIY station became an eclectic outlet, broadcasting self-written soap operas, horoscope readings and magic tricks. Think cheesy stock music and thick Lancashire accents. Yet without autocues, makeup or professional technicians, WVTV became a smash hit, gobbling up 95% of its available audience, technically making it the best-performing station in the world. When Coronation Street was knocked off its pedestal, Granada knew something was up.Numerous people recall the broadcast being interrupted. It turned out a sheep had chewed through cable wires“The villagers all loved it,” says Cowking from a seat in the Lower Buck Inn in Waddington, “because they’d see themselves, see their families, see the vicar.” According to Cowking, Granada hadn’t anticipated the channel’s success: “When they first started filming us and doing it, they actually said: ‘Don’t worry about it, it probably won’t even air.’”None of the team of four had wanted to be presenters, but the village of about 400 had a small pool of willing participants. Brown had volunteered to help out with the cameras, but instead found himself in front of them.Most of the ideas for WVTV programming came from this Waddington four. Students from then-Lancashire Polytechnic were tasked with producing the shows, which were recorded in front of a live audience. There was the vicar’s Thought for the Day, keep fit classes and a cooking programme by the butcher’s wife Barbara. “In a small community you run out of things you can do a feature on,” Cowking admits. “But when you think about it, Barbara probably came before Nigella Lawson.”“We weren’t journalists,” Brown says. “We still had to live in the village when the TV people had gone.”People were climbing on their roofs and turning their aerials to get the village channel instead of Coronation StreetThis lack of formal training came back to bite the presenters multiple times. Hornby remembers being chastised by a producer for ruining “continuity” after getting a perm; Terry Jones of Monty Python fame tried to eat the studio’s pet goldfish during an interview; and the whole production was put at risk when a Weetabix box that was being used as a prop to hold up scripts out of sight of the camera was accidentally broadcast, potentially breaching advertising rules. Numerous people involved with the station recall the broadcast being interrupted, only for it to turn out that a sheep had chewed through cable wires.Waddington’s kids were also roped in, with three hours every Saturday dedicated to programmes made for and by young villagers. Gilly Czerwonka, a teacher at the time, helped gather a pool of children to write and star in the shows – often without any form of parental consent. She recalls one episode where the youngsters acted out a robbery on Waddington post office and high-tailed it in a car she had to drive.Despite gaffes and a low budget, the presenters were a smash hit with the locals, and WVTV made news across the globe, with the 21-year-old Cowking even receiving fanmail. But the coverage wasn’t without its snobbery.“There was a lot of condescension,” says Luise Fitzwalter, the editor of The Television Village, “these ‘hicks from up north’ – which was absolute nonsense.”“Everyone adored it,” she continues. “People from far and wide were climbing on their roofs and turning their aerials to get the village channel instead of Coronation Street. Granada said to me: ‘What have you done?! Our flagship programme!’”The production side of the experiment was a monumental task, with engineers, researchers, producers and camera operators living in Waddington for two months in the lead-up. Fitzwalter says they thought it would be “great, great fun and terribly naughty” to persuade the global manufacturers of the latest tech – from widescreen TVs to Sky – to send their prototypes to a remote village in Granadaland. Though the cabling had been hidden in the stream that runs through the village’s award-winning scenery, the imposing, aerial-adorned command centre in the car park of the Higher Buck pub caused Cowking’s mother to exclaim: “If nana came back to life now, she’d think the sputniks had landed!”View image in fullscreen‘If nana came back to life now, she’d think the sputniks had landed!’ … Waddington village, home to a huge command centre covered in aerials.Photograph: Courtesy George Francis LeeNaturally, the parish council wanted to keep an eye on things – as did the Independent Broadcasting Authority once they found out what was happening. “We had created a channel without asking anyone if we could,” Fitzwalter laughs. The village channel even made adverts for local firms, but allegedly had to return the money after the IBA caught wind.Just before launch, legal tangles around copyright threatened to kill the entire project. Until, according to Fitzwalter, Granada company secretary Alastair Mutch said: “Oh stuff it, let them sue.”Luckily for Granada, no complaints ever came in, nor did the porn channel spur outrage. “We agonised about it,” says Mark Gorton, the second director of the experiment. “We went round with forms, basically saying that if people were driven mad by smut that it wasn’t Granada’s fault.”We put cameras in people’s homes and filmed them watching television. The rules of reality TV didn’t exist“At the last minute on the night of the launch we bottled it and left it out of the package. Only to be greeted by a delegation of village folk who arrived at the head end and demanded it be switched on.”Gorton points out how The Television Village was a precursor to today’s deluge of social experiment programming: “We treated it as an investigation. It was pre-reality TV, so the way it was made was like an observational documentary. We put cameras in people’s homes and we’d film people watching television. Gogglebox cast them brilliantly, but we just let people be people. The rules of reality TV didn’t exist.” “We were the original Gogglebox!” Brown adds proudly. This televisual wild west is best encapsulated by Gorton’s memory of watching two hours of one villager wordlessly watching television before falling asleep to the 10 o’clock news.Despite the impact of WVTV, none of the villagers got paid for their involvement – not even the four stars who did shifts every weekday. Hornby speaks of having to juggle her presenting responsibilities with two young children, and her brother Brown still feels let down after everything ended: “The TV people went, it all switched off, and that was it – gone.” Warburton, who now owns the Lower Buck pub, prefers not to discuss the project at all.The major findings of the experiment were that viewers loved sport and film, much to the glee of Sky, who had provided these channels. But more surprisingly, it found people love programming made by the people around them. There was a buzzing sense that the hyper local was the future of entertainment.Thirty-five years later, the experiment has been proven correct. But instead of charming local production studios, hyper local programming today is pumped out by accounts on YouTube, Facebook and TikTok. History has shown WVTV as one of the earliest examples of user-produced content, well before everyone had the ability to record and publish whatever they wanted.“What has come to pass over the 35 years,” Gorton says, “is that anyone can present a television programme. We’ve learned anyone can be good – can be great – at it.”The experiment had launched in March, and by late April the cable was fished from the Waddington stream and the cameras were packed away. Brown and Cowking had aspirations to enter television professionally, but life seemed to have other plans. Today, many of the young people of Waddington have no idea what took place in 1990, when for a few months cameras seemed to outnumber people – when the village was full of chatter about satellites, aerials and invisible waves from space. A number of those involved have since passed away. The only permanent reminder of the experiment is an easily missed wood-cased silver plaque by the war memorial that reads: WADDINGTON The Television Village.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than thinking about how many things you can cram in, perhaps it’s better to ponder how few you really need to do, and focus on doing them really well.View image in fullscreenA to-do list is the best place to start.Photograph: Posed by model; Iuliia Bondar/Getty ImagesWhere do you start? With a list, obviously. To the chronically overstressed, taking the time to handwrite all the stuff you already know you need to do can feel like a waste of time, but it’s always worth the effort. “You can’t prioritise tasks if you feel overwhelmed,” says Graham Allcott, the author of How to Be aProductivityNinja, “but you can be totally overloaded and still not feel overwhelmed. The key to this is getting all the various things you have to work on out of your head so you can start to make sense of them. Get a piece of paper, and write on it all the things you need to make progress on, all the stuff that feels unfinished, everything you care about that isn’t done. It will take you longer than you think, but the very act of getting it all out of your head will help you get clarity, perspective and a sense of control.”Build momentumThe best next step is controversial: some productivity experts suggest doing the hardest task first, while others advocate building momentum by rattling off some easy wins. The best approach is a mix of both: go through your list and clear out anything you can do in under three minutes, from making dentist’s appointments to writing quick notes to friends or family, then ride the dopamine wave into the more challenging stuff.“Most people think they’re tired from overwork,” says Scott Clary, the host of the Success Story podcast. “They’re not – they’re tired from mental clutter. The unanswered text, the apology they’re avoiding, the decision they keep postponing. These run in the background of your mind all day like 20 browser tabs, draining your battery. Close those loops first thing, and the energy comes back immediately. The actual work of closing them is almost always less exhausting than carrying them around.” Research bears this out: in a 2011 paper titledConsider it done!, the psychologists EJ Masicampo and Roy F Baumeister found that, though unfulfilled goals can cause cognitive drain, making plans to tackle them mitigates the effect – as long as you eventually carry them out. So many people have written entire books about planning, most of which boil down to chopping things up: if there’s a big, daunting task you’ve been putting off, split it into smaller and smaller steps until you’re left with one “first thing” you can do immediately.View image in fullscreenEach person has ‘two to three hours a day where they feel most alive’.Photograph: Nitat Termmee/Getty ImagesAt this point, you’re ready to settle in for the working day, but do try to remember that not all of those hours are created equal. “Each of us has a very limited supply of what I call ‘proactive attention’ – the two to three hours a day where we feel most alive and most able to push things forward,” says Allcott. “It varies from person to person, but for most people it’s in the morning once we’ve had coffee and woken up a bit. What we choose to have our attention on during these hours is what defines our productivity.” A key part of this, he says, is about protecting our proactive attention from distractions – “our phones, emails, meetings, other people. Put your phone on silent, get out of the emails and messages, and close down all the other windows on your laptop. Focus!”Stop putting it offThere might be any number of explanations for why you’ve been putting off certain jobs, but often procrastination is a way of coping with negative emotions that come up when you think about these tasks, from boredom and frustration to anxiety, insecurity and self-doubt. The trick here is to fight the natural instinct to berate yourself over procrastination and to not be too hard on yourself: in a2010 paper, researchers found that students who were able to forgive themselves for procrastinating when studying for a first exam ended up procrastinatinglesswhen studying for their next exam. They concluded that self-forgiveness supported productivity by allowing “the individual to move past their maladaptive behaviour and focus on the upcoming examination without the burden of past acts”.One simple way to do this is to mentally rehearse a procrastination situation ahead of time. “Think of a situation that you find yourself in regularly and the behaviour you’re going to do when it arises – which sets up an association before you’ve even started doing it,” says Prof Benjamin Gardner, a specialist in behavioural change at the University of Surrey. “The more specific the better.” You might make what’s sometimes known as an “if-then” plan along the lines of, “If I find myself procrastinating, I’ll gently go back to my work without any self-recriminations.”Obviously, staying off X and Instagram is a good idea for your productivity (and possibly your sanity), but don’t stop there. “Adding usage limits to the apps on your phone or computer is a gamechanger, but don’t just think of them for social media,” says the productivity coach Teresa Richards, who believes in “achieving more by doing less”. “For my business, I have a 20-minute daily limit for emails, which forces me to be intentional about the ones I reply to and stops me from wasting time reading every marketing newsletter that comes my way. It’s the same with the news – there’s a fine line between burying your head in the sand and becoming overwhelmed by the inequalities in the world. Think about spending a little less time reading the news, and using the few minutes you save to do something more positive.” Stuck for inspiration? Search for “micro-volunteering” opportunities that interest you: the Be My Eyes app, for instance, allows you to be on call to provide real-time descriptions and assistance for people with visual impairments, while Macmillan Cancer Support are always looking for volunteers to handwrite thank-you notes.And relaxView image in fullscreenThe ‘Pomodoro’ method – using a tomato-shaped cooking timer – is good for ensuring you take regular breaks.Photograph: Alessandro Zocchi/AlamyHow regular should your breaks be? It really depends on how demanding your work is, and what works for you. Plenty of people follow the popular “Pomodoro” method – using an app, online clock or tomato-shaped cooking timer to work for 25 minutes, take a break for five, and repeat until lunch – and it’s certainly worth a try. Recently, there’s been a bit of a shift towards longer bouts of concentration: the time management expert Nir Eyal reports getting good results from 45-minute sprints, while the Slow Productivity author Cal Newport suggests that you can’t really get things done without settling down for at least 60 minutes. For entry-level productivity optimisers, though, it might be worth taking things the other way: Progressive Pomodoro, a flexible alternative to the traditional version, claims to nudge users into a “flow” state by starting with shorter work blocks and building up to longer ones. To give it a go, start with just five minutes of work: after you’re done, take a (very) short break and decide how long your next “block” should be. Eventually, the theory goes, you’ll be fully immersed in deep work and (hopefully) enjoying at least some of it.View image in fullscreenMovement is a ‘non-negotiable’ way to enhance productivity.Photograph: Posed by model; Pekic/Getty ImagesWhat are you doing in all of these breaks? That’s partly going to depend on whether you’re in the office or working from home, but either way, movement is non-negotiable. There’s a growing body of research showing that active breaks, even if they’re just a bit of a stretch or a stroll to the kettle, can yield measurable benefits for office workers, particularly in terms of wellbeing and health, but also possibly productivity. Onerecent studyconducted on 70 remote administrative workers, for instance, found that workers who were encouraged to take active micro-breaks reported reductions in post-lunch sleepiness, perceived stress and bodily discomfort. An active micro-break could simply entail standing up, moving around a bit, then sitting down again with good posture, or doing something that compensates for working in one position all day. The doorway stretch is a great example: bend one elbow and put your forearm vertically against a doorframe so that your elbow’s just above your shoulder, then move forward until you feel a stretch across your chest and shoulder. Hold for three deep breaths, then repeat on the other side (or, if you’re really time-pressed, do both at once) to counteract some of the forward hunch you’ve been cultivating with hours at the keyboard.Get out for lunchView image in fullscreenWandering past trees can boost positivity during a lunch break.Photograph: Kelly Mitchell/Getty ImagesAt lunchtime, it’s helpful to get out for a walk if you can: and if you can wander past some trees, even better. Spending time in nature, andespecially in wooded areas, seems to improve mood by increasing positive feelings such as happiness and optimism, decreasing rumination and providing a buffer from everyday stress. Don’t be put off if it’s raining – who doesn’t find that wet-earth smell oddly soothing? Our noses are incredibly sensitive togeosmin, the compound responsible for the fragrance, probably because it helped our ancestors find water.What about the afternoon slump? Well, the effect can be worsened by factors such as poor sleep, diet, dehydration and stress. But there’s mounting evidence that it’s an unavoidable feature of human life, thanks to a natural dip in your body’s circadian rhythm, withsome researchersfrom Loughborough University suggesting that it’s less to do with having a carb-heavy lunch than the fact that we’ve evolved to expect a snooze every 12 hours or so. If you can get away with an afternoon nap, great:five to 15 minutesis the sweet spot where you’ll get cognitive benefits for a few hours without needing to overcome any sleep inertia afterwards. If you can’t get away with snoring in the conference room, a short walk and a glug of water are probably the next best thing. And, of course, if you regularly slump in the afternoon, work around that – schedule low-effort tasks such as appointment-making, email replies and invoicing for the post-3pm period when doing anything else feels like wading through treacle.As for the end of the day – try to go out on a high, and set yourself up for success the following morning. “I encourage my clients to schedule three check-in points each week,” says Liz Hardwick, a productivity trainer and speaker. “On Monday I suggest setting three clear goals for the week. On Wednesday it’s time for midweek reflection: what’s working? What needs tweaking? What would make you feel good if you could finish [it] by the end of the week? And if you can face it, your last working day of the week is time for a look back: what made the biggest impact? What should you refocus on next week?” Take 30 seconds to get rid of any obvious clutter from your desk – atleast one studysuggests that office clutter is positively related with risk of work-related burnout– shut down all your tabs, and congratulate yourself on a job well done. Tomorrow’s another day.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingHow to have a better dayTime managementProductivityWork-life balanceWork & careersMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is Christmas in GazaJason Burkein JerusalemTue 30 Dec 2025 14.37 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 18.56 ESTShareIsrael has announced it will stop dozens of aid organisations working in Gaza within 36 hours for failing to meet stringent new requirements to hand over personal details of Palestinian and international staff deployed in the devastated territory.The list of groups hit by the ban include some of the world’s best known humanitarian organisations such as ActionAid, International Rescue Committee and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).Tuesday’s announcement by the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs comesamid fierce stormsthat in recent days have destroyed thousands of tents in Gaza, exacerbating an already acute humanitarian crisis.Foreign ministers of 10 nations expressed “serious concerns” about a “renewed deterioration of the humanitarian situation” in the devastated territory, saying the situation was “catastrophic”.“As winter draws in, civilians inGazaare facing appalling conditions with heavy rainfall and temperatures dropping,” the ministers of Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said in a joint statement released by the UK’s Foreign Office on Tuesday.The statement added that “1.3 million people still require urgent shelter support. More than half of health facilities are only partially functional and face shortages of essential medical equipment and supplies. The total collapse of sanitation infrastructure has left 740,000 people vulnerable to toxic flooding” .The ministers called for the UN and its partners to continue their work in Gaza, and for the lifting of “unreasonable [Israeli] restrictions on imports considered to have a dual use”.Hundreds of items have been blocked by Israel from entering Gaza on the basis that they may be used by Hamas to rebuild tunnels or for military purposes. The items include some vitally needed medical and shelter equipment.The ministers also called for the opening of crossings to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying that corridors for moving goods remained closed or severely restricted for humanitarian aid, including Rafah, the biggest entry point that leads directly to Egypt.“Bureaucratic customs processes and extensive screenings are causing delays, while commercial cargo is being allowed in more freely,” the statement said.“The target of 4,200 trucks per week, including an allocation of 250 UN trucks per day, should be a floor not a ceiling. These targets should be lifted so we can be sure the vital supplies are getting in at the vast scale needed,” it added.Under the 20-point agreement that allowed a fragile ceasefire to come into effect in October, Israel is obliged to allow “full aid” to be “immediately sent into Gaza”.The ceasefire ended two years of relentless conflict, but further progress towards a lasting peace deal has stalled, with Israel saying it will not withdraw from the 53% of Gaza territory that is still under its control until Hamas disarms and returns the remains of the last hostage it is holding. The Islamist militant organisation has so far refused to commit to full disarmament.Speaking on Monday,Donald Trump said that he hoped “reconstruction” could begin soon in the Palestinian territory, reduced to ruins by Israeli offensives in response to Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks, but gave no details.Israeli officials said they had given ample warning to aid organisations about the new registration requirements and that about 15% of nongovernmental organisations working in Gaza had not had their permits renewed.“Humanitarian organisations that fail to meet security and transparency requirements will have their licences suspended,” the ministry said, adding that those that “refused to submit a list of their Palestinian employees in order to rule out any links to terrorism” had received formal notice that their licences would be revoked as of 1 January.NGO officials have previously said that the new requirements clashed with European data protection legislation, and could endanger their staff.In its statement on Tuesday, the Israeli ministry alleged that an investigation had found that MSF employed two individuals with links to Palestinian militant groups: an alleged sniper with Hamas and a member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad.MSF said it “would never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity”.The ministry’s statement did not say whether MSF’s licence had been revoked.“In terms of registration, MSF continues to engage and discuss with Israeli authorities,” the NGO said. “We have not yet received a decision on reregistration.”The allegations against MSF echothose made by Israel against Unrwa, the main UN agency working with Palestinians in the region.A law passed on Monday in Israelwill force electricity and water companies,communications providers and banks to cut Unrwa off from any services. Previous laws stopped the agency from operating in Israel and ended all government contact.The international court of justice, the UN’s highest court, cleared Unrwa of the allegation that it was not impartial.Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli agency responsible for the administration of Gaza and the occupied West Bank, said that the organisations whose operations in Gaza will now be suspended had not supplied the territory with any aid since the ceasefire that came into effect in October, and had only contributed about 1% of the total aid volume previously.“Accordingly, the implementation of the government decision will not result in any future harm to the volume of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip,” it said.Other major organisations whose permits have not been renewed include Care International, and divisions of major charities such as Oxfam and Caritas, according to a list from the ministry. All help provide a variety of social services, including food distribution, healthcare, disability services, education and mental health.The ministry said the groups were given 10 months to provide the requested information but “nonetheless failed to comply with the requirements”.Oxfam’s policy lead in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Bushra Khalidi, told Reuters that its Palestinian staff and partners would continue supporting communities but said forcing aid agencies to rely on obtaining supplies locally – as they will not be permitted to bring in goods from outside – was part of a wider dismantling of the humanitarian aid system.The ministry said that by late November approximately 100 registration requests had been submitted and “only 14 organisation requests have been rejected”.“The remainder have been approved or are currently under review,” it added.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineAidCharitiesForeign policyShareReuse this content"

It is one of only three drugs, alongside magic mushrooms and hallucinogens, to have become used more regularly since 2015.Recent data from the Office for National Statistics shows that ketamine usage, while down slightly from the previous year, is still high. The numbers who say they have used the drug in the past month has increased by 251.85% since 2015, the greatest increase in the use of a single drug in that period.Ketamine use has become more prevalent over the past 10 yearsFew places have felt the effects of that increase more than urology departments. Chronic ketamine use can cause irreversible damage to the bladder and urinary tract, and departments have seen an increase in patients, with many of those treated being young adults and teenagers.Alison Downey, a consultant urologist in South Yorkshire, says ketamine abuse is worse than she has ever seen, with admissions pushing medical centres and hospitals to their limits.“We’re already stretched really thin as it is and it’s been a massive increase that we’re just not equipped for. Although it causes urology problems, ketamine abuse is not a urology issue, its an addiction and we can’t do anything about that”, said Downey, who has worked as a consultant for more than five years.“It’s an awful problem at the moment, and the epicentre seems to be Barnsley,” she said. “In 2021, there were 11 attendances in Barnsley A&E for ketamine-related issues, and that was for the whole year. This year, from January to May, there have been 50, that’s a huge increase for just five months.”Downey believes that ketamine abuse has surged due to a myriad of factors, including how cheap it is. She says most cases they see are also young people who began using the drug as a coping mechanism during Covid lockdowns five years ago.“Most people I see are in their teens or early 20s, so looking at when they started doing ketamine it largely seems to have been during the pandemic,” said Downey, who pointed out that many who take it are still school age.“In under-16 drug centres, we’ve heard stories like kids pooling their pocket money together to buy some ketamine and then they’ll just share it,” she said. “They’ll take little, small amounts into the school toilets and take some then, which is absolutely frightening.”Nadir Osman, a consultant urological surgeon in Sheffield, says that admissions tied to ketamine abuse have “skyrocketed” in the last few years, and that not enough ketamine users understand the effect that consistently taking the drug will have on their bodies.“Ketamine is a unique drug because it seems like there are no side-effects, but its more complicated than that,” said Osman. “It slowly impacts the bladder and the liver, and then the urinary tract. It takes a couple of years to begin to notice these effects, but once you start noticing them they’re pretty irreversible.”Osman also claimed that some users who are on a list for surgery end up not getting the procedure done due to continuing to use the drug as pain relief.Prof Ian Pearce, consultant urological surgeon and andrologist at Manchester Royal Infirmary, believes that more needs to be done to warn people, especially those who are still of school age, about the dangers of becoming involved with ketamine while providing help with those already experiencing the effects of abusing the drug.“One of the main issues with ketamine is that the relapse rate post-rehabilitation is massive, so ongoing support is vital,” said Pearce, who suggested that the government should implement a “targeted educational drive aimed at secondary schools to really get across the message that this is a highly negatively impactful substance with a huge potential for lifelong sequelae”.Explore more on these topicsDrugsHealthHospitalsEnglandNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Soldiers were seen disguising combat vehicles with green netting and raising a flag at an airbase in easternBelarus, close to the Russian border.The video appeared part of a choreographed attempt to intimidateEuropeand to prepare Russians for a further escalation in the already brutal war against Ukraine. The deployment, if true, would symbolically reduce the time it would take for a Russian missile to hit an EU capital.Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, said 10 Oreshnik systems would be stationed in his country. Putin announced they were entering active service at a meeting on Monday with his generals, where he reaffirmed his intention to capture more Ukrainian territory, including the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.Earlier Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned that “reprisals” would be carried out against Kyiv and that targets were already prepared. They followed what he said wasan attack on Sunday nightinvolving 91 Ukrainian drones on the Russia’s president’s palace in the Novgorod region.The Kremlin has not produced evidence to back up its allegations. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, said on Tuesday that no proof would be offered since all the missiles had been shot down. He said he could not comment on the lack of debris.People living in the area said they did not hear explosions or the sound of anti-aircraft fire, according to the independent Russian media outlet Sota. No air raid alert was issued, nor weremobile phone clips showing smoke and flames shared online, a typical feature of confirmed hits.On Tuesday Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia had made up the story, and urged other countries to ignore it. “Almost a day passed, and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened,” heposted on X.He did not criticise Donald Trump, who on Mondayangrily endorsed Russia’s accountand said Putin had told him about the attack in a phone call. “It’s one thing to be offensive, because they’re offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that,” the US president said.Sybiha expressed irritation with India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, after they said they were concerned by the reports. “Such reactions to Russia’s baseless manipulative claims only play into Russian propaganda and encourage Moscow for more atrocities and lies,” he remarked.Ukrainians commanders said Russian kamikaze drones regularly flew over a government palace used by Zelenskyy on their way to the capital. One officer, the head of territorial defence unit 112, said his team shot down two drones on Saturday above the state residence in Koncha-Zaspa, south of Kyiv.“Whenever there are large-scale attacks, they fly in our area. There are always shaheeds. Quite often we shoot them down in this place,” the soldier told the Guardian. He shared a video showing an enemy drone flying low across a white winter sky.The Ukrainians are keen to keep the focus on continuing diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, followingZelenskyy’s two-hour meeting with Trump on Sunday in Florida. The two leaders discussed a 20-point peace plan under which the US would offer Kyiv post-war security guarantees voted on by Congress.There was no progress on the future of the eastern Donbas region, which Putin says must be handed over to Russia. Zelenskyy has ruled out giving Russia land. He has proposed a demilitarised zone, which could be confirmed in a referendum if Russia agrees to a ceasefire of at least 60 days.Zelenskyy said the Russians were spreading “fake news” because of his “fairly successful conversation and meeting” with Trump over the weekend, and the progress made in recent weeks by the US and Ukrainian delegations. Russia was making accusations because it didn’t want “any positive outcome for anyone in this format”, he added.Ukraine’s president is due to meet with European allies on 6 January in France, at a conference hosted by Emmanuel Macron. Leaders will discuss Europe’s contribution to a peacekeeping operation. There is likely to be a subsequent meeting between European heads of state with Trump and his White House team in Washington.Commentators said US security pledges were meaningless if Trump was willing to accept everything the Russian president told him. “If the potential ceasefire monitoring will be done by the same people who now believe what Russia is saying – we are in big trouble,” Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaBelarusUkraineEuropeNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

A core concern among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.“People demanding that AIs have rights would be a huge mistake,” said Bengio. “Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down.“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow, we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”As AIs become more advanced in their ability to act autonomously and perform “reasoning” tasks, a debate has grown over whether humans should, at some point, grant them rights. A poll by the Sentience Institute, a US thinktank thatsupports the moral rightsof all sentient beings, found that nearly four in 10 US adultsbacked legal rightsfor a sentient AI system.Anthropic, a leading US AI firm, said in August that it was letting its Claude Opus 4 model close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, saying it needed to protect the AI’s “welfare”. Elon Musk, whose xAI company has developed the Grok chatbot, wrote on his X platform that “torturing AI is not OK”.Robert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness, has said “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.Bengio told the Guardian there were “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could, in theory, replicate – but humans interacting with chatbots wasa “different thing”. He said this was because people tended to assume – without evidence – that an AI was fully conscious in the same way a human is.“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” he added. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.“There will be people who will always say: ‘Whatever you tell me, I am sure it is conscious’ and then others will say the opposite. This is because consciousness is something we have a gut feeling for. The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions.“Imagine some alien species cameto the planet and at some point we realise that they have nefarious intentions for us. Do wegrant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”Responding to Bengio’s comments, Jacy Reese Anthis, who co-founded the Sentience Institute, said humans would not be able to coexist safely with digital minds if the relationship was one of control and coercion.Anthis added: “We could over-attribute or under-attribute rights to AI, and our goal should be to do so with careful consideration of the welfare of all sentient beings. Neither blanket rights for all AI nor complete denial of rights to any AI will be a healthy approach.”Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, earned the “godfather of AI” nickname after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton,who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaComputer science and ITComputingInternet safetyInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

StaceyPolicy editorMoment of maximum danger will come in May’s local and regional elections and PM is already plotting his comebackTue 30 Dec 2025 09.49 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 18.31 ESTShareKeir Starmer will begin his second full year in Downing Street as one of theleast popular everprime ministers – a spectacularly rapid reversal from his landslide election win of just 18 months ago.Yet Starmer believes this will be the year things start to improve for his beleaguered premiership and fractiousLabourparty.His chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, recentlytold special advisersgathered in Downing Street that 2026 would be “the year of proof” when Labour begins to show voters that the change they voted for in 2024 is being delivered.Starmer will start the year with a speech on the cost of living, flagging recent interest rate cuts and the abolition of levies from energy bills as signs that life is becoming more affordable.But he faces a number of potential pitfalls in the year ahead that could end up defining his premiership.1.Changes to SendBridget Phillipson has beendrawing up plansfor several months to change the way children with extra needs are treated in the school system, and she is due to publish them in the form of a white paper in the new year.The education secretary is under pressure to come up with a cheaper and more efficient way to run the system, given the financial pressures caused by the recent rise in the number of children with conditions such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Parents’ groups are concerned that Phillipson could do away with the system of education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which grant children the legal right to additional support and are often cumbersome to secure and costly to manage.Labour backbenchers say privately they are willing to rebel on the issue if the changes look as if they are aimed at saving money rather than improving the way the system is run.A repeat of last year’swelfare rebellion, which led to the government backing down over proposed cuts to disability benefits, would be another major political blow for Starmer.2.Local and regional electionsThe moment of maximum danger for the prime minister will come in May when voters in Scotland and Wales will elect their devolved administrations and local elections will be held in parts of England including London.Labour and the Conservatives are each expected to take heavy losses in those elections, with Labour officials worried their party could finish third in Wales and in Scotland.Such a result, coupled with losses in London councils, could be enough to trigger a leadership contest against Starmer – though the lack of an obvious single challenger could yet save his job.Before that, Starmer and his advisers are planning a new year offensive against Reform UK and its leader, Nigel Farage, in which they will label the populist party as “far right” and warn about the consequences of electing it to the national government.3.King’s speechStarmer is already plotting his post-local election comeback, including a plan to prorogue parliament and return for a new session with a new king’s speech.Thatpackage of legislationis likely to include Phillipson’s Send measures, a new immigration bill, changes to the House of Lords and long-awaited changes to the leasehold system, including an end to new flats being sold as leasehold.The prime minister is hoping the new bills will help breathe fresh life into his government and give MPs a clear sense of direction for the following 12 months.4.Managing Donald TrumpArguably the greatest success of Starmer’s premiership so far has been his deft handling of foreign affairs, particularly the combustible US president.Next year promises to be a crunch one in US-UK relations as Starmer attempts to finalise negotiations over trade agreements while also making sure Ukraine is not left stranded by attempts in Washington and Moscow to stitch together a peace deal.Starmer wants to agree a technology deal with the US that would enable closer collaboration on AI and quantum computing, buttalks have been hitby last-minute objections from US officials over unrelated trade complaints, including British food safety standards.Helping the prime minister during this sensitive year will be theincoming ambassadorto Washington, Christian Turner, a career diplomat who brings with him experience from the Middle East, north Africa and Pakistan.5.Single-sex spaces guidanceMinisters have still not approved official guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission on access to single-sex public spaces and are nowlikely to do soin 2026.The guidance is required because of a supreme court ruling in April saying the legal definition of a woman should be based on biological sex, and it is expected to reflectinterim advicethat transgender people should not be allowed to use toilets reserved for the gender they live as.The government’s decision on approving the ECHR’s recommendations is likely to prove a flashpoint, given that trans rights campaigners andsome inside the commissioncriticised the interim advice as overly literal.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourEducation policyLocal electionskey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

None of them ended well for VenezuelaTue 30 Dec 2025 14.34 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 14.35 ESTShareNearly a week afterDonald Trumpfirst announced what he said wasthe first US ground strikein a four-month-long military pressure campaign againstVenezuela, details remain very thin on the ground.CNN and the New York Times reported late on Monday that they had confirmed the CIA had used a drone to target a “port facility” allegedly used by the Tren de Aragua street gang. No casualties were reported, but the date, time and location of the attack remain unknown. Venezuela’s strongman leader,Nicolás Maduro, and his government have remained silent.If confirmed, the first strike on land would mark a new phase in a campaign that since August has involved the deployment of a massive US naval fleet, airstrikes that have so far killed 107 people, a “total blockade” of sanctioned oil tankers, the seizure of two vessels and the pursuit of a third.Independent organisations, activists and analysts inVenezuelahave so far been unable to find any details of an attack.US struck ‘big facility’ in Venezuela, Trump claimed without offering detailsRead moreWhether or not the strike even took place, analysts agree that Trump’s announcement itself marks his latest move in a shadow war aimed at removing Maduro from power.“Obviously, the US doesn’t want to call it a war because that would trigger congressional oversight … but it is a war, as people are dying – and they’re dying in a very explicit and loud way with these airstrikes on boats,” said Alejandro Velasco, a historian of modern Venezuela and a professor at New York University.He added that Maduro is also waging his own war to stay in power: “That’s the only thing he and the people around him are concerned about. For them, the war is about how to survive one more day.”Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, said the US is already running a psyops campaign against Venezuela: “It’s not a war that involves massive amounts of weapons yet, because I think neither side has the stomach to do that … So it’s more of a war of moving of pieces and hoping one side folds.”It is that logic, he said, that has driven all of Trump’s moves so far, from the military buildup to the attacks on boats and the seizure of oil tankers.“Trump’s entire plan hinges on the idea that someone in Maduro’s inner circle will defect and say, ‘Maduro, you’ll leave and we’re forming a new government.’ With every step, the US doubled down on that strategy, even though it didn’t work,” he added.The alleged first strike on land would be just Trump’s latest attempt in that strategy, said Sabatini.Andrés Antillano, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, said it was “unlikely” that the strike, if it occurred at all, destroyed any significant drug infrastructure.He is among several experts on Venezuelan drug trafficking who noted that, despite initial US claims that the military pressure is part of a so-called “war on drugs”, the country plays a relatively minor role in global cocaine trafficking – and is certainly not responsible for the most significant volumes reaching the US.“There is an exaggeration of the Tren de Aragua, which is in fact very weakened and fragmented … If the attack really happened, it may have hit a small fishing village from which speedboats carrying cocaine depart,” said Antillano.Antillano noted that it could have occurred in an “isolated place, which is why nothing is known”, adding that the Maduro regime also may not want to acknowledge the attack. Venezuela took weeks to comment on the deadly airstrikes in theCaribbean, initially claiming the images were fake.“In any case, even if everything Trump has said is true, it still seems to me an attack with minimal impact, despite its media coverage. That was more or less what happened with the airstrikes on boats: they led to the deaths of fishers, possibly some linked to drug trafficking, but they had no impact on drug trafficking itself nor did they shake the foundations of the Maduro government,” he added.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaUS militaryDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroDrugsUS foreign policyCaribbeananalysisShareReuse this content"

However, the pre-Covid age of rock-bottom borrowing costs is a distant memory, global growth is slowing and conditions remain fragile.Here are five key charts underpinning the economic outlook for 2026.AI-driven economic growth?After years of hype, the catalytic potential ofartificial intelligencewill feature heavily for the global economy in 2026. Could companies ploughing vast sums into datacentres, IT and automation kickstart productivity growth? Or could enthusiasm wane amid investor fears of abubble in the US stock marketfuelled by stratospheric valuations for AI companies?Polling by Deutsche Bank of its institutional clients revealed that a tech bubble bursting topped the ranking of the 15 largest risks for the year ahead, with 57% of respondents placing it among their three biggest risks.Chart showing global GDP growth is forecast to slow in 2026Jim Reid, the bank’s global head of macro research, said: “We’ve never seen a single risk score so far ahead of the rest entering a new year, making it very clearly the dominant concern for 2026.”Despite a potential AI tailwind, global GDP growth isforecast to moderatein 2026 amid the hit to international trade from Trump’s tariff policies. Consumer demand – squeezed by years of elevated inflation and borrowing costs – remains under pressure.Growth in China is expected to slow as Beijing faces rising challenges in stoking activity. The US is forecast to lead the G7 growth league table, followed by Canada and Britain.Cooling inflationbut risks remainHouseholds have faced a severe cost-of-living squeeze frominflationsticking at elevated levels, but the hopes are for a marked slowdown in the rate of consumer price growth in 2026.Economists are predicting a “normalisation” of inflation across rich countries, paving the way for central banks to end their cycle of interest rate cuts – in effect lifting a restriction on the economy from higher borrowing costs.In the US, the term of the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, ends in May. The focus will be on whether Powell’s replacement will oversee deeper rate cuts amid political pressure from Trump. Fears over interference from Washington are also expected to weigh on financial markets.Graph showing central bank interest rates are forecast to stabiliseBritain risks standing out as a disinflation laggard. In the autumn, theInternational Monetary Fundforecast the UK would suffer the highest inflation in the G7. However, that was before Rachel Reeves’s budget, which theBank of Englandexpects could sink the headline rate close to its 2% target by the summer.For theEuropean Central Bank, inflation across the single-currency bloc already hovering near its 2% target is expected to deter it from taking action in 2026.Still, economists remain wary that inflation across rich countries could be in danger of rekindling – limiting the scope for rates to be cut much further.Jack Meaning, the UK chief economist at Barclays, said: “We’ve been through a period of repeated shocks, and we’re coming into a period where there’s always a chance of new shocks hitting the system.“But, failing that, the conversation is more plus or minus a small adjustment to target, rather than these big swings we’ve had recently. So it’s more familiar to life for people who remember things before the big inflation. And that’s a bit more normal.”Navigating elevated trade tensionsAfter the initial shock of Trump’s “liberation day” announcement last April, international trade tensions have subsided.But, while the worst-case scenarios have not immediately materialised, US tariff rates are significantly higher than before Trump’s return to the White House, and trade policy uncertainty remains elevated.Graph showing spike in trade uncertainty amid Donald Trump’s tariff warEconomists reckon simmering geopolitical tensions more broadly will probably lead to further trade fragmentation, forcing companies to accelerate their supply chain diversification andnear-shoring efforts.“Geopolitically, the world remains a boiling pot of uncertainty,” said Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro at ING bank. “We’re still to get the US supreme court’s tariff rulings, and the trade tensions between the US and China, and increasingly between Europe and Beijing, appear to be baked into a new normal.”Longer term, the tariff hit will probably reduce trade volumes, raise supply-chain costs and dampen economic growth worldwide.Keeping bond vigilantes in checkGovernments across advanced economies came under pressure from rising borrowing costs in 2025, particularly for countries with already high levels of debt and weak growth outlooks.Bond vigilantes had the US, Britain and France in their crosshairs in particular. Donald Trump’sOne Big Beautiful Bill Actrattled markets, while speculation over the UK’s budget fuelled a sell-off in its bond markets, and France’s were plunged into crisis as Emmanuel Macron’s government battled to pass a budget.Graph showing government borrowing and debt interest costsForecasters warn that fiscal vulnerabilities remain in the year ahead, despite hopes that a steadier inflation outlook and thawing trade tensions could provide a more supportive backdrop. Highly indebted governments facing pressure to boost growth and raise defence spending will come under the microscope.In the UK, there are hopes that Reeves’s decision to leave more headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rule at the autumn budget could ease therisk of a bond market backlash. But attention is shifting to a tough round of May local elections and whether Keir Starmer could survive a leadership challenge.The rise of unemploymentAgainst a volatile economic backdrop, hiring demand tumbled across rich countries in 2025. Unemployment rates in the US and the UK rose sharply, and economists warn that a further rise in joblessness stands as a big risk for 2026.The impact of tax policies, business uncertainty and AI adoption are expected to weigh on employment. So far there are limited signs of widespread AI-fuelled job displacement. But investment is accelerating, andyouth unemployment rates in Britainin particular are causing political alarm. Meanwhile, participation in the workforce remains under pressure owing to demographic shifts such as population ageing and rising ill-health.Graph showing rising UK and US unemployment rates after post-Covid recoveryIn the UK, the unemployment rate has already reached 5.1%, thehighest level outside the Covid pandemic in almost a decade, and could rise further in 2026. In the US, the rate has hit4.6%, a four-year high, amid concerns over the strength of the world’s largest economy.Despite the pressures in the jobs market on both sides of the Atlantic, wage growth is expected to remain resilient, helping workers to rebuild a financial buffer but spooking central bankers worried about inflation risks.Hannah Slaughter, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain is likely to usher in 2026 with rising unemployment and the risk that pay packets could start shrinking again. Policymakers need to react to these trends.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyArtificial intelligence (AI)InflationEconomicsInternational tradeGiltsTrump tariffsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Here is how to introduce the small, helpful habits that suit youSign up here to get the whole series straight to your inboxAnita ChaudhuriTue 30 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTShareMy quest for the ideal lunch break is definitely a triumph of hope over experience. From inventing endless super-soups that might banish the mid-afternoon snack attack, to wildly optimistic lunchtime to-do lists, I have tried and failed countless times. The executive coachZoe Thomsonis not surprised. “One of the biggest things for people is they overestimate how much time and energy they are going to have in their lunch hour,” says Thomson, who previously had a 20-year career with the Avon and Somerset police. “And they underestimate how much time and energy they might need to achieve it.”I tell her that this has been the flaw with most of my doomed lunchtime masterplans. “The problem is, unpredictable things happen. Say you plan to do a 45-minute spin class in a 60-minute lunch break, but your last call overruns by 10 minutes. Your plan is no longer feasible. If you decided instead to do a 10-minute walk around the block every day, and then have a nice cup of tea after your sandwich, you’re winning. Even if something urgent comes up, the 10-minute walk is still possible. And on a really good day you could walk four times around the block.”I confess that I find this idea a bit uninspiring. How am I going to transform my lung capacity by ambling to the end of the road? “Actually, when you look at the most successful people, they do the boring, small, incremental changes daily and stick with it,” says Thomson.View image in fullscreenTry to fit in a 10-minute walk every day.Photograph: Posed by models; JohnnyGreig/Getty ImagesBut even if you’re ensconced in a healthy routine, there can still be space to mix it up. “As humans, we like certainty, but we crave variety,” she says. And after a morning of work, she points out, many of us struggle with decision fatigue. “So if we aim for 80% routine and 20% variety, that’s probably about right. Having to make a fresh decision about what to do for lunch every day creates stress,” says Thomson. Having occasional lunch breaks with a shared activity can be great – a book group works well, as does an uplifting choir session such as those organised byMusic in Offices.Selina Barkeris a coach and creator ofTime to Thrive, a journal that focuses on energy management rather than time. “However long your lunch break lasts, even if it’s only 10 minutes, the key point is that it’s there to top your energy back up. The prescription for how you do this will vary depending on the type of work you do. So if you’ve been in meetings all morning with people talking at you, maybe what you need is a quiet walk in the park – especially for introverts working in an open-plan office. But if you’ve been on your feet for hours, maybe the best thing would be a yoga or meditation class.”If you work in an office, it can sometimes feel a bit awkward to step away from the canteen crowd and go off on your own. Barker says we shouldn’t feel embarrassed about prioritising what we actually need. “Don’t make a big thing of it. Just say I’m off to recharge my batteries.”When it comes to the main event – the food – choosing what to eat can be tricky. Ideally, we want something that is enticing, yet still healthy and will sustain our energy until home time.View image in fullscreenAdd wholegrains to ensure your salad is filling enough.Photograph: d3sign/Getty Images“The lunches that work against you are usually the highly refined ones,” says the nutritionistRosemary Martin. “A pastry or white-bread sandwich with crisps or a chocolate bar on the side gives you a quick boost followed by a predictable drop in energy and concentration.” But not all lunches labelled healthy are good either. “The tiny low-carb salad may feel virtuous at midday but leaves you tired, distracted and craving sugar a couple of hours later.”Martin suggests that if you want steady energy and clear focus after lunch, the magic ingredient is balance. “Go for meals that combine whole grains, plant protein, healthy fats and colourful vegetables that will digest at a comfortable pace and give your brain what it needs to stay focused into the afternoon. Lentil soup with wholegrain bread, a tofu, rice and veg bowl or a hummus wrap with plenty of crunchy salad are simple but nourishing options which will reliably carry you through the rest of your day.”For those who work at home, all of this becomes a lot easier. You can exercise at home and prepare lunch far from the horrors of the office microwave. But experts point out that there are still important issues to be mindful of. A common strategy is skipping the lunch break altogether in order to finish early. “I do often question it when people tell me they’re saving that hour for the end of the day. I think that takes away from what the lunch break is actually for,” says Thomson.However, she agrees that for some people, taking an entire hour might not make sense. “You could split the hour into three 20-minute breaks spread across the afternoon or two half-hour ones,” she says, but the principles remain the same. Are you stepping away from your desk? “Are you taking time to get up and move (or sit down and rest if you’re on your feet all day?) Are you giving yourself some downtime? If you don’t create that space to slow down the brain, it will wake you up at three or four in the morning.” It’s much better, she says, “to give yourself headspace by design.”Explore more on these topicsNutritionHow to have a better dayFoodHealth & wellbeingWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But today the Unesco site faces a new threat: mass tourismSupported byAbout this contentIsabel Woodford in Mexico CityTue 30 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 15.29 ESTShareOn a clear day over the Sea of Cortez, Espíritu Santo looks untouchable. Turquoise water laps at the shores of the island’s rocky coves; whale sharks cruise past snorkellers; seabirds caw over ancient cliffs. The pristine island and itsUnesco-protected surroundings– informally called “Mexico’s Galápagos” – are a cocoon of biodiversity.Yet an increase in tourist numbers has led to growing unease among the island’s longstanding stewards, as environmentalists report a decline in the area’s marine life and call for stricter regulations.Espíritu Santo is no stranger to conflict. In the 1990s, the island, roughly the size of Manhattan, was a potential goldmine. Developers were reported to have plans for a casino. The fight to save it, led by grassroots activists and a local billionaire, was an early example of private conservation. Three decades on, those involved warn of its fragile legacy.View image in fullscreenThe black-tailed jackrabbit is endemic to the island.Photograph: Bill Gorum/AlamyThe allure of Espíritu Santo for developers in the 90s was obvious, with its secluded, uninhabited beaches and privileged location near the Baja California peninsula.Although nature zones had some protections, the island had an unusual legal structure that made it particularly vulnerable. It wasejidoland – a type ofcommunal agricultural propertywith roots in the1910-17 Mexican revolution. It was controlled by a group of about 30 landowners (ejidatarios), each of whom owned a small plot.That created a legal grey zone around construction, says Exequiel Ezcurra, former president of theMexican Institute of Ecology. “Even a threat in Mexico can be very, very real,” he says, pointing to the country’s historically lax approach to conservation.“We believed that if Espíritu Santo fell, others would fall too,” he says, adding that this posed a wider threat, given the “immensely important role in global ecology and conservation” that islands play.It was an American conservationist who sounded the alarm. Tim Means, who had spent decades ferrying ecotourists across the Sea of Cortez, learned of developers’ ambitions and began asking some of Mexico’s most influential philanthropists for support.We believed that if Espíritu Santo fell, others would fall tooExequiel Ezcurra, ecologistAmong them was the billionaire Manuel Arango. At the time, he was one of Mexico’s most prominent businessmen, overseeingGrupo Cifra, a retail company that introduced Walmart to the country; he was also an ardent environmentalist.Fears mounted when one of the communal landowners built a series of illegal, rudimentary bungalows at the turn of the millennium. “We said, ‘what a travesty. This is going to continue,’” remembers Arango.The group devised a plan to buy the island directly from the landowners and transfer it to the Mexican government. It was a novel concept called “an agreed expropriation”, says Ezcurra.View image in fullscreenIn 2005, Unesco designated Espíritu Santo a world heritage site.Photograph: Leon Werdinger/Alamy“I never imagined we could buy an island,” Arango says. “But if theejidatariosremained as the owners … it would have been a disaster.”Negotiations with the landowners took several years before a majority agreed to sell the island’s 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres) for an estimated $3m (£2.27m).Arango started a unique fundraising campaign. About a third of the funds came from local people, contributing as little as 100 pesos (£4.15) each. Arango donated about half a million dollars and philanthropic foundations covered the remainder.“We wanted it to come from many people. We wanted the island to feel like theirs,” he says, insisting it felt like a local effort among the people of La Paz, who saw the island as their responsibility.View image in fullscreenManuel Arango, pictured in 2014, whose money and connections were key to protecting the islands.Photograph: Ernesto Agudo/AlamyEnrique Hambleton, an environmental educator and author from La Paz who joined the campaign, says it was a historic event for Mexico. “It was the first time that conservation of a place was agreed with the participation of government, stakeholders, sailors, fishermen – everyone.”Once the island had been bought, the coalition sought to ensure that the government assumed stewardship and implemented robust legal protections. Arango used his political connections to mobilise key figures around the then-president, Vicente Fox. In January 2003, Isla Espíritu Santo was declaredfederal land, which prohibited development.“If we’d known all that [this battle] would take, we might not have started it,” Arango says, adding that Means, who died in 2019, deserves the main credit. “Means was the real motor behind everything.”Further protections followed. In 2005, Unesco designated 244 islands, islets and coastal areas in the Gulf of California, including Espíritu Santo, aworld heritage site. Then, in 2007, Mexico named the Espíritu Santo archipelago asa national park. The Sea of Cortez, often called the “aquarium of the world”, is recognised asone of the most biologically diversemarine areas in the world.Residents say the fight inspired other communities in Baja California Sur to band together to oppose mega-developments years later, including theCabo Cortesproject, theEl Mogotesandbank plans, and developers’ plans for acruise ship facilityoff La Paz.The campaign also served as an early model forprivate conservation, which is on the rise in Mexico today. Between 2012 and 2023, the number of privately protected hectares in the countryincreased by 44%, according to the local body of the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (Conanp).A similar trend is also emerging globally. In the 1990s, privately protected areas (PPAs) worldwide were still on the fringes of conservation; today, tens ofmillions of hectaresare voluntarily protected by private owners, according to estimates by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).The legal locks we put in place are fragile. What really protects the island in future is the people who defend itManuel Arango, philanthropistYet, concerns about the future of conservation in the Mexican Gulf remain. Among the crucial issues facing Espíritu Santo is how the Conanp authorities should handle the surge in tourists and the many licensed businesses that serve them.In recent years, authorities have been withdrawing permits that once allowed tour agencies to operate permanent camps on the island, where visitors could stay overnight. They argued that these were damaging important habitats and polluting the dunes, according to Irma González López, the national park’s director between 2014 and August 2025.Mike Lever, owner of Baja Expeditions, believes stricter restrictions are necessary. “This beautiful island is now under threat by mass tourism,” he says.“Beautiful beaches and the quiet of this desert island … has seen the arrival of day boats carrying bus loads of tourists from Cabo, loud music, heavy drinking, crowded beaches, garbage and influencer opportunities.”The marine life around Espíritu Santo is already under enough pressure, says Octavio Aburto, a professor at San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.“Over the 30 years that I’ve been [visiting], I’ve seen it degrade more and more. They forgot about the marine life,” he says, arguing that protection of the island’s terrestrial environment has taken priority.View image in fullscreenA cormorant feeds on sardines in the waters off Espíritu Santo.Photograph: Franco Banfi/Biosphoto/AlamyScientific studiesindicate that human activities and the climate crisis are contributing to thedecline of endangered speciesthroughout the Baja California region. Other threats include overfishing, illegal fishing, rapid population growth,mining projectsand the slow implementation of environmental policies, according to the reports.Conanp’s Dilia Rebeca Meza says she is considering tighter visitor controls, and recently introduced stricter monitoring on the island – which some locals dislike.“You can’t fix this overnight. It will take years,” she says, noting that the island is the area’s “crown jewel” and an environmental priority. “The mission is to preserve it in the long term, not just for this generation, but also for future generations.”‘We get nothing’: residents fight back as Mexico builds big for 2026 World CupRead moreFor long-term residents such as Hambleton, it is local activists who will protect Espíritu Santo. He says the local community has regular meetings to discuss how to defend the island. “People complain, and that forces the authorities to act.”Conservation, he stresses, has to come before profit.Arango, who has carefully documented the island’s legal protections, hopes that future generations will defend it if they are ever challenged. He is all too aware of the economic and political pressures.“The legal locks we put in place are fragile,” says Arango, now in his 80s. “What really protects the island in future is the people who defend it. We need the community to be the guardians.”Explore more on these topicsEndangered habitatsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanEndangered speciesMexicoConservationAmericasWildlifeAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The show was plagued with woeful writing, cringe-inducing character development (justice for Miranda!) and just 71 seconds of fan-favourite Samantha. But for a moment there, as the third series started, it looked likeAnd Just Like Thathad finally hit its stride. Then came an episode all about Seema’s natural deodorant. No wonder creator Michael Patrick King announced that this would be the final series. It ended on a bum note; the closeup of Miranda’s toilet flooded with poo was just way too symbolic. Still, there’s no denying that fans have had a hoot dissecting every single “wtf?” episode. And as Carrie – a single woman once more – danced around her palatial townhouse to Barry White’s You’re The First, The Last, My Everything, who didn’t let out a little sob?All’s FairView image in fullscreen‘Can Kim Kardashian act? Of course she can’t’ … Kardashian with Naomi Watts in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyCan Kim Kardashian act? Of course she can’t. But that was almost the least of All’s Fair’s problems. The recipient of a very rarezero star reviewin the Guardian (and, it must be said, richly deserving the absence of every one of those stars), it was hard to know where to start with listing the problems with this Ryan Murphy clunker. The hilariously leaden writing? The tedious veneration of wealth and consumption? The almost wilful parade of cliches? Performances so bad they felt almost spiteful?Let’s just say “all of the above” and never speak of this show again. Except a second season has been commissioned so we’re probably going to have to.AKA Charlie SheenView image in fullscreenWay too indulgent … AKA Charlie Sheen.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixGiven the restraining orders, the domestic violence allegations and the parental failures, it’s fair to say that Charlie Sheen has been a bad boy. Not that you’d really have known it from this three-part documentary which chuckled along at Sheen’s various bouts of self-destructive hedonism while struggling to tell us anything we didn’t already know about the Hollywood hell-raiser. Instead, it felt as if this loose cannon was being indulged, so any sympathy this series might induce should be reserved for the people who have had to endure close contact with this charming but flippant egotist.The Iris AffairOf course we knew it was preposterous from the get-go: a drama about a supercomputer known as Charlie Big Potatoes that could either save the world – or destroy all of humanity. We stuck with it out of sheer love for Niamh Algar and Tom Hollander … but by the end, it felt like even they had stopped bothering. Hollander barely cared when he died, and Algar ended up slicing Charlie with an axe … in super slow-motion. Talk about giving up the ghost.MobLandView image in fullscreenBafflingly bad accents … Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan in Mobland.Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/APShady characters meeting in deserted boxing gyms? The Prodigy’s Firestarter jackhammering away in club scenes? The late 90s called and wants its gangland drama back. Actually, that is unfair on the gangland dramas of the late 90s. Many of them look a little dated now, but at least they didn’t suffer the ignominy of having to indulge Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren’s baffling Irish accents. But there were many other problems with MobLand. Mainly that it was just really dull; a dispute over drug-selling territory between various cockney picaresques which Nick Love would probably dismiss as a bit basic.With Love, MeghanView image in fullscreenA deliberate provocation? … With Love, Meghan.Photograph: Jake Rosenberg/NetflixGiven the extent to which she grinds the gears of the nation’s performatively enraged, right-wing culture warriors, it’s almost tempting to admire the Duchess of Sussex’s various televised ventures into twee homemaking as deliberate provocations. But then you watch them and are forced to admit that actually, in this one instance, they might have a point. It’s like watching the Liberty catalogue come to life before your horrified eyes; a wine o’clock poster with delusions of grandeur; a parade of snoozing dogs, humming beehives, Hallmark platitudes and pointless crafting “hacks” you’ll forget instantly. All underpinned by vast, largely unearned wealth. Ugh.Victoria BeckhamView image in fullscreenA cagey non-event … Victoria Beckham.Photograph: NetflixThere are clearly interesting things to be said about both Victoria Beckham and her struggles with vocation, self-image, self-acceptance. But for whatever reason, this three-part series chose not to say them. Instead, the experience was akin to consuming a sales catalogue. Victoria clearly has good reason to bridle at what she describes as her “miserable cow” image. But sadly, she didn’t do herself any favours with this cagey non-event of a series.The InheritanceView image in fullscreenWay too try-hard … Elizabeth Hurley as The Deceased and Rob Rinder as The Executor in The Inheritance.Photograph: Channel 4It should have been the next Traitors – except even camper, with Liz Hurley playing dead and executor Robert Rinder overseeing her inheritance. What more could you ask for? As 13 normies battled it out, there was plenty of backstabbing and squabbling. But the rules quickly became bewildering: it’s still too confusing to explain what exactly was happening in the weekly division ceremonies. Even more disappointingly, we only saw glimpses of Hurley via videos recorded for the contestants. The Inheritance ended up reeking of a show that was trying way too hard to live up to something way beyond it.Too MuchView image in fullscreenIcky … Megan Stalter as Jessica in Too Much.Photograph: PAHow do you follow a show that defined a generation as much as Girls did? The pressure on Lena Dunham was immense when she released this starry romcom about Jessica, a rosy-eyed New Yorker who lands in London with a broken heart. Meg Stalter took her biggest role to date by the horns and was joyous to watch as she revelled in Austen levels of romantic ideals, all while falling for indie guy Felix (Will Sharpe). But it was all very glossy and, ironically, was not enough. Plus, the amount of celebrity friends involved felt icky.Mitchell & Webb Are Not HelpingView image in fullscreenNot even good enough to be ‘patchy’ … Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping.Photograph: Channel 4David Mitchell and Robert Webb’s previous sketch series, the largely excellent That Mitchell and Webb Look, had a skit pondering the innate patchiness of the sketch show. We only wish that this return to the format rose to the status of “patchy”. Given the shrewd recruitment of talented younger comics Stevie Martin, Krystal Evans, Kiell Smith-Bynoe and Lara Ricote, expectations were high. But sadly, most of it didn’t land. Sweary Aussie Drama was a single joke milked to a husk but repeated in every episode. Mitchell seemed too willing to slip into Would I Lie to You? auto-rant mode. The writing room sketches, meanwhile, simply provoked the thought that they should probably have stayed in there a while longer.The Twisted Tale of Amanda KnoxView image in fullscreenA total mess … The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox.Photograph: Andrea Miconi/DisneyThis dramatisation of the story of Amanda Knox was executive produced by Amanda Knox and pretty much exclusively showcased the perspective of Amanda Knox. So, while there probably is an interesting drama to be made about the 2007 murder in Perugia of British student Meredith Kercher, this isn’t it. Of course, the story of Knox’s wrongful conviction and eventual exoneration is interesting in itself but the material needed to be handled sensitively. Instead, the series struggled painfully to find the right tone, lurching awkwardly from oddly jaunty, slightly mannered farce to inevitably, real-life horror. Twisted? Arguably. A total mess? Very much so.Prime TargetView image in fullscreenMore farcical by the second … Leo Woodall as Edward Brooks with Quintessa Swindell as Taylah Sanders in Prime Target.Photograph: Apple TV/PAWe love Leo Woodall … but did we buy him playing the greatest maths genius since Euclid, a man so smart he’s on the brink of a prime number discovery that could ruin society as we know it? Nope! This globe-trotting thriller about the NSA spying on – and killing off – intellectuals, and the man with the elaborate formula they were after, frankly got more farcical by the second. Silliness-by-numbers.1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue StoryView image in fullscreenInfamous … 1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Story.Photograph: Channel 4/DrumThis hagiography followed the OnlyFans star renowned for sexual escapades such as proudly sleeping with men who look ‘barely legal’ as she prepared for her biggest feat yet: having sex with 1000 men (or 1057, as it turned out) in the space of 12 hours. What on earth would possess her? What we wanted was way more interrogation of Bonnie Blue’s actual psyche, plus those of the men in the queue to have sex with her – some donning balaclavas and, fascinatingly, many others not. They could at least have spoken to the legendary mum who showed up to haul her son out of the queue. What we got was horrific shots of Bonnie making snow angels on a floor full of used condoms and absolutely no interrogation of her infamy whatsoever. And to think, the documentary-maker has a teenage daughter too.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVAnd Just Like ThatDavid MitchellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After decades of talk, Francis Ford Coppola’s forever-gestating dream project Megalopolis debuted in movie theaters in fall 2024, and promptly flopped at the box office, grossing a paltry $14m worldwide against a budget around $120m, much of which was put up by Coppola himself. Not even a series of splashy Imax presentations, including some with a live-actor element, could entice more than a relative handful of curious cinephiles out of the house to witness Coppola realize his ambition of making a movie about a visionary, time-stopping architect (Adam Driver) and the decadent city only he can save with his brilliant blueprints.‘He’s a jump-off-the-cliff kind of guy’: inside Francis Ford Coppola’s chaotic Megalopolis shootRead moreSome of the movie nerds showed up to watch Driver speechify, to immerse themselves in digital evocations of a futuristic, Rome-New York City hybrid, and enjoy the eclecticism of a cast that also includes Laurence Fishburne, several members of Coppola’s family, SNL’s Chloe Fineman, a number of semi-canceled actors encouraged to ham with impunity, andAubrey Plazaas Wow Platinum. A bunch of the movie’s original viewers had some fun making jokes on social media; a few mounted genuine defenses in the digital pages of Letterboxd and the like. But unsurprisingly, the movie did not figure into year-end awards consideration. After months-to-years of buildup, the movie left theaters within a few weeks, and was available to stream at home a little while later. For most movies, that’s a recipe for disappointed shrugs.Then something happened. Or rather, one thing didn’t happen:Megalopolisnever made it to the kinds of subscription-streaming channels that sometimes leads to a quick rediscovery (or, in some cases, couch-dwelling derision). The movie was briefly available to rent or buy on video on demand, but disappeared from those outlets relatively quickly, and didn’t surface on other common home-video formats in North America. (It was released on physical media in some other countries.)Instead, Coppola launched asix-city speaking tourover this past summer, screening the movie and engaging in a two-hour lecture about some of its broadest themes (topics on the agenda included “time”, “work”, and “war”). If you missed this, intentionally or otherwise, you might still be able to catch Megalopolis on this coming New Year’s Day, when it will screen again in what Coppola claims to hope will become an annual tradition. He also supposedly plans for a “director’s cut” – sorry, then what was it we watched last fall, exactly? Someone else’s cut – called Megalopolis Unbound: longer, weirder, maybe some dream sequences. (Was the whole movie not his own dream sequence?)If you can’t wait that long and want some kind of glimpse of the Megalopolis world at home, there’s also a whole separate documentary:Megadoc, directed by Mike Figgis, is available to rent after its own festival-and-theatrical run this past fall. It includes scraps of alternate versions of the film from its lengthy development, including a table read with Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman, and a rehearsal with a young Ryan Gosling. There’s also apparently plenty of Plaza staying in character as journalist Wow Platinum. It’s not the full Megalopolis, but it’s more extensive than most DVD special features these days.Meanwhile, he’s selling those lecture tickets and also someextremely fancy watches; given how much he’s paid for his dream-project movie, it’s no wonder he’d want to get as many releases and cuts as possible out of the experience. He’s also performing a more eccentric version of a practice common to contemporary cinema: branding. Megalopolis does not exactly promise a sequel – it’s more of an all-on-the-floor movie, which is why the idea of a director’s cut feels so loopy despite it running well under 150 minutes – and anyway, that would cost another arm and a leg. But maybe he can force the cult-movie issue by more tightly controlling the movie’s distribution. There is something chic about scarcity in art, after all, and there will always be interest in Coppola as an artist in what is likely the final decade-and-change of his life. For the moment, he seems willing to parlay that interest into making Megalopolis happen.In some ways, it’s a brave rebuke to the half-ephemeral, half-disposable nature of contemporary film culture. An environment re-oriented toward streaming, influencers and online weirdos can burn people out on buzzy movies before they’re even released with memetic obsessiveness; movies from major film-makers can go straight to Netflix and get shuffled around the tiles until they’re nestled in between glorified Hallmark movies and Dateline-level true-crime docs; where movies can make hundreds of millions in theaters and unceremoniously turn up as one more option on your smart TV three weeks later.View image in fullscreenFrancis Ford Coppola in Megadoc.Photograph: Elliefilm Megadoc LLCCan Coppola will this into being on his own, insisting that his movie has been misunderstood before others have a chance to reclaim it more organically? It seems unlikely. I had a blast seeing Megalopolis in Imax last fall, but the idea of paying to see Coppola ramble about it and the state of the world only fills me with dread. Even the idea of an extended cut feels a bit like when Zack Snyder tried to gin up interest in two additional versions of his Netflix sci-fi movies Rebel Moon. Choosing the object of a cult is something that, well, actual cult leaders do; movie cults are more endearing because they choose their own targets, rather than being manipulated into joining.Strapped for cash: why Francis Ford Coppola is flogging his watchesRead moreStill, there’s precedent for this kind of ongoing exhibition. Though the New Year’s Day screenings aren’t in Imax, those specialty large-format theaters do sometimes run into dry spells where studios don’t have the latest blockbuster ready for them. (Just last week, some Imax theaters, in between Zootopia and Avatar sequels, were hosting combined revivals of Sinners and One Battle After Another, though both movies are available at home.) Fathom Entertainment and cheap-to-distribute digital prints have brought a rep-house sensibility to some multiplexes. The weekend after Diane Keaton’s death, three of her signature movies were screening at AMCs around the US.Moreover, the ritualization of Megalopolis would probably be more widely admired if the movie itself had a better reputation. (Recall the similarly intentional scarcity of Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s film Memoria, which initially showed in just one theater at a time, and even now remains relatively difficult to find.) Re-releasing the movie on New Year’s Day is appealing because Megalopolis is, in fact, a New Year’s-y movie: shiny, ridiculous and hopeful – and more than a little fake. Movies get unsolicited “45th anniversary” or theme-month revivals all the time now. Who says a museum-quality, agreed-upon classic should be the only cinema allowed to turn itself into a weird little holiday? Coppola would probably prefer to imagine that the ideas of Megalopolis are too nagging, far-reaching, and ambitious for people to let go. But the movie offers little more than vague, sometimes questionable platitudes in reference to how to build a better future as a society. What it has to offer is an experience – a quixotic quest to build a better, or at least weirder, in-person cinema.Explore more on these topicsMegalopolisFrancis Ford  CoppolaAdam DriverAubrey PlazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Seeing Netanyahu beg Donald Trump to be bailed out from a quagmire, a rising number of Americans openly acknowledge that Israel is not an ally but a liability. In September, the US’s Arab allies also reached the conclusion that we Iranians have always underscored: Israel’s recklessness is a threat to all.This reality is paving the way for whole new relationships that may transform our region. The US administration now faces a dilemma: it can continue writing blank cheques for Israel with American taxpayer dollars and credibility, or be part of a tectonic change for the better. For decades, western policy towards our region has been mostly shaped by myths originating from Israel. Thewar in Junewas momentous for a number of reasons, including how it exposed the cost for the west of mistaking mythology for strategy. Israel and its proxies claim a “decisive victory”, with Iran left weakened and deterred. Yet our vast strategic depth – the country covers an area the size of western Europe, and has a population 10 times that of Israel’s – meant that most of our provinces were untouched by Israel’s aggression. In contrast, all Israelis experienced the might of our military. The narrative of invulnerability – central to Israel’s myth-making machine – has been shattered.The manufactured crisis overIran’s nuclear programmeexemplifies how fiction authored in Tel Aviv and peddled by Israel’s proxies has fuelled unnecessary confrontation. For decades, we Iranians have emphasised that we do not seek nuclear weapons. This is not a tactical claim but a strategic doctrine grounded in religious, ethical and security considerations. Yet during President Trump’s first term, the US administration was misled into believing that Iran was nearing collapse, that the2015 nuclear dealwas a lifeline for us, and that abandoning the accord would compel us to quickly concede. Those myths encouraged Washington to abandon a functional diplomatic framework in favour of “maximum pressure” that only produced “maximum resistance”.A growing number of Americans – particularly those who want a focus on rebuilding the US – are publicly acknowledging what has been taboo: that uncritical acceptance of Israel’s narratives has drained American resources, undermined American credibility, and entangled the US in conflicts that do not serve American interests. Over the past two years, the regime in Tel Aviv has killed tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians in Gazaand attackedLebanon, Syria, Iran, Yemen and even Qatar. Nearly every other state in the region has been threatened. No responsible individual calls this aggression “self-defence”.There is another silver lining to recent events: the new impetus in our region to contain a shared Israeli threat. This has put a final nail in the coffin ofthe so-called Abraham accordsand opened the door for novel cooperation.Europe has lost all credibility in the Middle East. The way to regain it lies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon | Nathalie TocciRead moreI have been made aware that there is an unprecedented willingness among mutual friends of Iran and the US to facilitate dialogue and underwrite the full and verifiable implementation of any negotiated outcome. It sounds promising. Despite Israel’s attack on diplomacy amid Iran-US nuclear negotiations, Iran remains open to an agreement that is built on mutual respect and mutual interest.That objective hinges on the US accepting that a negotiation is different from dictating the terms of a capitulation. Our people are well aware that President Trump is not the first US president to attack them, and have witnessed disastrous experiences of engaging with the US. If President Trump wants to win their trust, and stand by his pledges to his own supporters at home, he should do what none of his predecessors have achieved: finally end an unnecessary crisis by pursuing peace through diplomacy. The first step is to address the Iranian nation with a language of respect, without ifs and buts.Iranhas never desired a war with the US: our generals’ restraint in June – the only reason US military installations in our region are still intact – proves this point. That restraint should not be mistaken for weakness or assumed to be endless.The world should also know that Iranians will never abandon their rights. Enjoyed by all signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, those rights include access to all aspects of peaceful nuclear technology. We Iranians do not fear serious negotiations to achieve a fair deal. Such a deal must feature tangible and verifiable sanctions lifting. The shifts in our region can enable implementation of understandings in a whole new way.For those willing to go where no one has gone before, there is a brief window of opportunity. Fortune favours the brave, and it takes a lot more guts to break an evil cycle than to simply perpetuate it.Seyed Abbas Araghchi is the Iranian foreign ministerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The rich and famous are being punished for their conspicuous vacuityTue 30 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 15.19 ESTShareWhen Katy Perry and five other women were launched into space in Jeff Bezos’sBlue Origin rocket, no doubt they expected to be celebrated as trailblazers. Cast your mind back to April, and the event was getting wall-to-wallnews coverage. The crew, also including Bezos’s then-fiancee Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, were in spacefor about 11 minutes, during which Perry sang a rendition of Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World and revealed the setlist for her Lifetimes tour. On their return, the pop star kissed the ground and showed a daisy to the camera – a tribute to her daughter, Daisy.Well, talk about crashing back down to earth. Instead of being hailed as a giant leap for 21st-century feminism, the voyage turned into a colossal PR failure. Itwas ridiculedfor being tone-deaf, an out-of-touch luxury ride for the super-rich during a time of economic hardship. There were so many mocking memes and hot takes that Perry lateradmitted feeling “battered and bruised”at being turned into a “human piñata”. “I take it with grace and send them love,” she said, “cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for the unhinged and unhealed.”But the Blue Origin backlash reflected a broader cultural shift. As the now-viral refrain from Kourtney Kardashian goes, “Kim, there’s people that are dying.” The public’s tolerance for the promotion of celebrity as an end in itself is disappearing fast. In a world beset by economic uncertainty, political upheaval, wars and environmental breakdown, is it any surprise we increasingly want to see those with big platforms use them for something more than self-promotion?Of course, Jeff Bezos’s Venice wedding this summer, estimated tohave cost £37m, was uber-glamorous, and any A-lister worth their buck was invited. We saw the photos of Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Ivanka Trump and the Kardashians boarding water taxis to tour the Venetian lagoon. Once these images would have inspired envy or aspiration; now they arouse anger and feed “eat the rich” narratives.View image in fullscreenKaty Perry kissing the ground upon return to Earth after a flight on Blue Origin New Shepard NS-31, Van Horn, Texas, 14 April 2025.Photograph: BLUE ORIGIN/AFP/Getty ImagesOur celebrities were once distant figures whose lives functioned as escapism. Social media has eroded that distance, drawing stars into the same feeds, crises and conversations as everyone else. Now, when they appear indifferent, it reads as disdainful.Take Sydney Sweeney, whose advert for American Eagle jeans caused one of thebiggest controversiesin pop culture this year. In it, the blond-haired, blue-eyed star of Euphoria is framed as having “great jeans” – playing on the pun with “genes” – which critics claimed evoked eugenics and white supremacy. Even Donald Trump got involved,calling it“the hottest ad out there” after it was reported that Sweeney hadregistered as a Republicanvoter in Florida months before his election. Many saw Sweeney’s silence as complicity. “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear,” the actorsaid in November.Fast forward a few weeks, and Sweeney finally conceded she should have addressed the controversy around the ad. She also spoke out against “hate and divisiveness”. The generous interpretation is that it took time to work out the right response, but cynics may point out that the contrition coincided with Sweeney’s latest film, Christy, underperforming at the box office.Film execs could be forgiven for believing that merely having an A-list name in a title could get people into theatres – after all, it’s been the established way since the dawn of Hollywood. But Sweeney’s experience also speaks to a broader recalibration in the film industry itself. This season, films starring the likes of Margot Robbie, Dwayne Johnson, Julia Roberts, Keanu Reeves and Daniel Day-Lewishave all struggled at the box office. One popularpost on Redditsaid it was “simply because the star system no longer exists and a single name is not enough to convince a person to go to the cinema”. Instead, what resonated were films that challenged existing power structures as well as having a solid cast, such asRyan Coogler’s Sinners, a vampire film rooted in Black history, or Paul Thomas Anderson’sOne Battle After Another, about a retired revolutionary and his mixed-race daughter taking on the state.It’s no longer enough, it seems, to celebrate celebrity. Even Taylor Swift, who built a career on emotional vulnerability, faced a muted response when her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, prioritised songs about showbiz and herfiance’s manhoodover grander concerns. Accusations that Swift was detached from the anxieties of the wider world were compounded when shefailed to challenge the Trump administrationusing snippets from the album on social media (in stark contrast to other musicians, such as Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo, who havepublicly objected to similar political appropriation).Last year, Swift was on a list of celebrities that social-media userswere encouraged to blockbecause they had not publicly commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Perhaps such strength of feeling was behind the increasing number of artists who have felt empowered to speak out about the scale of death and suffering in Gaza over the past 12 months. But there are also potential repercussions for those who do make political statements – and not just about the Middle East. The suspension of the US TV host Jimmy Kimmel (over comments made about the killing of Charlie Kirk) demonstrated that powerful institutions are willing to act against public figureswho challenge them.There is also the risk of celebrities sliding into performative activism. On her new Substack, Charli xcx recentlyreflected on the artist’s responsibilityto the public. “Some people seem to have developed a connection between fame and moral responsibility that I’ve never really understood,” she said. Meanwhile, Jennifer Lawrence has saidthe onus shouldn’t be on artiststo fix the world’s problems. But in an age when many have lost trust in institutions that once shaped public morality, from political leaders to the media, it’s hardly surprising that celebrities are being looked to to fill the vacuum. In 2025, people don’t want their celebrities in space, they want to know what they stand for on the ground.Nadia Khomami is the arts and culture correspondent at the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Certainly, the news that his cancer treatment will bescaled backhas come as a welcome personal relief, but it will also present opportunities for further overseas travel next year, likely to include a state visit to the US to mark the 250th anniversary of its foundation.It has been a year that has seen the king grow into the role of a silent but effective diplomat, navigating Donald Trump’s visit while demonstrating the UK’s support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine. Overseas trips have included a historic visit to the Vatican topray publiclywith the pope, and successful visits as head of stateto Canada– shortly after Trump hadsuggestedit might become the US’s 51st state – andto Australia. Moreover, the king has hosted the biggest number of inward state visits to the UK foralmost 40 years. For his use of the monarchy’s soft power to support UK foreign policy and strengthen international relations, Charles has won plaudits.He has been praised too for hisopenness about his health– a significant departure from centuries of secrecy surrounding such matters in the British monarchy. First came the announcement – in early 2024 – that the king had been treated for an enlarged prostate; then the news of his cancer diagnosis; and now its effective treatment. This has undoubtedly done much to make the king seem more relatable and empathetic, and has consolidated hispersonal approval ratingamong Britons at 62%, according to an October poll by Statista.But for all this, the fly in the ointment has and will remain hisbrother Andrew, despite him being stripped of his titles and facing imminent banishment from Windsor Park’s Royal Lodge to a property on the Sandringham estate. It is a scandal that has engulfed the family and continues to raise profound and potentially existential questions for the monarchy. In October, on a visit to Lichfield Cathedral, Charles washeckled by a protesterwho asked, “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?”, and whether the king had “asked the police to cover up” for his brother. While the protester was swiftly bundled off and silenced, questions about the lack of transparency and suggestion of a conspiracy of silence won’t go away.Walter Bagehot, the Victorian journalist and political essayist, argued that the British monarchy’s “mystery is its life”; and that “we must not let in daylight upon magic”. This has, for more than 150 years, provided the justification for our constitutional monarchy to remain shrouded in secrecy, above scrutiny, and protected from sustained critique. As Bagehot wrote: “Above all things our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about it you cannot reverence it.”King Charles hails reduction in cancer treatment as ‘milestone’ in his recoveryRead moreYet automatic deference or reverence is no more. Contemporary expectations of transparency and accountability are finally beginning to focus on the monarchy. Silence now suggests there is something to hide, and this erodes public trust and with it acceptance, never mind affection, for the institution. Indeed, public support for the monarchy reached itslowest level on recordthis year, with more Britons than ever before questioning its future. While a majority still supports its continuation, the figure has steadily declined since 2022.There are questions around what was known and ignored regarding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. What further questions of accountability and transparency may arise? Should it not be more widely known and considered that as monarch, our head of state, has sovereign immunity and so cannot be tried in court? And then there is the little-known fact that the king’s consent is sought for all legislation that affects the “personal property or personal interests of the crown”. Legislative exemptions from the Equality Act 2010 means that royal household employees cannot pursue discrimination claims (based on race, sex, age, etc) through an employment tribunal or court. Moreover, the monarch’s exemption from the Freedom of Information Act prevents scrutiny of how royal funds are spent and conceals the extent to which the monarch may attempt to influence government policy through private lobbying efforts. This, many would argue, fundamentally undermines democratic accountability.This year the House of Commons library published aresearch briefingon the finances of the monarchy. It has not made headline news, yet it raises very real questions about the institution and the sources and scale of its wealth, all at a time when the government is struggling to balance the books. The report tracks how the value of the sovereign grant, the monarch’s official funding, has risen to £132.1m for 2025/6, due in part to soaring profits from the crown estate. The king also received £28.7m in 2024/5 from the Duchy of Lancaster and a private undisclosed income from investments, inherited wealth and income from family estates such as Sandringham and Balmoral. Since 1993 the monarch and heir voluntarily pay income tax, but not on the sovereign grant, and nor do they automatically pay capital gains or inheritance tax. Questions as to what constitutes “public” and “private” money should be asked, and a clear separation made between state and royal wealth.The royal family has consistently been reactive rather than proactive when it comes to change and public opinion, and continues to believe in privilege and privacy at all costs. Yet for the monarchy to survive and thrive, and the king to continue to play a role as a unifying figurehead, supporting charitable causes and exercising soft power internationally, he needs to embrace openness and accountability. Reverence towards the institution is all but lost, but without transparency and letting in the “daylight”, it risks further alienation, mistrust and fatal irrelevance. As the king is praised for the openness with which he has spoken about his health, perhaps he might reflect on the expectations the public may have of a truly modern monarch.Anna Whitelock is a professor of the history of modern monarchy at City St Georges, University of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The people – some of them at least – have spoken: here comes a fresh tranche of the great and good.Many questions remain about this process of elevation, but it’s worth saying that in the past, there were many more. As we think about the probity of politics now, fromPPE procurement scandalstoa one-time MEP bribed by the Russians, one might frown – but things have been degrees worse.A hundred years ago, if you wanted a knighthood, say, a baronetcy or even a peerage and, worthy or not, were prepared to pay for it, you called on a man namedArthur Maundy Gregory, who had set up in a large office almost directly opposite Downing Street.Liveried servants, their uniforms so closely modelled on those of House of Commons messengers that you could not tell the difference, would usher you into Gregory’s office, where the man himself, immaculately dressed and usually wearing a monocle, would greet you and point out the framed photographs of the crowned heads of Europe on his walls. They included the futureKing George VI, at whose wedding toElizabeth Bowes-Lyon(later the queen mother) he had been an usher.Despite his respectable appearance and ingratiating manner, Gregory was a scoundrel and a chancer. He had had various careers, as an actor, impresario, editor of vanity publishing magazines, club owner, self-proclaimed spy master and police informant and would maybe eventually even become a murderer. As he chatted, the telephone on his desk would ring and he would explain that No 10 was calling, without mentioning that he himself lived in an apartment at number 10, though Hyde Park Terrace, not Downing Street.View image in fullscreenMaundy Gregory, circa 1920s.Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty ImagesGregory would explain to you the scale of fees to help grease the wheels to the next birthday honours release: £10,000 for a knighthood, £40,000 for a baronetcy and £50,000 for a peerage – huge sums; multiply by 47 to get an idea of the modern equivalents. His commission probably totalled £30,000 a year and the rest went to party funds, mainly the prime minister, David Lloyd George’s. The hard-faced men who had done rather well out of the first world war might not have liked the “Welsh wizard”, but they were prepared to pay an honours tout like Gregory for their titles. Some of them, shovelled towards honours, were out-and-out crooks – Gregory either didn’t know, or didn’t care.Lloyd George himself did not look too closely where the money was coming from.As he told a Tory politicianlater: “You and I know perfectly well it is a far cleaner method of filling the party chest than the methods used in the US or the Socialist party … Here a man gives … to the party and gets a baronetcy. If he comes to the leader of the party … and says you must do this or that, we can tell him to go to the devil … The worst of it is that you cannot defend it in public.”Eventually, the awards got so disreputable that King George V complained about the rogues he was expected to confer honours on. “Disagreeable and distasteful” he said, privately of course. And the Tories also objected to their own potential donors being stolen by Lloyd George’s fixers. After they got into power in 1924, theHonours (Prevention of Abuses) Actwas finally passed, but the only person who has ever been tried under the legislation was Gregory himself; he went to prison for two months (freed after seven weeks for good behaviour) and was fined £50 with 50 guineas costs. On release from Wormwood Scrubs, he was met by a taxi and taken immediately into exile in Paris, where he received a monthly pension (in brown envelopes) for keeping his mouth shut about who he’d sold to. In those days, baronetcies (scarcely awarded these days) and peerages were hereditary and one or two third-generation descendants of Gregory’s honorands are still knocking about.Couldn’t happen now, could it? No, but let’s not be complacent. The other day, a friend of mine, a highly respectable professional, happened to be reading my book on Gregory when an unexpected and startling email popped into their mail box. “Have you ever considered independent recognition for (your) career impact, through attaining a royal honour such as an MBE, OBE, CBE or even a knighthood or damehood? Your leadership … feels very aligned with what these honours and awards look to recognise.”The company which sent the email says its clients are 6.5 times more likely to attain a royal honour and that it has an 80% success rate for king’s awards for enterprise. Its fees, it says, are based on the length of an honours nomination that it prepares for clients. I’m not sure Maundy Gregory could have put it better himself.Stephen Bates is a former senior Guardian correspondent and the author ofThe Man Who Sold Honours, published by Icon BooksDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Most have been at home that day 1) cooking and 2) filling multiple bin bags, washing baskets and buckets with hundreds upon hundreds of water balloons, which are generally stored within the boots of their cars.The party proceeds in my folk’s back yard and, while the adults drink and eat, the young adults stand at the sink in the cellar filling still moreballoons for what is essentially a communal pot.Childrenbecome increasingly excited and unhinged until finally, organically, groups of Sheas put down our plates (hard for us) and start lining along either side of the street, unloading waterbombs and bunkering down behind the vehicles.No one knows who throws the first volley but once one bomb bursts against a bonnet, bonce or ballsack, it’s on for young and old.View image in fullscreenA young Patrick Marlborough, left, threatens the photographer with a drenchingWise elders sit on the veranda, operating as quasi-umpires, keeping an eye out for traffic (no one could yell “CAR” like my Auntie Gwen) and innocent civilians (“PRAM!”), calling affairs to a halt if a family friend – unsure what they walked into – just wants to get back to their car and leave without being annihilated. Some neighbours take refuge in their homes; others come out to watch.Right beside the veranda, an engineering corps of sorts fills balloons at the front yard spigot, helping to resupply the public stock alongside those running back and forth from the porch and the cellar.At the heart of everything – as it is in most of our family traditions – is my mother’s giant white van. Sitting in front of the veranda, it is a mobile citadel protecting the observers on the porch. It is also a choice spot for the youngest among us to cower behind: the bombs explode especially loudly on its roof, and squatting there begging for mercy provides brief respite for our shell-shocked toddlers who naively believed their big cousins would go easy on them.But for about 30 years from 1977, the van was also the place where interfamily conflict would end, and our war of outward aggression began. As hell rained down around her, my mother would take her position as the driver. The side door slid open, a healthy supply of balloons in bin bags were wedged between the two facing bench seats and anywhere between eight and 12 cousins piled in.Then the bombing raids began.View image in fullscreen‘Nothing felt as good as bursting a balloon on a sloshed goofball’s boat shoes before zooming away yelling “Happy new year!”’Mum drove the van down the hill into town where – leaning from windows, holding each other by belts and collars, calling out targets like artillerymen – my family would lay siege to Fremantle and its drunken NYE revellers. It was a floodbath.There were rules: no direct hits (aim for feet and walls), no homeless people, no pregnant women/babies, no people with disability, no one who looked dangerous (the bikie bars and club houses were off limits), no throwing when stopped at a red light (getaway is vital), and, even though they may beverytempting, no cops.My family’s Saturday lunch is often for 50. Lockdown has been a challengeRead moreThe rest were fair game. Nothing felt as good as bursting a balloon on a sloshed goofball’s boat shoes before zooming away yelling “Happy new year!” to a fading chorus of “FUCK YOU, YOU DOG –” etc.At its height, there could be 10 or more raids on town a night, sometimes going until as late as 2am in what became a community event of sorts.Not everybody loved us but I remember no real complaints, other than the odd drunken man angrily hurling his longneck in our wake – although we did have to contend with the fireys of Fremantle, who each year would wait out front of the fire station for us with a small truck and a big hose, spraying us down as we drove past. (One year, Norma Snairy – an elderly family friend – didn’t wind her window up in time and a jet of water flooded the van and its occupants in a long overdue karmic comeuppance.)When a raid ended, the van would pull up back in front of the house where the street war was very much ongoing; you’d have to all but duck and roll out as if you were parachuting from a troop carrier under heavy enemy fire.The town raids wound down in the early 2000s after police pulled us over, grabbed two pregnant cousins from the van and threatened to arrest them. After that the violence turned inwards – and the interfamily street war picked up in ferocity.Methods and technology changed over generations (mine incorporated water blasters and pistols, tote bags and throwing devices) and innovations (a dongle that fills 10 balloons at once) came and went, as did many loved ones. But always the next day, the gruelling clean-up began. There’s nothing like picking up 10,000 used water balloons from boiling hot cement on a 35C New Year’s Day to make you question a lot of things about yourself and the people who raised you.View image in fullscreenFamily members restock the artilleryWhile drafting this piece, I posted in various Fremantle Facebook groups, asking if any citizen or firefighter had any memories of being hit or hosing us down. I got no responses. It’s a different town these days and many who’d remember have moved away or passed on.Even among the Sheas, the street war has all but ended: these days the teens are too glued to their iPhones to risk getting them wet and those of us in our mid-30s have more qualms about breaking the body and spirit of a toddler than our older cousins did in the 90s.I wish I could say we had regrets and remorse but stirring up my family’s memories has resulted only in talk of a revival. So if you ever find yourself leaving one of Fremantle’s new craft breweries only to be suddenly struck and soaked at the feet, look up to catch a glimpse of a white van as it speeds away – and know that when we yelled out “Happy new year!”, we meant it.Explore more on these topicsFamilySummer essentialsChildrenWestern AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

Ghosting is the humane optionPhineas HarperEither say you can’t make it well in advance or keep stummTue 30 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 11.44 ESTShareAs New Year’s Eve looms, I implore you to heed this party etiquette advice.There are only two correct times to decline a party invitation: well in advance or not at all. The last thing any stressed-out host wants to receive, in the moments before their big event begins, is a sudden flood of 11th-hour RSVPs from guests announcing that they’re not coming. And yet, as anyone who regularly organises large parties in Britain knows, that’s exactly what they tend to be sent. It needs to stop.Having an invitation turned down in advance stings a little, but it is genuinely helpful. It provides a sense of potential turnout to help gauge catering and expectations. A decline on the day, however, is infuriatingly useless. Food and booze will already long since have been ordered, and it’s way too late to invite another friend to make up the numbers.Worse, getting a string of hastily typed apologies just hours before kick-off is an almighty buzzkill. Spending the day preparing, cleaning, baking and making Spotify playlists – only to be hit by a wave of rejection just as you’re feeling most vulnerable about who will turn up – sucks.There’s nothing wrong with guests reneging on party invitations per se. Shit happens. That’s life. Never mind. But rather than adding to your host’s headaches, the polite way to bow out of an event you find yourself unexpectedly unable to attend is to simply keep your mouth shut and your phone in your pocket. Ghosting, in this case, is the best approach.Worst of all is vibes-death by group chat. I’ve learned the hard way never to make the mistake of creating a WhatsApp group for a party in which guests can also post. No matter how many 🕺 messages and 🍸 emojis are exchanged in advance, come the day, every invitee in the group will receive the same barrage of energy-sapping dropout messages as a parade of guests inevitably pronounce they “can’t make it after all”, like the world’s worst hype men.OK, if it’s a small event – a dinner perhaps – and you suddenly can’t attend, sure, send a short note of apology followed by some grovelling (possibly via a card or flowers) a few days later. But for gatherings any larger than 10, just keep stumm.Most organisers of large parties will have probably anticipated flakiness anyway, and will have invited enough people to ensure a banger regardless of dropouts. But no host wants to hear about how you “somehow double-booked” yourself while they’re elbows-deep in party prep. Your last-minute bailing is your loss. Keep it to yourself.Phineas Harper is a writer and curatorExplore more on these topicsSocial etiquetteThe hill I will die onChristmascommentShareReuse this content"

It had to because this is not only a policy conflict.Between the administration and the opposition are actual opposites of principle: among those committed to inclusion and those to exclusion; truth and lies; kindness and cruelty; the protection and destruction of systems that in turn protect the climate or public health.It seems possible that what will ultimately emerge is a clarified sense of principles and a deeper commitment to them (which is why part of the conflict is over American history itself).On one hand, there are the heads of the federal government and their spokespeople, whose lies are part of their disdain for the electorate and the rule of law. Those lies also get served up as the justification for their cruelty – the cruelty directed toward federal workers, immigrants, children in this country in need of food and healthcare, including vaccines, and the millions of people currently starving or devastated by preventable disease around the world sinceElon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” gang destroyed USAID.Americans are waking up. A grand reckoning awaits us | Robert ReichRead morePoliticians’ lies were once decried and punished when detected, in a process that often led to contriteness and apologies from the liar. Even the act of lying was a furtive one when people feared detection and its consequences. Now liesarethebackboneofthe Trump administration’s utterances – from likely lying about the inhabitants of the small boats they are blowing up in the Caribbean, to lying about vaccines, the economy, climate, polls, laws, history, race, immigration and pretty much everything else.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt specializes in grotesque falsehoods in praise ofDonald Trump’s health, intelligence, success, and popularity. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary,peddlesliesabout health and healthcare and the science behind them. Vice-President JD Vance has likewise lied about a broad range of subjects, but his venom has been particularly directed at immigrants, who he falsely accuses ofdire economic impactsandoutlandish crimes. White House adviser Stephen Miller has told the same lies with even more venom. But Trump is first and last the liar-in-chief.It’s clear that many on the far right are now part of a subculture that celebrates and revels in cruelty and viciousness and doesn’t mind dishonesty. Trump officials sometimes seem baffled by the response from the rest of us who aren’t part of it, but apparently they don’t think we matter. We’re not their target audience, and this indifference to the opinion and values of the majority is itself a testament to their commitment to minority rule. It’s our job as the opposition to matter. And we have.The immigrant-rights opposition is motivated by solidarity with those under attack, underwritten by compassion. FromLos AngelestoChicagotoCharlotte, North Carolina, people have risked their own physical and legal safety to stand with those under attack by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), andorganized,trainedand otherwisedone the worktoprotect their neighbors. It has had a major impact on the ability of ICE to persecute immigrants and the Brown and Black people whose immigration status doesn’t seem to matter to these goon squads – sometimes as specific as preventing a person from being hauled away, sometimes as broad as theunprecedentedproteststhis year.Trump is shamelessly covering America in his name | Mohamad BazziRead moreFor example, the Chicago Tribunereportsthat on 25 October, “agents deployed even more teargas, this time right before a children’s Halloween parade inIrving Park, where a resident raced out of his house, still in his Chicago Blackhawks pajamas, to confront feds who’d tackled a man in his front yard.”Others, as lawyers, judges, protesters, journalists, scientists and educators, have defended truth, facts, science and law to protect human beings and the social and natural systems we depend on. They have stood up for the authority of truth that authoritarians seek to squelch or corrupt. The withholding and corrupting of information by the administration is corrosive to democracy, and it comes from a kind of elitism that regards the rest of us as not deserving the truth – and maybe suckers who will buy the lies (which plenty on the right actually are, and most of the rest of us aren’t).Facts, truth, science, history are themselves democratic. The causes of the civil war, Covid-19 and the climate crisis are the same whether you’re a billionaire or a busker, and money can’t buy you out of that – though it can buy you a social media platform or a network news corporation to corrupt.The opposition has been marked most of all by solidarity (which is by definition alliance and commitment to those who are not the same as you), an embrace of difference. I do not believe there has been anything like this level of solidarity with immigrants and refugees before, from the crowds showing up in the streets to the US senatorwho flewto El Salvador to try to rescue the kidnapped and persecutedKilmar Ábrego García. I hope that it gives rise to a shift in the Democratic party’s discourse about immigrants and refugees, from a watered-down acceptance of their characterization as a burden and a problem, to recognition of their irreplaceable contributions to this country, economically and otherwise.The attempts to secure truth and maybe justice forJeffrey Epstein’s victims has also been driven by solidarity with the victims and a sense of principle that the Trump administration and Trump himself don’t share. Their victimization was the result of the radical inequality between poor girls and young women and wealthy men, so one of the underlying questions is about equality, about whether we will have a nation in which everyone’s rights matter, in which everyone deserves protection by the law.Through the lens of history, Trump’s legacy will be more of a blotch than a Maga masterpiece | Simon TisdallRead moreIt has been remarkable how this scandal that refuses to die down was what caused widespread Republicandefection, when members of the House and Senate voted so broadly to release the files and someRepublicansspokeopenlyagainst Trump himself. Polls show Trump’s own popularity and that of his handling of the economy and immigration hasdeclinedradicallyover the course of the year.It was not clear when 2025 began what kind of opposition to theTrump administrationthere would be and how effective it would be. Many at the beginning of the year feared a powerful administration whose destruction went unchallenged, but it has been challenged and it has stumbled, faltered and backed down in many situations.The administration now seems to be getting more extreme and reckless as it grows more desperate, chaotic and unpopular. We enter 2026 with radical uncertainty about the fate of this country – but also with the clarity that people have the power to determine what it will be, if they continue to show up and stand on principle.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Today, how US foreign policy has dramatically – and alarmingly – turned towards Latin America and the CaribbeanTue 30 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 13.57 ESTShareDonald Trump is not generally noted as a student of history. Yet over the past year, his decisive reorientation ofUS foreign policytowards the Americas has revived a playbook dating back two centuries, to the fifth president, James Monroe. Now the 47th is doubling down. An anti-interventionist is having second thoughts. Remarks that sounded at first like bad jokes or random outbursts from the presidential id have become more sinister through repetition or accompanying actions. Only a fool would take all of Mr Trump’s comments literally – but they should certainly be taken seriously.He has refused to rule out using military forceto take control of Greenlandand repeatedly floated the idea of making Canada the 51st state. He threatened to seize the Panama canal. He has imposed swingeing tariffs on key partners, and says he mightabandon the Canada-Mexico tradepact signed in his first term. He has meddled outrageously in elections in Honduras and Argentina, and sought to interfere with Brazilian justice. Heimposed sanctions on Colombia’s presidentin October. He has launched deadly attacks on alleged drug boats in international waters – extrajudicial killings that the administration hassought to legitimiseby arbitrarily designating traffickers as terrorists – and threatenedmilitary strikeson Mexico, Venezuela and any other country he blames for drugs consumed in the US.Gunboat diplomacy is back. The US has positioned an extraordinarydisplay of military mightoff the coast of Venezuela – its largest presence in the Caribbean for decades – and is seizing oil tankers. Mr Trump reportedly gave Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro,an ultimatum to quitwhen they spoke recently, and has puta $50m bountyon his head. Mr Trump is unconcerned by the regime’s repression. Purportedly this is about tackling drugs – but Venezuela is not a producer or major conduit for narcotics, and Mr Trump hasjust pardoned the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernándezfor major drug-related offences.History repeatingThe US seems convinced that it can strongarm the leftist Mr Maduro into fleeing, or persuade other members of his regime to oust him. The question is what happens if its confidence is misplaced – as it was in Mr Trump’s first term, when recognising the then opposition leader Juan Guaidó as president failed to dislodge Mr Maduro. The CIA has reportedly used drones tostrike a Venezuelan port facility. How much further will the US go?In 1823, President Monroe warned European powers not to interfere in the western hemisphere. In 2025, Mr Trump’s actions reflect concern about China’s growing role. “The United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe doctrine to restore American preeminence,” statesthe new national security strategy.What it calls the “Trump Corollary” is a nod to the “Roosevelt Corollary”. The 26th US president turned Monroe’s defensive, exclusionary stanceinto “big stick” hegemony. The pledge of a “potent restoration of American power and priorities” will depend on “enlisting” allies and pressuring others, and on an “adjusted” military presence. The“Donroe doctrine”is also spurred by promises to prevent mass migration, a fixation on drug trafficking, hopes of trade advantage and a hunger for minerals, plus a craving for headline-grabbing, ego-bolstering symbols of domination.Mr Trump appears unperturbed by stronger Chinese and Russian spheres of influence – as long as he has a domain to match Xi Jinping’s and Vladimir Putin’s. The new US “doctrine” is in reality subject to his whims,grudgesand personal relations with leaders, and inconsistencies within his court. There are clear divisions in his foreign policy team,notably on Venezuela. Richard Grenell, the mercantilist presidential envoy for special missions, has promoted talks with Mr Maduro. Marco Rubio, secretary of state, remains unabashedly hawkish – and, with the Middle East and Ukraine largely out of his hands, has plenty of time to devote to Latin America.Pushing back BeijingThe speed with which China was able to build ties with Latin America and the Caribbean partly reflected arelative lack of US interest in the region. China is now the largest trading partner, but the US is the largest foreign investor. The White House may well believe that it can easily regain ground – and that it is already notching up successes. Javier Milei’s far-right partywon midterm elections in Argentina, to widespread surprise, after Mr Trump proffered the country a $40bn bailout – as long as his man won. The president’s disdain for human rights makes El Salvador’sself-styled “coolest dictator”Nayib Bukele not a concern but an asset, takingVenezuelan deportees from the US.It’s not only about ideological bedfellows:Mexico seems to be shifting towards the USunder pressure, and a series of new security dealswill see American troops deployed across the region. Yet elsewhere, fear of an unpredictable, bullying administration may warm relations with Beijing. Mr Trump’s tactics often backfire.Sanctions and tariffswere meant to kill Brazil’s case against Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup after losing the 2022 election – but the former president gota 27-year sentence. The popularity of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva rose. The US has since eliminatedkey food tariffstoo.An attack on Venezuela would fuel a backlash in the region – and, experts predict, arefugee surgeto the US. Mr Trump’s vociferous complaints about China “controlling” the Panama canal spurred the private Hong Kong-based company CK Hutchison, which owned two ports in Panama, to announce that it would sell all its port holdings to a grouping led by the US investment firm BlackRock. But Beijing blocked the deal – then said the price for approval would be adding the Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco to the consortium. Cosco would be excluded from Panamanian locations, butcould reportedly gaina stake in dozens of ports worldwide.Few in the region would choose to rely on either hegemon, and anxiety in Latin America at increased US forcefulness is matched by concern from allies in Asia and Europe at both US bullying and US withdrawal. Canada isinterested in bolstering transatlantic relations. The European Union and Latin America would benefit from better ties too, but thelong-awaited trade deal between Brussels and the Mercosur bloc, due to be signed this month, hasstalled again. Europe should make it a priority.Sharp political divides within Latin America, as well as diverging interests between continents, will place limits on cooperation. But Mr Trump’s reckless and regressive behaviour is spurring changes that the US too may live to regret.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fewer cages, gentler gas, a close season for hares. All very civilised. Yet the central obscenity remains untouched. We are still breeding, confining and killing animals by the billion, then praising ourselves for marginally reducing the panic and pain along the way.This strategy treats animal suffering the way Victorian engineers treated cholera. Add a valve here, a filter there, and never question the sewer itself. One billion chickens a year is not an ethical problem that can be solved with better regulations. It is a moral failure so large it has become invisible, like traffic noise. The state recognises animals as “sentient beings” while organising their lives around maximised throughput and minimised cost. That is not compassion. It is bureaucratic anaesthesia.Your editorial gestures toward the real issues – climate damage, wildlife loss, the need to reduce meat consumption – then hurriedly looks away. This is the familiar dance of British politics. Everyone knows the answer, but nobody wants to say it out loud because it might upset farmers, voters or the ghost of Sunday roast. So we get a strategy that asks how to kill animals more nicely instead of why we insist on killing them at all.Veganism is not a lifestyle garnish or a boutique moral pose. It is the obvious conclusion of everything that this strategy claims to care about. If animals matter, stop eating them. If carbon emissions matter, stop propping up livestock farming – one of the most wasteful systems ever invented. If wildlife matters, stop turning land into feedlots and monocrop deserts to support cheap meat.This is not radicalism. It is arithmetic. Until policy reflects that, animal welfare will remain what it is now: a polite cover story for continued slaughter.Dean WestonRowhedge, EssexDegrees of separation are the issue here – relating the food on our plates to the animals they once were. As a rehomer of over 50 ex-battery hens, I stopped eating eggs the moment I stepped into a battery farm. I visited a dairy farm as part of my job, and watched as a cow, depressed after her twelfth calf was taken away from her, was sent “up the road” in the slaughter lorry. I stopped eating dairy from that moment.I would never expect the world to go vegan, as I now am, but transparency and truth about where our food comes from, how it lives and dies, would benefit not just us humans but the beautiful creatures we share our planet with. Non-human animals are sentient beings and we humans should be intelligent enough to respect and realise that.Jo BarlowCamborne, CornwallYour article (Do prawns feel pain? Why scientists are urging a rethink of Australia’s favoured festive food, 22 December) highlights what science has made increasingly clear: prawns and other crustaceans are sentient individuals who can learn, remember, form relationships and experience pain. Their hard shells don’t make them unfeeling – only easier for humans to ignore.Yet every festive season, billions of these animals are treated as disposable commodities, boiled alive, mutilated or transported under extreme stress. If we acknowledge that prawns feel fear and distress, then continuing to subject them to these practices becomes impossible to justify.Recognising crustaceans as individuals – not food items – requires more than minor welfare tweaks. It calls for a fundamental shift in how we view and use other animals. The most ethical choice is simple: leave prawns off our plates and choose vegan foods that don’t require anyone to suffer.Scott MillerResearch specialist, fishing andwaterways,thePeta FoundationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The Norwegian children were dealt with using a welfare approach, their identities protected, the public response muted and the children totally rehabilitated.All of which is in sharp contrast to the media response, public outcry and outcomes for the killers of James Bulger. While this is an extreme example, the vast majority of empirical research reaches the same conclusion.It will be to the Labour government’s enduring shame if it does not do what Lady Hale, among many others, is proposing.Prof Roger EvansEmeritus professor of socio-legal studies, Liverpool John Moores UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

My father was interviewed by the Gestapo over 10 days and failed to get any agreement to leave.My mother, Nelly (Kornelia), who was very beautiful, bravely went by herself to the Zlin Gestapo HQ and met a lone Gestapo officer, telling him that she was not leaving until he issued her with the exit permits for both families. She stunned him by openly declaring she was Jewish, which he didn’t believe “because she was so beautiful”. However, he was captivated, and she left with all the permits for both families.When my sister, Vera, who was born a few days before Tom in Zlin, died in 2019, he ended a letter of condolence to me with these words: “Speaking of survival, you may know that I and [his brother] Peter and our parents owed our lives to Nelly in 1939, because she charmed or forced our exit permits from the Gestapo office.

Here was a statement win to show that the pain and agony can be worth it. A champion team must often suffer to arrive at beautiful moments. Those scratchy wins over Wolves, Everton and Brighton can now be celebrated alongside a champagne evening to sign off 2025.The club’s familiarity with chasing the title as the league turns for home has bred an unavoidable anxiety. April and May have previously proved the cruellest months but December has been full of worries. In pre-match, “north London forever” was sung tremulously, fans seeking a collective warmth to ward off individual doubts about the dream. For 45 minutes, fans, players and manager alike were left alone with their private agonies, only for the second half where Arsenal played the expansive, confident football of the autumn, smashing in four goals to vaporise the unease.Gabriel Magalhães’ opener sparks Arsenal’s second-half rout of Aston VillaRead moreAston Villa were a feared opponent, all too familiar. Bringing their winning run – and perhaps their title challenge – to an abrupt end added further satisfaction, burying a recent ghost and some former employees, too. Emi Martínez, a former Gunner, fed off the frustration with his time-keeping, and was barracked as he headed in for half-time. How the home fans enjoyed him being culpable for Arsenal’s first goal. It was only 24 days previously that Emi Buendía’s 95th-minutewinner at Villa Parkwas followed by Arsenal players sinking to the turf as if another disappointing May had already been reached.It is rare that Mikel Arteta is the least active manager in the technical area but Unai Emery exuded the greater nervous energy, breathing in the London night air deeply, as if caught downwind of an offending odour. His distaste was understandable, his Villa team might have been out of sight by the break, only for the razor-sharp counterattackingthat caught out Chelseato fail them. Ollie Watkins was particularly culpable, his seventh goal in 12 matches against favoured opposition coming long after Villa’s fate had been sealed.Time has been relatively kind to Emery’s Emirates Stadium tenure, a job taken on in difficult circumstances. Its termination six years ago has proved the right move for all concerned, particularly Arteta, the coach passed over for his fellow Basque.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres misses a header against Aston Villa.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersThe Arsenal fans who mocked Emery might instead have celebrated a signature win for Arteta against the alchemist taking Villa to heights unseen for decades, who had previously had his successor’s number, Arteta enjoying just two wins from eight. Emery’s blueprint is little secret but has brought him four European trophies. Sit in, do not seek a greater share of possession, spoil if you have to. And in the moments when the match will be decided, it becomes time to go for the throat. Going behind need be no cause for alarm; each of Villa’s five successive away wins had come after falling a goal behind. Falling two behind, then three, then four, was not part of any plan.Martin Ødegaard’s pass for Martín Zubimendi to coolly score the second released endorphins of relief into a crowd suddenly finding a voice for something other than berating the referee, Darren England. Leandro Trossard’s goal celebrations were tempered by an extended video assistant delay. Gabriel Jesus’s fourth was the first this season for the only Premier League winner in the ranks, a reminder of the power at Arteta’s hands.Arteta hails Arsenal for ‘smelling blood’ in emphatic win against Aston VillaRead moreThe restoration of the defensive bedrock of Gabriel Magalhães and William Saliba represented better tidings than pre-match panic greeting news of Declan Rice’s knee injury, the measure cautionary rather than cause for desolation. Rice’s absence meant this was time for other heroes. Arteta’s expansive, expensive squad was designed with such emergencies in mind. The sight of Villa’s collection of rangy midfielders carrying the ball great distances through the spaces where Rice is usually found was a significant feature of a purgatorial first half where Viktor Gyökeres was guilty of two headed misses. He was also guilty of losing possession for a move from which Watkins should have scored far earlier than he eventually managed.The Swede is not alone in struggling with the burden of expectation but Arsenal need so much more from the player bought as the franchise striker; Kai Havertz’s return to the bench may soon enough disrupt the project, as will Jesus’s return.Arsenal’s most heroic moment of the first half came when Saliba’s toe robbed Watkins as he shaped to tap in. His partner’s return got another band back together. “Set piece again,” sang the home fans after Martínez’s flap and the familiar sight of the Brazilian defender bundling home. From there, a deluge of goals and noise to remind Arsenal’s path to glory need not be all trouble and strife. They have it within themselves for success to happen far more serenely.Explore more on these topicsArsenalAston VillaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Yet Ruben Amorim’s side struggled – badly – and while Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire headed those unavailable, the display provokes questions regarding United’s cohesion.In the contest’s closing phase they were potent only sporadically – as throughout. Their opening-half goal was a fortunate one for Joshua Zirkzee, rebounding in off Ladislav Krejci, and after the Czech’s equaliser just before the interval, Wolves might have recorded a first – and famous – victory of the season.Gabriel Magalhães’ opener sparks Arsenal’s second-half rout of Aston VillaRead moreAfter Jhon Arias went close with a late shot saved by Senne Lammens, Rob Edwards’ visitors threatened again, and while Patrick Dorgu thought he snatched an 89th-minute winner he was ruled correctly offside.A draw was far more respectable for Wolves because despite United’s missing personnel any team with hopes of Champions League qualification has to collect all points against opponents surely heading for relegation. The boos at the end echoed those at half-time and informed Amorim precisely how the home fans viewed the evening.He said: “Strange game. We struggled – a lack of creation. We had our chances but the fluidity offensively wasn’t there. When you play Casemiro and [Manuel] Ugarte in the middle you know it is different from when you have Bruno or Kobbie [Mainoo]. We have lack of fluidity and then lack of quality and then we suffer a goal from a set piece. We didn’t use that excuse [players missing]against Newcastle [a 1-0 win]so we won’t use it today.”Amorim did strike a positive note. “I’m really confident we will be a strong team – we need to recover all the players,” the Portuguese said.The latest to be ruled out was Mason Mount, by injury, so Zirkzee replaced him in the right-hand No 10 role. Wolves had the better of the opening period, rolling passes about, pleasing Edwards and infuriating Amorim. So when United claimed possession, Luke Shaw was found and Benjamin Sesko released down the left, a sharp turn and right-foot shot that went close cheered the head coach.The emotion was brief as Wolves again took over. Yerson Mosquera broke easily down the right and teed up Tolu Arokodare. The forward missed his kick, the ball bounced to Hwang Hee-chan, and the Korean blazed high.View image in fullscreenJoshua Zirkzee fires in a shot that deflected into the net to give United the lead.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersUnited required someone to wrest the initiative – precisely what Ayden Heaven did. The centre-back robbed Hwang near Wolves’ left touchline and drove infield. The ball went to Zirkzee and his shot beat José Sá via Krejci.Hardly fantasy stuff and soon United’s brittleness returned. First Heaven lost Arokodare in the area and the Nigerian missed a header. Moments later Lammens saved at point-blank range from Hugo Bueno.Finally, Wolves’ efforts yielded what they deserved. At a Bueno corner from the right the ball flicked off the hapless Zirkzee to the far post and the unmarked Krejci headed home.For the second half Amorim brought on Jack Fletcher, 18, for Zirkzee, precisely a year on from when the Portuguese removed the Dutchman after 33 minutes as United trailed 2-0 here to Newcastle – the game ending in that score. Amorim explained: “We were struggling with their midfielders, and we played with three strikers and sometimes that’s not the best thing to attack well.”His unit had to up the tempo, as when Dorgu thumped the ball right and in it came quickly for an opening Matheus Cunha missed the target with. But could they keep this up?A Casemiro chip to Sesko prised Wolves open and though he was offside this was more encouragement. As was a Diogo Dalot effort – his radar was awry – and a panicky Mosquera header meant as a back-pass for Sá that had the goalkeeper scrambling to clear off the line. Afterwards Edwards said he told Mosquera: “‘You’re mad you are.’ But he has a heart of gold.”Manchester United 1-1 Wolves: Premier League – liveRead moreAs the hour passed Wolves headed for only a third point of a troubled campaign – and possibly more – and United now mixed attack with ­clumsiness as when Shaw felled Mateus Mané.Hwang dipped the free-kick in and though the ball went back out of United’s area, in it came again: Krejci shot, Lammens saved low to his left and Mosquera, following up, could not squeeze the ball in.Edwards said: “The lads are with us but there’s nothing like results to get everyone on board.”Jørgen Strand Larsen, who came on in the 65th-minute, is a target for West Ham. Edwards was asked about the striker’s future. “Only time will tell,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Still, theBournemouthwinger’s missiles were a devastating weapon against a slipshod Chelsea defence. They led to insultingly simple goals for David Brooks and Justin Kluivert during a breathless first half and were enough to plunge Enzo Maresca deeper into trouble after another damaging result for the Italian’s erratic side.There were jeers from the Stamford Bridge crowd when Maresca removed Cole Palmer withChelseachasing a winner during a one-sided second half. There was no chance of the dissenters giving a moment’s thought to the context around Palmer, whose load still needs careful management as he feels his way back from a groin injury. “You don’t know what you’re doing,” was the chant pouring down from the stands and, although Chelsea were the stronger side during the closing stages, there were more boos when this wild game drew to a close.Barry finishes the job for Everton after Garner returns to haunt ailing ForestRead morePositives were in short supply. Chelsea were appalling at the back, conceding six clearcut chances. They have let in four goals from throw-ins this season, leaving them with the worst record in the league, and again counted the cost of failing to press home an advantage. They have now dropped 15 points from winning positions. Bournemouth, winless in 10 games, made Chelsea pay for not pushing on after going 2-1 up through an Enzo Fernández goal in the 23rd minute.It was 2-2 four minutes later, Kluivert equalising when another Semenyo delivery caused havoc. Bournemouth, nine points above the bottom three, dug deep. They were indebted to a fine potential farewell from Semenyo, who looks set tocomplete a £65m move to Manchester City, and ensured that Andoni Iraola could talk up a resilient display.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer shakes hands with Enzo Maresca after being substituted but the manager was jeered for his decision.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“I am very proud,” Bournemouth’s manager said. “It is one point, but we did very good things. We would have taken one point before coming here but looking at how the game developed I am probably not satisfied.”Maresca, his mood hardly lifted by the defending that left his side with one win from their past seven league games, was not well enough to conduct his post-match press conference. “He had a temperature two days ago,” Willy Caballero, Chelsea’s assistant manager, said. “After the game he asked me to replace him [here].”Chelsea will feel even queasier when they remember what comes next: a trip to City without Moisés Caicedo, who will serve a one-game ban after his fifth booking of the season. No wonder the mood is darkening. December has been a bad month for Chelsea and it is hard to see them coping against City without the protection offered by Caicedo in midfield.Opponents are finding it too easy to create chances. Bournemouth had done their homework. Chelsea cowered under the aerial bombardment and were behind when a Semenyo delivery in the sixth minute bounced through to Brooks, who bundled the ball past Robert Sánchez from close range.View image in fullscreenEnzo Fernández shoots to put Chelsea ahead for a second time.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThere was no hiding Chelsea’s kryptonite. Semenyo was at it again in the 27th minute, this time hurling in a missile from the left, James Hill making a nuisance of himself at the near post. Chelsea, who had Malo Gusto filling in for the hamstrung Marc Cucurella at left-back, were all over the place. Trevoh Chalobah lost the initial challenge and Alejandro Garnacho was dozing at the far, allowing Kluivert to steal in for the equaliser.The defending was shambolic at both ends. It was 1-1 when Cole Palmer converted a contentious penalty, awarded after Sam Barrott was sent to the pitchside monitor and deemed Semenyo’s brief tangle of legs with Estêvão Willian enough for a foul, and the hosts led when Garnacho teed up Fernández to whip a wonderful effort beyond Djordje Petrovic.It was a baffling half. Bournemouth, who had hoped that bringing Hill in for Bafodé Diakité would restore order at the back, seemed to decide there was no point sitting back. They flew at Chelsea at every opportunity and saw Sánchez make fine saves from Evanilson and Brooks before half-time.Maresca, having seen enough, brought Reece James on for Josh Acheampong at right-back and punished Garnacho for his part in Kluivert’s goal by replacing him with Pedro Neto. Fourteen shots from Bournemouth, after all, was the most mustered in a first half at Stamford Bridge by any visiting side in thePremier Leaguesince records began in 2003.Bournemouth kept pushing. They appealed in vain for a penalty when Gusto handled a cross at the start of the second half. They almost nicked the points when Enes Unal headed over in added time.Chelsea were short of inspiration. Liam Delap was quiet after being handed a rare start up front. Estêvão was brighter, testing Petrovic from 20 yards, but Bournemouth held firm to leave Maresca on increasingly dodgy ground.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Filmed at Edgbaston in 2016, it shows the blue-sky brothers,Brendon McCullumand Rob Key, back when the world was still young, looking sharp and chiselled, laughing and joshing on the outfield, and nominally discussing how to bat in T20 cricket.And yes, the chemistry, well, the chemistry is overpowering. It almost feels like a romantic intrusion, the viewer cast as gooseberry. This isColdplay kiss-camenergy. This is like watching Bacall and Bogart fall in love on screen. You know how to whistle don’t you, Keysey? You just put your lips together and enter into a transcendent game state.Mainly the clip is a useful basic primer on McCullum’s own anti-philosophy of cricketing success. How, Key asks, does he prepare himself? Well, it’s about getting into a really relaxed state. And after that maintaining the really relaxed state.Five things England must do to make it two Ashes Test wins in a row in SydneyRead moreThere is technical stuff. “I try to hit it over there, sometimes over there, sometimes over there.” He has fast hands. What’s the deal with fast hands? “I don’t really know.” How about the pull shot? What’s that all about? “I think I … I don’t even know how I play it … I think it’s more of a … swivel.”It is no great revelation that a McCullum masterclass should have no deep intellectual content, that it’s a bit like watching your dad explain how to make a cup of tea. This is why it’s a good video. McCullum was for a while the No 1-ranked T20 player in the world. And this is what Key is bringing out, the beauty of high talent meets mental clarity.A random bloke telling you he just whacks it is meaningless. The hammer of the Indian Premier League doing this is interesting, as it is when McCullum says his method is transferable because “in Test cricket I never really had a defensive game that was going to sustain against quality bowling”. Sound familiar, as a method? This is insight, the power of knowing both your strengths and your limits.Still though. And throwing forward, would you ask this same masterclasser to plan, coach, and detail-manage an Ashes tour? And not just ask, but insist, becauseMcCullum didn’t actually apply for the jobin the first place.When that fails in a fug of slack planning, would you then ask the same person to try again? To change and to learn, when the pare-it-back life is his entire methodology?By now McCullum has long since begun to feel like a corporate motivational speaking event that got out of hand. The morning routine guy. The how to fold your T-shirts guy. The one-simple-trick guy. He can be good and valuable. But there’s no need to ask him to run the entire global corporate accounting practice.This is also why McCullum must now be held to account under normal rules of success and failure, whatever the endgame to this zombified tour, starting with Sydney this weekend.There is an argument that this is a match both Australia and England might be better served, structurally, by losing. Australia to speed the process of rebuilding an ageing team, England to focus minds on the live content of this series.The talk already is that a 3-2 scoreline would make it very hard to change coach or managing director. Winning two Tests in Australia, after failing to win any of the previous 18. This is a real thing. It is at least a convincing cover for a fudge, given that sacking people costs money and effort and is no guarantee of an uptick.View image in fullscreenThe England captain, Ben Stokes, will provide his own tour review and an impartial account could leave Brendon McCullum in trouble.Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPAIt would also be a mistake to get distracted by what happens on the way out. Nothing has changed. The job for McCullum and Key was to oversee the environment, to prep the details. You don’t reward a failure of planning because the players were good enough to claw it back once that part had gone.It will be hard to maintain this clarity should England avoid defeat in Sydney. There are so many distractions already. Even the Australian reaction tolosing at its great secular cathedral of sport, its temple of chino shorts, has been misleadingly overblown.The MCG groundsman has been tried on the courthouse steps.Greg Chappell has written an articleabout the death of warrior culture, about dishonour and disgrace, about crack-ball barbarians at the gates. This is all distractingly feelgood for English cricket. Maybe, in the end, the real Bazball was the Australians we annoyed along the way.Don’t be misled, either, by the fact that Melbourne was actually a good win, irrespective of thepitch furore. Don’t be distracted by the approach of a T20 World Cup, which, like London vape shops, tend to pop up in twos and threes every hundred yards or so.Don’t be distracted, above all, by the fact that changing the coach will not solve the chronic structural problems of English cricket, its alienation, its invisibility, its elitism. In fact, this last bit is the whole point here. The appointment of convincing amateurs to the highest roles. The tolerance of slackness, jobs for the boys, PR-ing your own shortcuts. This is a huge amount of all that is wrong with the sport.This is why there has to be accountability. What precedent does it set, what message does it send – other than, perhaps, an accurate one – if it turns out you can get away with not having proper warm-up games, not having a fielding coach, not having a pink-ball practice game for players who have yet to see a pink ball? Not to mention every other fine detail, right down to the reverse-cinderella-ing of Shoaib Bashir, replaced after all thatby Will Jacks, a golf-bro utility man. If none of that matters, then nothing really matters.View image in fullscreenWill Jacks was preferred to Shoaib Bashir by the selectors.Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAPEven before Sydney there has been some revisionism. There has been talk that it was OK not to have practice games, because England didn’t have practice games before and won the first Test of those tours. But this is more squint-past-the-detail stuff. It overlooks the fact those other opponents also didn’t have much prep, whereas Australia were cocked and ready. It overlooks the basic point that because you got away with not revising for one exam doesn’t mean you should never revise for any exams.The argument for retaining the current regime is that England can learn from this, that McCullum can add a grasp of detail to his inspirationalism. Paring it back, stripping it away: this has been his super-strength. What would Baz with data briefings actually look like? The talkfrom Ben Stokes of weak men, the mid-series tough love, felt like an emergency attempt to drip some substance into the slack areas behind these baggy first principles. And Stokes is the key now.The captain will be asked to give his own tour review. A clear, impartial account could well leave McCullum dangling by a thread, and Key required to own up to a lack of oversight. If Stokes feels those above him can learn from this the current regime might hang on.Sydney is an opportunity to win again. But it shouldn’t be permitted to cloud these facts. Or the need, above all, to feel like there are consequences, jeopardy, a forensic eye on performance; that this is above all a sport that still matters.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamBrendon McCullumThe AshesAustralia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Joshua remains in hospital in Lagos, where he was described by his management team as being in a stable condition.Fury, who had been expected to come out of retirement to fight Joshua next year, posted a tribute to Ghami and Ayodele on social media yesterday, writing: “This is so sad. May God give them a good bed in heaven.”Anthony Joshua’s camp confirm two of his close friends died in Nigeria car crashRead moreUsyk, the WBA, WBC and IBF heavyweight champion, spoke of “an unbelievable loss” on social media, describing Ghami and Ayodele as “two incredible people who were not only a part of AJ’s team, but also friends!” Usyk passed his “sincere condolences to their families, loved ones and everyone who knew them” and wrote to Joshua: “Stay strong, champion.”Joshua, born in Watford to Nigerian parents, had worked with Ayodele and Ghami since the beginning of his career. The crash took place on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway near Makun on Monday morning and, just hours before, Joshua and Ayodele posted footage on Instagram of them playing table tennis together.Jake Paul, wholost to Joshua in a fightwatched by 33 million people two weeks ago, also offered his condolences. “Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ, and anyone impacted by today’s unfortunate accident,” he wrote.Joshua is being treated at the Duchess international hospital in Lagos, where the president of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said he had visited the fighter and his mother, who has been at his bedside. “I have spoken with AJ to personally convey my condolences over the passing of his two close associates, Kevin Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami, in the recent accident,” Tinubu said in a statement. “I wished him a full and speedy recovery, and prayed with him. AJ assured me he is receiving the best possible care. I also spoke with his mother and prayed for her.”According to the government of Ogun state, where the crash took place, Joshua did not need any emergency medical intervention at the scene, despite unverified footage seeming to show him grimacing in pain as he was removed from what appeared to be the wreckage. Ogun officials did say, however, that Joshua had “narrowly escaped death”.The federal road safety corps (FRSC) in Nigeria posted several pictures of the crash scene on X on Monday, revealing preliminary findings that suggested the Lexus “was suspected to be travelling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit”. The FRSC added the car lost control during “an overtaking manoeuvre” and crashed into a stationary truck by the side of the road.Police commander Babatunde Akinbiyi of Nigeria’s traffic compliance and enforcement agency said early investigations showed the Lexus had been travelling along the highway from Lagos to Sagamu when it “experienced a tyre burst due to excessive speed” and lost control.Explore more on these topicsAnthony JoshuaBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

It shows there’s still a real love, not just for my dad, but for all the loved ones who didn’t get to see this.”View image in fullscreen‘We had no idea it was going to be us.’Photograph: Justin Setterfield/The FA/Getty ImagesAnd the year’s best commentary moment54 big seconds from the 98th minuteatHampden Park.Explore more on these topicsSportFootball politicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the fleeting moments, wild celebrations and creative compositions that caught our eyes – accompanied by explanations and technical info from the photographers themselves.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly celebrates by Florencia Tan Jun (1/200th sec, f/2.8, ISO 2500)“As a photographer, a penalty shootout in a final feels completely different from a penalty during regular play. I get nervous, especially because the players’ reactions and celebrations are so much more intense, and I still have to make split-second decisions when everything happens at once. After Chloe Kelly scored the deciding penalty for England at Euro 2025, I could see that she was going to celebrate in the opposite direction from me, so I started to focus on the reactions happening nearer to me. Suddenly I saw her cross over, so I immediately changed focus and caught her celebrating with her teammates behind her. I like this photo because it captures the purest, most unpremeditated and historic reaction in women’s football. It shows happiness at 100km/h.”View image in fullscreenSteeplechase fall by Emilee Chinn(400mm, 1/3200 sec, f/2.8, ISO 2000)“In this frame, steeplechaser Geordie Beamish is shown going down after getting caught in the congestion of the early laps. Along with capturing the split second of another runner’s foot connecting with his face, what makes this image so powerful and moving to me is that he got up, placed second in his heat, and went on to take the gold medal. Moments like this are what make sports photography so rewarding and they remind us how resilience can turn a setback into something remarkable.”View image in fullscreenAshes misery by Robbie Stephenson (600mm, 1/3200th sec, f/4, ISO 600)“From an artistic point of view, I like the irony in this image. The Toyota advert [seen behind Ben Stokes] is shown on the sight screens after every wicket, so there have been many opportunities to capture player reactions in front of it. However, here it’s a fitting way to narrate Stokes’ deflated body language and it reflects the general mood in the England camp. Capturing the sign in the background was fortuitous – I was hoping to get England players celebrating after taking wickets, when it flashed up unexpectedly on a different advertising board.”View image in fullscreenSuperhuman byDean Moutharopoulos (24mm, 1/400th sec, f/1.4, ISO 1250)“Although he’s not in action, this image of javelin thrower Guillermo Varona displays his strength, focus and determination. From a distance I had noticed his warm-up preparation – leaping and clicking his heels prior to his throw – and I knew I had to capture it. Using a wide angle lens to show the stadium, I lay down against the fence, doing my best not to disturb him, and waited for his jump. After his throw, I looked at the shot [and saw] the bright red of his uniform against the black sky, the silhouette of his floating body and the javelin gripped tightly in one hand – I knew straight away I had one of my favourite photos of the year.”View image in fullscreenFormula One by Jakub Porzycki (15-35mm, 1/10th sec, f/22, ISO 100)“When I photograph a Formula One race, I try to use the time between the ‘must have’ photos – the start of the race and the podium ceremony at the end – to look for more creative frames. At Imola, I had already visited the Ayrton Senna memorial and saw it filled with national flags, flowers and mementos. I noticed the passing cars were slightly visible between these objects, so I decided to use this colourful surrounding to frame a long exposure. Freezing the motion of a fast-moving car with a slow shutter speed isn’t easy (you must pan the camera at exactly the right speed), so I took many photos and chose the best. This photo shows Lando Norris, who later became the new F1 world champion.”View image in fullscreenTrafalgar Square by Lee Smith (16mm, 1/4000th sec, f/4, ISO400)“As a Sunderland fan born and raised, this image was a labour of love. I’d travelled down to London the day before the Championship play-off final, specifically to cover the traditional ‘pilgrimage’ to Trafalgar Square by Mackems when their team plays at Wembley. Huge numbers were in attendance. It was a peaceful, good-humoured, mass celebration that lasted long into the evening. This photograph was taken as the sun was going down behind the National Gallery. Sunderland fans were playing head-tennis in the fountains and splashing water. Many held aloft red smoke flares, adding ambiance, dramatic light and colour all around the iconic landmark. The scenes that day will last with me for a lifetime. What made it even more special is that we won the playoff final the following day.”View image in fullscreenHigh diving by Marko Djurica (16mm, 1/1600th sec, f/22, ISO 800)“This photo was taken at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore during the men’s high-dive competition. It shows Switzerland’s Jean-David Duval plunging from the 27m platform into a small circular pool below. The pool measures just six metres deep and 17 metres across – dimensions that feel even more intimidating when viewed from the top of the platform. For the first time, Reuters was granted a photo position inside the pool and I had the opportunity to shoot from there. Positioned on the very edge for safety, I spent nearly four hours in the water wearing a wetsuit and fins, holding an underwater housing containing a Canon R3 camera with a 16mm lens. Some water splashed over the camera’s glass dome as I lowered it into pool to capture a half-and-half shot of Duval’s dive. The effect was unplanned and it’s one I doubt I could replicate in the same way.”View image in fullscreenRed Rose by Ryan Pierse (double exposure)“This image of the England superstar Ellie Kildunne is the result of an in-camera sequential multiple exposure. First, I took a single picture of the iconic Red Rose logo. The very next frame – without being able to see the previous image of the rose – I had to capture an image of Ellie as centrally as possible to line up with the rose. The camera then blends the two exposures together. This technique can be low percentage on hit-rate, but when it all comes together you can produce a very striking image.”View image in fullscreenSilhouetted surfer by Adam Pretty (200m,1/320th sec, f/4, ISO 100)“I took this picture – early in the morning before the sun was up – at the relatively new Surftown wave pool in Munich. Six elite French Polynesian surfers were holding private training sessions to practise specific manoeuvres and aerials on the perfectly consistent man-made wave. Aelan Vaast was performing a layback hack on the final section of the wave. I used a flash to create this silhouette of her against the bright blue water of the pool and to capture the spray she was throwing with her massive turn.”View image in fullscreenMuddy cyclist by Billy Ceusters (300mm, 1/1600th sec, f/2.8, ISO1600)“Dendermonde is one of those races where, when there’s mud, there’s mud. It’s really in the middle of the fields and getting around on the course is very difficult. I was at the finish line waiting for Wout van Aert to cross when I captured this image. He is covered in dirt, exhausted but also happy with his victory. It’s a photo that represents all the values that I love in this sport: suffering, self-sacrifice and achieving your goals.”View image in fullscreenRyder Cup delight by Maddie Meyer (15mm,1/2000 sec, f/2.8, ISO 1000)“In professional sports there is often such a distance between fans and athletes. It can feel sterile and, as a photographer, it can be hard to bring them into one frame. Here, Rory ran to the adoring Europe fans after his team defeated the United States in the Ryder Cup in New York. He appeared to fully give in to the moment, allowing the fans to embrace him over the barricade. It can be challenging to make a well-composed image in a chaotic scene, but I like this picture and think it tells the story of Europe’s triumph on away territory.”View image in fullscreenSmoke bomb by Thibaud Moritz (35mm, 1/400th sec, f/3.5, ISO 3200)“I like this picture because there’s something raw and almost graphic about it. I shot it at the Parc des Princes in Paris, where PSG had set up giant screens on the pitch to broadcast their Champions League final against Inter. The atmosphere was electric throughout the night. I positioned myself at the foot of the ultras’ stand, which is usually the most visually expressive. This photo was taken at the moment of PSG’s second goal, when the stand erupted. Black smoke flares are extremely rare in a football stadium. Unlike red flares, which still reveal silhouettes, black smoke swallows everything very quickly. I chose to focus on the intensity of a few supporters celebrating the goal, but the presence of a supporter lifting a scarf with the PSG logo added clarity and context to the scene.”View image in fullscreenBlurry badminton by Shi Tang (85mm,1/5th sec, f/6.3, ISO 50)“This images captures badminton player Tomoka Miyazaki in mid-motion. She is rendered with a long-exposure effect which transforms her movement into flowing streaks of red light. The blurred trails emphasise the power and fluidity of the action, while the sharpness of her focused expression adds contrast and intensity. Set against a dark background, the vibrant colours and sweeping motion create an almost abstract, dance-like composition.”View image in fullscreenBike flip by Hannah Peters (99mm, 1/3200th sec, f/22, ISO 640)“I’d been looking forward to the Crankworx slope-style event because it often makes good pictures, but I was disappointed when I set off early that morning to see clouds and no light. The sun suddenly broke through for about five minutes and only two riders made their runs. It was a bit of good fortune that Tim Bringer managed to pull off a pretty awesome trick just in time.”View image in fullscreenSlam dunk by Fernando Medina (60mm, 1/250th sec, f/6.3, ISO 160, with a strobe)“In today’s NBA, there are so many athletically talented players that can jump out of the building, you always have to be ready for an opportunity like this. NBA team photographers like myself shoot with strobes located high on the catwalk above the court, and they take two to three seconds to recharge, so we can’t shoot a burst and then pick out the best photo. You have to wait for that one moment to take the photo. Here, I was fortunate to press the button at the right time! I love taking great shots, but, not so much when it’s at the Orlando Magic’s expense. I’ve been with the team for 37 years, since their inception, so I’m a bit of a fan of these guys. To have my photo chosen by fans as their favourite of the season is an amazing honour.”View image in fullscreenTrump celebration by Carl Recine (400mm, 1/2500th, ISO 200)“I’ve been lucky enough to photograph plenty of trophy presentations, but I don’t think I’ll ever top this one. Normally they’re formulaic and you know exactly what’s coming. But when you throw President Trump into the mix, you’ve got to expect the unexpected. Chelsea had just been crowned Club World Cup champions and President Trump was supposed to step off the stage after handing the trophy to their captain, Reece James. Instead, he planted himself next to James, standing proudly, dead centre of the Chelsea team group as though he’d been playing in the final. A few seconds of confusion followed; James and Fifa president Gianni Infantino were gesturing for Trump to move along. Then the light hit Trump and the trophy perfectly, creating one of those moments where news and sport collide in one image.”View image in fullscreenArtistic swimming blur by Hollie Adams (600mm, 1/200th sec, f/4, ISO 4000)“This photo captures Iris Tió during the artistic swimming team free final at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore as she is lifted out of the water by one of her teammates during a routine. I really enjoyed covering artistic swimming because it’s fast and there are lots of opportunities to capture interesting compositions or facial expressions. The background was very messy, so I spent most of my time shooting while lying on the ground on the side of the pool.”View image in fullscreenAlcaraz composite by Rachel Bach (70-200mm, 1/5000th sec, f/4, ISO 640)“I created this composite of Carlos Alcaraz by taking more than 1,500 images from one spot inside the roof of Rod Laver Arena. After shooting, I selected frames where Alcaraz could be seen in different positions around the court and stitched them together. Ordinarily when I’m creating a composite, I have my camera fixed in the same position and I use triggers to fire the shutter remotely. But in this case, I wasn’t allowed to do that, so I was capturing it all handheld. This meant standing as still as possible – and it meant a bit more post-production to line everything up. Alcaraz is known for being able to cover the court, so I knew a composite would showcase this. And I like how you can discover different things when you look at this composite, depending on where you focus.”View image in fullscreenGoalline desperation by Hannah McKay (35mm, 1/1000th sec, f/4, ISO 5000)“You have to place your remote cameras behind the goal net, so normally you’ll see the net in front of the players, but in 2024 I bought a new Sony RX02 camera that’s really small – it’s the size of a GoPro – and it gives the impression that it’s placed inside the net. I’d been using it for several months without having any luck and I was starting to get very frustrated with it, so I was pleasantly surprised when I got this picture of Gabriel Martinelli scoring for Arsenal and Emi Martínez lying on the floor. The Villa keeper is so close the camera, it gives it more impact. It did really well when I posted it on Instagram. I think people liked it because it was a new angle and a dramatic moment. Plus, I think remote pictures usually look better at night with the lights and the colours.”View image in fullscreenPara swimming blur by Ian MacNicol (1/2000th sec, f/4)“Guo Jincheng is an S5 class para swimmer who lost both arms in an electrocution accident aged six. I first encountered him when he represented China at the 2024 Paralympics, where he was one of the standout athletes. He swims like a dolphin – with no swimming cap and no goggles – and hits the end of the pool with the crown of his head like a torpedo, destroying the field in the process.”View image in fullscreenIce hockey by Steph Cahmbers (150mm, 1/8th sec, f/11, ISO 800)“When the Seattle Kraken take to the ice during a pre-game light show, the swirling spotlights last about a minute. Using a slow shutter speed, the colours from the tunnel paired with the players’ profiles in silhouette, creates a unique image that’s only possible from my photo position’s shooting hole. It’s hit or miss, so I like to challenge myself before each game.”View image in fullscreenKnee slide by Morgan Harlow (35mm, 1/250th sec, f/1.8, ISO 10,000)“Following the final whistle of the Women’s Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada, I was given exclusive access to enter the changing rooms to capture any celebrations. Captain Zoe Aldcroft ran in with the trophy and champagne started to fly everywhere. Players were intentionally spraying the floor and I sensed what was about to happen: I saw Hannah Botterman getting ready to make a celebratory knee slide. She actually performed three slides in total, but I wasn’t happy with my original positioning amid such a crowded changing room, so I quickly moved to be directly in front of her for the final slide. I knew this was going to be the pivotal moment to capture. To be given access to document such a moment was a great and unforgettable experience.”View image in fullscreenDizzypole vault by Alex Plavevski (32mm, 1/2500th sec, f/4, ISO 4000)“We all knew that Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis would attempt to break the world record at the world championships in Tokyo, so I wanted to create something different, to set this photo apart from the usual angles that we capture during a pole vault competition. The floodlights behind him looked like stars and it was as if he was trying to reach them. Then I recalled the old star filter that I had been carrying around in my camera bag for years without using. It makes floodlights appear more starry. I decided to give it a try, and when I checked the results on my camera screen, it looked just as I had hoped.”View image in fullscreenTennis triangle by Julian Finney(200mm, 1/1000th, f/3.2, ISO 100)“The Madrid Open is a unique tournament where the three main courts are inside the Caja Mágica, or ‘Magic Box’. The roof moves according to sunlight and creates hard shadows across the court at certain times of the day. I discovered an area that I could shoot behind to add an extra shadow and I thought to myself: ‘I could compose the player inside a triangle shape.’ Then it was a matter of waiting for the action to happen in area of the court where the player was in silhouette. I find it very rewarding to discover a new style of image, which other photographers will attempt to copy year-over-year.”View image in fullscreenMo Salah by Carl Recine (24mm, 1/6400th, ISO 3200)“Once the final whistle blew and Liverpool realised they had clinched their 20th league title, Anfield erupted in relief and celebration. Players streamed toward the Kop, hugging teammates, staff and ball boys. I kept my eye on Mo Salah because he was Liverpool’s talisman and it had been his season. After a few minutes of chaotic celebration, he headed for the fans, grabbed a phone and recreated a celebration which he’d performed earlier in the match after scoring. I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time, but my camera settings had been knocked and I only had time to adjust the shutter speed, so I was pretty close to not getting this shot. The moment lasted no more than two seconds, but Salah’s smile and the pure emotion of the fans behind him on the Kop evoked the connection between player and supporter. It was my favourite picture of the season.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayAthleticsRugby unionGolfSurfingBadmintonCyclingShareReuse this content"

At this time of year, the average sea temperature around the UK and Ireland is 6C to 10C.The warning follows the disappearance of Matthew Upham, 63, and another man during aChristmas Day swimin the Devon seaside town of Budleigh Salterton.A number of people were safely brought to shore, but Upham and the other man, in his 40s, could not be found. Of the people rescued, two were looked over by paramedics and one was taken to hospital as a precaution.Gareth Morrison, the head of water safety for the RNLI, said on Tuesday: “We know this time of year many people take part in festive and new year dips or continue to take part in regular winter swims.”He said swimmers should be aware of their abilities and carefully assess sea conditions before entering the water. First-time swimmers should consult their GP before attempting to swim in open water.“With the sea temperatures still dropping and reaching their coldest around March, the effects of cold water, combined with weather conditions and any personal health issues, should be taken seriously before venturing in,” Morrison said.“Avoid swimming alone; consider going with others or joining a group so you can look out for each other. We’d recommend wearing a wetsuit to keep you warm and increase your buoyancy, together with a bright swim cap and tow float to make yourself visible to others and use in an emergency.”Morrison said people who spot a swimmer in difficulty should call emergency services rather than enter the water themselves.Upham and the second man, who has not been publicly named, were reported to have gone missing after going into the water to try to help a woman in difficulty.“The most important thing to remember is if you are in any doubt stay out of the water and if you or anyone else does get into trouble in or on the water, please call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard,” he said.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUK weatherSwimmingEmergency servicesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the prime minister has since condemned the tweets and said he was unaware of them.Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, has alsolaunched a reviewlooking into “serious information failures” around the case, aftersuccessive Tory and Labour governmentshad lobbied for Abd el-Fattah’s release as a political prisoner.The activist, who was granted British citizenship while in prison in 2021 through his mother’s birth in the UK, hasapologised “unequivocally”for his posts after opposition parties called for him to be deported and his citizenship revoked.Human rights campaigners have reacted with anger to the suggestion, saying citizenship stripping as a punishment for social media posts would be an “extremely authoritarian step”.On Tuesday the activist faced fresh criticism from the Conservatives after his official Facebook account appeared recently to have liked a social media post suggesting “Zionists against Alaa Abd el-Fattah” were behind a “campaign” against him.The Home Office has not officially commented but government sources said the legal bar for revoking citizenship had not been met and the evidential case in relation to Abd el-Fattah had not changed for 12 years, during which he was granted citizenship.Abd el-Fattah citizenship row shows shift on questions of national identityRead moreShabana Mahmood, the home secretary, is unlikely to remove someone’s British citizenship unless they obtained it by fraud or are considered a terrorist, extremist or involved with serious organised crime. The decision comes with a right of appeal, as inthe case of Shamima Begum, whounsuccessfully appealedagainst the decision by the former home secretary Sajid Javid’s decision to revoke her citizenship in 2019.Government sources said the bar on removing citizenship was set high to provide the necessary safeguards.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah, seen here speaking at his trial in Cairo in November 2014 on charges of breaking a law against protests, spent more than a decade in detention in Egypt.Photograph: Al Youm Al Saabi/ReutersSome human rights experts and campaigners have warned that allowing politicians to deprive someone of their citizenship for any reason is a slippery slope.Chris Doyle of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, who supported Abd el-Fattah’s release, said the tweets were “appalling” but the context was that Egyptian social media was a “very angry place” at the time and it should be understood that Abd el-Fattah was not an Islamist.Doyle added: “Politicians calling for the stripping of people’s citizenship on a bandwagon is not a path to go down. Citizenship is a right and any grounds for removing citizenship should be if there has been an improper part of the process.”David Davis, the Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, said he was not necessarily opposed to the idea of Abd el-Fattah losing citizenship but politicians should not have that power. “We do give out citizenship too easily … and on the other hand you have spectacularly bad staff work. This problem starts with the inappropriate award of citizenship,” he said.“That being said, it should not be in the gift of politicians whether in government or opposition to determine someone’s citizenship. That is an almost vertical slippery slope. At what point do you decide to withdraw citizenship from your political opponents or someone who is politically uncomfortable for you?“I don’t think it’s necessarily the case he should not have his citizenship withdrawn but it should be a judicial or quasi-judicial procedure. These things should automatically go to court. It should not be a political decision.”Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s migrant rights director, said: “Stripping anyone of their citizenship, even for hateful comments, is not a legitimate penalty and it is deeply disturbing that anyone – particularly those in or seeking positions of leadership – should have so little regard for our shared nationality that they so quickly call for such draconian action.“Stripping someone of their citizenship because of what they may say or tweet would be an extremely authoritarian step.”Downing Street has defended its campaign for the release of Abd el-Fattah and its decision towelcome him to the UKdespite his “abhorrent” tweets a decade ago.The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Monday: “We welcome the return of a British citizen unfairly detained abroad, as we would in all cases and as we have done in the past. That is central to Britain’s commitment to religious and political freedom. It doesn’t change the fact that we have condemned the nature of these historic tweets and we consider them to be abhorrent.”In one resurfaced tweet from 2010, Abd el-Fattah said he considered “killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them”. In 2012 he posted: “I am a racist, I don’t like white people.” He is also accused of saying police did not have rights and “we should kill them all”, and referring to British people as “dogs and monkeys”.Downing Street said Starmer had not been aware of the past tweets until after Abd el-Fattah had entered the UK. The development raises questions about what vetting took place before Abd el-Fattah was granted UK citizenship in 2021, and what research the government carried out before it took up his case with the Egyptian authorities. Successive prime ministers, including Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, had campaigned for Abd el-Fattah’s release.The Conservatives and Reform UK have both suggested the activist should be deported from the UK for the posts and have his British citizenship revoked, even though the law does not appear to provide grounds for either action. Nigel Farage has promoted a petition for people to sign in favour of deporting Abd el-Fattah to Egypt.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeEgyptSocial mediaLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The unusual choice of venue for the ceremony, Mamdani said, is symbolically resonant of the “inauguration of a new era”.“It was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working peoples’ lives,” Mamdani said in a statement.“That ambition need not be a memory confined only to our past, nor must it be isolated only to the tunnels beneath city hall: it will be the purpose of the administration fortunate enough to serve New Yorkers from the building above.”He added that he was “humbled by the opportunity to lead millions of New Yorkers into a new era of opportunity, and honored to carry forward our city’s legacy of greatness”.View image in fullscreenThe abandoned city hall subway station.Photograph: Michael Freeman/AlamyThe station was first opened in 1904 as one of the city’s 28 original stations and was decommissioned in 1945 as the system was modernized. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1979 and put on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.The New York attorney general, Letitia James, has been selected to administer Mamdani’s oath of office, with a follow-up ceremony on the steps of city hall later on Wednesday, where he will be sworn in by the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, followed by a block party up Broadway.The choice of a subway station, James said, was appropriate because the transit system is the “great equalizer” of New Yorkers.“For all of our strengths and weaknesses as individuals, we ride together on the train, to places far and wide,” James added. “Zohran is our next mayor because he understands how important it is that New Yorkers living side by side all deserve a city that we can thrive in, no matter what subway line you use.”But only one previous New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, a progressive Democrat, has confirmed his attendance, with former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani not publicly confirming if they will show up. Outgoing centrist Democrat mayor Eric Adams has left his attendance open to question.At a press conference on Monday, Adams said he wanted to discuss it with Mamdani to make sure he doesn’t “disrupt his day”.“That’s a very important, historical day, and it’s unfortunate that there’s a body of some of his supporters, some of them, who rather protest everything,” Adams said in an apparent swipe at Mamdani boosters. “If he’s cool, I’m cool,” Adams said. Mamdani said his predecessor is “still welcome to my inauguration”.Ahead of Mamdani’s swearing-in, tech billionaire Elon Musk hit out at his choice to lead the city’s fire department.“Proven experience matters when lives are at stake,” Muskwrote in a post on the social platform Xafter Mamdani appointed Lillian Bonsignore, 56, an openly gay veteran emergency medical services (EMS) leader, to lead the FDNY.Mamdani wrote in apostreplying to Musk: “Experience does matter, which is why I appointed the person who spent more than 30 years at EMS. You know, the workforce that addresses at least 70% of all calls coming into FDNY?”Last week, Adams appointed Mark Guerra, the first deputy commissioner with 37 years experience on the fire department, to serve as fire chief for the remaining days of his mayoralty. “Lillian’s light is one that can’t be dimmed by anything else that takes place,” Mamdani said, reported Fox 5. “The mayor is free to continue to be the mayor until the end of this year and make decisions as such.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkDemocratsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At Folkestone in Kent, tailbacks formed as drivers hoping to catch the shuttle faced seven-hour delays.By Tuesday evening, engineers were still struggling to restore full service, with the Channel tunnel operator, Getlink, saying trains were running on only one of the tunnel’s two tracks, travelling in alternate directions.The technical glitch began on Monday night, according to Getlink, with “an incident related to the power supply to trains”.In statements on Tuesday morning, Eurostar indicated the outage led to the failure of a train operated by LeShuttle, which carries cars and freight vehicles through the tunnel. It said the train was eventually moved out of the tunnel.At St Pancras, Jack Slater and his girlfriend were left with no choice but to cancel a new year’s trip to Paris, a treat they had been planning since the summer.“We’re being advised to rebook for tomorrow, but all of the trains are fully booked already so the only option would be to upgrade to a first class seat – which is an extra lot of money,” he said.View image in fullscreenEurostar passengers wait for train services to resume at St Pancras.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAMatt Orien had come from Seattle in the US with his family, hoping to make it to Paris after spending a few days in London. “This is disappointing, but we have a friend who is helping us out with admin so we’ll hopefully have a way to get there,” he said. “We’re doing OK and we’ll find a way to have fun … we feel sorry for the people that are stuck in the train, in the tunnel.”Betty Ndukaeze, travelling in a family group, was hoping to reach Paris to celebrate. The journey started with a delay, with their 7.01am train leaving an hour late, before coming to a halt. After a long wait, they were sent back to St Pancras, she told the BBC.“It was chaos from the moment we got here,” said Ndukaeze. “They kept announcing there was a problem with the train ahead of us and saying they were trying to fix the problem.“We just got back here. The journey back from where we were stuck was only 20 minutes.”As of Tuesday afternoon, Eurostar said it would resume services to and from London at about 6pm, but it “strongly” advised passengers to postpone their journeys.Live service updatesshowed all departures for Paris on 30 December as cancelled, other than two trains at 18.01 and 19.01. In the other direction, only the 18.12 and 19.12 trains were listed as scheduled to depart for London.View image in fullscreenTravellers stranded at Gare du Nord station in Paris.Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP“As the overhead power supply issues in the Channel tunnel still remain, only one line is available to run trains on,” the operator said. “This means there will continue to be delays and longer journey times than usual this evening. Therefore we continue to advise our customers to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available.“We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have already been cancelled.”A driver’s photograph shared withthe BBCshowed overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks.Eurostar, which carries foot passengers, and LeShuttle, which carries vehicles and is owned by Getlink, share the tunnel’s two tracks, which normally run only in one direction.Between them, the services transport thousands of passengers a day over the Christmas period.In an update sent out at 3pm on Tuesday, Getlink said the shuttle service had “resumed very gradually on one track shortly before 3pm CET [2pm UK time]” and that trains were running “alternately in both directions with significant delays”.Additional shuttles would be added from Tuesday evening until Wednesday morning, while waiting times would be adjusted throughout the day, it said. Live updates for the shuttle warned passengers: “Delay of approximately six hours to booked time, please check in as planned.”At Folkestone, the terminus for the shuttle, drivers trapped in lines of cars waiting to board shared their frustration on social media. “About to board our 08.25 departure, due out at 15.05!!!” said Spike on X, suggesting some vehicles faced a seven-hour delay.Kate from Woking said drivers at Folkestone were given food vouchers, playing cards and crisps. “Staff at the terminal were doing their best but they couldn’t promise much.”Stephanie Roberts, from Ashford, was returning home after a two-week holiday in Le Touquet, with her husband, Simon and their 18-month-old French bulldog, Dempsey.View image in fullscreenCars stuck in lines of traffic waiting to board a LeShuttle service from Folkestone to Calais.Photograph: Dean Pallant“We began queueing in Calais in the Eurotunnel at 10.30am French time,” she said. “In the end, we were waiting for more than five hours before we were able to board a train.“There was no food or water, but luckily we had brought a baguette with us, so we were able to munch on that. We bought a small bottle of water from a vending machine for €3 for Dempsey.The price is not the issue, it’s the principle.”Some UK drivers with later trains said they had diverted to Dover to take the ferry instead.The Port of Dover urged stranded drivers to consider switching to travel by sea, saying operators running between Dover and Calais had capacity for extra passengers.The east coast mainline train company LNER responded by offering passengers a free ride home. It said that “any customers who have had to abandon their journey in London King’s Cross are able to return to their home station on the next available LNER service at no additional cost”.LNER customers who choose to defer their Eurostar travel to a different day may use their existing LNER ticket to travel on that same day, it added.Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: “Those who have had their train cancelled have the option to exchange their booking or claim a refund or Eurostar e-voucher. For delays, travellers are entitled to compensation.“If you are delayed overnight, you have the right to be put up in a hotel or be reimbursed for one,.”Eurostar said customers could exchange their unused ticket for another date in the same travel class, receive a refund, or an e-voucher valid for 12 months. Stranded passengers can also claim hotel accommodation of up to £150 per room, along with £50 for taxi costs and £35 for food and drink expenses.Explore more on these topicsEurostarRail industryRail transportTransportEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Soon after, drummer and vibraphonist Chuck Redd cancelled a Christmas Eve gig.Richard Grenell, the Kennedy Center president, a Trump appointee, threatened to sue Redd for $1m in damages for what he called a “political stunt”.“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment – explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure – is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” Grenell said in the letter,which was obtained by the Washington Post.The latest jazz cancellation comes after folk singer Kristy Lee announced she had cancelled a concert at the center scheduled for next month. Leesaid on social mediathat “when American history starts getting treated like something you can ban, erase, rename, or rebrand for somebody else’s ego, I can’t stand on that stage and sleep right at night”.A dance company, Doug Varone and Dancers, has said that it is pulling out of a two performances scheduled for April. The companysaidon social media that after “the latest act of Donald J Trump renaming the Center after himself, we can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution”.Grenell responded to the string of cancellations, saying: “The arts are for everyone and the left is mad about it.”He saidon social mediathat the acts cancelling shows had been booked by “the previous far left leadership”.“Their actions prove that the previous team was more concerned about booking far left political activists rather than artists willing to perform for everyone regardless of their political beliefs,” he said. “Boycotting the Arts to show you support the Arts is a form of derangement syndrome.”The Cookers apologized to their audience, saying “we understand and share your sadness” and remained “committed to playing music that reaches across divisions rather than deepening them”.Band member Billy Harper, a saxophone player, went further in comments to a Facebook group,Jazz Stage, saying he “would never even consider performing in a venue bearing a name (and being controlled by the kind of board) that represents overt racism and deliberate destruction of African American music and culture”.The Cookers are a band of primarily African-American musicians and their statement about “jazz was born from struggle” signals historical context. Washington DC is a once majority-Black city that has been long known as a center of Black arts and culture, historically earning the nickname “Chocolate City” – a title later celebrated ina song by Parliament-Funkadelic– as well the birthplace of Duke Ellington, Marvin Gaye and members of the hardcore bandBad Brains.Harper, who played with Max Roach and others, evoked the long history of jazz musicians taking a stand against racism. He said: “I know they would be turning in their graves to see me stand on a stage under such circumstances and betray all we fought for, and sacrificed for.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The survey was conducted at the Phillips station in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state.The department also collects measurements with electronic instruments at other sites, and said that statewide the snowpack currently stands at 71% of average.Southern California cleans up after the wettest recent Christmas seasonRead moreThe measurement is the first of the season, and offers an important snapshot of the health of California’s water supply. The snowpack acts as a critical saving bank for the year ahead – essentially a frozen reservoir that provides about a third of the water used annually in California as it melts each spring and flows into rivers and streams and replenishes groundwater.A period of warm, dry weather was recently broken by a series ofheavy storms– fueled by a powerfulatmospheric river– that broughtrecord levels of rainin places such as Los Angeles and large quantities of snow in mountainous areas.Officials said that Monday’s measurement offered a hopeful sign, but cautioned that it is too soon to know how that could affect water supplies in the coming year.“The dry conditions and warmer temperatures in early December delayed our snow-building season, but the return of storm activity, especially in the last week, helped to build a solid base for this year’s snowpack,” said Fabbiani-Leon. “While California is in a better position now, it is still early in the season and our state’s water supply for this year will ultimately depend on a continued cadence of storms throughout winter and early spring.”The water content of the snowpack at the Phillips station is at 50% of the average for this time of year and 21% of the average for 1 April, when the Sierra snowpack is typically at its peak, Fabbiani-Leon said.Those levels are about half of what the state saw at this time last year, said David Rizzardo, the department’s hydrology section manager.“The trend we’re looking at right now is more rain than snow,” Rizzardo told reporters. “We’d like to see the snow accumulation pick up by April 1 so that we’re closer to average.”The state has built a complex system of canals and dams to capture and store the water in reservoirs for the hot, dry months when it doesn’t rain or snow. Those reservoirs are measuring at 123% of average for this time of year, Rizzardo said.The measurements are closely watched in California, which is home to 39 million people and grows much of the country’s fresh fruit and vegetables. The health of the snowpack helps determine whether California will face challenges providing water to farms and cities during the hot summer months.The state has grappled in recent years with swings between extremes of wet and dry. About a year ago, officials recorded a water content of the snowpack at the Phillips station of 91% of the average. In 2025, the state’s snowpack was near average just ahead of the 1 April peak and the state’s reservoirs above their historic capacity after two wet winters, following a years-long drought that forced severe cuts in water use.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWaterWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Those species are recovering thanks to a significant environmental turnaround.”Atlantic salmon are also threatened by blockages in rivers such as dams. While they are able to swim up the Mersey to spawn in the gravel beds of the Bollin, which flows through Cheshire, and the Goyt, which runs throughDerbyshireand Stockport, obstacles in other rivers block their paths.They cannot migrate up the River Tame because of its weirs or the River Irwell because of the Mode Wheel locks at Salford Quays.Mike Duddy, of the Salford Friendly Anglers Society, told the BBC: “If we wanted to do something for our future generations, now is the time to build a fish pass because there are huge numbers of people that would love to see salmon returning to the Roch and Irk, as well as the rivers in Bolton.”The species declined in Britain during the Industrial Revolution but built back before being declared critically endangered again two years ago.The Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We will be undertaking a new salmon distribution study in early 2026, using eDNA sampling, to build an even better picture of the spawning range and assess the extent of recovery.”Explore more on these topicsFishEndangered speciesWildlifeCheshireDerbyshireGreater ManchesterLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

In the 2025 breeding season, from May to August, there were higher than average breeding successes for 14 species including the chiffchaff, garden warbler, whitethroat, coal tit, blue tit, great tit and robin.During 2025, volunteer bird ringers for the British Trust for Ornithology monitored 29 songbird species at specified locations under a project known as the constant effort sites scheme.Participants catch birds at the same place in the same way throughout the summer, allowing scientists to see how numbers of adults and newly fledged young are changing over time and whether they are surviving better or worse than in previous decades.Compared with the very wet spring of 2024, there were above average successes in the 2025 breeding season.Dr Ellie Leech, the head of the ringing scheme, said: “Thanks to the fantastic efforts of BTO bird ringers, we know that the breeding success of 14 species was higher than average in 2025, in large part due to the mild weather. This is welcome news.”Leech said the contrast between the sunny and dry spring of 2025 and the continual downpours of 2024 could not be more stark. “[It] shows just how important the weather can be; this is particularly for young birds that are less well insulated and less experienced at finding food in difficult conditions.”Above average breeding successes were recorded for migratory birds including the chiffchaff, reed warbler, blackcap, garden warbler and whitethroat. For resident birds, nine species – the coal tit, blue tit, great tit, Cetti’s warbler, long-tailed tit, robin, dunnock, chaffinch and goldfinch – there were statistically significant increases in breeding compared with the five-year average.Thereportsays: “It is likely that all species benefited from the mild and dry spring and summer weather and that the prolonged good weather in summer 2025 increased the likelihood of second broods, leading to higher productivity.”Despite the above average breeding successes of 14 species, adult numbers of some of the best-loved songbirds declined in numbers this year, which has been put down to the poor breeding season last year.For the willow warbler and garden warbler, the numbers recorded in 2025 were the lowest on record.Leech said the effects of climate breakdown could make matters worse for wild birds, with several of the species that are regularly monitored showing long-term declines.British wild birds continue to be in serious decline. The most recentred list of birds of conservation concern, which lists species at risk of extinction, includes much-loved British birds such as the skylark, starling, woodcock, house martin, house sparrow and swift.Most of the declining species are farmland birds, according to the RSPB, which says intensive farming practices, including pesticide and fertiliser use, are the main driver of bird population declines.Explore more on these topicsBirdsWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Average December temperatures in Iceland are between -1C and 4C.It was a hot day in general: a temperature of 19.7C was measured at Bakkagerði in eastern Borgarfjörður, in the far east of the country. The previous record was set on 2 December 2019, when the temperature was measured at 19.7C in Kvískerjar in Öræfi, in the south-east of Iceland.Birgir Örn Höskuldsson, a meteorologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office, told the RÚV news agency the conditions for the temperature record had been created because warm air of a tropical origin was over the country. A strong high pressure system was drawing warm, moist air to the south and preventing colder air from moving in.View image in fullscreenSeyðisfjörður in the snow: average temperatures in December in Iceland are between -1C and 4C.Photograph: imagebroker.com/AlamyIceland is getting warmer due to global heating caused by the combustion of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.In May, there wererecord-breaking heatwavesacross the country with areas 3C-4C hotter than usual. May temperature records were set at 94% of all the automatic stations that have operated for at least 20 years. The highest temperature was 26.6C at Egilsstaðir airport in East Iceland on 15 May.Earlier this year,mosquitoes were found in Iceland for the first time as global heating makes it more hospitable for insects. The country was until then one of just two places that did not have a mosquito population, the other being Antarctica.Studies have shown theArctic regionis warming at four times the rate of the rest of the planet, and Iceland has experiencedrecord heatthis year. Glaciers have been collapsing and fish from warmer, southern climes, such as mackerel, have been found in the country’s waters.Explore more on these topicsIcelandClimate crisisMeteorologyExtreme weatherEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He will be missed by all who knew him.”The family added: “Aaron was always happiest working on farms and fixing trucks. Even at the age of 14 he had an amazing work ethic and already had two apprenticeship offers.“Although we are saddened about the life he will never have, we are so thankful for the life he has lived and will cherish all the happy memories he left us with.”Police said they were called to the farm at 8.25pm. A 13-year-old boy who also sustained serious injuries in the incident and was treated in hospital is now recovering at home.In their tribute, Aaron’s family added: “We have had an overwhelming response from our friends, family, and the local community who we can’t thank enough.“We would also like to thank the ambulance service, police, and most importantly the amazing staff at the Royal Victoria Infirmary and charities who have provided us with so much comfort in this difficult time.“Our thoughts and well wishes are also with everyone else affected by this tragic incident.“We would now ask to be left in peace to grieve the loss of our son.”A John Deere Gator is a utility vehicle – bigger than a quad bike but smaller than a tractor – widely used on farms.Police said an investigation was ongoing to establish the circumstances of the collision and would like to speak to anyone who may have any information that could help.Explore more on these topicsCounty DurhamFarmingNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Over two decades, Burke has grown the organisation from seed into a nationally recognised voice for disabled people in Scotland’s largest city, and supported more than 5,000 members through the pandemic.But in her letter declining the proposed award, seen by the Guardian, Burke told the Cabinet Office: “I feel that I cannot accept a personal honour because disabled people are being so dishonoured at this time.“In fact we are being demonised, dehumanised and scapegoated for political choices and policy failures by consecutive governments.”Burke, who emphasises she means no disrespect to colleagues in the voluntary sector who have accepted similar honours, explains that she received the letter of recommendation on the day of the UK budget, which introduced stricter assessments for personal independent payments, frozen or reduced universal credit health top-ups and cuts to the Motability scheme.“The budget was an opportunity to send out a signal not about how much disabled people cost but about how much disabled people are worth and are valued by society.”Instead, she says, it has “supercharged the inequalities and unfairness disabled people face”.“It is fuelling misinformation. It is fuelling hatred. It is fuelling blame and scapegoating. When the biggest problem we have is that taxation needs to be addressed and if we could all get behind that, including the most wealthy people, we would be able to offer the provision of a welfare state.”Burke also challenges the government’s “negative framing” of disability, which she says is happening at the same time as “growing attacks by the far right about whether or not [disabled] people have any entitlement to things and lots of misinformation”.While she argues that “Scotland is doing better than the UK for sure”, Burke says her members will be watching carefully for the practical implementation of the Scottish government’s new disability equality plan, as well as what manifesto commitments are made before May’s Holyrood elections.Burke, who will have been running the GDA for 20 years this coming May, said she also balked at “individualising” the achievements of her organisation.The organisation is built around the twin pillars of supporting people at an individual level and reducing their social isolation, then building confidence and their collective voice to influence policy and services.“Ultimately I am most proud of the people power of GDA – the board, the staff and the members – all disabled people working together to improve disabled people’s lives at the individual and collective level.”“The peer support that members give each other, the friendships that have sprung up, people have even got married … that’s just something to be proud of. The sense of community and belonging that GDA members have. It feels like being part of a family for thousands of people.”Explore more on these topicsDisabilityGlasgowScotlandBenefitsWelfareUniversal creditNew year honours listnewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister told MPs the money would be converted into a foundation for humanitarian causes in Ukraine.Labour has turned its fire on Wolfson this week, arguing that his work for Abramovich while he is a shadow minister created an unacceptable conflict of interest.View image in fullscreenDavid Wolfson, a Conservative peer and the shadow attorney general, is representing Abramovich in a legal battle with the government of Jersey.Photograph: Roger Harris/UK ParliamentAnna Turley, the Labour party chair, demanded that Badenoch disclose whether she was aware Wolfson was due to represent Abramovich in the Jersey case and make clear that “nobody representing a man who is currently under British sanctions can serve around her shadow cabinet table”.Turley accused the Tory leader of “allowing her top team to moonlight second jobs that are in clear conflict with British and Ukrainian interests” and said it was “a totally irresponsible position for His Majesty’s official opposition to be in”.Jake Richards, a justice minister, said on Monday that Wolfson should either quit the shadow cabinet or leave Abramovich’s legal team.In a letter to Badenoch he asked whether Wolfson had recused himself from party policy regarding Abramovich’s assets, and said his ability to advise her on the matter was “clearly compromised”.The Ukraine Solidarity Campaign, an activist group, criticised Wolfson’s role in representing Abramovich and said it raised “profound questions about the Conservative party and its long‑standing entanglement with Russian wealth”.A Conservative party spokesperson said: “Lord Wolfson is instructed in ongoing legal proceedings in Jersey. He is not instructed on the Chelsea FC matter.”“The Conservative party led the way on supporting Ukraine and we remain committed to their cause. To suggest anything else is just Labour sinking to new depths.”The Tories accused Labour ministers of “rank hypocrisy” and said that Richard Hermer, the attorney general, had previously “acted for Gerry Adams and involved himself in the Shamima Begum case”.In the past, the Conservatives havecriticised Hermer over the clients he representedduring his 20-year career as a human rights barrister and called for a Whitehall investigation into potential conflicts of interest. The demands weredismissed by the cabinet secretary, Chris Wormald.In response, ministers have pointed to the “cab-rank rule”, which states that barristers should not discriminate between clients and should accept cases they are qualified for irrespective of their personal views.In his letter to Badenoch, Richards wrote that while the cab-rank rule “must always be respected … it cannot remove conflicts of interest, or eliminate the responsibility of politicians to avoid such conflicts”.Explore more on these topicsConservativesRoman AbramovichKemi BadenochRussiaBarristersJerseyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She said she had no idea she could still access careers advice at the Lancaster University, where she studied in the mid-2000s, until a chance remark earlier this year.Degree grade matters more than university reputation, report findsRead more“I was really quite worried about changing jobs, I hadn’t had a job interview in 18 years, I hadn’t had a different job in all that time, I didn’t have a CV, I didn’t have anything. It was quite daunting. I couldn’t remember how to write a CV or cover letters, interviews were obviously terrifying.“I hadn’t thought about speaking to anyone in a professional capacity, and then a friend mentioned that they’d read in an alumni magazine about getting careers advice from their university, so that’s how I heard about it,” Hamilton said.Lancaster’s careers service put her in touch with its career coach Rachel Beauchamp, who proofread her CV and talked her through the rigours of the current job market.“I was feeling, do I actually have any other skills? Can I do anything else? Rachel was really good at saying: look at all these things that you’ve done and how you could use those in different contexts. That was probably the most helpful thing, as well as a bit of confidence,” said Hamilton, who successfully interviewed for a new job.“I was so nervous on the day of the interview – I’d had interview prep with Rachel where we talked about the questions that might be asked and how to prepare for them. Although I was terrified at the interview – I could feel myself shaking – I felt I sold myself well and got across all the things I am good at.”Beauchamp said Hamilton was like many older graduates who had not applied for jobs through formal routes for 15 to 20 years, and wanted trusted sources of advice.Beauchamp said: “I’ve had quite a few people who have had caring responsibilities and have been out of work for quite some time. Now they are going back into the workplace and don’t know how to approach it.“More recently, it’s been around people facing redundancies or changes at their work, so they may be looking at retraining or going into something new.”Part of the challenge for older graduates, according to Beauchamp, is recognising the skills they have gained outside their workplace. Beauchamp recently helped a graduate with extensive experience running parent groups at her children’s schools.Healthcare graduates most satisfied with choice of course, UK data showsRead more“She’d been out of work for 12 years and now she wanted to get back into the workforce. I had an initial appointment with her about writing her CV, and I saw that she’d undersold herself. She’s now just started in an administrative role in the NHS, based on that confidence boost and the CV support,” Beauchamp said.Jeremy Swan, head of policy and advocacy at theAssociation of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, said many graduates are not aware that lifetime access “is rapidly becoming the norm”, even though more than 40% of universities in England and Wales now offer it.Hamilton said: “I’m in my 40s and most people at that stage have been in their careers for 20 years or so – and how many of them moan about what they do?“None of us do anything about it because the job fits in with your family or you’ve got decent pay, so you just stay with what you know. But I thought, I am just going to make myself miserable for the next 20 years.“More people need to know it’s easy to get help – and it’s free as well – to get a bit of confidence to go out there and try something else.”Explore more on these topicsCareersUniversitiesGraduate careersStudentsHigher educationWork & careersShareReuse this content"

She was 35.Her passing was announced in a social media post by the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. “Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts,”the post said. It was signed “George, Edwin and Josephine Moran, Ed, Carolina, Jack, Rose and Rory”.In a New Yorker essay published in November, Schlossberg said she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, and had less than a year to live.Schlossberg, who graduated from Yale and had a master’s degree from Oxford, was previously a climate reporter for the New York Times, and had contributed to the Atlantic, the Washington Post and Vanity Fair.The daughter of Caroline Kennedy, 67, and Edwin Schlossberg, 80,said she’d learned of her diagnosisshortly after giving birth to her second child with husband George Moran in May 2024 and had been undergoing treatment.“I did not – could not – believe that they were talking about me,” Schlossberg wrote in the essay, titled A Battle With My Blood. “I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn’t sick. I didn’t feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.”In the essay, the environmental writer addressed her cousin, Robert F Kennedy Jr, criticizing the influence his policies as secretary of health and human services had had on her experience with the illness.Schlossberg wrote that she strongly disapproved of his anti-vaccine positions and his decisions to cut funding for medical research, emphasizing the harm such actions cause to patients like herself.“As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearlya half billiondollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,” she wrote.She said that Kennedy “slashed billions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest sponsor of medical research; and threatened to oust the panel of medical experts charged with recommending preventive cancer screenings”.Schlossberg added that doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving medical center, where she was receiving care, were uncertain about their future after funding cuts initiated by the Trump administration.“Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,” Schlossberg wrote. The university later reached an agreement with the Trump administration that reinstated the funding.She concluded her essay reflecting on her focus in the time she had left, writing that she hoped to “fill my brain with memories” of her children: “I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go … I will keep trying to remember.”Schlossberg leaves behind a three-year-old son and a one-year-old daughter she shared with her husband.Explore more on these topicsUS newsJohn F KennedynewsShareReuse this content"

The groups compete among themselves in the territories they control.Saudi Arabia said the attack on the port city of Mukalla had targeted a weapons shipment from the UAE for the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is seeking to restore South Yemen as an independent state, as it was between 1967 and 1990.Yemen mapThe UAE said that the shipment had not contained any weapons and was meant for UAE forces rather than any Yemeni groups.But the strike by Saudi Arabia was seen as a shot across the bows after the STC made unprecedented territorial gains, seizing most of the resource-rich Hadhramaut province and much of neighbouring Mahrah, angering Riyadh.Some of the territorial gains came at the expense of Saudi-backed forces in the country and left UAE-supported groups in control of most of southern Yemen, including key port cities, oil facilities and islands. Saudi troops withdrew from their bases in Aden after STC forces seized the presidential palace there – a move that Saudi Arabia said was part of a “repositioning strategy”.The strikes will ratchet up tension between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh as competition between the two heats up in the Red Sea area.Tuesday’s attack was followed by measures announced by the chair of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, a Saudi-aligned figure who chairs the internationally recognised government of Yemen. Al-Alimi ordered all UAE military forces to withdraw from Yemen within 24 hours, a 90-day state of emergency, and the blockade of all land and sea ports for 72 hours.But an STC spokesperson dismissed calls for the group to withdraw, saying the separatists would hold their territory.“There is no thinking about withdrawal. It is unreasonable for the landowner to be asked to leave his own land. The situation requires staying and reinforcing,” Anwar Al-Tamimi told AFP.“We are in a defensive position, and any movement toward our forces will be responded to by our forces,” he added.Analysts describe the STC and other UAE-backed groups as the strongest factions militarily within the anti-Houthi coalition, so it remains to be seen how much support Saudi Arabia is willing to lend its allies in Yemen to fight the group.As many as 20,000 Saudi-backed forces have reportedly gathered on the border of Yemen.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke with his Saudi and UAE counterparts, his department said.Rubio and the UAE foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, discussed “the situation in Yemen and broader issues affecting Middle Eastern security and stability”, said a state department spokesperson.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the resumption of full-scale fighting in Yemen could destabilise the entire Red Sea area, and urged a de-escalation between all parties.The war in Yemen has killed an estimated 377,000 people, according to the UN, and nearly half of the population faces hunger due to the continuing civil war.A military statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency announced Tuesday’s strikes, which it said came after ships arrived there from Fujairah, a port city on the UAE’s eastern coast.Southern separatists in Yemen report Saudi airstrikes near positionsRead more“The ships’ crew had the disabled tracking devices aboard the vessels, and unloaded a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles in support of the STC forces,” it said.“Considering that the aforementioned weapons constitute an imminent threat, and an escalation that threatens peace and stability, the Coalition Air Force has conducted this morning a limited airstrike that targeted weapons and military vehicles offloaded from the two vessels in Mukalla.”The STC’s AIC satellite news channel acknowledged the strikes, without providing details.The attack is likely to have targeted a ship identified by analysts as the Greenland, a roll-on, roll-off vessel flagged out of St Kitts. Tracking data showed the vessel had been in Fujairah on 22 December and arrived in Mukalla on Sunday. The second vessel could not be immediately identified.Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert and the founder of the Basha Report, a risk advisory firm, cited social media videos that purported to show new armoured vehicles rolling through Mukalla after the ship’s arrival. The ship’s owners, based in Dubai, could not be immediately reached.“I expect a calibrated escalation from both sides. The UAE-backed STC is likely to respond by consolidating control,” al-Basha said. “At the same time, the flow of weapons from the UAE to the STC is set to be curtailed following the port attack, particularly as Saudi Arabia controls the airspace.”Footage later aired by Saudi state television, which appeared to be filmed by a surveillance aircraft, purportedly showed the armoured vehicles moving through Mukalla to a staging area. The types of vehicles corresponded to the social media footage.Mukalla is in Yemen’s Hadhramaut governorate, which the STC had seized in recent days. The port city is 480km north-east of Aden, which has been the seat of power for anti-Houthi forces in Yemen after the rebels seized the capital, Sana’a, in 2014.The strike in Mukalla comes afterSaudi Arabia targeted the council in airstrikeson Friday, which analysts described as a warning for the separatists to halt their advance and leave the governorates of Hadhramaut and Mahra.Those aligned with the council have increasingly flown the flag of South Yemen. Demonstrators have been rallying for days to support political forces calling forSouth Yemen to secede again.The actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the Opec oil cartel but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years.UAE support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan has reportedly angered Saudi Arabia, after the RSF committed mass atrocities in the Sudanese city of El Fasher. The two are also at odds over Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia where the UAE has a military base and airstrip.The UAE notably did not join Saudi Arabia and 20 other countries and Islamic organisations in issuing a statement condemning Israel’s recognition of Somaliland on Friday.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsYemenSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricaIranHouthisnewsShareReuse this content"

This was accompanied by mass protests in the capital as well as in major cities, including Isfahan, Shiraz and Mashhad.‘There’s no going back’: Iran’s women on why they won’t stop flouting dress code lawsRead moreProtesters chanted anti-government slogans, and video on social media showed demonstrators chanting “Don’t be afraid, we are together” and “Azadi”, the Farsi word for freedom. Footage also showed Iranian police in riot gear shooting teargas at protesters.The protests were the largest sincea wave of demonstrations rocked the country after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in police custodyfollowing her arrest for not wearing the hijab correctly. At the time, Iranian police responded with force, imposing an internet shutdown and violently cracking down on demonstrations with teargas and gunfire.On Tuesday, the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, instructed the government to listen to the “legitimate demands” of protesters. A government spokesperson said that a mechanism for dialogue would be set up to have talks with leaders of the protest movement.“The livelihood of my people is my daily concern,” Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. He added that the government had “actions on the agenda to reform the monetary and banking system and preserve the purchasing power of the people”.Analysts say the Iranian government has reduced its domestic repression since the 12-day war with Israel during the summer, as it seeks to shore up support after suffering significant blows to its image as an impregnable regime. The “morality police”, for example, have at times relaxed the strict application of social edicts in Tehran.View image in fullscreenMasoud Pezeshkian: ‘The livelihood of my people is my daily concern.’Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersIranian media have said that recent government liberalisation policies have depressed the currency’s exchange rate. On Monday, state television reported the resignation of the central bank chief, Mohammad Reza Farzin, a day after the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42 million to the dollar. When Farzin took office in 2022, the rial was exchanged for about 430,000 to the dollar.The erosion of purchasing power is exacerbating an already dire economic situation in Iran, making food and other daily needs increasingly unaffordable.According to Iran’s government statistics centre, food prices are up 72% and medical goods 50% compared with this time last year. At the same time, the government has said it will increase taxes in the Iranian new year, which starts on 21 March.You’ll never defeat us in Iran, President Trump: but with real talks, we can both win | Abbas AraghchiRead moreAs the Iranian government is confronted with protests at home, it also faces renewed threats of attacks from abroad. Donald Trump warned on Monday that the UScould carry out further military strikes on Iranif it attempted to rebuild its nuclear programme.The US conductedmassive bunker-buster strikes on key nuclear enrichment strikesin Iran in June. In a meeting on Monday with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said that there could be further nuclear activity outside the sites hit in June.“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again. And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down. We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening,” Trump said.Iran has said that it is no longer enriching uranium anywhere and that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.Writing for the Guardian, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran wanted dialogue with the US. “Despite Israel’s attack on diplomacy amid Iran-US nuclear negotiations, Iran remains open to an agreement that is built on mutual respect and mutual interest,” Araghchi wrote.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestMiddle East and north AfricaCost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The flight was heavily criticized for its environmental impact and critics questioned its purpose and use of resources.For Nguyen, who is a civil rights activist for sexual assault survivors as well as a bioastronautics research scientist, she said the backlash to flight saw her professional achievements and dreams “buried under an avalanche of misogyny”.First wheelchair-using astronaut touches down after ride to edge of spaceRead moreIn a lengthystatementshared on Instagram on Tuesday, she said that when King called to check on her days after the flight, “I told her my depression might last for years.”She said the volume of news coverage and social media reaction to the trip was so “unprecedented” that even a “small fraction of negativity becomes staggering”. “It amounted to billions of hostile impressions,” she said, “an onslaught no human brain has evolved to endure”.“I did not leave Texas for a week, unable to get out of bed. A month later, when a senior staff at Blue [Origin] called me, I had to hang up on him because I could not speak through my tears,” she wrote.Inan interview with the Guardianin March, Nguyen said she had put her lifelong ambition of becoming an astronaut on hold after another student raped her at university and she pursued a years-long fight for justice, which she described as “all-consuming”. In 2019, her activism for sexual assault survivors led to Nguyen being nominated for the Nobel peace prize and in 2022, she was one of Time magazine’s women of the year.The onslaught after the spaceflight made her feel like “collateral damage”, Nguyen said: “my moment of justice mutilated.”“In my moments of deep grief this year, I reached back out to a familiar place, to her – my survivor self – who found the strength to fight. How horrible that I needed to deploy that skill once again,” she said.Now, eight months on from realising her dream of going to space, Nguyen said the “fog of grief has started to lift”, and thanked those who have supported her and sent her well wishes. “Vietnam saved me … You all saved me,” she wrote.Nguyen, whose parents arrived in the US as refugees after fleeing Vietnam after the fall of Saigon, went on: “When Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon, bombs rained down on Vietnam. This year, when my boat refugee family looked at the sky, instead of bombs they saw the first Vietnamese woman in space.“We came on boats, and now we’re on spaceships,” she said.Despite the backlash, she said there had been “overwhelming good that has come out of [the flight],” including the media attention brought to her women’s health research and opportunities to meet world leaders in relation to her advocacy for rape survivors.“It is the greatest gift this holiday season that I can feel the fog lifting,” Nguyen wrote. “I can tell Gayle it’s not going to take years.”She ended her post with a photo of herself as a young student at Harvard, captioned: “For her.”Explore more on these topicsBlue OriginJeff BezosSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

It was subsequentlyacquiredout of insolvency by its Chinese franchise partner, Rebecca Feng, who fought off competition from Sports Direct’sMike Ashley.The fashion industry had been watching the fate of LK Bennett closely in the run-up to Christmas as the business approached the brink once again. LK Bennett lists just nine UK storeson its website, plus 13 concessions in the UK, Ireland and on Jersey.In the company’s most recent set of accounts, taking in trading until the end of January 2024, it lost £3.2m and had borrowings of almost £22m. The auditor Grant Thornton warned of “material uncertainty related to going concern” as it reported how the group had breached agreements with its lenders and pointed to a deadline of next month to renegotiate the company’s debt pile.The accounting group added: “It is expected that there may be a breach [of debt covenants] again … Although a letter has been obtained from the bank stating their intention to continue to make all facilities available until at least 31 January 2026, no formal waiver of the covenants has been obtained.”LK Bennett has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryFashion industrynewsShareReuse this content"

A CCJ is issued when someone takes court action against an individual or a company saying they owe them money,and the alleged debtor has not responded.Pharmacies that have used the Jhoots branding have been owned by either Sarbjit or his brother Manjit Jhooty.Manjit Jhooty, who owns more than 20 Jhoots branches through his companies Pasab and Jhoots Healthcare, has said his branches were separate from his brother’s and remained “fully functional and continue to deliver services to the communities they serve”. In December herebranded his businessas JHL Pharmacy and the Lloyds application does not apply to his operation.In November, Allied Pharmacies took over the running of 60 Jhoots stores.Jhoots Chemist, the business owned by Sarbjit Jhooty that is the subject of the Lloyds Bank high court application, reported creditors of more than £5m and a loss of almost £1.9m in its most recent financial year to the end of December 2024, according to documents filed at Companies House.The company owed £1.7m to the banks via loans and overdrafts, with filings showing Lloyds holds 16 unsatisfied charges against it.The most recent accounts, signed off in March, included a note that read: “The directors have not identified any material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”Sarbjit Jhooty did not respond to efforts to contact him for comment.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryLloyds Banking GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

Why are people so weird about shops? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThe trend poses new challenges for food retailers such as M&S, which are trying to maintain sales as some customers eat less.The head of food innovation at M&S, Annette Peters, said the new range was “great if customers are reducing their food intake, such as people using the GLP-1 medications. We have challenged ourselves to make products that are denser in nutrients than calories, so every single mouthful is packed full of more of the nutrients we all need.”M&S’s effort to target the weight-loss jab market follows similar moves by Morrisons, which earlier this month announced that it was partnering with the health and wellness brand Applied Nutrition to offer a range of“GLP-1 friendly ready meals”.From early January, 53 “high protein” products including ready meals, sandwiches, breads and cheeses will hit the shelves at about 400 Morrisons supermarkets.The pressure to remain relevant to weight-loss jab users could ramp up if pharmaceutical companies succeed in bringing ananti-obesity pillto market.While weight-loss jabs, which mimic the gut hormone GLP-1, have exploded in popularity in recent years, they remain expensive for most users. Pharmaceutical companies are racing to be the first provider of weight-loss pills, which would be easier to store, distribute and administer and would ultimately be cheaper than their injectable counterparts.Questions are still being raised about the side-effects of GLP-1 medicines, which are also used to treat diabetes. These includepancreas-linked problems, which prompted health officials to launch fresh research into the drugs’ side-effects earlier this year.There are also growing concerns that people are buying illegal weight-loss drugs peddled on social media sites. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyissued a fresh warningto people planning to use such medications, stressing the importance of buying them from registered UK pharmacies or legitimate retailers.So far, weight-loss jabs have given a financial boost to large pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, which became the first drugmaker to reach a $1tn (£740bn) market value in the US last month. The company has developed tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity.It has been competing with rivals including the Danish company Novo Nordisk, which is behind the weight-loss brands Wegovy and Ozempic. The company ousted its chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, in May over concerns it was losing ground in the market. Its share price rose in September after research showedpromising resultsfrom its weight-loss pill, which is still in development.Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerRetail industrySupermarketsDiets and dietingnewsShareReuse this content"

Planning approvals for offshore wind developments jumped more than sevenfold to 9.9GW from 1.3GW last year.Planning approvals for battery, wind and solar power have risen by more than 400% over the past five years.Graphic showing new battery, wind and solar projects, measured in gigawatts, in Great Britain since 2000The energy secretary,Ed Miliband, said: “After years of delay and underinvestment, this government is keeping its promise to take back control of Britain’s energy with clean homegrown power.“Every project we approve, every investment we make is about getting the country off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets, protecting households and lowering bills for good.”The record-breaking surge in planning approvals signals real momentum in the UK’s energy transition, according to Robin Clarke, a senior analyst at Cornwall Insight, but many could still face delays starting up.“On paper, the UK’s renewables pipeline has never looked stronger,” he said. “But approvals don’t generate electricity, and we urgently need to move from ambition to actual delivery of these projects. Too much capacity is still stuck in queues or waiting on grid upgrades. Grid bottlenecks remain one of the biggest risks to turning today’s approvals into tomorrow’s power.”Although approvals have accelerated, the pace of projects starting up has lagged behind, largely as a result of long construction timelines and grid connection delays, according to Cornwall.Many projects have been stuck in a “first come, first served” connections queue, but recent reforms to remove “zombie projects” from the queue and shift to a “first ready, first needed, first connected” approach is expected to clear some of the bottlenecks and quicken the pace of Britain’s renewable energy buildout.Britain’s energy system operator pulled the plug on hundreds of electricity generation projects earlier this month to cleara huge backlogthat had stopped many “shovel-ready” schemes from connecting to the power grid.More than half of the energy projects in the queue will be removed to make way for about £40bn-worth of schemes considered the most likely to help meet the government’s goal to build a virtually zero-carbon power system by 2030.Britain’s growing renewables industry may also have accelerated in 2025 as developers rush to get their projects over the line before tougher rules over which projects can connect to the grid, and upcoming local elections that could create uncertainty over future renewable energy planning policies.Clarke said: “The recent grid connection reforms are a significant step forward, and should help clear some of the backlog, but they won’t solve everything. We need faster decisions, more investment in the grid, and real collaboration between government, regulators and industry. Without that, these record numbers risk becoming just another statistic.”Cornwall added that the rapid expansion of renewable projects would also mean the UK must reinforce and build out its electricity grid at scale.“The current infrastructure was never designed for such high volumes of intermittent generation and storage, so investment in grid flexibility, transmission upgrades, and smart technologies will be critical to ensure these projects can deliver power where and when it’s needed,” it said.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryRenewable energyEnergyWind powerSolar powerEd MilibandEnergy storagenewsShareReuse this content"

How about a new year’s resolution not to watch – or make – anything this grim ever again?Lucy ManganTue 30 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTShareWe are always aware, I think, of man’s inhumanity to man. The latest true-crime documentary fromNetflixis here to remind you that this is an umbrella term. It is undoubtedly rarer, though precisely why is unclear, but women can inflict the most awful suffering too – and here, a pair of them do so on children.Evil Influencer: The Jodi Hildebrandt Story is the latest offering from Skye Borgman, who is the undisputed queen of the genre, specialising in high-end takes on the most extreme, the most only-in-America stories of depravity you could (not) hope to find. She made her name with 2017’sAbducted in Plain Sight, about the case of Jan Broberg, who was kidnapped not once but twice by Robert Berchtold, a close friend of the Brobergs and a sexual predator who effectively groomed the whole, spectacularly naive family.The Girl in the Picture, five years later, tells the story of a young woman known as Sharon Marshall, found after her death in a suspicious hit-and-run accident to have been living under multiple aliases as the kidnap and rape victim of a fugitive on the run from the FBI for decades.I Just Killed My Dadcompleted an unholy trinity of films from Borgman, with an examination of why 17-year-old Anthony Templet shot dead his apparently loving father and waited calmly outside for the police to arrest him. Spoiler alert: Templet’s father was nothing like the man he seemed.All the films are sober, unsensationalised looks at their subjects. They allow all the witnesses and any living victims time to speak freely and thoughtfully, and they interleave testimonies about the effects of events and perpetrators’ actions with facts, timelines and evidential hurdles faced by police and prosecutors in the cases with consummate skill.Evil Influencer is no different. It has measured accounts from the police detective Jessica Bate, put in charge of the case when it became clear that the 12-year-old boy ringing at a stranger’s door was not a young prankster but a malnourished escaper from the nearby home of supposed therapist Jodi Hildebrandt, and covered in injuries indicative of severe abuse and torture. When the police searched Hildebrandt’s home they found his similarly starved and terrified sister sitting shaven-headed in a closet, ropes and handcuffs hidden in a safe room and assorted other evidence that supported the boy’s story.Eric Clarke, the county attorney who would put together the case against Hildebrandt and the children’s mother, Ruby Franke, adds thoughtful commentary to his explanation of how proceedings unfolded. Franke had, with her husband, Kevin, been a popular pair of influencers showing followers how to raise a happy family in accordance with Mormon beliefs. Hildebrandt, herself raised within the faith, was a life coach who specialised in helping members of the Church of Latter-day Saints (LDS) who were going through marital difficulties resolve them. She was on LDS bishops’ list of approved advisers and her clients were thus primed to trust her, even when her “advice” mostly comprised inducing shame about sexual desire (especially male) and quickly shaded into all but enforcing separation of couples so, it seems, she could better control them as individuals. Male and female former clients talk about the power she came to wield over them (and the money they paid her in the process) and the damage she did to their relationships with their spouses and children.Ruby Franke fell under her sway and became her business and possibly sexual partner too, and, with Hildebrandt assuring her that they were doing it all for Christ, participated in the abuse of the two children.Like Borgman’s previous films, and indeed like any entry into the true-crime genre, what it doesn’t do is escape accusations of voyeurism and exploitation. Evil Influencer lays out an appalling but very simple story of extreme child abuse done in the name of God by someone who was able to convince others – and maybe herself – that He was working through her.Clarke (an LDS member himself) and others have interesting things to say about how early religious training in “a strong church” can make people more susceptible to being led to extremes, but it is not delved into deeply enough to give the film the heft it needs to transcend its essentially grubby impulses. A new year’s resolution to do better than make or watch more of this stuff might improve us all.Evil Influencer: The Jodi Hildebrandt Story is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsDocumentaryTV reviewUS crimeTelevisionNetflixFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.With such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto onThe Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”View image in fullscreenHall-of-mirrors feel … Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor in Superman.Photograph: Jessica Miglio/© 2025 Warner Bros. Ent. All Rights Reserved. TM & © DCThere was more baldness inSuperman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage aboutperceived wokenessadded a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.Is it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thrillerM3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.If Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr inThe Naked Gunreboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.View image in fullscreenTruly psychotic … Danny Huston in The Naked Gun.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/APIn the goopy, grungy world ofThe Toxic Avengerreboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such asBryan Johnson.In 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulishMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby inTron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully fromthe original 1982 Tron– seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.View image in fullscreenPale and pampered … Kevin Bacon in The Toxic AvengerBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satireMountainheadtook the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.As Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world.

But there are a few too many sentimental moments to properly work as social-realism, or anything close to convincing drama, which is disappointing given its creator, Don Ng, is a journalist-turned-director making his feature debut. It’s set in London, where Bosco (a sensitive performance by Yiu-Sing Lam) has arrived fromHong Kongfleeing the government’s crackdown on political freedom, though he doesn’t really talk much about the situation back home.Bosco is sent to live with other asylum seekers on a military base while his application is processed. Some of the best scenes turn out to be gentle observations of his sense of dislocation: walking around the local corner shop, for example, with its aisles of unfamiliar food. At a bus stop he meets Yasmin (Tsz Wing Kitty Yu), another asylum seeker, who writes letters to her student doctor boyfriend in Hong Kong, in prison for giving first aid to anti-government protesters. Bosco and Yasmin hang out together, though it’s obvious that for him the friendship feels like something more.Ng’s script has a habit of raising issues without exploring them. Bosco gets a cash-in-hand job at a car wash, where the illegally employed workers seem happy enough; and there’s no suggestion of exploitationor unsafe working conditions. Then, one of the asylum seekers at his accommodation is threatened with deportation to Rwanda. In another storyline, a young British man falls in with a far right group protesting against immigration. It all feels muddled and contrived – a further script edit might have resulted in a more rewarding drama.No Time for Goodbye is in UK cinemas from 1 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsMigrationRefugeesHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Still underage, he was also getting turfed out of festivals as soon as his set ended. “I’d be in school during the week, and then my mom would take me to open for Skrillex or Flosstradamus on the weekend,” he says. “So I became a cool kid in high school pretty quickly.” His wry laugh fades. “But there’s this really strange disconnect. You kind of expect these things to make you happy.” Cashing $10k for drubbing through an hour of garish EDM for sweaty Lycra-clad grownups will sharpen even the most adolescent perspective. “I had kind of sacrificed a bit of my childhood to be in these adult spaces,” he says.Villager: Nowhere FM – streamYoung took the first of a series of abrupt left turns in his nascent career. He packed in DJing, relinquished the Alex Young moniker and started listening to Radiohead and Rinse FM. “I wasreallyfalling in love with music,” he says. “I got into the UK canon of electronic music, starting to understand it more.” Now 29, he’s enjoying what he’s begun to think of as a second life. The heady, idiosyncratic club music he makes as Villager is about as far from EDM’s dopamine overload as you can get. He ditched a laptop-based approach to writing in favour of recording loops on sequencers and samplers that he works together into full tracks. The organic-feeling results are reminiscent of the early 2010s, when producers such as Blawan, James Blake, Untold, and Pangaea pulled the anything-goes philosophy of early dubstep into fresh, uncanny territory: the transcendent synth lines of Walk Away Now, omnivorous rhythms on Pig, and Dogma’s snappy snares.‘100,000 people are about to lose their minds!’ Four Tet on being the world’s unlikeliest superstar DJRead moreHis handful of EPs and tracks were praised by tastemakers Ben UFO, Four Tet and Jamie xx, and a freshly inked publishing deal with Fred Again’s manager (not to mention a writing credit on Halsey’s double-platinum album Manic) underscored his inherent pop chops. He says his first show in the UK – in November 2024, at Drumsheds, on a lineup curated by Four Tet – felt like deja vu, after he walked into the green room to find Floating Points, Four Tet and Caribou in conversation: “It’s funny. I black it out in my head, because that was like the new ‘meeting Skrillex’ moment.”Going to clubs to dance, rather than just perform, was also transformational. As a teenager, music had lacked any real social context. “My entire relationship with dance music had always been from the stage, looking at the crowd,” he says. Experimenting with drugs initially helped. “I took ketamine for the first time and was like: ‘Now I get dubstep!’” he laughs. But his relationship with substances became an issue.At the end of 2025, he cancelled a support tour with Disclosure to get help for what had accelerated into ketamine addiction. He stopped taking the drug and released an impeccably produced album of alt-pop, Old Friend, that sits somewhere between Thom Yorke, Bruno Mars and The Life of Pablo-era Kanye West, and expunges the dissonant feelings about making a career out of music that have clouded him since those teenage escapades. “I feel weightless now,” he says, exhaling. As if, bit by bit, he’s finally figuring out what this music thing is all about.Explore more on these topicsMusicNew music for 2026Electronic musicDance musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Some threw themselves overboard. And others were thrown into the sea.In The Zorg, Siddharth Kara tells two stories. The first is of a harrowing incident aboard the eponymous slave ship – the murder of 132 Africans by the British crew. The second relates how that event came to play a role in the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, in large part through the work of a dazzling array of committed campaigners. One of these was Olaudah Equiano, author of one of the few surviving accounts of the Middle Passage from the perspective of an enslaved person, in which he described it as “a scene of horror almost inconceivable”.The tale begins in Liverpool, a city which at its economic zenith was responsible for 40% of the European slave trade. Investing in slavery was a profitable activity not just for the elites but for the lower classes as well. One investor, William Gregson, saved up his rope-making wages, ploughed them into the trade and eventually became a rich burgher and mayor of the city. Gregson financed the slave ship The William, which left Liverpool for west Africa in October 1780 with Capt Richard Hanley at the helm. It was loaded with commodities to trade at slave markets, such as tobacco, firearms, knives and “India goods” such as chintz and Maldive cowrie shells, 400lbs of which was “the going rate … per African male”.Around the same time, a Dutch slave ship named the Zorg (later referred to by the British as the Zong) had departed the Netherlands. The Dutch had been supporting and supplying arms to the American revolutionaries and in December 1780, Britain declared war on them. The Royal Navy gave British ships permission to seize Dutch property at sea: carte blanche for piracy. The Zorg was captured by a British captain and anchored off the Gold Coast. Meanwhile, on one of his slave shopping trips, Hanley had picked up a fleeing British governor called Robert Stubbs who had been kicked out for corruption. Stubbs had been tasked with handing over gifts of gunpowder and brandy from King George III to the Asante Kingdom but had likely pilfered them, souring diplomatic relations and threatening the flow of slaves.When Hanley arrived at Cape Coast Castle, a fortress at the centre of the British slave trade with a 1,000-capacity slave dungeon below it, he found the Zorg and took it on. He overloaded it with slaves, placed 12 of his own crew on it and made Luke Collingwood, a ship’s surgeon of questionable nautical competence, the captain. A few months later, in August 1781, the Zorg left Accra with “442 slaves, 17 crew, and 1 passenger”, the depraved former governor Robert Stubbs, on board.Kara is particularly skilled at using sources to bring to life the general hell of being trafficked on a slave shipThe Zorg’s journey was fraught. Dysentery – “the flux” – tore through the ship. Scurvy followed. The captain sickened and became delirious, appointing Stubbs to take command. Thus, “a ship full of decay and death was being commanded by a passenger”. Kara is particularly skilled at using contemporaneous sources to bring to life the general hell of being trafficked on a slave ship. The testimony of Alexander Falconbridge, another ship’s surgeon turned abolitionist, is especially powerful. He describes how enslaved people’s skin was often rubbed down to the bone from lying packed close on bare wood, their flesh pinched and torn between the planks. Elsewhere a Liverpool captain’s eyewitness account describes “two Eboe women” who had “by some means got overboard to swim ashore” being devoured by sharks.By late November 1781 the Zorg was miles from Jamaica and short on water. The crew decided to jettison some of the enslaved Africans, who had endured months in the obscene conditions below deck. What drove this unspeakable plan of action was not ensuring the survival of the people on board – the Africans had begged to be allowed to live even without water rations – but economic greed. Maritime insurance did not cover the death of enslaved people from natural causes, but did cover the “necessity” of throwing them overboard for the ship’s safety, for example, in the event of an insurrection. Over the course of several days, the crew drowned “those Africans who would be worth less at auction, either due to gender, age, or state of illness”: the weak, the sick, women and children, including a baby born during the crossing.Back in Liverpool, when the sums were done, Gregson was not pleased with the return on his investment. He filed an insurance claim seeking £30 per lost slave – several thousand pounds today. The insurers declined to pay. In March 1783, Gregson took them to court and won a trial by jury, arguing that the throwing of the slaves overboard was “necessary”.According to Kara, “there is a direct line of causality between the public exposure of the Zorg murders and the first movement to abolish slavery in England”. Twelve days after the trial, an anonymous letter was printed in one of England’s most widely read newspapers. The author, who claimed to have been in court when the case was heard, argued compellingly against slavery, with the case of the Zorg as prime example of its evil. Equiano read the letter and took it to Granville Sharp, an abolitionist friend, who filed a motion for a new trial. At a hearing to decide whether to proceed, the events on board the Zorg were reviewed with a forensic level of detail: exactly what the abolitionists had hoped for.In spring 1787, the founding members of the Society for the Purpose of Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade first met. Over the subsequent years, they wrote letters, made speeches, organised petitions, lobbied parliamentarians and aristocrats and meticulously documented the particulars of the slave trade through archival research and fieldwork. “Their efforts,” writes Kara, “would lay a blueprint for the pursuit of social justice.” In 1807, after years of setbacks, the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was finally passed.The story of the Zong slave ship: a mass murder masquerading as an insurance claimRead moreWho or what should get credit for the abolition of the slave trade is a matter of debate. That the Zorg was influential is evident in JMW Turner’s painting, The Slave Ship, initially titled Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, which was inspired by the events of 1781. Turner exhibited it in London in 1840 to coincide with the first World Anti-Slavery Convention. While slavery has been near-universal in human culture, its abolition following a sustained civil mass campaign was unprecedented, and an affirmation of the power of the pen, persistence and moral courage.Unlike in his other work – including Pulitzer finalist Cobalt Red, which meticulously documented human rights abuses in the mines of Congo – Kara has had to fill in some gaps in the historical record. Imaginative flourishes sit awkwardly next to rigorously researched accounts, and the book has a chimeric feel. Part thriller, part serious nonfiction – whatever it is, The Zorg effectively illuminates one of the darkest chapters in our history, using powerful storytelling and documented fact to assemble a portrait that haunts the reader long after finishing it.The Zorg: A Tale of Greed, Murder and the Abolition of Slavery by Siddharth Kara is published by Doubleday (£22).

As a result, the photo shoot was never conducted.”Months later, towards the end of March, Nelson contacted Taylor to request that she pose for a photoshoot “with the express intention that the resulting images … would be published exclusively in the July 2025 issue of Vogue Portugal”, court documents state.Taylor agreed to pose but “at no point” authorised or licensed Nelson the right to make any other commercial use beyond the exclusive magazine issue, the complaint alleged.The photoshoot occurred in May and the images from that shoot appeared in the July issue of Vogue Portugal as planned.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHowever, on 4 September Nelson sent Taylor and Ubaldi a presentation of selected images that Nelson indicated she wanted to sell as “fine art prints” on her websites.“Immediately” after receiving Nelson’s proposal, Ubaldi informed Nelson that Taylor objected to such use of her image and explained that Nelson did not have Taylor’s licence or permission to sell the photos as “fine art prints” or “zines” and that “the only permitted use of the same had been for inclusion in Vogue Portugal”.Taylor alleged that Nelson was “well aware of [her] antipathy to such an expanded exploitation of her image” and that no agreement existed authorising Nelson to sell copies of the photoshoot, the court documents state.Nelson continued to seek a licence from Taylor, who “rejected each such request, and no such agreement was ever reached”, the documents state.Making Taylor’s rejection of Nelson’s “efforts to exploit the [photoshoot for] commercial purposes perfectly clear”, Ubaldi wrote to Nelson on 15 September: “We are not interested in a buyout of these images … I cannot be clearer about this – [Taylor] does not want you to sell images of her face, or her body as fine art prints.Amyl and the Sniffers win song of the year at 2025 Apra awardsRead more“If you had been transparent with her in advance of the shoot about your desire/intentions to sell the photos, she would have said no to the shoot. If you had any notion or desire to sell pictures of [Taylor] to recoup your costs, you should have disclosed this beforehand. We simply would have said no to the shoot.”But on 20 September, Taylor discovered that Nelson was selling “fine art prints” containing the pictures on her website and using the photos to promote her commercial enterprises, court documents state.“Moreover, after the foregoing interactions, [Nelson] expanded their exploitation … by offering a specially designed ‘zine’ that consisted exclusively of both published and unpublished images from the Vogue Portugal article,” the complaint stated.“Not only was this done without Ms. Taylor’s permission and in direct contravention of her wishes, but it appears to have been done in retaliation of Ms. Taylor’s demands that [Nelson] stop their unlawful exploitation of Ms. Taylor’s name, image and likeness for [her] commercial interest,” it alleged.Nelson’s Instagram and Facebook accounts continue to feature Taylor’s images without licence or authorisation from her, the complaint alleges.The complaint stated that “fans recognize Ms. Taylor’s likeness for its rebellious spirit and blend of a distinctive Australian ‘pub rock’ aesthetic – featuring mullets, footy shorts, and an unrefined style – with the style of 1970s punk”.“Accordingly, Ms. Taylor has built a substantial fan following based upon not only her musical talent, but also her image and personal brand.”The complaint alleges Nelson’s use of Taylor’s image has been likely to “cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive” regarding Taylor’s endorsement of Nelson’s commercial activities.It also alleges Taylor will “continue to suffer” harm, including “lost profits and damages to her reputation, brand, and business interests”.Nelson told the Guardian that as the matters were before a court it would not be appropriate to comment publicly but added that she denied the allegations and would address all claims through the proper legal process.Explore more on these topicsAmyl and the SniffersAustralian musicShareReuse this content"

He called the friend several unprintable names while acknowledging: “I’m only calling you that because culturally that’s how I know how to express myself.” The friend’s reply to the torrent of insults: “I hear you and I receive that.” The whole thing, Shabazz says, made him “miss the good old days, when men handled beef like men”.The bit encapsulates a dilemma of modern masculinity – how attempts at enlightenment battle with alpha-male impulses. On social media, the manosphere clamors for our attention, extolling traditional masculine virtues such as authority, protein powder and the stamping-out of empathy. Meanwhile, other voices point out the absurdity of that image and call for thoughtful, emotionally attuned understanding of manhood.In short: it’s a ridiculous time to be male. And that’s good news for a genre of social media comedy that has emerged between the Hims ads. If 2024 was the year ofthoughtful masculine standup, 2025 was the year of the self-mocking man sketch.Comedy from standup toSaturday Night Livehas long found fertile ground in shifting notions of masculinity. But in the past few years, comedians have developed followings with short sketches that cast them as flailing young men, stumbling their way through social situations that threaten their identities or expose them as clueless try-hards. And like all good comedy, they also expose a truth – in this case, about the absurd and contradictory experience of manhood in the 2020s.Some sketches emphasize the weirdness of male friendship.In one, a woman teaches a group of guys how to be real friends (“I learned that texting your friends just to check in is nice and not totally weird,” says one). Inanother, a man is on cloud nine after a friend makes a shockingly intimate request: “text me when you get home.” Other sketches tackleself-importance(like the guy who says “partner” instead of “girlfriend”), mockmale fragility(“how do you get the algorithm to respect you?”), or riff on theperformative maletrope. Then there are parodies of various iterations of man in 2025 – the insufferablefinance bro, for instance, or the “grown man convinced he has haters” – “lions don’t lose sleep over the opinions of sheep,” he informs us.As society interrogates masculinity, so do these comedians. Sample question: is it OK for guys to love board games?This is the quandary at the heart of aSahib Singh sketchthat begins with him deeply invested in a game of Wingspan, a board game about birds. When his friends point out his enthusiasm – “he’s smiling!” – he backtracks in a panic: “I hate board games. I hate birds, too. I only know about indigo buntings ‘cause I used to hunt them.” On his way home, he asks ChatGPT if it’s OK for men to “enjoy board games a lot” and flees from a female friend who encourages emotional honesty. In his rush to escape, he’s knocked down by a passing car; lying on the street, he types another question into ChatGPT: “Is it gay to get hit by a car?”Like others in the genre, the sketch confronts what another comedian, Robert Webb, has described as the fundamental definition of traditional masculinity: “the pursuit of not being a woman.” Singh, who has more than a million TikTok followers, and his fellow comics play with self-doubt and the conflict between our internal selves and the carefully crafted personas we show the world – a particular problem for insecure men, but surely one everyone can relate to. And as is often the case in these sketches, the comedian plays a version of himself. When you’re the target of your own joke, you can be brutally honest and win some understanding from the audience at the same time.Dan Carney, another prominent TikTok comedian, also routinely plays himself – or at least someone with the same name – as in anaccountof his visit to a Pride parade as the straight boyfriend of a bisexual woman that’s received more than half a million views. In a series of cringe-inducing attempts to demonstrate his allyship, as he asks attendees awkward questions and demands to have his picture taken, he embarrasses his partner. “She didn’t even want me to come,” he says proudly. “I insisted.”“I don’t want the joke to be at anybody else’s expense but my own,” Carney, who generally plays a naive, buffoonish version of himself, says in an interview. “Playing a well-meaning character allows me and the audience to explore a subject matter earnestly and without feeling like anybody’s under attack.”Carney says he’s not focused on making a statement – but he does find masculinity funny. Much of that humor derives from insecurity, as in Singh’s sketch. Inanotherof Carney’s videos, he hires a private investigator to determine whether he’s gay. He also points to the gap between social media and reality: “I mean, it’s gotten so ridiculous,” he says. “As a man, I’ll go online and I’ll doomscroll, and there will be some jacked guy telling me that I’m not working hard enough, and usually I’m, like, eating a Crunchwrap Supreme in bed at 2am.” And what’s always funny to him, he says, is people who take themselves too seriously.These self-serious, bro comedians nowadays are funny for reasons that they’ll never understandDan LicataThat’s the kind of man the comedian and actor Eric Rahill has spent years parodying: the guy who posts narcissistic messages about his triumphs and struggles, all under the guise of motivating the masses. “To everyone who’s ever dealt with depression – this is for you,” Rahill says in oneclip, before doing a huge number of possibly fake pullups.In another, he sits in a boat drinking: “Italy, wine and a new relationship with God. Life is good,” he says, before noting that later that day he nearly killed all his friends after “I severely overestimated my boating abilities trying to impress my guy friends”.Rahill is among the early practitioners of this style of social media comedy; the pullup clip was posted to TikTok in 2021. And of course, this recent crop of self-mocking man clips didn’t emerge out of nowhere. They have a predecessor, for instance, in the YouTube and Vine videos of Rahill’s collaborator Conner O’Malley, who has played characters ranging from ared-pilled YouTuberto a very sadAI “entrepreneur”. Meanwhile, SNL has frequently parodied modern manhood in sketches like“Man Park”, where women take their male partners to a dog-park equivalent to try to socialize them, and“Straight Male Friend”, in which Bowen Yang celebrates having a simple-minded dope around. Andthe film Friendship, in which Tim Robinson’s desperate character tries to win the approval of a cooler guy, might be considered a long-form version of a social media sketch.View image in fullscreenA still from Friendship.Photograph: Republic Pictures/PAOthers have blended the forms; the comedian Dan Licata – another O’Malley collaborator – filmed a standup special,For the Boys, last year in front of a crowd of teenage boys at his own high school, as a character whose sense of humor, rich in dick jokes, has never quite matured beyond that age. Interspersed amid the set are brief sketches in which he, a man who once broke both his legs jumping off a roof, tries to “impart wisdom” to today’s teens as they prepare for illustrious careers. “Dumb masculinity, I think, is very funny,” Licata says in an interview. “A lot of these self-serious, bro comedians nowadays are funny for reasons that they’ll never understand.”The ascent of too many self-serious bros has inspired plenty of legitimate concern over the future of young men,seduced by the manosphereandswinging to the political right. But self-mocking man comedy offers an alternative narrative of modern masculinity: it’s a study in conflicting demands and expectations, a clash between honesty and performance. These comedians’ ability to poke fun at themselves is, if nothing else, testament to a self-awareness that my gender sorely needs.Explore more on these topicsComedyMenSaturday Night LivefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A new millennium was dawning. What could possibly go wrong?Bidisha MamataTue 30 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShare‘We wish you peace,” said Tony Blair as the clock struck 8pm. It was New Year’s Eve 1999, a Friday night, and I was on the banks of the Thames. Britain’s fresh-faced prime minister – only two years into the job – was giving a gimmick called The British Airways London Eye its first spin. The Eye was physically unremarkable and harrowingly slow, but it didn’t matter because it only had a five-year lease and definitely wouldn’t still be around a quarter of a century later, littering the skyline.It was the end of the 90s and, as the Thatcher/Major doldrums whizzed out of view like the subplot of Sliding Doors, we maintained a Bridget Jones-like innocence and entrusted the future to guys like Blair, Peter Mandelson and Bill Clinton, who didn’t seem like (respectively) warmongers, abuse excusers or sex pests.Earlier that evening I’d popped a CD into the stereo – The Writing’s on the Wall, by a young group called Destiny’s Child – and bish-bosh-bashed a snack by a new telly chef called Jamie Oliver. On the tube on my way there I’d read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and wondered if there would be a film adaptation.The 90s had been absolutely fabulous and the 2000s were going to be amazing. It was the era of exotic “inventions” like cappuccino, pesto and hummus, and of going to parties in Soho lofts, hosted by a fashion editor/DJ/record label PR.That night in particular, as we linked arms, sang the only five words of Auld Lang Syne that we knew and gasped at the fly-past by Concorde, BA’s most famous and surely enduring jet, we could smell the future and it smelt of J’Adore, by Dior.I was dressed to kill, in a long tan leather coat, boot-cut black leather trousers, fake Timberland boots, a pointed-collar burgundy shirt, a stretchy plastic choker and a little bag from Kookai, managing to channel The Craft, Austin Powers, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and all four members of All Saints, simultaneously.After four hours of riverside anticipation and low-key sexual harassment in the thousands-strong crowd, Big Ben bonged, the fireworks went off and my friends and I cheered in the new year and wished strangers – an interesting mix of streetwise young locals, wholesome touristy families with kids and smiley international couples – all the best for the coming years’ peace and plenty. It took ages to escape the crush, but we eventually found ourselves in Chinatown. Like something from a feelgood romcom, we saw a brightly lit, delicious-smelling restaurant, its windows steamed up and its corner booth free. The lady who ran it gave us double portions, serving pak choi to my friend Elliot with the words, “Eat it, it’s Chinese Viagra. You’ll like it, big man.”Replenished, we wandered the streets and found a fully functional Dodgems ride, its music bleeping, its bulbs flashing. And, standing right there, a group of tracksuited guys who were the perfect blend of hot, forward and nice. They asked if we wanted to team up, so we all played on the Dodgems until dawn.It was great, and it was typical. Nights like that weren’t just possible then, they were common. And honestly, what’s wrong with it? Fireworks, a meal, fresh air and a funfair: forgo the champagne and it’s an eight-year-old’s perfect day.When the night was over, the decade was done. “Dawn of a New Millennium” said the Saturday Guardian’s front page, with a photograph of a fragile-looking Earth. I took the tube home, hit the sofa and snoozed through my £25 DVD of The Matrix. What a bleak prognostication: a global population destroys the planet and spends all its time in an escapist online fantasy world powered by soul-sucking AI that regards humans as nothing more than fuel for the simulation. As if!I’d been afraid that the millennium bug would reset all computer systems back to the year 1900 and everyone’s brains would explode. But no, Dale Winton was on TV announcing the Saturday night lottery numbers, as scheduled. Full of optimism, I opened my Muji notebook and started my diary entry: “01/01/00”.Explore more on these topicsThe millenniumMy big night outNew yearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The only real rule is to keep things to just one bite – no one wants to be manoeuvring a fork, after all. “People just want a big hug of comfort food with a decadent twist,” says Max Bergius, founder ofSecret Smokehousein east London. “If you’ve got a bit of smoked salmon left, get that on blinis and top with lumpfish caviar, which is only £2-£3 per 50g pot.” Mini fishcakes would also be just the ticket: “Whether you’ve got leftover smoked haddock or hot smoked salmon, fold it through mashed potato, mix with dill, lemon and fried leeks, then roll in panko and deep-fry.”Ella could also have a ball with croquetas, too, says Nieves Barragàn Mohacho, chef-director ofSaborandLegado, both in London. “Make the bechamel up to three days ahead, then use leftover ham or chicken, or mushrooms, for the filling. Whizz old bread into crumbs to coat, then fry.” Sausage roll fillings are, of course, another natural home for those crumbs, or use them as a jacket for chicken pieces, says Joanna Brennan, co-founder ofPump Street Bakeryin Orford, Suffolk. “Seasoning-wise, all you need is a bit of lemon zest and thyme, and they’ll sing so much more.” Incidentally, she adds, croissants make excellent crumbs, too: “You know how people use cornflakes to bread chicken? Well, croissant crumbs are also delicious.” (As are croissant crisps: “Thinly slice croissants, bake low and slow, then dip in melted chocolate flavoured with orange zest.”)One of Luke Ahearne’s “favourite things” at this time of year is a leftovers sandwich, and that doesn’t have to stop post-Boxing Day, says the chef atMotorinoin London: “Get some ham and turkey in an airtight container and freeze.” While you’re at it, set aside some cranberry sauce and honey ham glaze in the fridge. Come 30 January, defrost the meat, then pop in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven with the reserved glaze for 20 minutes. “Cool and slice thinly, then lay on top of some sourdough and start building sandwiches with lots of cranberry sauce. Cut into bite-sized pieces and, honestly, it’s a winner.” Leftover turkey, meanwhile, could be turned into a spicy, crisp salad, says Luke Selby, chef partner ofPale Hallin Wales: “There’s always a bit of turkey leg left over, and it’s perfect for something punchy.” Shred the meat, then crisp slowly in a pan, and toss with leftover cranberry sauce loosened with lime juice, a spoonful of soy and a little chilli oil. “Finish with fresh herbs [coriander and mint, say] and some sliced spring onion, and serve in little gem leaves.”Veg, meanwhile, can be scrubbed up and ready to party with a big batch of bubble and squeak. “Mix all your leftover veg with herbs, then season and add flour,” Ahearne says. Stamp out to “roughly the size of blinis”, then store in the freezer. “Refresh in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 10 minutes and top with whatever you like – perhaps roast beef and grated horseradish?” Word to the wise, though: save a stash for brunch the next day.Got a culinary dilemma?

I like to include this as part of a spread of mixed hot and cold dishes – a jolly, festive update on cheese and pineapple on a stick (which is admittedly hard to improve on). Then, a high-impact, low-effort dish: za’atar roast carrots with labneh and pistachio. On a whim, I hung a carton’s worth of plain yoghurt in muslin for labneh the other week, and now I can’t stop – it takes just 30 minutes for a soft-set, which is what you want here (for a firmer set, leave it to hang for an hour).Hot halloumi platter with pineapple salsa (pictured top)To get ahead, keep the cut pineapple in a large bowl in the fridge, the chopped mint and chilli in a small bowl, and the red onion and lime juice in another small bowl. Mix just before serving.Prep20 minCook15 minServes6, as asnack or side1 smallripepineapple, peeled, cored and cut into small chunks1 small red onion,peeled and very finely chopped1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped15g mint, leaves picked and finely choppedFinely grated zest and juice of1-2 limesA pinch of sea salt flakes½tbsp olive oil2225ghalloumi, patted dry and cut into ½cm-thick slicesIn a bowl, mix the pineapple, onion, chilli, chopped mint and lime zest, then add the lime juice and salt a little at the time, tasting as you go, until the flavours are nice and punchy (depending on how juicy they are, you may not need both limes).Heat the oven to 70C (50C fan)/gas very low. Put your largest frying pan on a medium heat, add a little olive oil, then lay in a single layer of the sliced halloumi. Fry for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown and crisp, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and put in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining halloumi in batches.To serve, arrange the hot halloumi on a platter, dress it with the pineapple salsa (you will not need it all) and serve immediately.Za’atar roast carrots with labneh and pistachiosView image in fullscreenRukmini Iyer’s za’atar roast carrots with labneh and pistachios.This is a lovely dish to serve as part of a meze spread, It can also all be prepared in advance, and put together at the last minute.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4500g natural yoghurt1kg carrots, peeled and cut diagonally into 1cm slices2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2tbsp za’atar45ml olive oil1tsp flaky sea salt2tsp maple syrup75g pistachiosJuice of ½ lemon1 small handful fresh mint leaves(optional)Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Tip the yoghurt into a muslin or clean cloth set over a sieve, bring the corners of the cloth together and gently twist so the yoghurt is completely encased in a ball. Fasten with string (or a rubber band) and tie to a cupboard handle with a bowl underneath to catch the liquid.Meanwhile, tip the sliced carrots into a large roasting tin (they should almost sit in one layer), then toss through the garlic, za’atar, olive oil and salt. Cover tightly with tinfoil and roast for 20 minutes.Remove the foil, drizzle over the maple syrup, then return to the oven for a final 10 minutes. At the same time, pop the pistachios on a baking tray, and put them on a lower shelf of the oven to toast (if your oven is fierce, rescue them after six to eight minutes). Roughly chop the toasted pistachios into chunky pieces.When you want to serve, warm through the carrots for 10 minutes in the oven, if need be. Untwist the cloth, spread the labneh over a platter and arrange the carrots on top. Squeeze over the lemon juice, scatter over the pistachios and mint leaves, if using, and serve warm or at room temperature.Explore more on these topicsNew yearQuick and easyFoodSnacksCheeseFruitStarterVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

They arrived in Spain in the 16th century, through trade with Flanders, and were often paired with pork, which we love. Here, however, I caramelise them with onion, thyme and sweet vinegar, then serve on crisp baguette with soft cheese and pine nuts. A small bite with big flavour, and just right with a glass of oloroso – perfect for festive times.Caramelised brussels sprout andpancetamontaditosPrep15 minCook35 minMakesAbout 20 canapes1 tbsp olive oil125g sliced panceta(Spanish bacon), or pancetta, finely chopped1 medium onion, peeled and finely sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced300g brussels sprouts, finely sliced3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped2 tbsp sweet apple vinegar2 tbsp soft light brown sugarSalt and black pepper20 slices fresh baguette150-200g soft curd cheese, whipped, or whipped cream cheese50g pine nuts, toastedHeat the oil in a large frying pan, then fry the chopped panceta for about five minutes, until golden and crisp.

Every year, an estimated684 millionpeople globally come down with it.Norovirus is a kind of infectious gastroenteritis, “an inflammation of the bowel and the colon that can cause diarrhea” and vomiting, explains Dr Ambreen Allana, an infectious disease physician based in Texas.Norovirus can spread year-round, but has earned the nickname “winter vomiting illness” because it peaks from December to February in the northern hemisphere, says Dr Laraine Washer, medical director of infection prevention and epidemiology at the University of Michigan’s school of medicine.Here’s what you need to know.How does norovirus spread?Norovirus is highly contagious. The virus typically enters the gastrointestinal tract via tiny viral particles from an infected person’s saliva or feces. These particles may end up on your hands, or in food or drink, and ultimately in your mouth – “what we call the fecal-oral route”, Washer says.Particles remain infectious for up totwo weekson hard surfaces like doorknobs and bathroom fixtures, and it takes very little exposure to make you sick. “The infectious dose of noroviruses is less than 20 virus particles,” says Washer. (Covid-19, by contrast, needs an exposure of100-400virus particles to infect.) “When somebody has an active norovirus infection, there’s billions of virus particles per gram of stool,” says Washer.There is also some risk of transmission via aerosolized particles, particularly if you’re around someone while they are experiencing symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting.Norovirus becomes contagious about two days prior to the onset of symptoms, and people can remain contagious for days or even weeks after they’re feeling better.Close quarters such as eldercare facilities, daycares and airports are a “perfect nidus for catching infection”, says Allana. Cruise ships are particularly notorious: the CDC has reported 16 norovirus outbreaks on ships stopping in US ports in 2025 alone.What are the symptoms of norovirus?The onset of norovirus symptoms can feel sudden, starting with abdominal cramping, sweating, chills, nausea, vomiting and “very watery diarrhea”, says Washer. Most cases are “mild” in the medical sense, meaning they resolve within three days.Nonetheless, it’s an extremely unpleasant illness. “People can feel pretty wiped out, fatigued; they may have a low-grade fever, headache. And in most cases, individuals are not able to continue doing their normal activities,” says Washer.Do I need medical care for norovirus?Each year, norovirus causes570-800deaths and70,000hospitalizations in the US, with people over 65 at greatest risk. Those most likely to have severe norovirus are “children less than five years of age, and especially older individuals and those who are immunocompromised”, says Washer.Those in higher-risk age categories are also particularly susceptible to kidney injury due to dehydration from excessive diarrhea, says Allana. If you or a family member is in a higher-risk age category and unable to keep down liquids, Allana recommends seeing your doctor or going to your local emergency department to receive IV fluids.Most adults and older children without underlying conditions recover from norovirus without medical intervention. While the CDCreports2,500 norovirus outbreaks annually in the United States, the actual number of infections is closer to21m– most cases go unreported because people can “deal with their infections at home”, says Washer.While there’s nothing you can do to shorten the duration of a bout of norovirus, it’s important to stay hydrated throughout. “Try drinking the same amount of Gatorade or water as the volume that comes out,” says Allana. “Ice chips, ice lollies – really anything you can keep down that will keep you hydrated.”An antiemetic – medication that prevents nausea and vomiting – like Dramamine may be necessary if you can’t keep liquids down. Do not, however, take medicines that stop diarrhea, like Imodium or Pepto-Bismol, says Washer. “Our body is trying to get rid of the infection, and if we keep the viruses inside … they stick around for longer periods of time,” she says.How can you avoid getting norovirus?We don’t have a norovirus vaccine yet. That’s because norovirus is “incredibly difficult” to grow and study in labs, says Dr Andrea Love, an immunologist and microbiologist who haswrittenabout norovirus on her Substack. The virus has many different strains, which mutate frequently, making broad protection challenging, Love explains.That leaves the basics.Wash your hands:“To prevent or control outbreaks, good handwashing is important for everyone,” advises a representative from the CDC via email. “Importantly, infected individuals should not prepare or handle food, or care for others when they are sick.”Hand sanitizer and other alcohol-based disinfectants do not work against norovirus, because of how the virus is structured. “You can use hand sanitizers in addition to handwashing, but hand sanitizer alone does not work well against norovirus and is not a substitute for handwashing,” according to the CDC spokesperson.Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, with good-quality soap, for at least 20 seconds, says Allana.Avoid using an infected person’s bathroom:If possible, designate a separate bathroom for the sick person in your household until they recover, and limit other contact, Washer suggests.Clean affected items:Clean surfaces with diluted bleach (1 cup per gallon of water) or undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide, both of which can kill norovirus. Wear disposable gloves when cleaning a bathroom where someone has been sick, and take reasonable precautions when working with strong chemicals, says Washer.When travelling, such as on an airplane, use a paper towel when touching surfaces like the washroom tap and door handle.Strong chemical agents are required to kill norovirus, and most disinfecting wipes don’t do the trick. But you may be able to find specialized bleach wipes at medical supply stores. Wear protective gloves while using them, and leave them on any contaminated surface for a few minutes.As forlaundry, wash and dry contaminated items separately on hot (norovirus can survive temperatures up to 158F or 70C), with bleach if possible. Running a bleach cycle of the washer in between loads won’t hurt.Avoid communal dining:Take extra steps to limit exposure. Buffets and potlucks pose particular risks, since multiple people handle serving utensils, and food comes from different kitchens. “If you really want to decrease your risk, avoiding potlucks around this time of year might be helpful,” Washer says.If you do get norovirus, continue taking precautions after recovery, and don’t assume immunity will protect you for long. “We don’t develop robust memory immunity to norovirus,” says Love. “People can become infected by norovirus every few months because of that.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyNorovirusHealthDoctorsInfectious diseasesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Some of my earliest memories feature my mother’s leotard-encased body bouncing to Jane Fonda with abandon. A similar carefree fluidity prevailed a decade later, as her feet struck hard-packed sand on a shorebreak jog. Twelve-year-old me panted alongside, so desperate to be made in her image that I tolerated heated cheeks and shaking quads. Their trembling barely subsided during the one stop we made, for her to wade into the waves and pee.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But it got easier to keep up after she gave birth to my youngest brother, with her squatting in the bushes every 10 minutes or so. Soon, even that wasn’t enough to staunch the flow. She gave up and switched to hiking. “I should have done more Kegels,” she quipped.And that’s how I learned – before I’d even taken the SAT – about the repetitive undercarriage squeezing recommended for millions of Americans.I tried everything to fix my incontinence. Here’s what workedRead moreI recently learned something else: women don’t have to live like this.Arnold Kegel was born in Iowa in 1894 and by the mid-20th century, he was a professor of gynecology in southern California. For context, in 1948 the New York Obstetrical Societyrefused to admitwomen, and as late as 1970only 7%of gynecologists were female. So it makes sense that a man created “the vaginal manometer” to record the strength of contractions of thepelvic floor muscles.They weaken over time as a result of things like surgery, pregnancy, vaginal delivery, smoking, and just plainageing while female. Kegel is credited with first describing how exercising these muscles canreduce the type of urinary incontinence that comes with a stressor, like aerobics or jogging on the beach.If only it were as simple as that sounds.Eventually it was my turn for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). After five pregnancies and three deliveries, coughing while walking would leave me in want of fresh panties. I told my friends I could walk without peeing and I could cough without peeing, but stood no chance against two abdominal stressors at once. “Have you done your Kegels?” they’d ask.A few more years ticked by, and after a lap at the track I’d be so wet that it looked like I’d put my pants on over a damp bathing suit. “You’ve been doing Kegels though, right?” a friend texted in response to one of my pandemic-era rants.View image in fullscreen‘I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels.’Photograph: DragonImages/Getty Images/iStockphotoEventually, I started paying about $90 a month to access online videos involving hip lifting and squeezing. I only did it once. By the time I turned 43, I had to wear black leggings on my Sunday morning runs so the dark outline that extended all the way to my knees wouldn’t be so stark.I never mentioned my incontinence at a doctor’s appointment, and no one asked. I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels. I was the one who’d signed up for the course and not done my homework so I didn’t question the narrative of midlife incontinence being a mixture of my fault and my destiny. But what if I should have? What if a catastrophic failure of women’s health and wellness has occurred?Spoiler alert: I should have, it has, and once I figured that out, a few quick office visits changed my life.No more suffering in silenceThe first part of my story, the silent suffering, is hardly unique. About45% to 50%of women experience SUI at least once a week. Think of it this way: If you make 10 of us skip rope, at least four will later slink off to a bathroom to wrap toilet paper around the crotch of our undies. But not to a doctor’s office, research suggests.One reportestimates that for every case of incontinence reported to primary care doctors, 20 go unreported. Transgender men on hormone therapy also often experience SUI,according topreliminary research. Some cis men struggle with SUI too, usually after treatment for prostate cancer, butmany, many fewerof them.For years, I just sucked it up, idiomatically and also literally, with the tissues I carried everywhere. Then one Sunday in February of 2024, something clicked. I’d run a 10K, rather than my usual 5K, on a path way out by the water, too far to make it home to change beforechurch. Tissues it is then. The entryway smelled like urine, but I didn’t think much of it, with all the older folks there to worship. The elevator also reeked. As I moved through more spaces, a terrible realization swept over me. I whispered in my husband’s ear: “Is that odor me?” His widened, almost guilt-ridden eyes were my answer.Later that same evening, I sat in bed, showered and fresh. Until I sneezed. After a few moments of disbelief, staring down at my wet pajama shorts, I decided enough was enough. The next morning, I called University of California, San Francisco’s Women’s Center for Bladder and PelvicHealth.“I can’t even do one thing without peeing any more,” I told Dr Michelle Van Kuiken, less than two weeks later. Apparently, I had four main options: (1) pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which is more than Kegels, but also, is Kegels, (2) the Poise Impressa, a tampon-like contraption you caninsert into your vaginain order to “gently lift and support the urethra”, according to its promotional materials, (3) bulking agent, sort of like lip fillers, but injected into the tissues of the urethra to make the opening smaller, and (4) the “sling”, a gold-standard surgery that creates a hammock for the urethra.Is that odor me?I quickly ruled out PFMT, having written “do Kegels” on my to-do list for the previous seven years and not getting them to-done. The second option seemed silly, given the bedtime incident. Was I supposed to sprint to the bathroom cabinet for an Impressa when I felt a sneeze coming on? The surgerycouldlast medecades (only about 2.5% of women need a new one after 10 years and less than 20% have re-upped at 15 years), but it would require general anesthesia with its attendant risks, and I wouldn’t be able to exercise for two weeks or have sex for at least four. Exercise is my antidepressant! So is sex!That left the fillers, what doctors call a “submucosal bulking agent”. Dr Van Kuiken’s staff made a quick call to my insurance company for approval, and told me I could receive the injection the same day.She warned me that it could end up taking me longer to pee and asked what would bug me more: that delay or leakage? She also offered a heads-up that it would hurt. I figured short-term pain sucks, but after childbirth, I can handle it. And you know what would suck more? Ending up like my grandma, whose bulky adult diapers made a crinkling sound when she sat, yet still weren’t effective enough for her to be comfortable in public. Not wanting that kind of isolation, I decided fillers were worth a try.View image in fullscreen‘I decided enough was enough. The next morning, I called UCSF’s Center for Bladder and Pelvic Health.’Photograph: Catherine McQueen/Getty ImagesWith my feet in stirrups and a drape spread over my knees, the ghost of pap smears past floated in the air. Starting the same way my IUD insertions had, Dr Van Kuiken first injected lidocaine to numb my urethra and its surrounding tissues. That burned some, like a vaccine, only unfortunately placed. While we waited for it to take effect, she explained that my urethra was sort of like a deflated, doughnut-shaped pool float. By spacing four injections just right, she could plump it up without leaving a low side. Now, those injections? Those hurt quite a bit: Think bee sting plus bikini wax for at least 15 seconds each. Still, when they were done, they were done. The whole thing was no worse than a facial laser treatment likebroadband light therapy, and I soon walked comfortably home.The next day, I went for a run with the aforementioned baby brother, who’s now 31. Nothing. Not a drop. At the tail end of a jog with one of my teenage daughters a few weeks later, I tried to sprint and felt a familiar dribble. So I went back to Dr Van Kuiken, and four weeks after the initial procedure she injected about 30% more Bulkamid. (It’s not uncommon for women to need a “top-off” injection to achieve results and durability.)I hardly realized I’d come to fear leakage, until all of a sudden I didn’t. I had no idea my gait had changed to try to minimize wetness, until my stride lengthened in the months after the procedures. The way I held my abdomen shifted, as did my times, soon matching my high school best, and then faster. I started running more – and having more fun doing it. It’s been more than a year now, and I’ve completed seven half marathons on trails up and down mountains. Without. A. Drop. And straight to church I can go, with nary a worry or a tissue.In other words, a quick, safe, minimally invasive, andcost-effectiveprocedure eliminated my incontinence and significantly improved my quality of life. And here’s the kicker: When Dr Van Kuiken did my physical exam, after I’d already chosen fillers, she said: “Your pelvic floor is actually really strong. No amount of Kegels was going to fix this for you.”View image in fullscreen‘A quick, safe, minimally invasive, and cost-effective procedure eliminated my incontinence.’Photograph: Jay Boncodin/Courtesy of Gail CornwallWhy don’t more women know about treatment options?It took me years to get good care, but more than that, years to even find out a solution existed. It doesn’t have to be this way. As one group of researcherssummed it up: “SUI is not part of normal ageing and can be remedied.”But most women don’t know that. One studysuggeststhat less than 15% of those bothered by SUI receive an injection or surgery. Anecdotally, that statistic rings true: every last one of the people I told about my procedures said they had no idea such a thing was possible.You’d think that’s because the FDA onlyapprovedBulkamid in 2020, but bulking agentswere first usedin the 1930s. Innovations in the late 80s made them a more viable option, and now, they can sometimes last 96 months or more for those who are eligible. (Doctors won’t inject bulking agent if, for example, you have an active urinary tract infection.) That can mean eight years of staying dry, or much drier, while belly laughing or lifting a squirmy baby. Most women also don’t know that using synthetic mesh in sling operations starting in 1996 eliminated the need for an abdominal incision and an overnight stay. They don’t know that hormonescan affectSUI. We just don’t know.We believe Kegels are it. As it turns out, Dr Van Kuiken is a big fan of PFMT as a risk-free option. But its efficacy for SUI depends on the cause and severity of the incontinence. What’s more, that acronym encapsulates a lot of different practices, so different thatresearchers don’t actually knowhow effective PFMT is. PFMT with biofeedback, for example,has been shown towork better than without it. In plain English, that means Kegel-like therapiescanworkfor SUI, but doctors don’t know how often or how well theydowork, especially since the exercises can be time-consuming. Inone study, researchers asked women to do exercises for45 minutes a day. I’m not the only one for whom that’s never going to happen. As one friend put it in a text: “They just told me to do kegals which I don’t.”And shame keeps women from learning about other options. Women who do come forward are often told to lose weight or cut out alcohol or sweeteners. Sometimes they’re instructed to drink more water, sometimes less. Sometimes to avoid tea,but maybeadd in decaffeinated coffee. Each of these “behavioral and lifestyle” recommendations can be read to imply that a woman is suffering because she’s been lazy or made bad decisions about what she puts in her mouth.That feels gendered. When men have a quality-of-life issue, we try to fix it. (Hello, Viagra.) When women have a problem, we tell them they wouldn’t if they’d just been a bit better and tried a bit harder, and also, to just deal. (Combine those Kegels with “belted undergarments” and priceymed-spa treatments, ladies!) I’m exaggerating somewhat, but also, there arereal disparitiesin funding for research on women’s health, female inclusion in clinical trials, and more.For me, finally receiving the right care was life-altering. After yearning to be just like my mother for so long, starting to pee myself seemed like a particularly embarrassing case of “be careful what you wish for.” But not any more. Now, I’m high and dry, even on a trampoline.When my bulking injections wear off in a few years, I’ll probably ask for more. Although, maybe I’ll be like my mom, who at age 75 hops on to the treadmill unworried. She got the sling surgery.Explore more on these topicsWomenWomen's healthHealthAgeingHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the column ends, here’s what has struck and surprised herPamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 30 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTSharePeople find it so hard to talk about sex, so if someone takes the time to sit down and write a question, then send it to the Guardian for me to answer, I always regard that as a great privilege. In the 20 years of writing the column, I have been reminded how many people are still out there, living their lives in quiet desperation about something that’s really troubling them sexually. Often the solution is more education; they just need to learn something, or be helped to be more open about a problem.So many people grow up without the message that sex is healthy and important for a person’s quality of life, and they feel guilty every time they have sex, or think a sexual thought. They haven’t been able to enjoy sexuality and discover who they really are. Sometimes, it’s not the sexuality that is causing someone’s problem, it’s societal notions – prioritising monogamy, for instance – that makes life difficult. One of the things I would have liked to have addressed more was sexuality when people have serious disabilities or illness. Many people think they can’t continue to be sexual beings, and often that idea is pushed by people around them – that, to me, is tragic.As the column went on, I did start to notice that readers seemed to have a greater understanding of sexual issues. There has been a welcome change in acceptance of people’s gender identity, and so that would sometimes come into the questions more frequently too. The social environment has changed, including the rise of dating apps and people hooking up casually, but essentially, the basic issues have remained pretty similar.As the Sexual Healing column comes to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for all your questions over the past 20 years. Here are some of the things they have taught me.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Hannah Robinson/The GuardianThe most common question hasn’t changedLow desire continues to be something people struggle with, especially when there is a mismatch between partners. This situation is very problematic if someone wants to continue having sex but their partner is no longer interested. Other sexual issues come and go, but that one has been a constant.People separate sex from relationshipsI have noticed issues around intimacy. I’ve had a lot of questions that were phrased in such a way that I realised many people separate sexuality from relationships. They’re comfortable seeking and having casual sex, but when they try to make a switch to something more long term, that tended to be when they would write to me, because they don’t quite know how to do that. But sexuality is not a constant throughout people’s lives. It changes and develops, and people go through all kinds of different stages. Just because you’re experiencing issues with intimacy when you’re 20 and prefer casual sex, where you’re not really revealing anything about yourself or learning anything about your partner, it doesn’t mean that in your 30s you’re not going to be ready for something different.Try to be truly honest about your own needs and accept it, rather than have expectations of what you should likeUnderstanding your own sexuality is keySo often, people compare themselves with others, or they’re looking on the internet, or seeing idealised notions of sexuality and relationships from movies and so on. Sometimes we get a lot of messages about sexuality when we’re growing up; other times there are none. It means that people can start their sexual life confused and find it difficult to navigate. There’s this sense of, “I should be feeling this,” or, “I should be doing this, but it doesn’t really turn me on.” Try to be truly honest about your own needs and accept them, rather than have expectations of what youshouldlike. Once you’ve figured that out, the next step is to be able to make that clear to a partner – and also be able to receive the information about your partner’s needs. Who are they truly, sexually?There’s no such thing as normalI don’t use the word “normal” when talking about sexuality because it suggests that there’s a certain standard. I will sometimes use the word “normative”, often when someone wants a bit of reassurance. When somebody asks: “Is it normal to do this?”, I’ll say: “Well, it’s common.” But I’m not going to describe anything as normal, because there’s such a broad range.The female orgasm is still a mystery to some peopleI’m still getting questions that show me people continue to think that the only “correct” type of female orgasm is one that’s purely vaginal and doesn’t involve the clitoris. For people to still think that, or to have that as the ideal, is extraordinary, but there it is. They just haven’t had the education to understand otherwise.There’s only so far I can goIn clinical work, I’m able to spend time to get a thorough background and understanding of what has led to the issues a person, or couple, is having. I don’t just focus on the sexuality, because everything is connected. With the column, I only ever had fragments of something that the writer was dealing with, and maybe it involved a partner, but I had no information about them, so it was one-sided. I would try to faithfully reply to that person from their perspective, while knowing that there’s always a broader view. Sometimes there was clearly a medical aspect. Very often, I’d get a sense that the person who was writing to me could really benefit from some supplementary hormone treatment. Even if I knew the answer, I couldn’t give advice – I’d have to say: go to a GP.Sex doesn’t have to stop when you reach a certain ageIt has been wonderful that in the past few years I’ve had more questions from people in their 70s, 80s, even 90s, who are very accepting of the fact that they’re still sexual beings. Earlier on, I didn’t really see that. I knew, and many people knew, that people can be sexual until the day they die, but society is ageist.The internet has changed sexWhen I started the column, the digital world wasn’t really something anyone wrote in about. Now, I do have concern about young people’s access to sexual imagery. It means that they don’t necessarily have a realistic notion of sexuality and this can influence their later connections and understanding of their own sexual self. Apps have meant that for many people sex has become more available. For some this is great, but others struggle. Younger people may not learn about intimacy early on, because they get into a pattern of casual hook-ups.BDSM comes out of the closetSomething that I noticed happening was I started getting a lot more questions from people in the BDSM community, and this was really good. That has happened over the past 10 years. I think people are just more comfortable with being more open in those communities. It was very hidden 20 years ago.We’re more accepting of kink …Younger people, especially, are more open to the idea that one shouldn’t “kink shame” others for whatever they are into. I was always glad to help people with those questions. But I think, equally, there are a huge number of people out there who would never write to me with their problem. There’s still a lot of fear and embarrassment about sex that isn’t considered normative. As a society, we’re not moving towards “anything goes”. What does that even mean? There are still parameters and things that have to be considered – boundaries, legality, consent issues that abound – and it all requires education and understanding.… and of polyamorous relationshipsRecently, I’ve had more questions from people wanting answers to problems that emerge in relationships with more than one person – not just the sexual issues, but more often the difficulties negotiating those relationships. Whether they are long term or casual, there are a lot of pitfalls if such relationships aren’t well negotiated and well understood, and if people are not communicating effectively. It would be good if it was more widely discussed.Is love addiction real – and what does it look like?Read moreThere are a huge number of issues that affect sexualityNeurodiversity is still not well understood, in terms of how it relates to issues that some people have with their sexuality. If you can’t focus or you become very distracted, that can really influence your ability to enjoy sex. That’s just one example, but there are myriad reasons why people might have low desire, for instance, and it’s not just a relationship issue. It could be depression, or the effect of bereavement, or a side-effect of medication. Maybe somebody is having erectile difficulty and doesn’t understand that they have early diabetes. There are many ways in which the whole aspect of a person affects one’s sexual self.People are selfish when it comes to sex – and that can be goodI think that people should be selfish to a degree, because if they don’t understand how their own body works they can’t impart that to a partner and help a partner to please them. People need to learn to give and receive pleasure, and sometimes people are not selfish enough: they find it difficult to receive, which often goes back to a deeply ingrained sense of guilt about enjoying sex. There is also pleasure for the giver as well as the receiver – there’s a negotiation that has to occur. So unless people are able to truly receive pleasure, then they’re not going to have a satisfying sex life.As told to Emine SanerExplore more on these topicsSexSexual healingRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Two women sweltering on the top bench seemed to sweat more over my question than over the clouds of sauna steam – the result of a beefy Finn ladling water on the wood-fired coals with a grim determination to broil us all.“Hmmm, yes, it will bring people to Oulu, which is good, but we don’t really know much about it,” said one of the women. “We know it’s happening, but we haven’t had many details.”Outside, queueing for the pleasure of a dip in the frozen river, the question elicited the sort of shrug rarely seen outside France. “We know it’s happening because the posters and signs are everywhere and people are talking about it, but we don’t know exactlywhatis happening,” said another woman, steaming in the sub-zero air.View image in fullscreenOulu can be found on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea.Photograph: VisitOuluThere are many reasons to visit the Finnish city of Oulu, which sits on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea: it hosts theAir Guitar world championships; is home to the world’s onlyScreaming Men’s Choir(20-40 suited, shouty men); and holds the annualPolar Bear Pitchingevent, where would-be business leaders pitch money-spinning ideas while standing in icy water. The presentations tend to be brief.Oulu, Finland’s fifth most populous city, is 100 miles south of the Arctic Circle. It is a short drive from huskies and sled rides; it offers sea, rivers, rapids, lakes, woods, nature trails and reserves; and there is cross-country skiing as well as almost 600 miles of cycle lanes. You can see the midnight sun in summer and the northern lights in winter. It is a leading light in solar power and renewable energy – and it has saunas. Saunas on lakes and on rafts, saunas in hotels, free saunas by the roadside and in most homes. A century ago, 95% of all children were born at home, often in the sauna. Today, most parents-to-be choose a hospital but introduce their offspring to the sauna at an average age of 4.5 months.A survey has declared Finland the world’s happiest country for the eighth successive yearPlus, the Oululainens have a cheery disposition, as do most Finns according to a survey that declared Finland theworld’s happiest countryfor the eighth successive year.These are all positives to attract visitors to this northern Nordic city that began as a settlement on Sami land in the 1600s, then became a trading site for wood tar, salmon and Nokia phones, and is now a European digital hub and a “living laboratory” (where innovations are tested in a real-world environment) for new technologies.View image in fullscreenA floating sauna on the Oulu River.Photograph: Jukka LappalainenSadly, few of these esoteric attractions featured on a trip organised by the city’s Oulu 2026 culture committee, which chose highbrow over the shouty men and pretend guitarists.The city’s diverse €50mCapital of Culture programme, spread across 39 sites and four counties, is aiming to attract up to 2.5 million visitors – 20% up on an average year – with the theme “Cultural Climate Change”. Highlights include a freeFrozen Peopleelectronic music festival, held on the iced-over Bothnian Bay – provided it is frozen next year. Also on the calendar is theLumo Art & Tech festival, plus theArctic Food Lab, celebrating local cuisine (wild fish, berries, mushrooms), and a Sami opera,Ovllá, about the Indigenous people of Sápmi – the local word for Lapland – which covers northern Finland, Norway, Sweden and Russia’s Kola Peninsula.“Its a unique opportunity for Oulu,” said Piia Rantala-Korhonen, chief executive officer of Oulu 2026, who estimates that for every euro spent, there will be a €5 return for the city. “Climate change is already happening and is a big concern here: the ice and snow are disappearing. Last year, we had to cancel the skiing marathon for only the second time in 100 years because there was no snow,” she said.View image in fullscreenAn Arctic Food Lab event, where people sample local delicacies.Photograph: oulu2026Out on Oulu’s unseasonably slushy streets, most locals are cheerfully enthusiastic about 2026. “It will be nice to have people come here and discover our city,” said Matti, a student at one of Oulu’s two universities. “I am looking forward to it.”Thirty meters under the city, you can find the Kivisydän (“stone heart”), a vast state-of-the-art car park that diverts vehicles away from the centre and doubles as a walkway when it rains and an emergency bomb shelter. It is a reminder of Finland’s proximity to Russia and the increasing alarm over its aggressive neighbour since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Behind the Kivisydän’s steel doors, a vast red stone column stands like a beating heart. The car park could house the entire city, our guide told us.But does it have a sauna? I asked.“I don’t think so, but we’re Finns. If necessary, we can build one in a couple of days,” he said.Were I a publicist for Oulu 2026, I would have hired Finland’s best air guitarist to accompany the screaming men with a few riffs while standing in an icy river. Instead, after a traditional salmon soup dinner hosted by the city – followed by a sauna – we were treated to a cosy Norse tale. When 19th-century Oulu sailors became drunk and rowdy on merchant ships carrying tar to Liverpool, local legend has it that the Liverpudlian landlord would urge them to “keep peace”. This is now a popular toast.As we raised glasses of local schnapps, I can think of many exclamations a scouse pub owner might make to an inebriated Finn. “Keep peace” is not one of them. Still, surrounded by the world’s happiest people, it seemed churlish to argue.Then it was off to the sauna.The trip was provided byOulu 2026This article was amended on 30 December 2025. The saunsa was on the Oulu River, not Lake Oulu.Explore more on these topicsFinland holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fight gave him purpose at a difficult time in his life‘I don’t want it to die’: one man’s battle to save the last phone box in his villageEmine SanerTue 30 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareThe caller display flashes up: “Derek in the K6” it reads. On the line is Derek Harris, ringing from the red phone box he saved for his village. When he saw, on the agenda for the parish council meeting, that BT had earmarked it for closure, Harris knew he had to fight it. “It’s fighting for what is valuable, cherished,” hetold mewhen I went to meet him in February, sitting over coffee in a cafe near Sharrington, the Norfolk village that has been his home for more than 50 years, and the phone box for longer. It’s a K6, for Kiosk No 6, designed in 1935 by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.For a few weeks, Harris, then 89, became a media star. One of the criteria for keeping a phone box in use is that at least 52 calls have to be made from it in a year (fewer than 10 had been made in 2024). As the campaign picked up speed, one day a queue of people made more than 230 calls from the K6. Harris sparked a national conversation about the continuing need for kiosks in an age of mobiles. Behind the scenes, he was a tenacious activist, sending constant emails to his MP, councillors, and of course, BT. Some of them included photographs he had taken of BT vans whose engineers were working nearby, as proof the phone box could be easily maintained. In March, BT decided to reverse its decision.Quite a lot of people are getting fed up with being oppressed by big organisationsHarris stresses it was a community effort. “We had the massive turnout” of volunteers to make the calls, he says. And “not just from this village, but from surrounding villages. It would have been impossible to have pulled this thing off had not so many people – local MP, district councillors, everyone – taken up the call to action.” It got national and even global coverage, he thinks, because “it struck a chord. Quite a lot of people are getting fed up with being oppressed by big organisations.”‘I don’t want it to die’: one man’s battle to save the last phone box in his villageRead moreIn February, when I met Harris, I was struck by how he seemed to view the phone box as a living being, with such affection for it. If it had been turned into a library, as other red phone boxes have, it would cease to be. As a functional kiosk, he said, “it would be alive”. I was thinking about this, driving home later that day, when I pulled into a car park for a rest and checked my phone. Harris had emailed me, titled “strictest confidence”, and I read with dismay that he had recently been diagnosed with inoperable cancer. “It struck me that this K6,” he wrote, “designed in the year of my birth, is deserving of being saved from a death sentence.”I asked if I could mention his illness, but he said absolutely not (though he’s consented to me publishing now), that he didn’t want a fuss and certainly didn’t want anyone to think he was using it as a ploy to get sympathy for the campaign. The phone box had value in its own right. The campaign gave Harris a sense of purpose at a time when he was coming to terms with bad news. “It’s been a good achievement,” he says now. “There’s life in the old boy yet.” What does the retained phone box mean to the village? “Oh they’re overjoyed,” he says.Since his victory, Harris has called me a few times over the year, stopping at the telephone kiosk while out on his walk, to say hello, complain about a politician, tell a story or two. It doesn’t hurt to keep the call numbers up. “We had a bit of snow earlier,” he says today, “but I walked here.” What can he see? “There’s open fields, lovely panorama. I’m looking through clear glass.”Not only was the phone box saved, but BT refurbished it in the summer, including a new door and brass hinges. “It looks splendid.” It was done, he jokes, “just in time for my birthday”. Harris turned 90 in July, and was celebrated by his village with a garden party. His card from the parish council featured a picture of his beloved red phone box, and he was given a phone box fridge magnet.Explore more on these topicsCommunities2025: what happened next?Telecommunications industryNorfolkOlder peopleRural affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not a push he needs.When the tide goes out, you see who’s been swimming nakedBerkshire’s insurance business, Geico, has been the key to its expansion over the decades. Its float – money from customers that Berkshire holds until it is needed for payouts – typically comes at a very low cost, and can be used to fund investment.Berkshire’s super-catastrophe (super-cat) insurance business has also been a profitable enterprise, although it faced large losses when disaster struck.In 1992, Hurricane Andrew cost Berkshire $125m, roughly equal to its 1992 super-cat premium income. But other insurers came out worse from what was then the largest insured loss in history, as Buffett wrote:Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)The dangers of derivatives – weapons of mass destructionIn his 2002 letter, Buffett said derivatives were “time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system”. He warned:In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.That warning looked very prescient in 2008, when the “frightening web of mutual dependence” that he said “develops among huge financial institutions” helped to trigger the financial crisis. Buffett said:Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.This “sleeping around” could actually be useful for large derivatives dealers because it assured them government aid if trouble hit, Buffett said:From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.However, that letter showed that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives contracts. Buffett justified this on the grounds that they were all “mispriced at inception, sometimes dramatically so”.Be ready for when it rains goldBuffett’s long-term goal is to outperform the S&P 500 index, which means keeping dry powder to deploy when valuations fall and “the cash register will ring loud”.Buffett says his plan is to dream big and be ready for when dark clouds fill the economic skies, as they will briefly rain gold.In 2016’s letterhe promised:When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.On delegation, and Buffett’s incredible managersBuffett has always been clear that the company is run on the principle of centralisation of financial decisions at “the very top”, which leads to a lot of delegation to the key managers running each company or business unit.He favours older managers, joking that “you can’t teach a new dog old tricks”.Through the 1980s, shareholders learned of the “terrific” Rose Blumkin and her family. “Mrs B” had escaped Russia, founded a furniture store inNebraskawith $500, offered much better deals than rivals, and was generating more than $100m of sales annually out of one 200,000 sq ft store before selling most of the business to Buffett for $55m as she approached her 90s.Happily in 1993, shareholders learned that Mrs B had celebrated her 100th birthday, with Buffett joking: “The candles cost more than the cake.” He added:Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attendmy100th.Alas she would not. As Buffettreminisced in 2011:She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)Succession planningBerkshire investors were treated to regular hints about life after Buffett. From 2005, they were reassured that the board had identified several candidates who could take on the role.Sounding unenthusiastic about the prospect, Buffett wrotein 2007’s letter:The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)Explore more on these topicsWarren BuffettNebraskaInvestingStock marketsUS economyEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yemen could yet become only one theatre in which the two vastly wealthy Gulf states vie for political influence, control of shipping lanes and commercial access.The UAE has been dabbling in Yemen for years due to itssupport for the separatist Southern Transitional Council.Many observers, including diplomats in Riyadh, had assumed that the UAE – often thought of as the junior if more ideological partner – would back down and tell the STC to delay or jettison its plan to declare independence and instead settle for negotiations on greater autonomy or more seats in Yemen’s coalition government body, the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC).Saudi Arabia had always seen Yemen as its preserve, first trying to defeat the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the north with a much-criticised bombing campaign in 2015 and then under international pressure reverting to diplomacy to try to reconcile the Houthis with the UN-recognised government in Aden.But in the past month, the UAE has kicked over many assumed red lines in Yemen,leading to the Saudi bombingof vehicles docking at the Yemen port of Mukalla. Riyadh pointedly said the vehicles had been sent for STC use and had come from an Emirati port.Saudi Arabia said: “The kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat.”View image in fullscreenScreengrab from a video shows smoke rising after a Saudi-led coalition airstrike in Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla on Tuesday.Photograph: Sabaa Tv/ReutersBut the UAE has been quietly considering commercial opportunities in Yemen for years. Tapping into the genuine, popular desire to restore the independence the south enjoyed before unification with the north in 1990, the UAE chose the STC as its vehicle.It was a shrewd bet. The STC was finally recognised as a genuine player in 2019 when it was given seats on the PLC.After years being sidelined in UN peace efforts, the STC leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, slowly gained western recognition and was allowed to attend events such as the UN general assembly.But the STC, feeding off longstanding cultural and economic grievances with the north, was never content with federalist solutions, and felt anyway it had been sidelined in the PLC.This month, the STC grabbed its opportunity,sending its forces into Hadramaut, the largest governorate in the south.With its sudden eastward expansion, the STC controlled nearly all of the territory of the former South Yemen state, including its most productive oilfields.Yemen mapAfter seizing Hadramaut, it was relatively easy to take al-Mahra, the most easterly governorate.It was asevere shock to Saudi Arabia, which has since been applying diplomatic pressure on Abu Dhabi to demand the STC’s withdrawal.In a ferocious diplomatic battle, Riyadh tried to isolate the UAE and the STC, making it clear that even if the STC stood its ground, southern Yemen would never progress beyond a micro-state lacking international recognition.So far, the UAE is not buckling. The withdrawal of the few remaining UAE counter-terror forces in Yemen announced on Tuesday is of no significance since UAE support for the STC remains.Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist, is portraying the UAE defence of the STC almost as a litmus test of the UAE’s character. He wrote on X: “The UAE does not let down nor abandon its allies. It supports them with generosity and political and military abundance. It does not leave them midway on the road to face their fate without support. It is clear in its policies and steps. It does not flee nor evade confrontation. It has a clear vision of its national and humanitarian responsibility and fulfils it with utmost care.”Equally patriotic statements are emerging from Riyadh. Farea al-Muslimi, a Yemen and wider Gulf research fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, is in little doubt about the enormity of what may be at stake.“After years of indirect competition through local proxies, the dispute now appears to be moving toward a more direct confrontation, with Saudi Arabia publicly accusing the UAE of actions that threaten its national security along its southern border,” he said.“The conflict reflects fundamental disagreements between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over the future political structure of Yemen and the balance of influence within it. Notably, the UAE – despite its greater geographic distance – has pursued a more interventionist and experimental approach on the ground.“Tensions between the two countries have been building for years. These actions suggest that the situation is entering a particularly dangerous phase. This development also evokes troubling parallels with the 2017 Gulf crisis involving Qatar, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE coordinated a major diplomatic rupture that destabilised regional relations for years.”Muslimi added that theHouthiswere “likely to view the growing rift between two of their principal adversaries with considerable advantage, observing as former coalition partners – who jointly fought and failed to defeat them – now turn against one another”.Western governments, taking their lead from Washington, have shown inSudanlittle desire to criticise the UAE in public, and in Yemen their sympathies will be with Saudi Arabia and the retention of a unitary state.Explore more on these topicsYemenSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricaSudanAfricaHouthisanalysisShareReuse this content"

The driver of Joshua’s vehicle was also injured, he added.An official spokesman for Joshua said: “It is with the deepest and most profound sadness that we confirm, following a road traffic accident in Lagos,Nigeriaearlier today, the death of Sina Ghami and Kevin ‘Lateef’ Ayodele.“Both were close friends and integral members of Anthony’s team. We respectfully ask that space and privacy be given to the families at this time while they process this truly shocking and devastating news. Anthony sustained injuries in the accident and was taken to hospital for checks and treatment, he is in a stable condition and will remain there for observation.”An image released by the federal road safety corps in Nigeria showing the damaged car that Anthony Joshua was travelling in.Photograph: Federal Road Safety Corps/APGhami acted as strength and conditioning coach while Ayodele was a trainer in Joshua’s camp.

Joshua, seated in the rear of the vehicle, sustained minor injuries and is receiving medical attention with another injured person.“Tragically, two other passengers in the vehicle lost their lives at the scene. The deceased have been conveyed to Livewell hospital morgue, Sagamu. The Ogun state police command extends heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and assures the public that a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident has commenced.”The Nigeria president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, added his condolences. He said: “I have spoken with AJ to personally convey my condolences over the passing of his two close associates in the recent accident. I wished him a full and speedy recovery and prayed with him.”A video shared by the local news outlet Punch appeared to show Joshua sitting in the back left seat of a damaged car. A second video showed him walking slowly and getting into a police vehicle.Nigeria’s federal road safety corpssaidin posts on X that it had arrived on the scene within three minutes of being notified. It said: “A total of five adult males were involved in the crash. Two persons sadly lost their lives, one sustained injuries, while two others escaped unhurt. Anthony Joshua was rescued alive and sustained minor injuries.”The agency added: “Preliminary findings indicate that the Lexus Jeep, which was suspected to be travelling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit on the corridor, lost control during an overtaking manoeuvre and crashed into a stationary truck well packed [sic] by the side of the road.“The primary causes of the crash being excessive speed and wrongful overtaking constitute serious traffic violations and remain among the leading causes of fatal road crashes on Nigerian highways.”Photossharedby the agency on X showed a black car with a badly damaged front and a truck covered in tarpaulin on a downward sloping grass verge, with what appears to be a dent on the left side of its back.View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua has sustained minor injuries in a car accident in Nigeria.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAJoshua is the son of British-Nigerian parents and has family ties in the town of Sagamu, about 30 miles north of Nigeria’s commercial capital, Lagos.

None of them ended well for VenezuelaTue 30 Dec 2025 14.34 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 14.35 ESTShareNearly a week afterDonald Trumpfirst announced what he said wasthe first US ground strikein a four-month-long military pressure campaign againstVenezuela, details remain very thin on the ground.CNN and the New York Times reported late on Monday that they had confirmed the CIA had used a drone to target a “port facility” allegedly used by the Tren de Aragua street gang. No casualties were reported, but the date, time and location of the attack remain unknown. Venezuela’s strongman leader,Nicolás Maduro, and his government have remained silent.If confirmed, the first strike on land would mark a new phase in a campaign that since August has involved the deployment of a massive US naval fleet, airstrikes that have so far killed 107 people, a “total blockade” of sanctioned oil tankers, the seizure of two vessels and the pursuit of a third.Independent organisations, activists and analysts inVenezuelahave so far been unable to find any details of an attack.US struck ‘big facility’ in Venezuela, Trump claimed without offering detailsRead moreWhether or not the strike even took place, analysts agree that Trump’s announcement itself marks his latest move in a shadow war aimed at removing Maduro from power.“Obviously, the US doesn’t want to call it a war because that would trigger congressional oversight … but it is a war, as people are dying – and they’re dying in a very explicit and loud way with these airstrikes on boats,” said Alejandro Velasco, a historian of modern Venezuela and a professor at New York University.He added that Maduro is also waging his own war to stay in power: “That’s the only thing he and the people around him are concerned about. For them, the war is about how to survive one more day.”Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, said the US is already running a psyops campaign against Venezuela: “It’s not a war that involves massive amounts of weapons yet, because I think neither side has the stomach to do that … So it’s more of a war of moving of pieces and hoping one side folds.”It is that logic, he said, that has driven all of Trump’s moves so far, from the military buildup to the attacks on boats and the seizure of oil tankers.“Trump’s entire plan hinges on the idea that someone in Maduro’s inner circle will defect and say, ‘Maduro, you’ll leave and we’re forming a new government.’ With every step, the US doubled down on that strategy, even though it didn’t work,” he added.The alleged first strike on land would be just Trump’s latest attempt in that strategy, said Sabatini.Andrés Antillano, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, said it was “unlikely” that the strike, if it occurred at all, destroyed any significant drug infrastructure.He is among several experts on Venezuelan drug trafficking who noted that, despite initial US claims that the military pressure is part of a so-called “war on drugs”, the country plays a relatively minor role in global cocaine trafficking – and is certainly not responsible for the most significant volumes reaching the US.“There is an exaggeration of the Tren de Aragua, which is in fact very weakened and fragmented … If the attack really happened, it may have hit a small fishing village from which speedboats carrying cocaine depart,” said Antillano.Antillano noted that it could have occurred in an “isolated place, which is why nothing is known”, adding that the Maduro regime also may not want to acknowledge the attack. Venezuela took weeks to comment on the deadly airstrikes in theCaribbean, initially claiming the images were fake.“In any case, even if everything Trump has said is true, it still seems to me an attack with minimal impact, despite its media coverage. That was more or less what happened with the airstrikes on boats: they led to the deaths of fishers, possibly some linked to drug trafficking, but they had no impact on drug trafficking itself nor did they shake the foundations of the Maduro government,” he added.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaUS militaryDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroDrugsUS foreign policyCaribbeananalysisShareReuse this content"

At least 70 Chinese war planes, 11 navy ships and 14 from China’s militarised coast guard were also detected since 6am.The defence ministry said the missiles came closer to Taiwan’s main island than in previous live-fire drills. Some landed in Taiwan’s 24-nautical mile contiguous zone, and at least 13 ships were also detected within those restricted waters, the ministry said.It followed the detection of 130 war planes, 28 ships, amphibious assault ships, and one surveillance balloon detected in the 24 hours to 6am on Tuesday.Asked about the drills on Monday, Trump said he had a “great relationship with President Xi, and he hasn’t told me anything about it”.“I certainly have seen it … I don’t believe he is going to be doing it,” Trump said, appearing to refer to an actual invasion. “Nothing worries me.”Beijing claims Taiwan is a Chinese province and is preparing to annex it militarily, with the aim of being capable of invasion by 2027, according to US intelligence from several years ago. In the meantime, it deploys an array of military and non-military forms of harassment and intimidation toconvince or coerce Taiwan to accept “peaceful reunification”.The US is Taiwan’s most significant backer in its resistance to Beijing’s annexation plans, but Trump’s stance – especially during his second term –has been inconsistent. Trump met Xi in October but said Taiwan “didn’t come up”. He is expected to visit Beijing for a more formal meeting next year.The PLA and Chinese state media said these exercises focused on simulating a blockade of major ports in Taiwan, repelling “external foreign interference”, and testing “sea-air coordination and precise target hunting and neutralisation”, including attacks on submarines and other maritime targets.‘Better off with Taiwan’: Honduras joins other Latin American countries rethinking ties with ChinaRead moreTaiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, said on Tuesday thatChinawas not acting as a responsible world power, and expressed his “strongest condemnation”. Taiwan would defend its sovereignty, he said.“We will act responsibly and not escalate conflict or stir up disputes.”The defence minister, Wellington Koo, said the drills disregarded international norms and “clearly aim to achieve cognitive warfare and deplete Taiwan’s combat capabilities … and to create division and conflict within Taiwanese society”.This week’s drills are the sixth and largest to target Taiwan since 2022, when major exercises surrounded Taiwan in retaliation for a visit by the then speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.Such exercises take extensive planning and are usually part of general training, but the PLA often links them to perceived acts of provocation. This week, Chinese officials and state media specifically cited a recent approval by the US government for a record$11bn weapons sales to Taiwan.An attack on Taiwan by Beijing is largely expected to draw in the US and potentially Japan, according torecent statements by the country’s prime minister. Sanae Takaichi said Japan’s military would be likely to get involved if China attacked Taiwan, which infuriated Beijing.In a speech on Tuesday, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said: “In response to the continuous provocations by pro-independence forces in Taiwan and the large-scale US arms sales to Taiwan, we must of course resolutely oppose and forcefully counter them.”Wang indicated that the drills were also a message to Japan, whose leaders he said “openly challenge China’s territorial sovereignty”.Aneditorialin the official state outlet, Xinhua, said the drills were “a clear reminder for the DPP that the trend of national reunification is unstoppable, and that the will of the people cannot be defied”.“The DPP’s fanciful attempts to pursue ‘Taiwan independence’ by relying on US support will only heighten tensions in the Taiwan strait and push the island’s residents toward the brink of conflicts,” it said.China-based analysts noted that the drills came almost immediately after Taiwanese officials, including Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, had attended a “twin cities” forum in Shanghai.The dean of the international studies institute at Fudan University, Xinbo Wu, said it demonstrated “the mainland’s two-pronged approach” towards Taiwan, offering inducements and threats.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanDonald TrumpXi JinpingTrump administrationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a cut from the current $31.60 maximum, which Anthony Albanese claimed would save Australians more $200m each year.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“We’re cutting the cost of PBS medicines because Australians shouldn’t have to worry about whether they can afford to fill a script,” the prime minister said.The cost for pensioners and those on concession cards will remain at $7.70 until 2030.A nurse-staffed 1800 MEDICARE phone line – a 24/7 telephone service to connect patients with GPs, hospitals or urgent care clinics – will replace the current Healthdirect service.A Medicare mental health check-in service will also launch in early January. The online portal, run by St Vincent’s Health, is geared toward early support for people experiencing mild mental health issues and will expand from late March to offer low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy over the phone or video chat.Tension on the streets, the mushroom trial circus and a devastating terrorist attack – looking back on Australia’s turbulent 2025Read moreSocial security indexationPeople on a range of social security payments will see a slight bump in their allowances from 1 January, as part of regular indexation changes. The single rate of youth allowance will go up by $17.60 per fortnight, while Austudy will increase by $13.90 per fortnight. The carer allowance will tick up by $3.30 a fortnight.Income thresholds will also be raised for student payments, as will the parental income test threshold for Youth Allowance and Abstudy. The full list of payment changes is available on theDepartment of Social Services website.Mandating cashNew rules requiring grocery stores and petrol stations to accept cash will kick in from 1 January, mandating that cash must be accepted for transactions of $500 or less.There are exemptions for small businesses with a turnover of less than $10m turnover.Childcare changesFamilies will get access to three days of government-subsidised childcare each week, aslong-mooted changes to early educationcome into effect.The “three-day guarantee”replaces the previous settings of an activity test, meaning all families will get access to three days of care, regardless of income or work habits of parents. The government claims 100,000 more families will now be eligible for more subsidised early education, the next step as Labor looks toa longer-term goal of universal childcare.Changing battery rebatesChanges to the government’s popular home battery program will see more money put into the program but slight reductions in the rebates consumers get for installing batteries. Asreported by Choice, estimated rebates will fall from $372 per kilowatt hour currently to $336 per kWh from January, as part of a gradual reduction in concessions as more people take up the scheme. The changes were announced in December in a bid to “secure the sustainability” of the program, with an extra $4.9bn put into the scheme at the same time as subsidies were altered.New South Wales changesIn NSW, road toll users are being saddledwith more quarterly rises. As some consolation, the government has announced it willpermanently extenda weekly toll cap of $60, which was due to expire at the end of 2025.The best of: Fiona Katauskas cartoons 2025 | Fiona KatauskasRead moreProperty developers will be able to claim a tax cut allowing them to claim a 50% reduction in land value from 2026 for eligible build-to-rent properties. But, in the City of Sydney, new developments will be required to install electric cookers and hobs, heaters and conditioners under a new electric standard – or “gas ban” – in the council area.There are more changes coming into effect from the raft of legislation that wasrushed through parliamentafter the Bondi attack, includinggun control, hate speech and protest laws, some of which took immediate effect on 24 December.They include limits on the number of firearms to four for recreational uses – and 10 for commercial uses, such as farming and pest control – although a grace period applies for existing owners until a national buyback scheme is established.A law allowing the police commissioner to restrict protests after terrorist incidents also came into effect on Christmas Eve.A 14-day declarationpreventing the authorisation of protests for much of metropolitan Sydney made the same day will last into the new year and could be extended to up to 90 days, or until the end of March, potentially affectingInvasion Day protests.Victoria changesPublic transport will be free for everyone aged under 18 from 1 January. The Victorian government will also make it free for more than 650,000 seniors and close to 300,000 carers and disability support pensioners to catch a train, tram or bus on weekends.Changes to the state’s congestion levy and vacant residential land tax (VRLT) will also come into effect on 1 January. The rate of the congestion levy will increase by more than 70% and apply to more parts of Melbourne. It applies to off-street private and public car parking spaces and is designed to encourage people to use public transport.Residential land in metropolitan Melbourne that has remained undeveloped for at least five years may also attract the VRLT from 1 January onwards. This means residential land capable of development cannot remain undeveloped without attracting the tax.Land that cannot be used or developed for residential purposes, or land that is “contiguous to the owner’s principal place of residence or holiday home”, is exempt.Queensland changesThe Queensland government is bringing in several major law changes, with the state’schild sex offender registerset go into effect.Australia announces special honours list to recognise acts of bravery during the Bondi attackRead moreNamed Daniel’s Law for murder victim Daniel Morcombe, the laws are modelled after Western Australia’s public child sex offender register.It will operate with three categories, with the first allowing allow the police commissioner to post images and “particular personal details” of offenders who have breached reporting requirements and whose whereabouts is unknown on a public website.The second allows Queensland residents to apply to temporarily view facial images of reportable offenders living in their suburb or small town. Thirdly, parents and guardians can also ask the register if a person with unsupervised contact with their child is a convicted sexual offender.Queensland has also rolled back rules against double jeopardy, the millenia-old legal principle preventing a person from being put on trial twice for the same offence.The new laws make it clear that an error caused by the state’sDNA lab scandalwould not prevent a person being charged again for the same offence. The laws only apply to 11 serious offences, including murder, rape and manslaughter, and went into effect this week.The state has also amended its defamation laws to exempt publishers, such as news organisations, from being sued for comments posted on their social media pages by others. The change brings Queensland in line with every other state.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsAustralian politicsNew South Wales politicsQueensland politicsVictorian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the pair returned to Australia on commercial flights. One Nation confirmed to Guardian Australia that the hospitality referred to accommodation at Rinehart’s US$66m Palm Beach mansion.The party said it submitted what is known as a Form A on December 16 – some 35 days after the return flight – but was advised by the registrar the following day that it had been knocked back as it was not administratively correct. The form was correctly lodged as an alteration on 30 December following the Guardian’s report.The declaration does not mention Ashby’s sponsored travel. When asked about Rinehart’s possible financial support for the party earlier this month, Ashbytold Nine Newspapers: “I haven’t seen any money from her.”Guardian Essential poll: One Nation records highest-ever primary vote after burqa stunt and Joyce defection speculationRead moreWhile in the US, Rinehart and Hanson attended CPAC (the Conservative Political Action Conference) where the One Nation leadercriticised both of Australia’s major partiesand praised the Trump administration for deporting immigrants, bombing alleged drug cartel boats and supercharging mining projects.It is unclear whether the trip was gifted to the One Nation senator from Hancock Prospecting or from Rinehart personally.Underparliamentary rules for senators’ interests, a declaration must be made of any sponsored travel or hospitality received where the value of the sponsorship or hospitality exceeds $300.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe rules state that any change in a senator’s interests should be notified to the registrar within 35 days of that alteration occurring.During the trip, Rinehart and Hanson attended Donald Trump’sGreat Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago. It is unclear if Ashby also attended what Hanson described as a “lovely” event at the president’s Florida home.Rinehart is a known supporter of Trump and his policies, having been a member of his US-based female support network, the Trumpettes, since 2016.She has also invested heavily in US stocks,with a $4.7bn portfolioincluding investments in Trump Media & Technology and the government-backed MP Materials.It is understood that Hanson also attended a separate party at Rinehart’s Palm Beach mansion, held in support of the conservative lobby group Moms of America.In aSky News interviewwith Andrew Bolt on 2 November, the Queensland senator said she had been invited to speak at the CPAC Florida event – tickets for which cost between $5,000 and $25,000. Hanson and Rinehart were pictured seated next to each other at one of the conference’s events.Watchdog clears Pauline Hanson’s use of taxpayer funds to attend Gina Rinehart’s birthday partyRead more“It will be my first speech overseas. I’m very pleased to have been invited to speak at it because I think it’s very well attended,” Hanson told Sky News.“It’s very important to me to be there on behalf of Australians, speaking on behalf of many Australians at this conference.”Bolt said Hanson’s US visit suggested her success had received “international attention”.Speaking about her boost in the recent Newspoll, which showed her picking up about four percentage points in voter support, Hanson said this was due to the major parties failing to commit to policies addressing migration and climate change.She called for Australia to withdraw from the Paris agreement and criticised the ambition to meet a target of net zero carbon emissions – views that closely align with those of Rinehart.“My concern is for the Australian people, their lifestyle, their standard of living, their way of life. I want to see our country prosper and we cannot do it under net zero.”Hanson also warned that there was a risk that “we’re going to lose our biggest … employer of people in this country and what gives us revenue into the country is the mining sector”.The private flights for Hanson and Ashby coincided with one of Rinehart’s most senior executives, the former NT chief minister Adam Giles, publicly backing One Nation.Incommentsmade to the Weekly Times, Giles, who heads Rinehart’s agricultural business, said he had donated to One Nation and was “encouraging my friends to be donating all they can … to support One Nation”.“Australians have been suffering and will increasingly do, under the left-leaning policies of net zero, we have been living under the immigration ponzi scheme trying to hold our economy together without fixing the problems, excess government tape, regulation and taxes and big, wasteful government,” said Giles, who led the Country Liberals from 2013 to 2016.Bid by Gina Rinehart’s company to build helipad set to be blocked by City of PerthRead moreRinehart’s longtime friend Barnaby Joyce recently defected to One Nation from the National party.Hanson and Joyce marked the new alliance by cooking Wagyu steak from Hancock Agriculture’s beef company 2GR on a sandwich press in Hanson’s Parliament House office.After the landslide defeat of the Liberals under Peter Dutton at the last election, Rinehart suggested the party had not followed Trump’s lead enthusiastically enough, declaring there was a need to return to “common sense and truth”.Her company, Hancock Prospecting, has formerly offered considerable financial support for the Liberal and Nationals. Before the last election, Hancock Prospecting donated $500,000 to the Liberal party.Under financial disclosure laws governed by the Australian Electoral Commission, Hancock Prospecting or Rinehart personallywould be required to declareany in-kind financial support provided to the senator or the party if the value exceeded $17,300.Rinehart has been critical of the Liberal party under Sussan Ley’s leadership , but is also known to oppose the party’s rising conservative warrior Andrew Hastie, given he testified in defamation proceedings against the SAS soldier Ben Roberts-Smith.Rinehart has criticised the “relentless attack” on Roberts-Smith, who in 2023 was found, on the balance of probabilities, to have committed war crimes while deployed in Afghanistan. Roberts-Smith has always denied the allegations.Neither Rinehart nor Hancock Prospecting responded to a request for comment.This article was amended on 30 December 2025 after One Nation responded to questions post-publication.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsPauline HansonGina RinehartDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The posts were still on Facebook on 16 December, two days after the attack, and received shares and likes.Some accounts are Britain-based and those have been reported tocounter-terrorism police in the UKas a matter of urgency.One post shows video of the aftermath of the Bondi beach attack, which was allegedly carried out by a father and son who were IS supporters, and says: “Allah is the greatest and praise to Allah.” It has clearly been viewed, with more than 100 likes, 27 comments and four shares recorded.Fifteen people were killed as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Hanukah in Sydney on 14 December. One of the attackers also died.Another post shows a photo of one of the Bondi beach gunmen and says: “The coming years of art and hell,” and contains praise for an IS leader. This had 12 shares and more than 300 likes.Facebook said it was in the process of removing some of the posts after being contacted by the Guardian, and said some had already been spotted and removed.Dave Rich, the director of policy for the CST, which works to keep Jewish people safe from attack, said: “The sheer volume of IS-supporting accounts promoting terrorist content on Facebook is deeply alarming, and the posts celebrating the Bondi terrorist attack are utterly nauseating.“Yet again, social media companies are incapable of meeting even their most basic of responsibilities and are putting all of us in danger as a result. This simply should not be happening any more. We will be calling on Ofcom to urgently investigate Meta’s failings and to take strong action where possible.”Ofcom, the media regulator, said: “If a post is reported to a platform now, the platform must decide whether the content is illegal under UK law, and take it down swiftly if it is. Our job is to make sure sites and apps have appropriate measures in place to comply with their duties.”It said it had received “evidence that suggests terrorist content and illegal hate speech is persisting on some of the largest social media sites”.A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, declined to answer a series of questions but said: “The content was removed for violating our policies around dangerous organisations and individuals.”A Home Office spokesperson said:“Social media content promoting terrorism or violence against communities is absolutely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. The law is clear: social media platforms must take action to prevent illegal content on their sites, including terrorist and violent material.”The focus on pro-IS material on popular social media sites comes amid concern about an increase in terrorist efforts to target Jewish people across the west.Two men wereconvicted on 22 Decemberof a plot to get machine guns and shoot Jewish people around the north-west of England. In that plot and the Sydney massacre, both sets of terrorists’ approaches had a degree of sophistication.Though neither was “directed” by IS, the Sydney attackersvisited the Philippinesand the north-west England machine-gun plotters had contact with an IS person overseas and were sophisticated enough to try to bypass Jewish community security and infiltrate a Facebook group, giving them details of potential Jewish targets.Rich said of the English plot: “This is an even more serious plot than the attack on thesynagogue in Heaton Parkand indicates a much greater level of training and sophistication.”Vicki Evans, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian: “The terrorist threats we face do not stand still and we rarely confine them to history. Instead, they flex in intensity and risk over time – and so does our response.“Recent attacks in Manchester and Australia are clear reminders of the range of threats we face, and we continue to ask the public to …report any concernsthey see in their real-world or online communities.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Soldiers were seen disguising combat vehicles with green netting and raising a flag at an airbase in easternBelarus, close to the Russian border.The video appeared part of a choreographed attempt to intimidateEuropeand to prepare Russians for a further escalation in the already brutal war against Ukraine. The deployment, if true, would symbolically reduce the time it would take for a Russian missile to hit an EU capital.Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, said 10 Oreshnik systems would be stationed in his country. Putin announced they were entering active service at a meeting on Monday with his generals, where he reaffirmed his intention to capture more Ukrainian territory, including the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.Earlier Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned that “reprisals” would be carried out against Kyiv and that targets were already prepared. They followed what he said wasan attack on Sunday nightinvolving 91 Ukrainian drones on the Russia’s president’s palace in the Novgorod region.The Kremlin has not produced evidence to back up its allegations. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, said on Tuesday that no proof would be offered since all the missiles had been shot down. He said he could not comment on the lack of debris.People living in the area said they did not hear explosions or the sound of anti-aircraft fire, according to the independent Russian media outlet Sota. No air raid alert was issued, nor weremobile phone clips showing smoke and flames shared online, a typical feature of confirmed hits.On Tuesday Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia had made up the story, and urged other countries to ignore it. “Almost a day passed, and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened,” heposted on X.He did not criticise Donald Trump, who on Mondayangrily endorsed Russia’s accountand said Putin had told him about the attack in a phone call. “It’s one thing to be offensive, because they’re offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that,” the US president said.Sybiha expressed irritation with India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, after they said they were concerned by the reports. “Such reactions to Russia’s baseless manipulative claims only play into Russian propaganda and encourage Moscow for more atrocities and lies,” he remarked.Ukrainians commanders said Russian kamikaze drones regularly flew over a government palace used by Zelenskyy on their way to the capital. One officer, the head of territorial defence unit 112, said his team shot down two drones on Saturday above the state residence in Koncha-Zaspa, south of Kyiv.“Whenever there are large-scale attacks, they fly in our area. There are always shaheeds. Quite often we shoot them down in this place,” the soldier told the Guardian. He shared a video showing an enemy drone flying low across a white winter sky.The Ukrainians are keen to keep the focus on continuing diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, followingZelenskyy’s two-hour meeting with Trump on Sunday in Florida. The two leaders discussed a 20-point peace plan under which the US would offer Kyiv post-war security guarantees voted on by Congress.There was no progress on the future of the eastern Donbas region, which Putin says must be handed over to Russia. Zelenskyy has ruled out giving Russia land. He has proposed a demilitarised zone, which could be confirmed in a referendum if Russia agrees to a ceasefire of at least 60 days.Zelenskyy said the Russians were spreading “fake news” because of his “fairly successful conversation and meeting” with Trump over the weekend, and the progress made in recent weeks by the US and Ukrainian delegations. Russia was making accusations because it didn’t want “any positive outcome for anyone in this format”, he added.Ukraine’s president is due to meet with European allies on 6 January in France, at a conference hosted by Emmanuel Macron. Leaders will discuss Europe’s contribution to a peacekeeping operation. There is likely to be a subsequent meeting between European heads of state with Trump and his White House team in Washington.Commentators said US security pledges were meaningless if Trump was willing to accept everything the Russian president told him. “If the potential ceasefire monitoring will be done by the same people who now believe what Russia is saying – we are in big trouble,” Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaBelarusUkraineEuropeNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

At Folkestone in Kent, tailbacks formed as drivers hoping to catch the shuttle faced seven-hour delays.By Tuesday evening, engineers were still struggling to restore full service, with the Channel tunnel operator, Getlink, saying trains were running on only one of the tunnel’s two tracks, travelling in alternate directions.The technical glitch began on Monday night, according to Getlink, with “an incident related to the power supply to trains”.In statements on Tuesday morning, Eurostar indicated the outage led to the failure of a train operated by LeShuttle, which carries cars and freight vehicles through the tunnel. It said the train was eventually moved out of the tunnel.At St Pancras, Jack Slater and his girlfriend were left with no choice but to cancel a new year’s trip to Paris, a treat they had been planning since the summer.“We’re being advised to rebook for tomorrow, but all of the trains are fully booked already so the only option would be to upgrade to a first class seat – which is an extra lot of money,” he said.View image in fullscreenEurostar passengers wait for train services to resume at St Pancras.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAMatt Orien had come from Seattle in the US with his family, hoping to make it to Paris after spending a few days in London. “This is disappointing, but we have a friend who is helping us out with admin so we’ll hopefully have a way to get there,” he said. “We’re doing OK and we’ll find a way to have fun … we feel sorry for the people that are stuck in the train, in the tunnel.”Betty Ndukaeze, travelling in a family group, was hoping to reach Paris to celebrate. The journey started with a delay, with their 7.01am train leaving an hour late, before coming to a halt. After a long wait, they were sent back to St Pancras, she told the BBC.“It was chaos from the moment we got here,” said Ndukaeze. “They kept announcing there was a problem with the train ahead of us and saying they were trying to fix the problem.“We just got back here. The journey back from where we were stuck was only 20 minutes.”As of Tuesday afternoon, Eurostar said it would resume services to and from London at about 6pm, but it “strongly” advised passengers to postpone their journeys.Live service updatesshowed all departures for Paris on 30 December as cancelled, other than two trains at 18.01 and 19.01. In the other direction, only the 18.12 and 19.12 trains were listed as scheduled to depart for London.View image in fullscreenTravellers stranded at Gare du Nord station in Paris.Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP“As the overhead power supply issues in the Channel tunnel still remain, only one line is available to run trains on,” the operator said. “This means there will continue to be delays and longer journey times than usual this evening. Therefore we continue to advise our customers to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available.“We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have already been cancelled.”A driver’s photograph shared withthe BBCshowed overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks.Eurostar, which carries foot passengers, and LeShuttle, which carries vehicles and is owned by Getlink, share the tunnel’s two tracks, which normally run only in one direction.Between them, the services transport thousands of passengers a day over the Christmas period.In an update sent out at 3pm on Tuesday, Getlink said the shuttle service had “resumed very gradually on one track shortly before 3pm CET [2pm UK time]” and that trains were running “alternately in both directions with significant delays”.Additional shuttles would be added from Tuesday evening until Wednesday morning, while waiting times would be adjusted throughout the day, it said. Live updates for the shuttle warned passengers: “Delay of approximately six hours to booked time, please check in as planned.”At Folkestone, the terminus for the shuttle, drivers trapped in lines of cars waiting to board shared their frustration on social media. “About to board our 08.25 departure, due out at 15.05!!!” said Spike on X, suggesting some vehicles faced a seven-hour delay.Kate from Woking said drivers at Folkestone were given food vouchers, playing cards and crisps. “Staff at the terminal were doing their best but they couldn’t promise much.”Stephanie Roberts, from Ashford, was returning home after a two-week holiday in Le Touquet, with her husband, Simon and their 18-month-old French bulldog, Dempsey.View image in fullscreenCars stuck in lines of traffic waiting to board a LeShuttle service from Folkestone to Calais.Photograph: Dean Pallant“We began queueing in Calais in the Eurotunnel at 10.30am French time,” she said. “In the end, we were waiting for more than five hours before we were able to board a train.“There was no food or water, but luckily we had brought a baguette with us, so we were able to munch on that. We bought a small bottle of water from a vending machine for €3 for Dempsey.The price is not the issue, it’s the principle.”Some UK drivers with later trains said they had diverted to Dover to take the ferry instead.The Port of Dover urged stranded drivers to consider switching to travel by sea, saying operators running between Dover and Calais had capacity for extra passengers.The east coast mainline train company LNER responded by offering passengers a free ride home. It said that “any customers who have had to abandon their journey in London King’s Cross are able to return to their home station on the next available LNER service at no additional cost”.LNER customers who choose to defer their Eurostar travel to a different day may use their existing LNER ticket to travel on that same day, it added.Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: “Those who have had their train cancelled have the option to exchange their booking or claim a refund or Eurostar e-voucher. For delays, travellers are entitled to compensation.“If you are delayed overnight, you have the right to be put up in a hotel or be reimbursed for one,.”Eurostar said customers could exchange their unused ticket for another date in the same travel class, receive a refund, or an e-voucher valid for 12 months. Stranded passengers can also claim hotel accommodation of up to £150 per room, along with £50 for taxi costs and £35 for food and drink expenses.Explore more on these topicsEurostarRail industryRail transportTransportEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Michelin, which has closed all its commercial and industrial activities in Russia.Deliveries appear to have been sent by companies based in Turkey, Spain, Saudi Arabia, India and one apparently British firm named as General Trade Solutions (UK). There is no firm registered with the UK’s Companies House of that name.The largest Russian importer in 2024 of Michelin tyres, Melaris LLC, was a supplier of the Russian military- industrial complex.A spokesperson for Michelin said the company was “committed to scrupulously complying with applicable economic and financial sanctions concerning Russia” and had “established dedicated internal processes and organisation to ensure this compliance”.The company said that none of the Michelin tyres seemingly exported to Russia were for military use and that it had recently strengthened its compliance programme by “implementing enhanced controls in addition to existing measures to further mitigate diversion risk”.The spokesperson added: “The adaptation of our compliance programme to diversion risk has significantly reduced instances of circumventions, as indicated by your recent figures.“However, we remain vigilant regarding the quality of the data provided by such reports, as there is no guarantee that the tyres mentioned are indeed Michelin Group products notably due to risk of counterfeiting and false declaration.“Furthermore, it is important to note that the aviation tyre industry is unique, with standard compatibility of an aviation tyre across all copies of the same aircraft model and a complex commercial chain involving several distributors and resellers.”Roman Steblivskyi, a policy expert with the Economic Security Council of Ukraine, said: “Russian aviation – civilian and military alike – remains dependent on western aviation tyres due to their superior quality. Therefore, Michelin should take a more proactive approach in preventing the illicit re-export of its products to Russia through third countries.“Michelin’s duty of care frameworks refer to tracking the origins of specific minerals under the ‘human rights’ section; however, they do not address monitoring or preventing the supply of Michelin products to authoritarian states such as Russia.“This gap raises questions about whether the company’s due-diligence standards are aligned with the current geopolitical environment and the risks associated with sanctions evasion.”France’s duty of care (vigilance) law requires large French companies to create and publish a plan to identify, prevent, and mitigate risks to human rights, health, safety, and the environment across their own operations, subsidiaries, and supply chains.A Michelin spokesperson said export control and sanctions risks were not something that French legislation required them to address but that “even if not explicitly mentioned in our latest duty of care plan, Michelin Group has implemented and consistently reviewed and strengthened its export control and sanctions compliance policy, adapting its measures and controls to address diversion risks”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaAir transportEuropeFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

This was accompanied by mass protests in the capital as well as in major cities, including Isfahan, Shiraz and Mashhad.‘There’s no going back’: Iran’s women on why they won’t stop flouting dress code lawsRead moreProtesters chanted anti-government slogans, and video on social media showed demonstrators chanting “Don’t be afraid, we are together” and “Azadi”, the Farsi word for freedom. Footage also showed Iranian police in riot gear shooting teargas at protesters.The protests were the largest sincea wave of demonstrations rocked the country after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in police custodyfollowing her arrest for not wearing the hijab correctly. At the time, Iranian police responded with force, imposing an internet shutdown and violently cracking down on demonstrations with teargas and gunfire.On Tuesday, the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, instructed the government to listen to the “legitimate demands” of protesters. A government spokesperson said that a mechanism for dialogue would be set up to have talks with leaders of the protest movement.“The livelihood of my people is my daily concern,” Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. He added that the government had “actions on the agenda to reform the monetary and banking system and preserve the purchasing power of the people”.Analysts say the Iranian government has reduced its domestic repression since the 12-day war with Israel during the summer, as it seeks to shore up support after suffering significant blows to its image as an impregnable regime. The “morality police”, for example, have at times relaxed the strict application of social edicts in Tehran.View image in fullscreenMasoud Pezeshkian: ‘The livelihood of my people is my daily concern.’Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersIranian media have said that recent government liberalisation policies have depressed the currency’s exchange rate. On Monday, state television reported the resignation of the central bank chief, Mohammad Reza Farzin, a day after the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42 million to the dollar. When Farzin took office in 2022, the rial was exchanged for about 430,000 to the dollar.The erosion of purchasing power is exacerbating an already dire economic situation in Iran, making food and other daily needs increasingly unaffordable.According to Iran’s government statistics centre, food prices are up 72% and medical goods 50% compared with this time last year. At the same time, the government has said it will increase taxes in the Iranian new year, which starts on 21 March.You’ll never defeat us in Iran, President Trump: but with real talks, we can both win | Abbas AraghchiRead moreAs the Iranian government is confronted with protests at home, it also faces renewed threats of attacks from abroad. Donald Trump warned on Monday that the UScould carry out further military strikes on Iranif it attempted to rebuild its nuclear programme.The US conductedmassive bunker-buster strikes on key nuclear enrichment strikesin Iran in June. In a meeting on Monday with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said that there could be further nuclear activity outside the sites hit in June.“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again. And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down. We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening,” Trump said.Iran has said that it is no longer enriching uranium anywhere and that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.Writing for the Guardian, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran wanted dialogue with the US. “Despite Israel’s attack on diplomacy amid Iran-US nuclear negotiations, Iran remains open to an agreement that is built on mutual respect and mutual interest,” Araghchi wrote.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestMiddle East and north AfricaCost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The groups compete among themselves in the territories they control.Saudi Arabia said the attack on the port city of Mukalla had targeted a weapons shipment from the UAE for the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is seeking to restore South Yemen as an independent state, as it was between 1967 and 1990.Yemen mapThe UAE said that the shipment had not contained any weapons and was meant for UAE forces rather than any Yemeni groups.But the strike by Saudi Arabia was seen as a shot across the bows after the STC made unprecedented territorial gains, seizing most of the resource-rich Hadhramaut province and much of neighbouring Mahrah, angering Riyadh.Some of the territorial gains came at the expense of Saudi-backed forces in the country and left UAE-supported groups in control of most of southern Yemen, including key port cities, oil facilities and islands. Saudi troops withdrew from their bases in Aden after STC forces seized the presidential palace there – a move that Saudi Arabia said was part of a “repositioning strategy”.The strikes will ratchet up tension between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh as competition between the two heats up in the Red Sea area.Tuesday’s attack was followed by measures announced by the chair of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, a Saudi-aligned figure who chairs the internationally recognised government of Yemen. Al-Alimi ordered all UAE military forces to withdraw from Yemen within 24 hours, a 90-day state of emergency, and the blockade of all land and sea ports for 72 hours.But an STC spokesperson dismissed calls for the group to withdraw, saying the separatists would hold their territory.“There is no thinking about withdrawal. It is unreasonable for the landowner to be asked to leave his own land. The situation requires staying and reinforcing,” Anwar Al-Tamimi told AFP.“We are in a defensive position, and any movement toward our forces will be responded to by our forces,” he added.Analysts describe the STC and other UAE-backed groups as the strongest factions militarily within the anti-Houthi coalition, so it remains to be seen how much support Saudi Arabia is willing to lend its allies in Yemen to fight the group.As many as 20,000 Saudi-backed forces have reportedly gathered on the border of Yemen.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke with his Saudi and UAE counterparts, his department said.Rubio and the UAE foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, discussed “the situation in Yemen and broader issues affecting Middle Eastern security and stability”, said a state department spokesperson.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the resumption of full-scale fighting in Yemen could destabilise the entire Red Sea area, and urged a de-escalation between all parties.The war in Yemen has killed an estimated 377,000 people, according to the UN, and nearly half of the population faces hunger due to the continuing civil war.A military statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency announced Tuesday’s strikes, which it said came after ships arrived there from Fujairah, a port city on the UAE’s eastern coast.Southern separatists in Yemen report Saudi airstrikes near positionsRead more“The ships’ crew had the disabled tracking devices aboard the vessels, and unloaded a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles in support of the STC forces,” it said.“Considering that the aforementioned weapons constitute an imminent threat, and an escalation that threatens peace and stability, the Coalition Air Force has conducted this morning a limited airstrike that targeted weapons and military vehicles offloaded from the two vessels in Mukalla.”The STC’s AIC satellite news channel acknowledged the strikes, without providing details.The attack is likely to have targeted a ship identified by analysts as the Greenland, a roll-on, roll-off vessel flagged out of St Kitts. Tracking data showed the vessel had been in Fujairah on 22 December and arrived in Mukalla on Sunday. The second vessel could not be immediately identified.Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert and the founder of the Basha Report, a risk advisory firm, cited social media videos that purported to show new armoured vehicles rolling through Mukalla after the ship’s arrival. The ship’s owners, based in Dubai, could not be immediately reached.“I expect a calibrated escalation from both sides. The UAE-backed STC is likely to respond by consolidating control,” al-Basha said. “At the same time, the flow of weapons from the UAE to the STC is set to be curtailed following the port attack, particularly as Saudi Arabia controls the airspace.”Footage later aired by Saudi state television, which appeared to be filmed by a surveillance aircraft, purportedly showed the armoured vehicles moving through Mukalla to a staging area. The types of vehicles corresponded to the social media footage.Mukalla is in Yemen’s Hadhramaut governorate, which the STC had seized in recent days. The port city is 480km north-east of Aden, which has been the seat of power for anti-Houthi forces in Yemen after the rebels seized the capital, Sana’a, in 2014.The strike in Mukalla comes afterSaudi Arabia targeted the council in airstrikeson Friday, which analysts described as a warning for the separatists to halt their advance and leave the governorates of Hadhramaut and Mahra.Those aligned with the council have increasingly flown the flag of South Yemen. Demonstrators have been rallying for days to support political forces calling forSouth Yemen to secede again.The actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the Opec oil cartel but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years.UAE support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan has reportedly angered Saudi Arabia, after the RSF committed mass atrocities in the Sudanese city of El Fasher. The two are also at odds over Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia where the UAE has a military base and airstrip.The UAE notably did not join Saudi Arabia and 20 other countries and Islamic organisations in issuing a statement condemning Israel’s recognition of Somaliland on Friday.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsYemenSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricaIranHouthisnewsShareReuse this content"

How do you not give a pardon?”Trump added that he “spoke to [Herzog] and he tells me it’s on its way. You can’t do better than that, right?”Netanyahu, Israel’s first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime, denies bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges brought in 2019. His supporters have dismissed his trials as politically motivated.The 76-year-old could be sent to prison if convicted, and a lengthy ban on holding public office would be part of any sentence. Given Netanyahu’s age, this would end his political career, Israeli analysts say.Trump shows customary disdain for protocol as poker-faced Netanyahu watches onRead moreTrump has repeatedly raised the prospect of a pardon for Netanyahu, in social media posts and during a speech to Israel’s national assembly in October. A month later, the US president wrote aformal letter to Herzogurging him to grant clemency and describing the case as “political, unjustified prosecution”.Asked on Monday about Trump’s remarks, Herzog’s office said the Israeli president had not had any conversations with Trump since receiving the letter in November.“There has not been a conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted,” Herzog’s office said in a statement issued a few minutes after Trump’s comments.Responding to that earlier request, Herzog’s office said the Israeli president appreciated Trump’s “unwavering support of Israel, his immense contribution to the return of the hostages, the transformation of the Middle East and Gaza and the safeguarding of Israel’s security” but stressed that “anyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures”.Many in Israel were outraged by Trump’s intervention, saying it infringed national sovereignty.Herzog’s office said the Israeli president had spoken to a representative for Trump then and it was explained that any decision would be made in accordance with established procedures.Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, is reported to have met Herzog earlier this year to discuss cancelling Netanyahu’s trial. Herzog delivered a lengthy lecture explaining why this was not in his power, aJerusalem Postcolumnist reported.“The cases are proceeding at an infuriatingly slow pace but they are closing in on the defendant. Therefore, a pardon is required. Actually, not a pardon. For a pardon, you have to admit and step down. As far as Netanyahu is concerned, the trial must be cancelled. At any cost,” Ben Caspit wrote.Netanyahu himself submitted a formal pardon request to Herzog on 30 November, arguing that frequent court hearings impaired his ability to govern and that clemency served the national interest by acting to “lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation”.The request by the six-time prime minister drew fierce criticism from opponents, who said pardoning him mid-trial would be a total breach of the rule of law.Experts say that although presidential powers of pardon can be exercised with some flexibility, they are intended to be used after conviction of an individual and there is no precedent for cancelling an ongoing trial, as Netanyahu and Trump are demanding.Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, areaccused in one caseof accepting more than $260,000 (£198,000) worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He also suggests Trump’s Republican base want a deal and not further unnecessary wars.Araghchi was writing a day afterNetanyahu held talks with Trumpin the US in which Israel’s calls to consider fresh attacks on Iran were discussed alongside the Gaza peace plan.Hamas will have ‘hell to pay’ if it fails to disarm, Trump warns after Netanyahu meetingRead moreNetanyahu claims Iran may be seeking to rebuild its nuclear programme after jointIsraeli-US assaults on Iran in Juneseverely damaged its key nuclear sites. Netanyahu has also been expressing growing concern about the risk to Israel posed by the neighbouring country’s missile programme. He will be emboldened by reports of protests running into a third day in the Tehran bazaar over its depreciating currency and rising inflation.On Monday, speaking alongside Netanyahu in Florida, Trump said: “I hope they’re not trying to build up again because, if they are, we’re going to have no choice but very quickly to eradicate that buildup.”View image in fullscreenProtesters march through downtown Tehran on Monday, angered by the country’s economic turmoil.Photograph: APBut Araghchi makes a direct appeal to Trump to set aside Israeli warnings and realise a narrow window has opened to restart negotiations withIran. It is one of his most direct appeals to Washington to restart talks and include Iran in a recalibrated Middle East.He writes: “The US administration now faces a dilemma: it can continue writing blank cheques for Israel with American taxpayer dollars and credibility, or be part of a tectonic change for the better.”He insists Iran remains open to negotiation so long as a capitulation is not required and says an unnecessary crisis can be avoided through talks.He reveals without naming any specific country that he “has been made aware that there is an unprecedented willingness amongst mutual friends of Iran and the US to facilitate dialogue and underwrite the full and verifiable implementation of any negotiated outcome”.His remarks suggest Gulf states may be willing to provide guarantees about any future nuclear programme, but Araghchi gives no hint that Iran is prepared to back down over its insistence on its right to enrich uranium domestically for civilian use, the issue that dogged US-Iran negotiations. He argues all signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty have a right to access all aspects of a peaceful nuclear programme.Araghchi says any future talks could take place in a more propitious context since the assaults on Iran in June had changed diplomatic alliances across the Middle East, showing that Iran has the strategic depth to resist Israel, while in the US hostility towards Israeli brinkmanship is growing.He writes: “The shifts in our region can enable implementation of understandings in a whole new way. For those willing to go where no one has gone before, there is a brief window of opportunity. Fortune favours the brave and it takes a lot more guts to break an evil cycle than to simply perpetuate it.‘There’s no going back’: Iran’s women on why they won’t stop flouting dress code lawsRead moreHe added “a rising number of Americans realise that Israel is not an ally but a liability”, adding Trump’s Arab allies have come to view Israel’s recklessness as “a threat to us all”.Despite the heavy economic pressure on Iran, revealed by its plunging currency and budget deficit, Iran’s leaders believe they emerged psychologically stronger from the June war than expected. Those in Israel and Washington that think Iran is weaker than Araghchi claims will point to a continued crackdown on dissent, sporadic protests, spiralling executions and an inability to break out of the cage of US economic sanctions.But Araghchi claims Israel has repeatedly misled Washington “into believing that Iran was nearing collapse, that the 2015 nuclear deal was a lifeline for us, and that abandoning the accord would compel us to quickly concede”. Those myths encouraged Washington to abandon a functional diplomatic framework in favour of “maximum pressure” that produced only “maximum resistance”.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her death was announced on Tuesday morning by the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP).Zia was the widow of former Bangladeshi president and military hero Ziaur Rahman, who had led to the fight for the country’s democracy but was killed in a military coup in 1981.She took up his political mantle with gusto and gained a loyal following for her uncompromising stance against the military dictatorship. She first came to power in 1991, remaining in office until 1996 and then served a brief second stint. However, the opposition boycotted the election result and Zia was then toppled by Hasina, who remained her arch political nemesis for the next 30 years.As Zia and Hasina alternated in the prime minister’s office over the past three decades, they stayed locked in a fierce political rivalry. Zia’s 2001 regime was mired accusations of corruption and after Hasina took power again in 2009, she was slapped with multiple cases.View image in fullscreenKhaleda Zia waves at the start of a 400km protest march from Dhaka to the northern village of Dinajpur in 1999.Photograph: Pavel Rahmen/APIn 2018, Zia was found guilty and jailed on corruption charges for 10 years. Her party said the charges were politically motivated to weaken the opposition, accusations denied by the Hasina government.Under Hasina, Zia’s BNP party faced routine harassment and oppression, with most leaders jailed or forced to flee abroad.Zia remained under house arrest for years, while her health began to deteriorate. But after the fall of Hasina during in a mass uprising in 2024, she was freed from years of house arrest. In January, Zia was allowed to travel abroad for medical treatment after Hasina’s government rejected requests at least 18 times.Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026, the first vote in Bangladesh since the fall of Hasina. However, late in November, Zia was taken to hospital, where her condition continued to decline.After her death was announced, interim prime minister Muhammad Yunus released a statement, calling Zia a “symbol of the democratic movement”.Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, who had lived in exile in the UK for 18 years, returned to Bangladesh this month to contest the elections, with the BNP considered to be the frontrunners.Zia is expected to be buried on Wednesday in Dhaka, alongside her husband.Explore more on these topicsBangladeshSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

However, the prime minister has since condemned the tweets and said he was unaware of them.Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, has alsolaunched a reviewlooking into “serious information failures” around the case, aftersuccessive Tory and Labour governmentshad lobbied for Abd el-Fattah’s release as a political prisoner.The activist, who was granted British citizenship while in prison in 2021 through his mother’s birth in the UK, hasapologised “unequivocally”for his posts after opposition parties called for him to be deported and his citizenship revoked.Human rights campaigners have reacted with anger to the suggestion, saying citizenship stripping as a punishment for social media posts would be an “extremely authoritarian step”.On Tuesday the activist faced fresh criticism from the Conservatives after his official Facebook account appeared recently to have liked a social media post suggesting “Zionists against Alaa Abd el-Fattah” were behind a “campaign” against him.The Home Office has not officially commented but government sources said the legal bar for revoking citizenship had not been met and the evidential case in relation to Abd el-Fattah had not changed for 12 years, during which he was granted citizenship.Abd el-Fattah citizenship row shows shift on questions of national identityRead moreShabana Mahmood, the home secretary, is unlikely to remove someone’s British citizenship unless they obtained it by fraud or are considered a terrorist, extremist or involved with serious organised crime. The decision comes with a right of appeal, as inthe case of Shamima Begum, whounsuccessfully appealedagainst the decision by the former home secretary Sajid Javid’s decision to revoke her citizenship in 2019.Government sources said the bar on removing citizenship was set high to provide the necessary safeguards.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah, seen here speaking at his trial in Cairo in November 2014 on charges of breaking a law against protests, spent more than a decade in detention in Egypt.Photograph: Al Youm Al Saabi/ReutersSome human rights experts and campaigners have warned that allowing politicians to deprive someone of their citizenship for any reason is a slippery slope.Chris Doyle of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, who supported Abd el-Fattah’s release, said the tweets were “appalling” but the context was that Egyptian social media was a “very angry place” at the time and it should be understood that Abd el-Fattah was not an Islamist.Doyle added: “Politicians calling for the stripping of people’s citizenship on a bandwagon is not a path to go down. Citizenship is a right and any grounds for removing citizenship should be if there has been an improper part of the process.”David Davis, the Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, said he was not necessarily opposed to the idea of Abd el-Fattah losing citizenship but politicians should not have that power. “We do give out citizenship too easily … and on the other hand you have spectacularly bad staff work. This problem starts with the inappropriate award of citizenship,” he said.“That being said, it should not be in the gift of politicians whether in government or opposition to determine someone’s citizenship. That is an almost vertical slippery slope. At what point do you decide to withdraw citizenship from your political opponents or someone who is politically uncomfortable for you?“I don’t think it’s necessarily the case he should not have his citizenship withdrawn but it should be a judicial or quasi-judicial procedure. These things should automatically go to court. It should not be a political decision.”Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s migrant rights director, said: “Stripping anyone of their citizenship, even for hateful comments, is not a legitimate penalty and it is deeply disturbing that anyone – particularly those in or seeking positions of leadership – should have so little regard for our shared nationality that they so quickly call for such draconian action.“Stripping someone of their citizenship because of what they may say or tweet would be an extremely authoritarian step.”Downing Street has defended its campaign for the release of Abd el-Fattah and its decision towelcome him to the UKdespite his “abhorrent” tweets a decade ago.The prime minister’s spokesperson said on Monday: “We welcome the return of a British citizen unfairly detained abroad, as we would in all cases and as we have done in the past. That is central to Britain’s commitment to religious and political freedom. It doesn’t change the fact that we have condemned the nature of these historic tweets and we consider them to be abhorrent.”In one resurfaced tweet from 2010, Abd el-Fattah said he considered “killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them”. In 2012 he posted: “I am a racist, I don’t like white people.” He is also accused of saying police did not have rights and “we should kill them all”, and referring to British people as “dogs and monkeys”.Downing Street said Starmer had not been aware of the past tweets until after Abd el-Fattah had entered the UK. The development raises questions about what vetting took place before Abd el-Fattah was granted UK citizenship in 2021, and what research the government carried out before it took up his case with the Egyptian authorities. Successive prime ministers, including Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, had campaigned for Abd el-Fattah’s release.The Conservatives and Reform UK have both suggested the activist should be deported from the UK for the posts and have his British citizenship revoked, even though the law does not appear to provide grounds for either action. Nigel Farage has promoted a petition for people to sign in favour of deporting Abd el-Fattah to Egypt.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeEgyptSocial mediaLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It is one of only three drugs, alongside magic mushrooms and hallucinogens, to have become used more regularly since 2015.Recent data from the Office for National Statistics shows that ketamine usage, while down slightly from the previous year, is still high. The numbers who say they have used the drug in the past month has increased by 251.85% since 2015, the greatest increase in the use of a single drug in that period.Ketamine use has become more prevalent over the past 10 yearsFew places have felt the effects of that increase more than urology departments. Chronic ketamine use can cause irreversible damage to the bladder and urinary tract, and departments have seen an increase in patients, with many of those treated being young adults and teenagers.Alison Downey, a consultant urologist in South Yorkshire, says ketamine abuse is worse than she has ever seen, with admissions pushing medical centres and hospitals to their limits.“We’re already stretched really thin as it is and it’s been a massive increase that we’re just not equipped for. Although it causes urology problems, ketamine abuse is not a urology issue, its an addiction and we can’t do anything about that”, said Downey, who has worked as a consultant for more than five years.“It’s an awful problem at the moment, and the epicentre seems to be Barnsley,” she said. “In 2021, there were 11 attendances in Barnsley A&E for ketamine-related issues, and that was for the whole year. This year, from January to May, there have been 50, that’s a huge increase for just five months.”Downey believes that ketamine abuse has surged due to a myriad of factors, including how cheap it is. She says most cases they see are also young people who began using the drug as a coping mechanism during Covid lockdowns five years ago.“Most people I see are in their teens or early 20s, so looking at when they started doing ketamine it largely seems to have been during the pandemic,” said Downey, who pointed out that many who take it are still school age.“In under-16 drug centres, we’ve heard stories like kids pooling their pocket money together to buy some ketamine and then they’ll just share it,” she said. “They’ll take little, small amounts into the school toilets and take some then, which is absolutely frightening.”Nadir Osman, a consultant urological surgeon in Sheffield, says that admissions tied to ketamine abuse have “skyrocketed” in the last few years, and that not enough ketamine users understand the effect that consistently taking the drug will have on their bodies.“Ketamine is a unique drug because it seems like there are no side-effects, but its more complicated than that,” said Osman. “It slowly impacts the bladder and the liver, and then the urinary tract. It takes a couple of years to begin to notice these effects, but once you start noticing them they’re pretty irreversible.”Osman also claimed that some users who are on a list for surgery end up not getting the procedure done due to continuing to use the drug as pain relief.Prof Ian Pearce, consultant urological surgeon and andrologist at Manchester Royal Infirmary, believes that more needs to be done to warn people, especially those who are still of school age, about the dangers of becoming involved with ketamine while providing help with those already experiencing the effects of abusing the drug.“One of the main issues with ketamine is that the relapse rate post-rehabilitation is massive, so ongoing support is vital,” said Pearce, who suggested that the government should implement a “targeted educational drive aimed at secondary schools to really get across the message that this is a highly negatively impactful substance with a huge potential for lifelong sequelae”.Explore more on these topicsDrugsHealthHospitalsEnglandNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At this time of year, the average sea temperature around the UK and Ireland is 6C to 10C.The warning follows the disappearance of Matthew Upham, 63, and another man during aChristmas Day swimin the Devon seaside town of Budleigh Salterton.A number of people were safely brought to shore, but Upham and the other man, in his 40s, could not be found. Of the people rescued, two were looked over by paramedics and one was taken to hospital as a precaution.Gareth Morrison, the head of water safety for the RNLI, said on Tuesday: “We know this time of year many people take part in festive and new year dips or continue to take part in regular winter swims.”He said swimmers should be aware of their abilities and carefully assess sea conditions before entering the water. First-time swimmers should consult their GP before attempting to swim in open water.“With the sea temperatures still dropping and reaching their coldest around March, the effects of cold water, combined with weather conditions and any personal health issues, should be taken seriously before venturing in,” Morrison said.“Avoid swimming alone; consider going with others or joining a group so you can look out for each other. We’d recommend wearing a wetsuit to keep you warm and increase your buoyancy, together with a bright swim cap and tow float to make yourself visible to others and use in an emergency.”Morrison said people who spot a swimmer in difficulty should call emergency services rather than enter the water themselves.Upham and the second man, who has not been publicly named, were reported to have gone missing after going into the water to try to help a woman in difficulty.“The most important thing to remember is if you are in any doubt stay out of the water and if you or anyone else does get into trouble in or on the water, please call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard,” he said.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUK weatherSwimmingEmergency servicesnewsShareReuse this content"

The survey was conducted at the Phillips station in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state.The department also collects measurements with electronic instruments at other sites, and said that statewide the snowpack currently stands at 71% of average.Southern California cleans up after the wettest recent Christmas seasonRead moreThe measurement is the first of the season, and offers an important snapshot of the health of California’s water supply. The snowpack acts as a critical saving bank for the year ahead – essentially a frozen reservoir that provides about a third of the water used annually in California as it melts each spring and flows into rivers and streams and replenishes groundwater.A period of warm, dry weather was recently broken by a series ofheavy storms– fueled by a powerfulatmospheric river– that broughtrecord levels of rainin places such as Los Angeles and large quantities of snow in mountainous areas.Officials said that Monday’s measurement offered a hopeful sign, but cautioned that it is too soon to know how that could affect water supplies in the coming year.“The dry conditions and warmer temperatures in early December delayed our snow-building season, but the return of storm activity, especially in the last week, helped to build a solid base for this year’s snowpack,” said Fabbiani-Leon. “While California is in a better position now, it is still early in the season and our state’s water supply for this year will ultimately depend on a continued cadence of storms throughout winter and early spring.”The water content of the snowpack at the Phillips station is at 50% of the average for this time of year and 21% of the average for 1 April, when the Sierra snowpack is typically at its peak, Fabbiani-Leon said.Those levels are about half of what the state saw at this time last year, said David Rizzardo, the department’s hydrology section manager.“The trend we’re looking at right now is more rain than snow,” Rizzardo told reporters. “We’d like to see the snow accumulation pick up by April 1 so that we’re closer to average.”The state has built a complex system of canals and dams to capture and store the water in reservoirs for the hot, dry months when it doesn’t rain or snow. Those reservoirs are measuring at 123% of average for this time of year, Rizzardo said.The measurements are closely watched in California, which is home to 39 million people and grows much of the country’s fresh fruit and vegetables. The health of the snowpack helps determine whether California will face challenges providing water to farms and cities during the hot summer months.The state has grappled in recent years with swings between extremes of wet and dry. About a year ago, officials recorded a water content of the snowpack at the Phillips station of 91% of the average. In 2025, the state’s snowpack was near average just ahead of the 1 April peak and the state’s reservoirs above their historic capacity after two wet winters, following a years-long drought that forced severe cuts in water use.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWaterWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Sands, who starred in A Room With a View and Leaving Las Vegas, was reported missing after setting off on a solo hike in January 2023. His body was found five months later.Body of triathlete apparently killed by shark found on California beachRead moreAnd in January 2023, the same month Sands went missing, another 15 hikers either got lost, were injured or died on the mountain.The department said it received a call at about 11.30am on Monday from someone reporting that their 19-year-old friend had tumbled 500ft (150 meters) down a remote mountainside. The caller had hiked to an area with cellular service and provided GPS coordinates to rescuers.A helicopter crew spotted the injured hiker and two other people but strong winds prevented the aircraft from landing. A second landing attempt hours later was also unsuccessful because of winds.A medic was eventually hoisted down from a helicopter and found all three people dead at about 7.30pm, the sheriff’s statement said. Their identities were not released as of Tuesday and the cause of the deaths wasn’t immediately known.That same day, the San Bernardino sheriff’s department announced that it rescued two other hikers – two men, ages 18 and 31 – from another trail on Mount Baldy. One of the hikers was hurt after falling more than 100ft from the trail.In October, three hikers were rescued near the same trail where the deceased hikers were found. The San Bernardino sheriff’s department said that three 20-year-old men were hiking near the Devil’s Backbone when they took a wrong turn, got lost and were unable to keep moving on the mountain. All were rescued without any injuries.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaMountaineeringLos AngelesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The defense rebuked federal prosecutors who pushed for the suspect to remain in custody.Cole’s lawyers argued Tuesday that their client is on the autism spectrum, and has been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder.In a recent court filing, they also wrote that Cole has “zero criminal history”, and there is “zero evidence that he will flee”. They argue that no one was “actually harmed” as a result of the crimes Cole has been charged with, since neither of the bombs exploded.US Capitol pipe bomb suspect says he believed Trump’s 2020 election lieRead moreHowever, according toa recent justice department memo, Cole allegedly confessed to his crimes after he was arrested by law enforcement. At the time, his home was also searched and several bomb-making components were found on the premises. The FBI also obtained Cole’s credit card statements, which, they note, showed the purchase of several materials used to make the bombs.The documents state that in a video interview with authorities, Cole, 30, said that he was inWashington DCto protest against the outcome of the 2020 election on 5 January. He initially maintained that he did not plant the pipe bombs, and was not the person pictured in surveillance footage on the evening of the attempted attacks.However, after the interviewing agents “reminded the defendant that lying to them was an additional criminal offense” and asked him again whether he was the individual in the video, he “paused for approximately fifteen seconds, placed his head face down on the table, and answered, ‘yes’”.The filing goes on to note that “the defendant walked the interviewing agents in detail through his construction, transportation, and planting of the pipe bombs”.According to the papers, when agents pressed Cole on his motive, he said that “something just snapped” after “watching everything, just everything getting worse”.Cole said that he wanted to do something “to the parties” because “they were in charge”. When asked about his decision to place the bombs at the RNC and DNC headquarters, the defendant reportedly responded: “I really don’t like either party at this point.”Later in the interview, Cole apparently explained that the idea to use pipe bombs came from “his interest in history”, specifically the Troubles in Northern Ireland. “The defendant denied that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to the proceedings scheduled to take place on January 6,” according to the court documents. He was also “pretty relieved” that the devices did not detonate, and told agents that he planted the bombs at night because he did not want to kill people, according to the filing.Cole’s lawyers have requested that the judgeorder the releaseof any video or written “statements, confessions or admissions” from the defendant to his legal team.Meanwhile, federal prosecutors argue that since Cole is charged with transporting explosives across state lines and maliciously attempting to use those explosives to damage or destroy property – the latter of which comes with a prison sentence of up to 20 years – he “poses an intolerable risk of danger to the community if released”.According to CBS News, Judge Martin J Sharbaugh said that he would not decide Tuesday on whether to release Cole from custody, but noted that he would issue an “expeditious” ruling.Cole’s arrest was the biggest development in a case that had long stumped law enforcement officials and inspired myriad conspiracy theories throughout the years of searching for the perpetrator.Explore more on these topicsUS Capitol attackWashington DCUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She was 35.Her passing was announced in a social media post by the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. “Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts,”the post said. It was signed “George, Edwin and Josephine Moran, Ed, Carolina, Jack, Rose and Rory”.In a New Yorker essay published in November, Schlossberg said she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, and had less than a year to live.Schlossberg, who graduated from Yale and had a master’s degree from Oxford, was previously a climate reporter for the New York Times, and had contributed to the Atlantic, the Washington Post and Vanity Fair.The daughter of Caroline Kennedy, 67, and Edwin Schlossberg, 80,said she’d learned of her diagnosisshortly after giving birth to her second child with husband George Moran in May 2024 and had been undergoing treatment.“I did not – could not – believe that they were talking about me,” Schlossberg wrote in the essay, titled A Battle With My Blood. “I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn’t sick. I didn’t feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.”In the essay, the environmental writer addressed her cousin, Robert F Kennedy Jr, criticizing the influence his policies as secretary of health and human services had had on her experience with the illness.Schlossberg wrote that she strongly disapproved of his anti-vaccine positions and his decisions to cut funding for medical research, emphasizing the harm such actions cause to patients like herself.“As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearlya half billiondollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,” she wrote.She said that Kennedy “slashed billions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest sponsor of medical research; and threatened to oust the panel of medical experts charged with recommending preventive cancer screenings”.Schlossberg added that doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving medical center, where she was receiving care, were uncertain about their future after funding cuts initiated by the Trump administration.“Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,” Schlossberg wrote. The university later reached an agreement with the Trump administration that reinstated the funding.She concluded her essay reflecting on her focus in the time she had left, writing that she hoped to “fill my brain with memories” of her children: “I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go … I will keep trying to remember.”Schlossberg leaves behind a three-year-old son and a one-year-old daughter she shared with her husband.Explore more on these topicsUS newsJohn F KennedynewsShareReuse this content"

Contrary to Musk’s promises, Doge’s success is vague and tough to quantify. Measuring the full impact and determiningwhether the agency even existsas a centralized entity anymore is difficult, complicated by an ongoing effort from the government to block disclosure of documents, which is itself a symptom of the chaos that the department created.Although the disarray and destruction left by Doge is evident across the globe, we still do not really know exactly how the agency operated and its true effects. Instead, humanitarian aid organizations are still trying to assess the extent of the damage that Doge created whileethics watchdogshave launched lawsuits trying to compel more transparency out of the government.“I know it feels like all this happened over the course of several years, but the first year of this administration isn’t even done,” said Nikhel Sus, the deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew). “We still want to know what happened, and we still want the record to be out there, because the public is entitled to this information.”Move fast and destroy things: 100 chaotic days of Elon Musk in the White HouseRead moreOutside of the US, Doge’scuts to USAIDhave also caused months of turmoil in countries around the world as humanitarian organizations struggle to make up for lost funding and calculate whether they can continue their operations at all. Thousands of aid workers havelost their jobs, testing for diseases such asHIV/Aidshas drastically declined and researchers have warned there could bearound 14 million excess deathsacross the globe in the next five years if the US fails to restore aid funding. Yet because of the nature of Doge’s cuts, non-profits including the International Aids Society (IAS) say that it’s hard to pin down the exact numbers of people who are affected.“The cuts also damaged monitoring and communications infrastructure, which means it is quite difficult to obtain full data,” IAS president Beatriz Grinsztejn said.All of the costs and chaos of Doge have also come while ethics groups andgovernment workers saythe central premise of the agency – making the government more efficient – hasn’t been delivered on. Musk’sclaims of findinglarge-scalevoter fraudhave likewise borne no fruit, finding neither backing in concrete evidence nor law enforcement action. Instead, some former federal workers have described officialstearing down functional partsof the government and building ineffective replacements – if they replace them at all.The mystery of how much Doge ‘saved’Doge, christened after acryptocurrencythat was itself named for a doe-eyed shiba inu, emerged out of Musk’sbackingofDonald Trumpduring the 2024 presidential election and months of suggestions on the campaign trail that the billionaire could root out “waste, fraud and abuse” within the government. In its formative days, Musk made extravagant predictions about the amount of money that Doge would save.“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk said during a Trump rally in October of last year. He later revised that following inauguration, still claiming that Doge would save $1tn worth of “waste” from the budget by the end of September of this year.Doge vowed to keep track of its contract cuts throughout its existence via an online tracking site, but even by Doge’s own count it is falling far short. The cost-cutting tracker, which has also been shown to contain egregious errors that make thefigures overblown and unreliable, projects that the effort has cut $214bn in spending. The site’s “wall of receipts” of canceled contracts states that it has cut $61bn. Although Doge promised to eventually update the site in real time, the page states it has not been updated since 4 October.The true dollar amount of how much Doge has cut and how much the agency has cost taxpayers isfar harder to pin downdue to the convoluted nature of government contracts, Doge’s poor accounting methods and court challenges to layoffs, some of which have resulted in reinstatements. Organizations across the political spectrum that have attempted to track Doge’s cuts agree, however, that Doge’s numbers do not give an accurate representation of how the agency operated.The sudden halting of US foreign aid had a ripple effectBeatriz Grinsztejn, president of International Aids SocietyDoge’s calculations also ignore the more difficult-to-measure long-term equations of cuts, such as demolishing a department thatcoordinates policy on homelessnessor effectivelyshutting downthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may result in greater costs down the road once those services are no longer available. A report in August from Democrats on the permanent subcommittee on investigations in Augustfound that Dogemay have caused around $21.7bn in waste through actions such as paying federal employees not to work due to deferred resignation. TheTrump administration’s top human resource officialannouncedin August that there would be around300,000 fewergovernment employees at the year’s end, largely due to Doge efforts, cut from a workforce of roughly 2.25 million civilians.“DOGE did not reduce spending, but it did reduce federal employment by nine percent in less than 10 months,” arecent analysisfrom the libertarian Cato Institute thinktank concluded. “A decline that large has not happened since the military demobilizations at the end of World War II and the Korean War.”Beyond mass firing personnel, one of the areas where Doge has had the most pervasive effects is foreign aid. Its shuttering of USAID, which Muskbraggedabout feeding “into the wood chipper”, disrupted global operations involving food aid and the treatment of a wide range of diseases. The cuts deeply affected testing andpreventative carefor HIV/Aids, which has left aid organizations scrambling to repair the damage.The chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in WashingtonRead more“The sudden halting of US foreign aid had a ripple effect,” Grinsztejn said. “It pulled a plug on our extensive network of partners, who immediately reported staff losses, suspended outreach and interruptions in HIV testing.”Aid agencies such as IAS already have snapshots of how funding cuts and freezes in Washington have specific, real-world effects. In Mozambique, anti-retroviral treatments for HIV dropped by a quarter, and in Johannesburg, South Africa, those treatments dropped by a third, according to IAS. About 156,000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean have lost access to HIV testing and treatments entirely.Cuts tofood aidhave meanwhile resulted inchildren starving to deathand programs being halted, although the full global effects are similarly hard to put an exact number on. One measure, from astudypublished by the Gates Foundation this month, showed that overall cuts in humanitarian aid would mean that 2025 was the first year in decades where the death rate of children under five years old would rise globally.“The world’s richest man has been involved in the deaths of the world’s poorest children,” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates toldthe New York Timesin May.The winding legal cases against DogeAs soon as Trump issued an executive order in January creating Doge, multiple non-profits and ethics watchdogsfiled lawsuitsagainst the government demanding that the agency disclose its power structure and comply with transparency laws. The number of cases against Doge multiplied in the following months as reports emerged that shadowy staffers wereaccessingsensitivegovernmentdatabasesandspearheadingmass layoffsof federal employees.Several of these cases have been resolved over the past months, including the supreme courtgranting some Doge staffersaccess to social security databases and afederal judge rulingthat the mass firing of probationary employees was against the law. Most of the thornier cases around what powers Doge wields and whether it must disclose its internal documents are still tied up in litigation and appeals, however, which government ethics groups say has meant that much about Doge has remained a black box.How Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA companyRead more“There are still very basic questions about Doge’s operational structure and activities that have not been answered because the entity has evaded transparency laws and evaded discovery requests,” Crew’s Sus said.Almost 11 months after filing its suit and winning two lower court victories, Crew’s case is still working its way through the court systems as the government has filed numerous appeals and a petition for rehearing. There’s no definitive timeline in sight for when it might compel more transparency out of Doge.Crew’s case is just one of many lawsuits involving Doge that are still pending a final decision and have no definitive end date in sight. Yet ethics watchdogs emphasize that these cases are important for getting a legal definition of what Doge is and what it is allowed to do. Otherwise, they say the risk is that the White House could re-empower Doge to carry out another rapid, opaque gutting of the government in the future.“Let’s say Doge’s influence wanes for some temporary period. They could immediately come back in a very strong and decisive way in which they’re operating similar to how they did at the outset of the administration,” Sus said. “They would have the apparatus to do that.”Does Doge still exist?In late March, Musk and seven other top Doge staffers sat down for a Fox News interview with host Brett Baier to defend their agency as backlash swelled. Almost all of those men – who included Musk’s deputy Steve Davis, longtime friend and Tesla board member Antonio Gracias and cloud-computing CEO Tom Krause – are no longer with Doge. Others, such as Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, have stayed on in a diminished capacity.There are still very basic questions about Doge’s operational structure and activities that have not been answeredNikhel Sus, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in WashingtonMany of Doge’s roles were intended to be temporary to begin with, allowing staffers to serve asspecial government employeeson short-term contracts. Yet some of the staffers’ exits embodied the messy, dramatic nature of their agency. Musk notoriouslyleftthe White House in May after feuding with other officials and engaging in a public spat with Trump, in which he accused the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Davis officially left the following month but continued to hold meetings and send deputies to assess staffers’ loyalty,according to Politico, leading to confusion and concern among those employees about potential legal issues around following his dictates.Davis returned to Musk’s empire after his government exit, appearing on a livestream last month in his role as CEO of the Boring Company to talk about tunneling under Tennessee. Anthony Armstrong, another Musk lieutenant, wasnamed chief financial officer of Musk’s xAIartificial intelligence company. Gebbia, one of the top Doge executives who remained in government, is nowin charge of redesigningfederal websites.Much of the early coverage of Doge’s staff also focused on the young engineers that Musk brought in to access data systems and work long hours at various agencies. Several of those employees – such asEd Coristine, who became well-known after his online pseudonym “Big Balls” became public – have beenmoved tofull-time government positions. Coristine now works at Gebbia’s National Design Studio,according to Wired. Trumpalso usedCoristine’s assault during an apparent carjacking outside of a DC nightclub as a prelude to sending the national guard to the city.Musk calls Doge only ‘somewhat successful’ and says he would not do it againRead moreOther staffers who came from Musk’s enterprises have gone back to their corporate roles. Erica Jehling, seconded to the Environmental Protection Agency as a member of Doge, now appears to be back working at SpaceX as a purchasing director, according to a LinkedIn profile matching her name and employment history. Gracias, Musk’s close friend and a billionaire venture capitalist, left Doge after gainingoperational control of an MDMA-therapy companyand amid backlash from the AFL-CIO over him working for Doge while his private equity firm managed retirement plans for public employees.The spectre of Doge still looms over federal workers, even if the days of engineers placingguards outside of conference roomsand setting up bunk beds in offices are no more. Inside many agencies, the ethos of canceling contracts and trying to run operations like a tech startup remains. Tools that Doge helped develop for processing information, often using AI and replacing human oversight, have also been put into use at agencies such as theGeneral Services Administrationand theDepartment of Veterans Affairs– where ProPublica reported a Doge staffer put together an error-prone AI tool for “munching” government contracts.When Musk’s former Doge aide Katie Miller asked the Tesla CEO this month how he assessed Doge’s accomplishments, Musk gave a toned-down response compared with his usual declarations of total victory and unlimited growth.“We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful,” Musk told Miller on her podcast, adding that it was his “best side quest”. When Miller asked whether he would go back and do it all over again, Musk was even less confident.“I mean, no, I don’t think so,” Musk said. “Would I do it? I mean, I probably … I don’t know.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

New projections issued after the December meeting show only one rate cut expected next year, while language in the new policy statement indicated the Fed would likely remain on hold for now until new data shows that either inflation is again falling or unemployment is rising more than anticipated.The lack of official data during the 43-day government shutdown, a gap in information still not fully filled, continued to shape the outlook and policymakers’ views about how to manage risk.Some of those either opposed or skeptical of the most recent cut “suggested that the arrival of a considerable amount of labor market and inflation data over the coming intermeeting period would be helpful on making judgments about whether a rate reduction was warranted”.The data catch-up continues, with jobs and consumer price information for December coming on 9 and 13 January, back to the normal release schedule.The Fed next meets on 27-28 January, with investors currently expecting the central bank to leave its benchmark rate unchanged.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS interest ratesInterest ratesUS unemployment and employment statisticsInflationEconomicsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not a push he needs.When the tide goes out, you see who’s been swimming nakedBerkshire’s insurance business, Geico, has been the key to its expansion over the decades. Its float – money from customers that Berkshire holds until it is needed for payouts – typically comes at a very low cost, and can be used to fund investment.Berkshire’s super-catastrophe (super-cat) insurance business has also been a profitable enterprise, although it faced large losses when disaster struck.In 1992, Hurricane Andrew cost Berkshire $125m, roughly equal to its 1992 super-cat premium income. But other insurers came out worse from what was then the largest insured loss in history, as Buffett wrote:Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)The dangers of derivatives – weapons of mass destructionIn his 2002 letter, Buffett said derivatives were “time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system”. He warned:In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.That warning looked very prescient in 2008, when the “frightening web of mutual dependence” that he said “develops among huge financial institutions” helped to trigger the financial crisis. Buffett said:Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.This “sleeping around” could actually be useful for large derivatives dealers because it assured them government aid if trouble hit, Buffett said:From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.However, that letter showed that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives contracts. Buffett justified this on the grounds that they were all “mispriced at inception, sometimes dramatically so”.Be ready for when it rains goldBuffett’s long-term goal is to outperform the S&P 500 index, which means keeping dry powder to deploy when valuations fall and “the cash register will ring loud”.Buffett says his plan is to dream big and be ready for when dark clouds fill the economic skies, as they will briefly rain gold.In 2016’s letterhe promised:When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.On delegation, and Buffett’s incredible managersBuffett has always been clear that the company is run on the principle of centralisation of financial decisions at “the very top”, which leads to a lot of delegation to the key managers running each company or business unit.He favours older managers, joking that “you can’t teach a new dog old tricks”.Through the 1980s, shareholders learned of the “terrific” Rose Blumkin and her family. “Mrs B” had escaped Russia, founded a furniture store inNebraskawith $500, offered much better deals than rivals, and was generating more than $100m of sales annually out of one 200,000 sq ft store before selling most of the business to Buffett for $55m as she approached her 90s.Happily in 1993, shareholders learned that Mrs B had celebrated her 100th birthday, with Buffett joking: “The candles cost more than the cake.” He added:Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attendmy100th.Alas she would not. As Buffettreminisced in 2011:She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)Succession planningBerkshire investors were treated to regular hints about life after Buffett. From 2005, they were reassured that the board had identified several candidates who could take on the role.Sounding unenthusiastic about the prospect, Buffett wrotein 2007’s letter:The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)Explore more on these topicsWarren BuffettNebraskaInvestingStock marketsUS economyEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, she added that Vought’s argument is “not a valid justification for the agency’s unilateral decision to abandon its obligations under the injunction”.She added that funding for the agency has continued “seamlessly” since the bureau was established in 2011, “even in the years since 2022 when the Federal Reserve’s interest expenses have exceeded its earnings”.The US court of appeals for the DC circuit upheld Jackson’s earlier injunction and is set to hear the case on the administration’s wider attempt to dismantle the entire CFPB in February 2026. “The only new circumstance is the administration’s determination to eliminate an agency created by Congress with the stroke of pen, even while the matter is before the Court of Appeals,” Jackson wrote in today’s order, describing it as “yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court’s injunction was put in place to prevent”.Jackson’s ruling comes just days before the agency was set to run out of the funding necessary to pay employees. In response, Elizabeth Warren – the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee – praised Tuesday’s decision. “If courts continue to uphold the law, they’ll keep blocking Russ Vought’s illegal attempts to ‘close down’ the agency that has returned $21bn directly to Americans who were cheated by big banks and giant corporations,” she said.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, following Jackson’s decision.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationConsumer rightsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At Folkestone in Kent, tailbacks formed as drivers hoping to catch the shuttle faced seven-hour delays.By Tuesday evening, engineers were still struggling to restore full service, with the Channel tunnel operator, Getlink, saying trains were running on only one of the tunnel’s two tracks, travelling in alternate directions.The technical glitch began on Monday night, according to Getlink, with “an incident related to the power supply to trains”.In statements on Tuesday morning, Eurostar indicated the outage led to the failure of a train operated by LeShuttle, which carries cars and freight vehicles through the tunnel. It said the train was eventually moved out of the tunnel.At St Pancras, Jack Slater and his girlfriend were left with no choice but to cancel a new year’s trip to Paris, a treat they had been planning since the summer.“We’re being advised to rebook for tomorrow, but all of the trains are fully booked already so the only option would be to upgrade to a first class seat – which is an extra lot of money,” he said.View image in fullscreenEurostar passengers wait for train services to resume at St Pancras.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAMatt Orien had come from Seattle in the US with his family, hoping to make it to Paris after spending a few days in London. “This is disappointing, but we have a friend who is helping us out with admin so we’ll hopefully have a way to get there,” he said. “We’re doing OK and we’ll find a way to have fun … we feel sorry for the people that are stuck in the train, in the tunnel.”Betty Ndukaeze, travelling in a family group, was hoping to reach Paris to celebrate. The journey started with a delay, with their 7.01am train leaving an hour late, before coming to a halt. After a long wait, they were sent back to St Pancras, she told the BBC.“It was chaos from the moment we got here,” said Ndukaeze. “They kept announcing there was a problem with the train ahead of us and saying they were trying to fix the problem.“We just got back here. The journey back from where we were stuck was only 20 minutes.”As of Tuesday afternoon, Eurostar said it would resume services to and from London at about 6pm, but it “strongly” advised passengers to postpone their journeys.Live service updatesshowed all departures for Paris on 30 December as cancelled, other than two trains at 18.01 and 19.01. In the other direction, only the 18.12 and 19.12 trains were listed as scheduled to depart for London.View image in fullscreenTravellers stranded at Gare du Nord station in Paris.Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP“As the overhead power supply issues in the Channel tunnel still remain, only one line is available to run trains on,” the operator said. “This means there will continue to be delays and longer journey times than usual this evening. Therefore we continue to advise our customers to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available.“We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have already been cancelled.”A driver’s photograph shared withthe BBCshowed overhead electrical cables strewn across the tracks.Eurostar, which carries foot passengers, and LeShuttle, which carries vehicles and is owned by Getlink, share the tunnel’s two tracks, which normally run only in one direction.Between them, the services transport thousands of passengers a day over the Christmas period.In an update sent out at 3pm on Tuesday, Getlink said the shuttle service had “resumed very gradually on one track shortly before 3pm CET [2pm UK time]” and that trains were running “alternately in both directions with significant delays”.Additional shuttles would be added from Tuesday evening until Wednesday morning, while waiting times would be adjusted throughout the day, it said. Live updates for the shuttle warned passengers: “Delay of approximately six hours to booked time, please check in as planned.”At Folkestone, the terminus for the shuttle, drivers trapped in lines of cars waiting to board shared their frustration on social media. “About to board our 08.25 departure, due out at 15.05!!!” said Spike on X, suggesting some vehicles faced a seven-hour delay.Kate from Woking said drivers at Folkestone were given food vouchers, playing cards and crisps. “Staff at the terminal were doing their best but they couldn’t promise much.”Stephanie Roberts, from Ashford, was returning home after a two-week holiday in Le Touquet, with her husband, Simon and their 18-month-old French bulldog, Dempsey.View image in fullscreenCars stuck in lines of traffic waiting to board a LeShuttle service from Folkestone to Calais.Photograph: Dean Pallant“We began queueing in Calais in the Eurotunnel at 10.30am French time,” she said. “In the end, we were waiting for more than five hours before we were able to board a train.“There was no food or water, but luckily we had brought a baguette with us, so we were able to munch on that. We bought a small bottle of water from a vending machine for €3 for Dempsey.The price is not the issue, it’s the principle.”Some UK drivers with later trains said they had diverted to Dover to take the ferry instead.The Port of Dover urged stranded drivers to consider switching to travel by sea, saying operators running between Dover and Calais had capacity for extra passengers.The east coast mainline train company LNER responded by offering passengers a free ride home. It said that “any customers who have had to abandon their journey in London King’s Cross are able to return to their home station on the next available LNER service at no additional cost”.LNER customers who choose to defer their Eurostar travel to a different day may use their existing LNER ticket to travel on that same day, it added.Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: “Those who have had their train cancelled have the option to exchange their booking or claim a refund or Eurostar e-voucher. For delays, travellers are entitled to compensation.“If you are delayed overnight, you have the right to be put up in a hotel or be reimbursed for one,.”Eurostar said customers could exchange their unused ticket for another date in the same travel class, receive a refund, or an e-voucher valid for 12 months. Stranded passengers can also claim hotel accommodation of up to £150 per room, along with £50 for taxi costs and £35 for food and drink expenses.Explore more on these topicsEurostarRail industryRail transportTransportEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, the Guardian has published anaward-winningseries of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand the Hebrew-language outletLocal Call– that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.One investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them onMicrosoft’s cloud services– setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company tocut offIsrael’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created aChatGPT-like toolto analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed toextraordinary termsto clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.I asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.How did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?Yuval Abraham:The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.Harry Davies:There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.What has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?Yuval Abraham:As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.If you remember the[Edward]Snowdenrevelations, many of them had to do withmetadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.So data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.Quick GuideContact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.Some of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.We know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as yourevealed, Yuval, and has alsopurchasedAI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?Yuval Abraham:What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] calledLavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.These AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.AI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.Harry Davies:Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.Microsoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?Harry Davies:I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have beenprotest groupswhich have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.Yuval Abraham:And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.It sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.Yuval Abraham:Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for itsNimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.These are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.Microsoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.What’s your focus going to be in 2026?Yuval Abraham:I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.Harry Davies:We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.There’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.And there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?Yuval Abraham:Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.Harry Davies:Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.Quick GuideContact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Leandro Trossard added a third with 20 minutes to go before the substitute Gabriel Jesus rubbed salt in Aston Villa’s wounds to compound their first defeat in 12 matches and leave them six points adrift of the leaders in third.Arteta hails Arsenal for ‘smelling blood’ in emphatic win against Aston VillaRead moreArsenal had fought their way to five unconvincing wins sincelosing the reverse fixtureto the last kick of the game at Villa Park 25 days ago, and with their title jitters growing as Manchester City have reeled off six successive victories, Mikel Arteta’s side needed a statement victory.The result and new cushion at the top before City visit Sunderland on New Year’s Day achieved the desired outcome in style, but Arteta will not look back on the first half with any fondness. The Emirates was edgy, Viktor Gyökeres looked lightweight and profligate up front, leaving an unhappy Arteta to exchange words with the referee, Darren England, as Villa created the better chances, with two let-offs in particular afforded by Ollie Watkins.Arsenal had missed the injured Declan Rice badly during the opening 45 minutes, with Amadou Onana able to dominate in midfield in his absence, and the Belgian’s withdrawal at half-time with a hamstring injury proved pivotal. Without Onana’s physical presence Martin Ødegaard found the space to showcase his quality, creating two goals and exuding much-needed calmness under pressure in the absence of Rice.Such composure continues to elude Gyökeres, who contributed little other than missing the target with two first-half headers, with his return five league goals (and just two since September) looking like an extremely poor return for Arsenal’s £64m investment. Gyökeres’s shoddy finishing was further highlighted by the contribution of Jesus, who scored his first goal of the season within a minute of being introduced as he continues his rehabilitation from a cruciate knee ligament injury.View image in fullscreenGabriel Jesus fires home Arsenal’s fourth goal in the 78th minute.Photograph: John Walton/PAAs a result, the nerves that have blighted Arsenal’s recent second-half performances came early before half-time, as Villa threatened on the counterattack. Ezri Konsa caught Gyökeres in possession and released Watkins, who shot wide at the near post, before shooting across goal from a similar position on the left after being released by another smart pass from Emiliano Buendía.Arteta was pacing the touchline with more agitation than usual by this point midway through the first half, and with good reason. A break in play caused by a hamstring injury to Onana, who initially played on after some judicious stretching, helped Arsenal regain their equilibrium if not any fluency.By the brink of half-time Arteta’s antics had degenerated sufficiently for England to have a quiet word, which seemed to involve the suggestion that he return to his seat, a futile act akin to asking New Year’s Eve revellers to leave the pub before midnight.Arteta’s mood improved considerably three minutes into the second half, when Arsenal took the lead with the kind of scrappy goal that is becoming their trademark.Four of Arsenal’s past six goals had been own goals and this was another festive gift, with Emiliano Martínez spilling Bukayo Saka’s corner under pressure from Gabriel, who headed in from close range. The video assistant referee, Jarred Gillett, took a close look as Gabriel’s arm was raised and close to his former teammate’s face, but correctly took no action.View image in fullscreenGabriel Magalhães opens the scoring for Arsenal.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersArsenal’s second goal five minutes later showcased their other qualities, coming from high pressing and impish attacking play. Ødegaard dispossessed Jadon Sancho and fed his namesake Zubimendi, who beat Martínez with a clinical finish with the outside of his right foot to spark delirium tinged with relief.Villa’s remarkable run of 11 successive victories had included five straight wins from losing positions away from home, but they did not threaten a fightback on this occasion, a failure of nerve that will leave major questions over whether they can continue to gatecrash the two-horse title race.Arsenal deliver statement win and bury the Emery bogey | John BrewinRead moreTrossard made sure of the points after Lucas Digne had failed to clear Ødegaard’s cross from the left in the 69th minute, while 10 minutes later the Belgian created the fourth for Jesus, who beat Martínez with a curling shot.Watkins fired an injury-time consolation into an open goal from two yards, but his pivotal contribution had come in the first half, spurning two good chances when Arsenal were wobbling.Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth, who are without a win in 10 games, may be just what Arsenal need to calm their nerves further.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Yet Ruben Amorim’s side struggled – badly – and while Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire headed those unavailable, the display provokes questions regarding United’s cohesion.In the contest’s closing phase they were potent only sporadically – as throughout. Their opening-half goal was a fortunate one for Joshua Zirkzee, rebounding in off Ladislav Krejci, and after the Czech’s equaliser just before the interval, Wolves might have recorded a first – and famous – victory of the season.Gabriel Magalhães’ opener sparks Arsenal’s second-half rout of Aston VillaRead moreAfter Jhon Arias went close with a late shot saved by Senne Lammens, Rob Edwards’ visitors threatened again, and while Patrick Dorgu thought he snatched an 89th-minute winner he was ruled correctly offside.A draw was far more respectable for Wolves because despite United’s missing personnel any team with hopes of Champions League qualification has to collect all points against opponents surely heading for relegation. The boos at the end echoed those at half-time and informed Amorim precisely how the home fans viewed the evening.He said: “Strange game. We struggled – a lack of creation. We had our chances but the fluidity offensively wasn’t there. When you play Casemiro and [Manuel] Ugarte in the middle you know it is different from when you have Bruno or Kobbie [Mainoo]. We have lack of fluidity and then lack of quality and then we suffer a goal from a set piece. We didn’t use that excuse [players missing]against Newcastle [a 1-0 win]so we won’t use it today.”Amorim did strike a positive note. “I’m really confident we will be a strong team – we need to recover all the players,” the Portuguese said.The latest to be ruled out was Mason Mount, by injury, so Zirkzee replaced him in the right-hand No 10 role. Wolves had the better of the opening period, rolling passes about, pleasing Edwards and infuriating Amorim. So when United claimed possession, Luke Shaw was found and Benjamin Sesko released down the left, a sharp turn and right-foot shot that went close cheered the head coach.The emotion was brief as Wolves again took over. Yerson Mosquera broke easily down the right and teed up Tolu Arokodare. The forward missed his kick, the ball bounced to Hwang Hee-chan, and the Korean blazed high.View image in fullscreenJoshua Zirkzee fires in a shot that deflected into the net to give United the lead.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersUnited required someone to wrest the initiative – precisely what Ayden Heaven did. The centre-back robbed Hwang near Wolves’ left touchline and drove infield. The ball went to Zirkzee and his shot beat José Sá via Krejci.Hardly fantasy stuff and soon United’s brittleness returned. First Heaven lost Arokodare in the area and the Nigerian missed a header. Moments later Lammens saved at point-blank range from Hugo Bueno.Finally, Wolves’ efforts yielded what they deserved. At a Bueno corner from the right the ball flicked off the hapless Zirkzee to the far post and the unmarked Krejci headed home.For the second half Amorim brought on Jack Fletcher, 18, for Zirkzee, precisely a year on from when the Portuguese removed the Dutchman after 33 minutes as United trailed 2-0 here to Newcastle – the game ending in that score. Amorim explained: “We were struggling with their midfielders, and we played with three strikers and sometimes that’s not the best thing to attack well.”His unit had to up the tempo, as when Dorgu thumped the ball right and in it came quickly for an opening Matheus Cunha missed the target with. But could they keep this up?A Casemiro chip to Sesko prised Wolves open and though he was offside this was more encouragement. As was a Diogo Dalot effort – his radar was awry – and a panicky Mosquera header meant as a back-pass for Sá that had the goalkeeper scrambling to clear off the line. Afterwards Edwards said he told Mosquera: “‘You’re mad you are.’ But he has a heart of gold.”Manchester United 1-1 Wolves: Premier League – liveRead moreAs the hour passed Wolves headed for only a third point of a troubled campaign – and possibly more – and United now mixed attack with ­clumsiness as when Shaw felled Mateus Mané.Hwang dipped the free-kick in and though the ball went back out of United’s area, in it came again: Krejci shot, Lammens saved low to his left and Mosquera, following up, could not squeeze the ball in.Edwards said: “The lads are with us but there’s nothing like results to get everyone on board.”Jørgen Strand Larsen, who came on in the 65th-minute, is a target for West Ham. Edwards was asked about the striker’s future. “Only time will tell,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If Jokić misses a month, that means he would be sidelined for about 16 games but could be playing again before February’sNBAAll-Star Game.The 6ft 11in Jokić – considered by many to be the best player in the world right now — got hurt with about three seconds left in the first half of Denver’s 147-123 loss in Miami on Monday night.Jokić entered Tuesday ranked fifth in the NBA in scoring this season at 29.6 points per game, plus leads the league with averages of 12.2 rebounds and 11 assists per contest. The only other player in NBA history to average at least 12 rebounds and 11 assists over a full season was Oscar Robertson for the Cincinnati Royals in 1961-62.“Obviously, it’s part of the game,” Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said Monday night after the game – speaking before the team got the word on the severity of Jokić’s injury. “But we never want to see it happen. ... Next man up. We’ve got to focus on what’s in here.”Denver have five games left on a seven-game road trip, one that resumes Wednesday when the Nuggets visit the Toronto Raptors.Jokić was alone under the basket and appeared to step forward to help Denver’s Spencer Jones defend a drive by Miami’s Jaime Jaquez Jr as time was about to expire in the second quarter. While backtracking, Jones stepped on Jokić’s left foot and it seemed the center’s knee buckled a bit.Jokić collapsed to the court, grabbing at the knee. He was helped to his feet, then made his way to the locker room under his own power but with a pronounced limp.Denver has been playing without three would-be starters in Aaron Gordon, Christian Braun and Cam Johnson. Even after dropping four of their last six games the Nuggets are still currently No 3 in the Western Conference at 22-10, with Jokić having played in all 32 of those games.That’s about to change, obviously. Denver are 13-23 over the last five seasons when Jokić isn’t in the lineup, and any slippage in the coming weeks would be damaging to the Nuggets’ playoff positioning. The Nuggets entered Tuesday only three games ahead of Phoenix, which is currently seventh in the conference.“You just have to stay with it as a team and as a group,” Nuggets coach David Adelman said Monday night. “And honestly, you have to stay with it as a team and a group because that’s how you best support your teammates that are out – by honoring them when you play. So, we’ll move on from there. This is part of the NBA.”The injury interrupts what might be Jokić’s best season of his career. Not only is he leading the league in rebounds and assists, but he’s shooting a career-best 43.5% from three-point range and tops the NBA with a true shooting percentage – a formula that accounts for three-pointers and free throws – of just over 71%.“It’s like a quest for efficiency and consistency, and I think that’s whether he admits it or not, he sees it as a craft,” Adelman said before Monday’s game, a couple of hours before the injury happened. “He’s trying to look at it as something, ‘What can I get better over the year at?’ And I think it’s been really impressive to watch him over these years, not be satisfied with it, and attack new journeys.”Explore more on these topicsNikola JokićDenver NuggetsNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The 35-year-old Carlsen, who also won the FreestyleChessgrand slam title this year, struck back in the second game and after a draw in the third, he kept his cool in the time scramble in the fourth to prevail in the endgame.Uzbekistan’s Bibisara Assaubayeva beat Ukrainian Anna Muzychuk 2½-1½ in the final to win the women’s title.Explore more on these topicsMagnus CarlsenChessShareReuse this content"

Diggs is charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery.Diggs’s lawyer, David Meier, said in an emailed statement that Diggs “categorically denies these allegations”.Meier said the allegations never occurred, describing them as unsubstantiated and uncorroborated. A court arraignment is scheduled for 23 January.“The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee’s satisfaction,” Meier wrote.In a statement, the Patriots said they were standing by Diggs. “We support Stefon,” the team said.A police narrative in a court filing said a woman came to the Dedham police department on 16 December to report that two weeks earlier, while working as a private chef for Diggs, he came into her bedroom and became angry during a discussion about money. The woman told police that Diggs “smacked her across the face”, she tried to push him away and then he “tried to choke her using the crook of his elbow around her neck”.“She said that he was behind her with his arm wrapped around her,” wrote officer Kenneth J Ellis. “She said that she did feel like she had trouble breathing and that she felt like she could have blacked out.” Diggs then threw her on a bed and said “lies” when she told him she had not been paid, Ellis wrote.The chef sought payment for a week in November when Diggs was having houseguests and she had to go home, Ellis wrote. The woman “left her position” and the home in Dedham but returned on 9 December to retrieve her property. At that point, she told police, Diggs referred her to his assistant, who told the woman she had to sign a non-disclosure agreement before she would be paid. She did not sign it, police said.The woman was reluctant to file charges until last week, Ellis wrote, when “she let me know that she had changed her mind from a few days ago” and wanted criminal charges.Diggs, 32, established himself as one of the NFL’s best wide receivers during a run with Minnesota and Buffalo from 2018 to 2023, when he had six consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons and was selected to the Pro Bowl four times.After a lackluster stint in Houston last year, Diggs ended up in New England, signing a three-year, $69m deal in free agency that guaranteed him $26m.Diggs has proven a reliable target for second-year quarterback Drake Maye and is a big reason why the team has once again clinched the AFC East title as it heads toward the playoffs.Off the field, his tenure with the Patriots got off to a rocky start when a video surfaced on social media in May showing Diggs passing what appeared to be a bag of pink crystals to women on a boat.It was not clear what the substance was, and an NFL spokesperson said the league would not comment. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said the team would handle the matter internally.Grammy award-winning rapperCardi Bhas posted photos in recent months of the newborn son she has with Diggs.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsNFLUS sportsMassachusettsCardi BShareReuse this content"

The model offers flexibility and focus – but raises deeper questions about growth, pressure and childhoodTim JoyceTue 30 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 04.02 ESTShareIn a major studyreleased recently in Epidemiology, conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes. Parents and their junior athletes feel that by being able to play several hours in the day instead of after school it will accelerate their progress in the sport while still leaving room for academics. And from my perspective, as a parent of a competitive tennis player who attends a “regular” school, it appears to be the rule, not the exception, that most advanced junior players are in online school and not in a physical building. I often find myself bonding with the few other parents whose kids remain in regular school as we’re a rapidly dwindling species.I was there: Carlos Alcaraz’s comeback in French Open final is still hard to comprehendRead moreConsider ICL Academy, the largest of the online schools for tennis players. According to Dayton Hansen the COO of ICL, “Since 2020, ICL Academy has seen a 4300% increase in overall enrollment, with a particularly strong rise among competitive student-athletes. Today, we serve approximately 532 competitive tennis players from across the US and around the world. This is by far and away the largest number of junior tennis players attending one single school. What we’re seeing isn’t simply a pandemic-driven spike – it’s a sustained shift driven by families seeking a model that allows their children to excel academically without compromising their training, competition schedules, mental health, or long-term development.”But what about socialization in an online school environment? Hansen replied that, “At ICL, socialization is not an afterthought; it’s a core component of our program design.” When pressed more about what this actually means Hansen said, “We heavily prioritize in-person interaction whenever possible. A perfect example of this was just this past week as we brought a number of our staff members to Florida to support our students and families at the Junior Orange Bowl. We do this a number of times throughout the year as we bring our students together across the United States as they participate in different tournaments and events.”Tristan Stratton, 16, is a preternaturally gifted tennis player who is one of the top ranked juniors in the United States. He is enrolled at ICL and so far it’s been a good fit, according to his mother Meg Stratton. “I didn’t make the decision to enroll my son at ICL lightly”, Ms Stratton told me. “Our intention was to keep him at an in-person high school. And I’m glad that Tristan spent two years at a regular high school. But the travel and logistics with him playing national and international tournaments made it untenable after a while. He is much more focused now that he’s in online school and it’s frankly simplified our frenetic lives.”This thought is echoed by another parent of an online-schooled child. Laura Lafors of Virginia enrolled her 17-year-old son Cole in the Laurel Spring online school. She stated that, “as [Cole’s] junior year approached it felt more like it was the right time to make the move. We were no longer worried about the loss of socialization since he had already experienced two years of high school. Prior to moving online Cole felt like it was impossible to miss school for tennis tournaments and he had very little time left in the day between school, tennis practice and homework. Cole wants to play college tennis so this move to have more time to train and the flexibility to travel for tournaments was very important.”Within the tennis community, the gold standard for online schooling is undoubtedly the Dwight Global Online school. An offshoot of the Dwight School, a private school in Manhattan, Dwight Global believes they have found the ideal combination of online and optional in-person activities. Since Dwight has their own physical school, it makes it the perfect option for those in the New York City area. That is, if one can afford it, as Dwight comes with more than double the annual price tag ($42,000) as ICL and other online schools.According to Blake Spahn, the vice chancellor of the Dwight Schools, “Since 2020, Dwight Global’s enrollment has more than doubled, representing sustained multi-year growth rather than a temporary pandemic spike.” Furthermore Spahn states that, “Dwight Global is the result of a 14-year head start, deep institutional learning, and continuous refinement – not a rapid pandemic-era pivot. We were building, iterating, and perfecting high-touch online education long before it became fashionable. This experience allows us to deliver a level of academic rigor, personalization, and student support that rivals – and in many cases exceeds – top bricks-and-mortar schools, while offering flexibility that traditional models simply cannot match.”Additionally, says Spahn, for those students who desire more in-person interactions, “We have brick and mortar schools around the world where our online students are able to convene in person for various activities. For example, we hold an annual orientation; Steam (Science, Engineering, Computer Science and Robotics) weekends that allow the students to do labs together; music concerts; Model UN and many more activities.” I asked Spahn how many of the online students engage with in-person events, and thought he didn’t have an exact figure he stated, “I can confidently say that many of the tennis players do some type of in-person activity whether it be orientation, after-school activities, simply using the library at one of our schools, and almost all of them attend graduation and prom in person.”While most kids and parents seem pleased with their decision to go online, I spoke with several parents, who preferred not to be named, that said their kids were miserable with the online setup. “Hitting tennis balls and staring at a screen all day for school was stunting his emotional and mental growth,” one New Jersey mother told me.Is there a type of child who thrives best in an online environment? From my perspective it seems that there are two groups of kids who are best fit for online schooling: those super high-performing, top ranked kids are the perfect candidates for remote since they are traveling so much; and then those kids who have had trouble adjusting socially in regular schools, be it because of bullying or other emotional concerns.Mary Beth Finegan, clinical director of New York Sports and Performance Psychology (NYSPP) at The Child & Family Institute, says that online learning can be beneficial to certain students. “Online learning for student-athletes has its benefits in terms of lessening any time management stress load with the flexibility that online classes provide. Elite-level athletes often require extensive in person competition schedules in locations across the US and beyond. Things to consider for student-athlete mental health are studies that show too early a specialization of one sport leads to burn out and how social support networks help in the prevention of burnout.” But when asked the either-or question about which is more optimal, Finegan said that “from my personal experience in-person fosters better social interactions for youth including how to read facial expressions and nonverbal communication in others.”In addition to the massive uptick in athletes choosing online schooling, in the last couple of decades there’s been a surge in the number of young athletes in the United States –often at the urging of overly involved parents - who now purposely “reclass” (staying back a grade or even two) in order to gain an advantage for college and, in many a delusional parent’s mind, for professional sports. In no sport is this practice of reclassing as rampant as tennis.And there is likely no other sport as torturous to watch a loved one compete in as tennis. The emotional and mental pressure the kids (and parents) feel far surpasses every other sport, in my view. Watching Little League and travel baseball games in years past was, for the most part, fun and joyful. Watching high-level junior tennis is stress-inducing agony where exhaustive relief is often the best outcome one can hope for. In fact, it should be mandatory that tournaments provide portable blood pressure devices to distribute to parents.So why then do we allow our kids to engage in such a tormenting endeavor? Because the cliches are undeniably true: the sport builds character and the journey through junior tennis prepares kids to deal with adversity and learn through failure. Lots and lots of failure. After all, we’ve been taught, that what doesn’t kill you …Since the chance of becoming a professional tennis player are infinitesimal and getting into a high-level Division I college for tennis is tremendously difficult, parents need to be brutally honest with themselves, if not completely so with their child. No one wants to stifle a dream to become a pro athlete or accomplished musician or dancer or any other endeavor one is passionate about, since they’re all worth pursuing with intensity. But what is the real goal for having one’s child in a remote-schooling environment? All things being equal, would any parent truly doubt that interacting with peers and exchanging in-person dialogue with teachers isn’t better?The impulse of every loving parent is to provide one’s child with the best opportunities to prepare he or she for life. Who wouldn’t want the best, at all times, for a child? But there’s a thin line between wanting what’s best for your kid v doing what is right for them, to make them stronger and more confident by giving them opportunities and advantages but at the same time showing them that life isn’t fair and that obstacles will always be present.What is doubtless is that online schooling is here to stay and will likely only grow. It’ll be interesting to see if this will cause brick-and-mortar schools to pivot and offer some sort of blended learning so they can keep up. In our increasingly fractured, siloed society, where life has become more about a la carte choices in how we receive and process information, and universal, shared experiences are rarer, online schooling is furthering that trend.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsUS educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bolstered by those big plays, the Falcons led 21-0 at halftime and 24-3 early in the second half.Matthew Stafford recovered from throwing three interceptions to help the Rams pull even at 24. Stafford’s11-yard touchdown passto Puka Nacua with 2:46 remaining tied the game.The Falcons (7-9) extended their winning streak to three games as Robinson also set the Falcons record for most scrimmage yards in a season.The Rams (11-5) lost their second straight. They began the week leading theNFLin scoring and yards and were shut out in the first half. After trailing 21-0 at halftime, the Rams were kept out of the end zone until Stafford’s 27-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Ferguson late in the third quarter.Los Angeles cut Atlanta’s lead to 24-17 when Emmanuel Forbes Jr blocked a 37-yard field goal attempt by Gonzalez and Jarred Verse returned the recovery 76 yards for a touchdown. It was the Rams’ first blocked kick returned for a touchdown since 1986.Stafford’s second interception, on a throw picked off by Atlanta rookie Xavier Watts, gave the Falcons the ball at their 7 in the second quarter. Robinson broke through the line and took off down the sideline, outrunning the Los Angeles defense for the NFL’s longest run of the season.Watts’ second interception, the third thrown by Stafford, stopped the Rams on a fourth-down play from the Atlanta 27 with 9:04 remaining.The Rams will open the playoffs on the road, an outcome that was set after NFC West rivals Seattle and San Francisco both won on Sunday. They entered the night as the No 5 seed from the NFC and their motivation against the Falcons was to protect that spot and the first-round matchup against a team from the NFC South, either Carolina or Tampa Bay.Stafford, who earned his third Pro Bowl honor this season, began the weekleading the NFLin touchdown passes and passing yards. He had thrown only five interceptions before his turnover-plagued effort against the Falcons.Stafford completed 22 of 38 passes for 269 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions. He has a career-best 42 touchdown passes this season.Robinson needed 151 rushing and receiving yards to break William Andrews’ team record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson added five catches for 34 yards, including a four-yard touchdown reception, to finish with 229 scrimmage yards in the game and 2,255 for the year.Explore more on these topicsNFLAtlanta FalconsLos Angeles RamsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Dennis Hamlin later died from his injuries at a hospital, officials said.Mary Lou Hamlin was taken to Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Burn Center in Winston-Salem, where she was being treated Monday, officials said.The fire caused the structure to collapse. The cause is under investigation.Stanley is located about 20 miles (32km) northwest of Charlotte.The home is owned by a company called Won One Real Estate that lists Denny Hamlin as its manager, according to local property tax records and a business document filing with the North Carolina Secretary of State’s Office.Representatives for Hamlin had not responded to requests for comment as of Monday evening.Hamlin is one of the marquee drivers in Nascar’s top circuit, having won 60 Nascar' Cup Series races, including the Daytona 500 three times.The 45-year-old driver for Joe Gibbs Racing has yet to win a Cup points championship. He fell short of the title during this season’s final race in Arizona last month.Weeks earlier, Hamlin said his father — who nearly went broke with financial sacrifices to try to get his son into Nascar – was battling a serious illness, and that he didn’t have much time left to live.“I know for a fact this is my last chance for my dad to see it. I don’t want him going and never getting to see the moment,” Hamlin told the Associated Press.Hamlin also mentioned his dad in emotional testimony this month at the start of afederal antitrust trial against Nascarbrought in part by 23XI Racing, which is owned by Hamlin and Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan. NASCAR, 23XI Racing and another race team reached a settlement during the trial before jurors ever deliberated.Explore more on these topicsNascarMotor sportUS sportsShareReuse this content"

As he turns 50, even golf’s most dominant figure confronts the one opponent he could never overpowerAssociated PressTue 30 Dec 2025 02.30 ESTShareTalk to any golfer who played againstTiger Woodsand there is sure to be at least one story about one shot so sublime they were certain it could not be hit by them or anyone else.He was just different. Better.The 2-iron Woods hit into the par-5 10th hole at the TPC Sugarloaf led Stewart Cink to say, “This is a skill set I don’t have.” Padraig Harrington once saw Woods hit an 8-iron so majestic at Firestone that it got in his head and led to the Irishman making triple bogey.Nick Price played the opening two rounds with Woods at St Andrews in the 2000 British Open and felt the tournament already was over. Mark O’Meara played a practice round with him at Pebble Beach before the 2000 US Open and told his wife before the championship started, “Tiger is going to win. And not only is he going to win, he’s going to blow away the field.” Woods won by 15.For all those years, so many greats in the game could never relate to Woods. And now, finally, they can.Not even Woods can beat time. He turns 50 on Tuesday.It’s a milestone for anyone, but it’s different in golf because the sport can be played well after the age when athletes have long retired in other sports. Phil Mickelson won a major at 50. Jack Nicklaus made an early Sunday charge at the Masters when he was 58.With Woods, it’s complicated.He now is eligible for the 50-and-older PGA Tour Champions. He also has had more surgeries than the 15 majors he won. This is the first year he didn’t play a single tournament, the result of a ruptured achilles tendon in March and a seventh back surgery in September.“I’m probably going to play 25 events on both tours and I think that should cover most of the year, right?” Woods quipped in the Bahamas when asked about turning 50.He won the US Open just eight days before reconstructive surgery on his left knee. He won the Masters two years after surgery to fuse his lower back. But he hasn’t been the same since that 2021 car crash in Los Angeles. Woods has played 11 times the last five seasons, finished only four of those tournaments and hasn’t been closer than 16 shots to the winner.“Come back to what point?” Woods said. “I’d like to come back to just playing golf again.”And so this celebration is more about looking back than forward.Ernie Els was most prescient in 2000 at Kapalua when he was on the losing end again – no one finished second to Woods more than the Big Easy. They matched eagles on the 18th in regulation, birdies on the 18th in a playoff and Woods got him with a 40-foot birdie putt on the second extra hole. Vintage Tiger.“I think he’s a legend in the making,” Els said that day. “He’s 24. He’s probably going to be bigger than Elvis when he gets into his 40s.”That’s up for debate, of course. Undeniable is the impact Woods has left on golf.View image in fullscreenAmateur golfer Tiger Woods tees off at the 11th hole during the pro-am for the Los Angeles Open golf tournament at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles on 26 February 1992.Photograph: Bob Galbraith/APPopularity soared and prize money skyrocketed. Woods made golf look different and he made it cool. And perhaps his greatest legacy is he unwittingly trained a generation of players who wanted to be like him. Scottie Scheffler said nothing inspired him more than watching the intensity of Woods when he was out of contention at the 2020 Masters. Woods made a 10 on the 12th hole and followed with five birdies over his last six holes. He tied for 38th.“Tiger was just different in the way he approached each shot. It was like the last shot he was ever going to hit,” Scheffler said. It was the only time they played together. Scheffler now is coming up on three years at No 1 in the world, the longest stretch since Woods.But it started with that skill set unlike any other.“He’s the only guy I’ve ever known who continually exceeded expectations,” Tom Lehman said. “No matter how much you heaped on him, he found a way to exceed them.”Lehman recalls one moment at the Memorial on the 17th hole, a green so rock-hard it felt impossible to get it close. Lehman hit 5-iron as high and far as he could and was pleased to see it roll out 25 feet from the cup.“He hits this shot way up in the air and it was coming down like a parachute,” Lehman said. “Lands by the cup and bounces 2 feet and stops. I figure he must have hit a 7-iron. I said, ‘Tiger, what club was that?’ He said, ‘That was a little, three-finger 5-iron.’ He just filleted it in there.“When I think of him, that’s what I think of. Only one guy could hit that shot. And he did it often.”Explore more on these topicsTiger WoodsGolfUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Still, theBournemouthwinger’s missiles were a devastating weapon against a slipshod Chelsea defence. They led to insultingly simple goals for David Brooks and Justin Kluivert during a breathless first half and were enough to plunge Enzo Maresca deeper into trouble after another damaging result for the Italian’s erratic side.There were jeers from the Stamford Bridge crowd when Maresca removed Cole Palmer withChelseachasing a winner during a one-sided second half. There was no chance of the dissenters giving a moment’s thought to the context around Palmer, whose load still needs careful management as he feels his way back from a groin injury. “You don’t know what you’re doing,” was the chant pouring down from the stands and, although Chelsea were the stronger side during the closing stages, there were more boos when this wild game drew to a close.Barry finishes the job for Everton after Garner returns to haunt ailing ForestRead morePositives were in short supply. Chelsea were appalling at the back, conceding six clearcut chances. They have let in four goals from throw-ins this season, leaving them with the worst record in the league, and again counted the cost of failing to press home an advantage. They have now dropped 15 points from winning positions. Bournemouth, winless in 10 games, made Chelsea pay for not pushing on after going 2-1 up through an Enzo Fernández goal in the 23rd minute.It was 2-2 four minutes later, Kluivert equalising when another Semenyo delivery caused havoc. Bournemouth, nine points above the bottom three, dug deep. They were indebted to a fine potential farewell from Semenyo, who looks set tocomplete a £65m move to Manchester City, and ensured that Andoni Iraola could talk up a resilient display.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer shakes hands with Enzo Maresca after being substituted but the manager was jeered for his decision.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“I am very proud,” Bournemouth’s manager said. “It is one point, but we did very good things. We would have taken one point before coming here but looking at how the game developed I am probably not satisfied.”Maresca, his mood hardly lifted by the defending that left his side with one win from their past seven league games, was not well enough to conduct his post-match press conference. “He had a temperature two days ago,” Willy Caballero, Chelsea’s assistant manager, said. “After the game he asked me to replace him [here].”Chelsea will feel even queasier when they remember what comes next: a trip to City without Moisés Caicedo, who will serve a one-game ban after his fifth booking of the season. No wonder the mood is darkening. December has been a bad month for Chelsea and it is hard to see them coping against City without the protection offered by Caicedo in midfield.Opponents are finding it too easy to create chances. Bournemouth had done their homework. Chelsea cowered under the aerial bombardment and were behind when a Semenyo delivery in the sixth minute bounced through to Brooks, who bundled the ball past Robert Sánchez from close range.View image in fullscreenEnzo Fernández shoots to put Chelsea ahead for a second time.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThere was no hiding Chelsea’s kryptonite. Semenyo was at it again in the 27th minute, this time hurling in a missile from the left, James Hill making a nuisance of himself at the near post. Chelsea, who had Malo Gusto filling in for the hamstrung Marc Cucurella at left-back, were all over the place. Trevoh Chalobah lost the initial challenge and Alejandro Garnacho was dozing at the far, allowing Kluivert to steal in for the equaliser.The defending was shambolic at both ends. It was 1-1 when Cole Palmer converted a contentious penalty, awarded after Sam Barrott was sent to the pitchside monitor and deemed Semenyo’s brief tangle of legs with Estêvão Willian enough for a foul, and the hosts led when Garnacho teed up Fernández to whip a wonderful effort beyond Djordje Petrovic.It was a baffling half. Bournemouth, who had hoped that bringing Hill in for Bafodé Diakité would restore order at the back, seemed to decide there was no point sitting back. They flew at Chelsea at every opportunity and saw Sánchez make fine saves from Evanilson and Brooks before half-time.Maresca, having seen enough, brought Reece James on for Josh Acheampong at right-back and punished Garnacho for his part in Kluivert’s goal by replacing him with Pedro Neto. Fourteen shots from Bournemouth, after all, was the most mustered in a first half at Stamford Bridge by any visiting side in thePremier Leaguesince records began in 2003.Bournemouth kept pushing. They appealed in vain for a penalty when Gusto handled a cross at the start of the second half. They almost nicked the points when Enes Unal headed over in added time.Chelsea were short of inspiration. Liam Delap was quiet after being handed a rare start up front. Estêvão was brighter, testing Petrovic from 20 yards, but Bournemouth held firm to leave Maresca on increasingly dodgy ground.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Forest have made strides under Dyche but after a miserable defeat by Everton, his previous club, it is now three straight losses and a bruising run of January fixtures await on the horizon.Happy new year? Five of their next six matches are away including a trip to West Ham, now only four points behind Forest in the table. For David Moyes and his threadbare squad, this was a triumph, goals by the former Forest loanee James Garner and Thierno Barry earning a deserved victory.Veltman earns Brighton draw at West Ham after Welbeck spot-kick dramaRead moreForest only had themselves to blame for a lethargic display against an Everton side that arrived without a victory or even a goal since the reverse fixture at Hill Dickinson Stadium almost four weeks ago. That dayEverton earned a 3-0 win, a Nikola Milenkovic own goal inside two minutes setting the tone, and here it did not take too much longer for them to seize the lead. After a forgettable opening, Everton produced the first moment of quality; Dwight McNeil, a January target for Dyche, slipping Garner in with a cute pass. Garner wriggled goalside of Morgan Gibbs-White and found the far corner to open the scoring against the club he spent 18 months on loan, clinching promotion via the Championship playoffs in 2022. Garner refused to celebrate.Jack Grealish, who missed last weekend’sstalemate at Burnleythrough illness, returned to action from the bench but Moyes said he would have preferred not to use the Manchester City loanee. Moyes named four academy players plus two goalkeepers as substitutes and, without 10 of his squad owing to injury and the Africa Cup of Nations, the Everton manager said he will likely recall the 18-year-old midfielder Harrison Armstrong from his loan spell at Preston. “It is one of the team’s best [away wins] because of what we had available to us,” Moyes said.Dyche changed things at the interval, introducing Douglas Luiz in place of Nicolás Domínguez and the substitute registered a fierce but hopeful strike from distance. Igor Jesus poked an effort wide after anEvertonclearance pinballed in the box but frustration reigned, with Everton happy to stifle Forest. Moyes covered his face after James Tarkowski failed to make the most of a rare opening. A few minutes later a Forest move typical of their performance; Neco Williams squared the ball towards the penalty spot but Taiwo Awoniyi was too laboured and Dilane Bakwa too slow, allowing Merlin Röhl, on his first start on loan from Freiburg, to intervene.View image in fullscreenEverton’s James Garner refuses to celebrate after opening the scoring against Forest, where he enjoyed a successful loan spell.Photograph: Nigel French/PAForest had 70% of possession and completed almost three times as many passes as their opponents but struggled to penetrate an organised Everton defence. Jake O’Brien and Tarkowski proved a meaner match for Igor Jesus than Rúben Dias and Josko Gvardiol. Oleksandr Zinchenko registered Forest’s first shot on target on 44 minutes, his whipped free-kick forcing Jordan Pickford into an awkward two-handed save but they never truly tested the England goalkeeper. “We had very dominant stats but stats don’t win games,” said Dyche, whose team were jeered off at full time. “I’ve just spoken to the players about it. But that expectation should be here.”Grealish would arrive from the bench but it was Garner, by some distance the best player on the pitch, who created Everton’s second on 79 minutes. Garner jinked clear of Murillo and promptly punished the Forest centre-back for charging out of position. Garner picked out Barry on the edge of the 18-yard box and the Frenchman trapped the ball with his first touch and then beat John Victor with his next.Forest supporters headed for the exits as Barry, aptly, in the city home to Robin Hood, pulled out a bow and arrow celebration. Everton fans, not in quite the same hurry to depart, were understandably determined to savour victory. “Rightly so,” Moyes said afterwards. “It was some result to come here with such a depleted side and get a win.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

All the glory was Newcastle’s, the points that took them up to 10th secured and the performance did not matter. Burnley deserved more but once again were left with nothing, except a feeling of resignation to their fate.Within seven minutes Joelinton and Yoane Wissa had given the visitors a two-goal lead, and ­Newcastle’s travelling woes looked a distant memory. Considering Burnley’s own recent form a comeback looked highly unlikely but Eddie Howe’s side are fragile, not knowing what to do with a lead nor how to control a game against a team who have ­collected two points from 10 games. Josh Laurent’s volley ignited hope, a flame that was finally extinguished by ­Guimarães in injury time.Krejci grabs point for Wolves as Manchester United continue to flounderRead more“A massive win for us, I don’t think it really matters tonight so much in terms of how we did it, we just needed to do it,” Howe said. “I can’t praise the players enough for how we battled through, it was never going to be easy and that second half was a massive 45 minutes for us, we needed to get over the line and full credit to the players for how they saw the game out.”Sixty-five seconds in and Turf Moor was deflated, Kyle Walker caught out of position and Anthony Gordon allowed to make up for his poor decision-making in theBoxing Day loss at Old Trafford. The winger had the time and space to find Joelinton, who produced a fine finish for his first Premier League goal in a year.Second-bottom Burnley needed to regroup but an inability to clear their lines allowed Wissa to double the lead. The situation was ominous for a side who had not won in two months and Newcastle were confident, getting five shots on target in the opening quarter of an hour.Howe’s side are, however, ­brittle away from home. They did not know how to control proceedings and invited pressure. Marcus Edwards was productive in a central role, ­running at the defence, who could only backtrack and hope for the best. The fact it took a volley from a centre-back to half the deficit did not matter but the failure to find an equaliser did highlight ­problems in front of goal.View image in fullscreenBruno Guimarães enjoys the moment with teammates after adding a third goal for Newcastle in the 93rd minute.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PANewcastle possessed the extra quality, and Wissa and Harvey Barnes had fine chances to extend the lead before the break but poor finishing and good ­goalkeeping frustrated them. nly Fabian Schär on the line prevented Edwards equalising. It was an entertaining game because neither side knew how to control it.It was imperative that Burnley began the second half with intent to test the Newcastle mindset but their bark is worse than their bite. Armando Broja winning a physical battle with Malick Thiaw and Loum Tchaouna testing Nick Pope were further indications that Burnley and their now vociferous fans were up for the fight.Burnley dominated the second half and Newcastle struggled to cope, needing to battle to hold on. Edwards drove past Lewis Hall into the box before firing at Pope but his leg was strong enough. The goalkeeper was almost embarrassed by a Lucas Pires cross and a Laurent header hit the bar but somehow Newcastle clung on until a defensive mix-up, ended the fight and gifted Guimarães the final sucker punch.“I’m trying to highlight the ­positives in a time of adversity and hardship,” Parker said. “We’re in a dogfight we’ll remain in for the majority of this season. You can see teams wither away or lack energy, commitment or desire but there’s something in this group that is elite.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBurnleyNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As only the second ever Premier League game to see three first-half penalties awarded, there was drama aplenty for anyone without a vested interest.Guimarães shuts down Burnley’s late fightback to end Newcastle’s poor away runRead moreBut this draw – with twice as many goals as theone at the Amex Stadiumearly this month – does little to help either side. While Brighton are becoming increasingly well acquainted with the bottom half of the table, West Ham fans fear relegation more with each passing week.Nuno Espírito Santo’s side have now gone eight Premier League games since their last victory and they were clinging on to a point after twice seeing their lead disappear when Danny Welbeck and Joël Veltman cancelled out goals from Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paquetá.With Nottingham Forest losing, it felt like a chance missed to move within two points of the last safe spot.“We need fight,” said Bowen, the captain. “We need a bit of emotion with the situation we are in. It is the first time that I’ve properly seen it.”The performance only hammered home Nuno’s assertion that the upcoming transfer window would be very important for the club’s future. Two more goals conceded means only Wolves have a worse defensive record in the top flight this season, and the centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo hobbled off injured.At the other end of the pitch, Nuno’s weekly striker roulette meant a first start for Callum Wilson in five games. His decision then to take the former Newcastle man off with half an hour remaining prompted boos around the London Stadium, but options are scarce.He might soon have the services of Jørgen Strand Larsen to call upon, with West Ham preparing their opening offer for the Wolves striker. Whether that extends to his £40m asking price remains to be seen.The disparity in resources between the teams was evident in the respective strength they were able to call upon from the bench. While Brighton brought on Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, Nuno had to make do with the inexperienced duo of Ezra Mayers and Mohamadou Kanté.View image in fullscreenJarrod Bowen slots home West Ham’s opener in the 10th minute.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters“That’s the reality,” said the West Ham manager. He will be desperate for reinforcements next month.Slow starts on their travels have dogged Brighton all season, and Bowen put West Ham ahead after 10 minutes when slotting calmly past Bart Verbruggen.Then came the flurry of penalties, starting with a quickfire double for Welbeck. He dispatched the first, awarded for a poor Maximilian Kilman slide tackle on Yankuba Minteh, into the bottom corner. Perhaps overeager to change approach after Paquetá had comically rugby-tackled Lewis Dunk for the second, Welbeck followed up with a Panenka that hit the bar.As the clock ticked into first-half added time, Michael Salisbury was then called to the pitchside monitor to review Dunk halting Wilson’s goalbound shot with what he judged to be the upper part of an outstretched arm. Paquetá stroked the resulting penalty into the bottom corner.“No one can say that’s a clear hand,” bemoaned Fabian Hürzeler. “The VAR footage is not clear enough, therefore it’s just a guess. We are the best league in the world so to make a decision just on a guess is not right.”Brighton restored parity just after the hour when Alphonse Areola slapped a corner straight to Veltman, who controlled and volleyed home from close range.The visitors pushed hard in the final stages for the three points, with Areola producing fine saves to keep out dangerous efforts from Mitoma and Rutter, and Konstantinos Mavropanos heading away from under his own bar.By the final whistle, Jan Paul van Hecke was the only starting Brighton outfielder not to have attempted a shot. But the visitors could not find a winner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Samuel Uwikunda, the Rwandan referee, took several minutes and watched multiple replays on the sideline screen before making the decision to dismiss the Senegal captain.Even with the numerical disadvantage, however, Senegal were stronger and 17-year-old substitute Ibrahima Mbaye forced a penalty as he broke away, only to be clipped by Rachid Moumouni.

To continue to win you have to win in different contexts. Today maybe the margin wasn’t that big, but we made it big because we were so efficient and ruthless in front of goal.“We smelt blood, but had to really grab it. The way we started the second half was amazing, we really turned things up and were efficient in everything that we did.“We have created a lot of chances in the last few weeks, but we saw the difference today. We needed scrappy goals to win other games but today the quality of our finishing was top and made the difference.”Unai Emery refused to criticise his players after Villa failed to record a club record 12th successive win, and highlighted the half-time loss of Amadou Onana to a hamstring injury as the turning point following a promising opening 45 minutes.“We did a very good first half, but the first goal changed everything and after it they pushed it,” he said. “And we had as well the injury of Amadou Onana and we lost everything in the middle. They had the power and they showed it, so we finished losing.”Emery failed to shake Arteta’s hand following the final whistle as he was quick to disappear down the tunnel while Arsenal were celebrating a significant victory, and joked that it was “too cold” for him to wait any longer for his fellow Basque.Arteta had no complaints, however, and is more concerned with assessing Rice’s knee problem before Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth. “The swelling has to come right down for him to have the chance to function,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArsenalAston VillanewsShareReuse this content"

May God give them a good bed in heaven.”Anthony Joshua’s camp confirm two of his close friends died in Nigeria car crashRead moreUsyk, the WBA, WBC and IBF heavyweight champion, spoke of “an unbelievable loss” on social media, describing Ghami and Ayodele as “two incredible people who were not only a part of AJ’s team, but also friends!” Usyk passed his “sincere condolences to their families, loved ones and everyone who knew them” and wrote to Joshua: “Stay strong, champion.”Joshua, born in Watford to Nigerian parents, had worked with Ayodele and Ghami since the beginning of his career. The crash took place on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway near Makun on Monday morning and, just hours before, Joshua and Ayodele posted footage on Instagram of them playing table tennis together.Jake Paul, wholost to Joshua in a fightwatched by 33 million people two weeks ago, also offered his condolences. “Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ, and anyone impacted by today’s unfortunate accident,” he wrote.Joshua is being treated at the Duchess international hospital in Lagos, where the president of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said he had visited the fighter and his mother, who has been at his bedside. “I have spoken with AJ to personally convey my condolences over the passing of his two close associates, Kevin Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami, in the recent accident,” Tinubu said in a statement. “I wished him a full and speedy recovery, and prayed with him. AJ assured me he is receiving the best possible care. I also spoke with his mother and prayed for her.”According to the government of Ogun state, where the crash took place, Joshua did not need any emergency medical intervention at the scene, despite unverified footage seeming to show him grimacing in pain as he was removed from what appeared to be the wreckage. Ogun officials did say, however, that Joshua had “narrowly escaped death”.The federal road safety corps (FRSC) in Nigeria posted several pictures of the crash scene on X on Monday, revealing preliminary findings that suggested the Lexus “was suspected to be travelling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit”. The FRSC added the car lost control during “an overtaking manoeuvre” and crashed into a stationary truck by the side of the road.Police commander Babatunde Akinbiyi of Nigeria’s traffic compliance and enforcement agency said early investigations showed the Lexus had been travelling along the highway from Lagos to Sagamu when it “experienced a tyre burst due to excessive speed” and lost control.Explore more on these topicsAnthony JoshuaBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

I cannot see what is to be gained by gambling.”26 Feb:Gambles.And Reading chairRob Couhig,6 Oct, defendingmanager Noel Huntagainst fans’ impatience. “I’ve never considered firing Noel. I don’t believe firing a manager suddenly turns a guy into a better striker or a better defender. I don’t think firing a manager changes anything as long as the players still support him.

The posts were still on Facebook on 16 December, two days after the attack, and received shares and likes.Some accounts are Britain-based and those have been reported tocounter-terrorism police in the UKas a matter of urgency.One post shows video of the aftermath of the Bondi beach attack, which was allegedly carried out by a father and son who were IS supporters, and says: “Allah is the greatest and praise to Allah.” It has clearly been viewed, with more than 100 likes, 27 comments and four shares recorded.Fifteen people were killed as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Hanukah in Sydney on 14 December. One of the attackers also died.Another post shows a photo of one of the Bondi beach gunmen and says: “The coming years of art and hell,” and contains praise for an IS leader. This had 12 shares and more than 300 likes.Facebook said it was in the process of removing some of the posts after being contacted by the Guardian, and said some had already been spotted and removed.Dave Rich, the director of policy for the CST, which works to keep Jewish people safe from attack, said: “The sheer volume of IS-supporting accounts promoting terrorist content on Facebook is deeply alarming, and the posts celebrating the Bondi terrorist attack are utterly nauseating.“Yet again, social media companies are incapable of meeting even their most basic of responsibilities and are putting all of us in danger as a result. This simply should not be happening any more. We will be calling on Ofcom to urgently investigate Meta’s failings and to take strong action where possible.”Ofcom, the media regulator, said: “If a post is reported to a platform now, the platform must decide whether the content is illegal under UK law, and take it down swiftly if it is. Our job is to make sure sites and apps have appropriate measures in place to comply with their duties.”It said it had received “evidence that suggests terrorist content and illegal hate speech is persisting on some of the largest social media sites”.A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, declined to answer a series of questions but said: “The content was removed for violating our policies around dangerous organisations and individuals.”A Home Office spokesperson said:“Social media content promoting terrorism or violence against communities is absolutely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. The law is clear: social media platforms must take action to prevent illegal content on their sites, including terrorist and violent material.”The focus on pro-IS material on popular social media sites comes amid concern about an increase in terrorist efforts to target Jewish people across the west.Two men wereconvicted on 22 Decemberof a plot to get machine guns and shoot Jewish people around the north-west of England. In that plot and the Sydney massacre, both sets of terrorists’ approaches had a degree of sophistication.Though neither was “directed” by IS, the Sydney attackersvisited the Philippinesand the north-west England machine-gun plotters had contact with an IS person overseas and were sophisticated enough to try to bypass Jewish community security and infiltrate a Facebook group, giving them details of potential Jewish targets.Rich said of the English plot: “This is an even more serious plot than the attack on thesynagogue in Heaton Parkand indicates a much greater level of training and sophistication.”Vicki Evans, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian: “The terrorist threats we face do not stand still and we rarely confine them to history. Instead, they flex in intensity and risk over time – and so does our response.“Recent attacks in Manchester and Australia are clear reminders of the range of threats we face, and we continue to ask the public to …report any concernsthey see in their real-world or online communities.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Since then, the Guardian has published anaward-winningseries of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand the Hebrew-language outletLocal Call– that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.One investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them onMicrosoft’s cloud services– setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company tocut offIsrael’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created aChatGPT-like toolto analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed toextraordinary termsto clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.I asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.How did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?Yuval Abraham:The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.Harry Davies:There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.What has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?Yuval Abraham:As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.If you remember the[Edward]Snowdenrevelations, many of them had to do withmetadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.So data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.Quick GuideContact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.Some of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.We know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as yourevealed, Yuval, and has alsopurchasedAI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?Yuval Abraham:What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] calledLavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.These AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.AI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.Harry Davies:Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.Microsoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?Harry Davies:I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have beenprotest groupswhich have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.Yuval Abraham:And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.It sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.Yuval Abraham:Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for itsNimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.These are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.Microsoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.What’s your focus going to be in 2026?Yuval Abraham:I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.Harry Davies:We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.There’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.And there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?Yuval Abraham:Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.Harry Davies:Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people.

Contrary to Musk’s promises, Doge’s success is vague and tough to quantify. Measuring the full impact and determiningwhether the agency even existsas a centralized entity anymore is difficult, complicated by an ongoing effort from the government to block disclosure of documents, which is itself a symptom of the chaos that the department created.Although the disarray and destruction left by Doge is evident across the globe, we still do not really know exactly how the agency operated and its true effects. Instead, humanitarian aid organizations are still trying to assess the extent of the damage that Doge created whileethics watchdogshave launched lawsuits trying to compel more transparency out of the government.“I know it feels like all this happened over the course of several years, but the first year of this administration isn’t even done,” said Nikhel Sus, the deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew). “We still want to know what happened, and we still want the record to be out there, because the public is entitled to this information.”Move fast and destroy things: 100 chaotic days of Elon Musk in the White HouseRead moreOutside of the US, Doge’scuts to USAIDhave also caused months of turmoil in countries around the world as humanitarian organizations struggle to make up for lost funding and calculate whether they can continue their operations at all. Thousands of aid workers havelost their jobs, testing for diseases such asHIV/Aidshas drastically declined and researchers have warned there could bearound 14 million excess deathsacross the globe in the next five years if the US fails to restore aid funding. Yet because of the nature of Doge’s cuts, non-profits including the International Aids Society (IAS) say that it’s hard to pin down the exact numbers of people who are affected.“The cuts also damaged monitoring and communications infrastructure, which means it is quite difficult to obtain full data,” IAS president Beatriz Grinsztejn said.All of the costs and chaos of Doge have also come while ethics groups andgovernment workers saythe central premise of the agency – making the government more efficient – hasn’t been delivered on. Musk’sclaims of findinglarge-scalevoter fraudhave likewise borne no fruit, finding neither backing in concrete evidence nor law enforcement action. Instead, some former federal workers have described officialstearing down functional partsof the government and building ineffective replacements – if they replace them at all.The mystery of how much Doge ‘saved’Doge, christened after acryptocurrencythat was itself named for a doe-eyed shiba inu, emerged out of Musk’sbackingofDonald Trumpduring the 2024 presidential election and months of suggestions on the campaign trail that the billionaire could root out “waste, fraud and abuse” within the government. In its formative days, Musk made extravagant predictions about the amount of money that Doge would save.“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk said during a Trump rally in October of last year. He later revised that following inauguration, still claiming that Doge would save $1tn worth of “waste” from the budget by the end of September of this year.Doge vowed to keep track of its contract cuts throughout its existence via an online tracking site, but even by Doge’s own count it is falling far short. The cost-cutting tracker, which has also been shown to contain egregious errors that make thefigures overblown and unreliable, projects that the effort has cut $214bn in spending. The site’s “wall of receipts” of canceled contracts states that it has cut $61bn. Although Doge promised to eventually update the site in real time, the page states it has not been updated since 4 October.The true dollar amount of how much Doge has cut and how much the agency has cost taxpayers isfar harder to pin downdue to the convoluted nature of government contracts, Doge’s poor accounting methods and court challenges to layoffs, some of which have resulted in reinstatements. Organizations across the political spectrum that have attempted to track Doge’s cuts agree, however, that Doge’s numbers do not give an accurate representation of how the agency operated.The sudden halting of US foreign aid had a ripple effectBeatriz Grinsztejn, president of International Aids SocietyDoge’s calculations also ignore the more difficult-to-measure long-term equations of cuts, such as demolishing a department thatcoordinates policy on homelessnessor effectivelyshutting downthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may result in greater costs down the road once those services are no longer available. A report in August from Democrats on the permanent subcommittee on investigations in Augustfound that Dogemay have caused around $21.7bn in waste through actions such as paying federal employees not to work due to deferred resignation. TheTrump administration’s top human resource officialannouncedin August that there would be around300,000 fewergovernment employees at the year’s end, largely due to Doge efforts, cut from a workforce of roughly 2.25 million civilians.“DOGE did not reduce spending, but it did reduce federal employment by nine percent in less than 10 months,” arecent analysisfrom the libertarian Cato Institute thinktank concluded. “A decline that large has not happened since the military demobilizations at the end of World War II and the Korean War.”Beyond mass firing personnel, one of the areas where Doge has had the most pervasive effects is foreign aid. Its shuttering of USAID, which Muskbraggedabout feeding “into the wood chipper”, disrupted global operations involving food aid and the treatment of a wide range of diseases. The cuts deeply affected testing andpreventative carefor HIV/Aids, which has left aid organizations scrambling to repair the damage.The chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in WashingtonRead more“The sudden halting of US foreign aid had a ripple effect,” Grinsztejn said. “It pulled a plug on our extensive network of partners, who immediately reported staff losses, suspended outreach and interruptions in HIV testing.”Aid agencies such as IAS already have snapshots of how funding cuts and freezes in Washington have specific, real-world effects. In Mozambique, anti-retroviral treatments for HIV dropped by a quarter, and in Johannesburg, South Africa, those treatments dropped by a third, according to IAS. About 156,000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean have lost access to HIV testing and treatments entirely.Cuts tofood aidhave meanwhile resulted inchildren starving to deathand programs being halted, although the full global effects are similarly hard to put an exact number on. One measure, from astudypublished by the Gates Foundation this month, showed that overall cuts in humanitarian aid would mean that 2025 was the first year in decades where the death rate of children under five years old would rise globally.“The world’s richest man has been involved in the deaths of the world’s poorest children,” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates toldthe New York Timesin May.The winding legal cases against DogeAs soon as Trump issued an executive order in January creating Doge, multiple non-profits and ethics watchdogsfiled lawsuitsagainst the government demanding that the agency disclose its power structure and comply with transparency laws. The number of cases against Doge multiplied in the following months as reports emerged that shadowy staffers wereaccessingsensitivegovernmentdatabasesandspearheadingmass layoffsof federal employees.Several of these cases have been resolved over the past months, including the supreme courtgranting some Doge staffersaccess to social security databases and afederal judge rulingthat the mass firing of probationary employees was against the law. Most of the thornier cases around what powers Doge wields and whether it must disclose its internal documents are still tied up in litigation and appeals, however, which government ethics groups say has meant that much about Doge has remained a black box.How Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA companyRead more“There are still very basic questions about Doge’s operational structure and activities that have not been answered because the entity has evaded transparency laws and evaded discovery requests,” Crew’s Sus said.Almost 11 months after filing its suit and winning two lower court victories, Crew’s case is still working its way through the court systems as the government has filed numerous appeals and a petition for rehearing. There’s no definitive timeline in sight for when it might compel more transparency out of Doge.Crew’s case is just one of many lawsuits involving Doge that are still pending a final decision and have no definitive end date in sight. Yet ethics watchdogs emphasize that these cases are important for getting a legal definition of what Doge is and what it is allowed to do. Otherwise, they say the risk is that the White House could re-empower Doge to carry out another rapid, opaque gutting of the government in the future.“Let’s say Doge’s influence wanes for some temporary period. They could immediately come back in a very strong and decisive way in which they’re operating similar to how they did at the outset of the administration,” Sus said. “They would have the apparatus to do that.”Does Doge still exist?In late March, Musk and seven other top Doge staffers sat down for a Fox News interview with host Brett Baier to defend their agency as backlash swelled. Almost all of those men – who included Musk’s deputy Steve Davis, longtime friend and Tesla board member Antonio Gracias and cloud-computing CEO Tom Krause – are no longer with Doge. Others, such as Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, have stayed on in a diminished capacity.There are still very basic questions about Doge’s operational structure and activities that have not been answeredNikhel Sus, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in WashingtonMany of Doge’s roles were intended to be temporary to begin with, allowing staffers to serve asspecial government employeeson short-term contracts. Yet some of the staffers’ exits embodied the messy, dramatic nature of their agency. Musk notoriouslyleftthe White House in May after feuding with other officials and engaging in a public spat with Trump, in which he accused the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Davis officially left the following month but continued to hold meetings and send deputies to assess staffers’ loyalty,according to Politico, leading to confusion and concern among those employees about potential legal issues around following his dictates.Davis returned to Musk’s empire after his government exit, appearing on a livestream last month in his role as CEO of the Boring Company to talk about tunneling under Tennessee. Anthony Armstrong, another Musk lieutenant, wasnamed chief financial officer of Musk’s xAIartificial intelligence company. Gebbia, one of the top Doge executives who remained in government, is nowin charge of redesigningfederal websites.Much of the early coverage of Doge’s staff also focused on the young engineers that Musk brought in to access data systems and work long hours at various agencies. Several of those employees – such asEd Coristine, who became well-known after his online pseudonym “Big Balls” became public – have beenmoved tofull-time government positions. Coristine now works at Gebbia’s National Design Studio,according to Wired. Trumpalso usedCoristine’s assault during an apparent carjacking outside of a DC nightclub as a prelude to sending the national guard to the city.Musk calls Doge only ‘somewhat successful’ and says he would not do it againRead moreOther staffers who came from Musk’s enterprises have gone back to their corporate roles. Erica Jehling, seconded to the Environmental Protection Agency as a member of Doge, now appears to be back working at SpaceX as a purchasing director, according to a LinkedIn profile matching her name and employment history. Gracias, Musk’s close friend and a billionaire venture capitalist, left Doge after gainingoperational control of an MDMA-therapy companyand amid backlash from the AFL-CIO over him working for Doge while his private equity firm managed retirement plans for public employees.The spectre of Doge still looms over federal workers, even if the days of engineers placingguards outside of conference roomsand setting up bunk beds in offices are no more. Inside many agencies, the ethos of canceling contracts and trying to run operations like a tech startup remains. Tools that Doge helped develop for processing information, often using AI and replacing human oversight, have also been put into use at agencies such as theGeneral Services Administrationand theDepartment of Veterans Affairs– where ProPublica reported a Doge staffer put together an error-prone AI tool for “munching” government contracts.When Musk’s former Doge aide Katie Miller asked the Tesla CEO this month how he assessed Doge’s accomplishments, Musk gave a toned-down response compared with his usual declarations of total victory and unlimited growth.“We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful,” Musk told Miller on her podcast, adding that it was his “best side quest”. When Miller asked whether he would go back and do it all over again, Musk was even less confident.“I mean, no, I don’t think so,” Musk said. “Would I do it? I mean, I probably … I don’t know.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.With such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto onThe Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe.

Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.Is it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thrillerM3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.If Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr inThe Naked Gunreboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.View image in fullscreenTruly psychotic … Danny Huston in The Naked Gun.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/APIn the goopy, grungy world ofThe Toxic Avengerreboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such asBryan Johnson.In 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulishMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby inTron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully fromthe original 1982 Tron– seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes.

But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible.

We had no plans, so we met at a local cinema and then wandered the long street between our houses, pausing for a drink or two in various bars and chatting to strangers doing the same. We stopped when we became hungry and shared a plate of curries and drank beer in the window of an Indian restaurant, watching the parade of partygoers outside. Then we walked to the top of the hill to watch the fireworks lighting up the sky.It was after midnight as we strolled back but we weren’t quite ready to call it a night, and we found ourselves in a games arcade where a bunch of women were cramming into a photo booth to take a strip of black-and-white photos together. Their enthusiasm was infectious and so we waited until they were finished and did the same. I now have the strip of photos stuck on my fridge, secured under a magnet for a local plumber. In them, we are both grinning wildly at the camera, our faces squashed close, the years of friendship evident in our expressions.Bow-tied snooker players and hushed commentary: the joys of Pot Black | Nova WeetmanRead moreWhen I was cleaning up my parents’ house after my dad died, I found boxes of photographs that I’d left behind when I moved out. They chronicled my teens and 20s and showed faces that I’d long forgotten. Among them was a single rectangle black-and-white frame that looked to be cut from a much-longer strip of photos. I like to imagine that, after crowding into the photo booth and posing for the shots, the three of us couldn’t afford more strips, so we cut this one up and took a panel each. In the shot, I have long hair pulled tight into a ponytail but my smile is much the same as it is now.I don’t remember when we posed for the photo but it would probably have been on a rare night out in the city as we trekked in on the train from the outer eastern suburbs and spilled out to all the promise of the grown-up world.I stuck this single frame next to the New Year’s Eve photos on my fridge. Two nights out, nearly 40 years apart. And a record of who I was as a young friend and of who I am now. Looking at the photos, I decided that I needed more to fill my fridge and so these became the beginning of something bigger. Now, whenever I’m out late with friends and we pass a photo booth, I drag them in so that I can add to the mini gallery of faces I love looking at each day.There is something about the strip photos that preserves friendship for me in a way that a single photograph does not. Perhaps it is because the photographs exist as a series of changing poses that suggests evolution or complexity to a friendship, where a single image captures an isolated pose. Or perhaps it is due to being squashed together and staring up at the lens, waiting for the flash that never seems to go off when you imagine it will, and finally when it does come you’ve already given up posing so the images are more candid than any you prepare for.My dad died suddenly while I was in Japan. A memory of him lives on in my fridge | Nova WeetmanRead moreDespite most of us carrying mobile phones equipped with technology that takes far better photographs than a booth does, crowding into a machine with friends to take strip photos is still a thing. I wonder if it is because there is something magical about having to wait by the booth for the strip to finish printing and pop out into the tray before we then crowd around to check if our hair looks OK or if our smile is straight. The rarity of waiting for the photos to print seems to increase the joy.I have thousands of photographs on my phone snapped without much consideration for form or composition and I rarely look at them. But a strip photo is proof of something, it’s tangible and real. And importantly, these tiny squares don’t tell the whole picture of whatever is happening because there is no background. They aren’t an attempt at capturing an event like other photos are. These are something simpler, a reminder of a mood, a feeling, a connection between us and the people we care about. And they are a record of a moment in time that we can stick on our fridge.Nova Weetman is an award-winning author of books for children and young adults, including The Edge of Thirteen, winner of the Abia award 2022Explore more on these topicsPhotographyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Today, how US foreign policy has dramatically – and alarmingly – turned towards Latin America and the CaribbeanTue 30 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 13.57 ESTShareDonald Trump is not generally noted as a student of history. Yet over the past year, his decisive reorientation ofUS foreign policytowards the Americas has revived a playbook dating back two centuries, to the fifth president, James Monroe. Now the 47th is doubling down. An anti-interventionist is having second thoughts. Remarks that sounded at first like bad jokes or random outbursts from the presidential id have become more sinister through repetition or accompanying actions. Only a fool would take all of Mr Trump’s comments literally – but they should certainly be taken seriously.He has refused to rule out using military forceto take control of Greenlandand repeatedly floated the idea of making Canada the 51st state. He threatened to seize the Panama canal. He has imposed swingeing tariffs on key partners, and says he mightabandon the Canada-Mexico tradepact signed in his first term. He has meddled outrageously in elections in Honduras and Argentina, and sought to interfere with Brazilian justice. Heimposed sanctions on Colombia’s presidentin October. He has launched deadly attacks on alleged drug boats in international waters – extrajudicial killings that the administration hassought to legitimiseby arbitrarily designating traffickers as terrorists – and threatenedmilitary strikeson Mexico, Venezuela and any other country he blames for drugs consumed in the US.Gunboat diplomacy is back. The US has positioned an extraordinarydisplay of military mightoff the coast of Venezuela – its largest presence in the Caribbean for decades – and is seizing oil tankers. Mr Trump reportedly gave Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro,an ultimatum to quitwhen they spoke recently, and has puta $50m bountyon his head. Mr Trump is unconcerned by the regime’s repression. Purportedly this is about tackling drugs – but Venezuela is not a producer or major conduit for narcotics, and Mr Trump hasjust pardoned the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernándezfor major drug-related offences.History repeatingThe US seems convinced that it can strongarm the leftist Mr Maduro into fleeing, or persuade other members of his regime to oust him. The question is what happens if its confidence is misplaced – as it was in Mr Trump’s first term, when recognising the then opposition leader Juan Guaidó as president failed to dislodge Mr Maduro. The CIA has reportedly used drones tostrike a Venezuelan port facility. How much further will the US go?In 1823, President Monroe warned European powers not to interfere in the western hemisphere. In 2025, Mr Trump’s actions reflect concern about China’s growing role. “The United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe doctrine to restore American preeminence,” statesthe new national security strategy.What it calls the “Trump Corollary” is a nod to the “Roosevelt Corollary”. The 26th US president turned Monroe’s defensive, exclusionary stanceinto “big stick” hegemony. The pledge of a “potent restoration of American power and priorities” will depend on “enlisting” allies and pressuring others, and on an “adjusted” military presence. The“Donroe doctrine”is also spurred by promises to prevent mass migration, a fixation on drug trafficking, hopes of trade advantage and a hunger for minerals, plus a craving for headline-grabbing, ego-bolstering symbols of domination.Mr Trump appears unperturbed by stronger Chinese and Russian spheres of influence – as long as he has a domain to match Xi Jinping’s and Vladimir Putin’s. The new US “doctrine” is in reality subject to his whims,grudgesand personal relations with leaders, and inconsistencies within his court. There are clear divisions in his foreign policy team,notably on Venezuela. Richard Grenell, the mercantilist presidential envoy for special missions, has promoted talks with Mr Maduro. Marco Rubio, secretary of state, remains unabashedly hawkish – and, with the Middle East and Ukraine largely out of his hands, has plenty of time to devote to Latin America.Pushing back BeijingThe speed with which China was able to build ties with Latin America and the Caribbean partly reflected arelative lack of US interest in the region. China is now the largest trading partner, but the US is the largest foreign investor. The White House may well believe that it can easily regain ground – and that it is already notching up successes. Javier Milei’s far-right partywon midterm elections in Argentina, to widespread surprise, after Mr Trump proffered the country a $40bn bailout – as long as his man won. The president’s disdain for human rights makes El Salvador’sself-styled “coolest dictator”Nayib Bukele not a concern but an asset, takingVenezuelan deportees from the US.It’s not only about ideological bedfellows:Mexico seems to be shifting towards the USunder pressure, and a series of new security dealswill see American troops deployed across the region. Yet elsewhere, fear of an unpredictable, bullying administration may warm relations with Beijing. Mr Trump’s tactics often backfire.Sanctions and tariffswere meant to kill Brazil’s case against Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup after losing the 2022 election – but the former president gota 27-year sentence. The popularity of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva rose. The US has since eliminatedkey food tariffstoo.An attack on Venezuela would fuel a backlash in the region – and, experts predict, arefugee surgeto the US. Mr Trump’s vociferous complaints about China “controlling” the Panama canal spurred the private Hong Kong-based company CK Hutchison, which owned two ports in Panama, to announce that it would sell all its port holdings to a grouping led by the US investment firm BlackRock. But Beijing blocked the deal – then said the price for approval would be adding the Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco to the consortium. Cosco would be excluded from Panamanian locations, butcould reportedly gaina stake in dozens of ports worldwide.Few in the region would choose to rely on either hegemon, and anxiety in Latin America at increased US forcefulness is matched by concern from allies in Asia and Europe at both US bullying and US withdrawal. Canada isinterested in bolstering transatlantic relations. The European Union and Latin America would benefit from better ties too, but thelong-awaited trade deal between Brussels and the Mercosur bloc, due to be signed this month, hasstalled again. Europe should make it a priority.Sharp political divides within Latin America, as well as diverging interests between continents, will place limits on cooperation. But Mr Trump’s reckless and regressive behaviour is spurring changes that the US too may live to regret.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Seeing Netanyahu beg Donald Trump to be bailed out from a quagmire, a rising number of Americans openly acknowledge that Israel is not an ally but a liability. In September, the US’s Arab allies also reached the conclusion that we Iranians have always underscored: Israel’s recklessness is a threat to all.This reality is paving the way for whole new relationships that may transform our region. The US administration now faces a dilemma: it can continue writing blank cheques for Israel with American taxpayer dollars and credibility, or be part of a tectonic change for the better. For decades, western policy towards our region has been mostly shaped by myths originating from Israel. Thewar in Junewas momentous for a number of reasons, including how it exposed the cost for the west of mistaking mythology for strategy. Israel and its proxies claim a “decisive victory”, with Iran left weakened and deterred. Yet our vast strategic depth – the country covers an area the size of western Europe, and has a population 10 times that of Israel’s – meant that most of our provinces were untouched by Israel’s aggression. In contrast, all Israelis experienced the might of our military. The narrative of invulnerability – central to Israel’s myth-making machine – has been shattered.The manufactured crisis overIran’s nuclear programmeexemplifies how fiction authored in Tel Aviv and peddled by Israel’s proxies has fuelled unnecessary confrontation. For decades, we Iranians have emphasised that we do not seek nuclear weapons. This is not a tactical claim but a strategic doctrine grounded in religious, ethical and security considerations. Yet during President Trump’s first term, the US administration was misled into believing that Iran was nearing collapse, that the2015 nuclear dealwas a lifeline for us, and that abandoning the accord would compel us to quickly concede. Those myths encouraged Washington to abandon a functional diplomatic framework in favour of “maximum pressure” that only produced “maximum resistance”.A growing number of Americans – particularly those who want a focus on rebuilding the US – are publicly acknowledging what has been taboo: that uncritical acceptance of Israel’s narratives has drained American resources, undermined American credibility, and entangled the US in conflicts that do not serve American interests. Over the past two years, the regime in Tel Aviv has killed tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians in Gazaand attackedLebanon, Syria, Iran, Yemen and even Qatar. Nearly every other state in the region has been threatened. No responsible individual calls this aggression “self-defence”.There is another silver lining to recent events: the new impetus in our region to contain a shared Israeli threat. This has put a final nail in the coffin ofthe so-called Abraham accordsand opened the door for novel cooperation.Europe has lost all credibility in the Middle East. The way to regain it lies in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon | Nathalie TocciRead moreI have been made aware that there is an unprecedented willingness among mutual friends of Iran and the US to facilitate dialogue and underwrite the full and verifiable implementation of any negotiated outcome. It sounds promising. Despite Israel’s attack on diplomacy amid Iran-US nuclear negotiations, Iran remains open to an agreement that is built on mutual respect and mutual interest.That objective hinges on the US accepting that a negotiation is different from dictating the terms of a capitulation. Our people are well aware that President Trump is not the first US president to attack them, and have witnessed disastrous experiences of engaging with the US. If President Trump wants to win their trust, and stand by his pledges to his own supporters at home, he should do what none of his predecessors have achieved: finally end an unnecessary crisis by pursuing peace through diplomacy. The first step is to address the Iranian nation with a language of respect, without ifs and buts.Iranhas never desired a war with the US: our generals’ restraint in June – the only reason US military installations in our region are still intact – proves this point. That restraint should not be mistaken for weakness or assumed to be endless.The world should also know that Iranians will never abandon their rights. Enjoyed by all signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, those rights include access to all aspects of peaceful nuclear technology. We Iranians do not fear serious negotiations to achieve a fair deal. Such a deal must feature tangible and verifiable sanctions lifting. The shifts in our region can enable implementation of understandings in a whole new way.For those willing to go where no one has gone before, there is a brief window of opportunity. Fortune favours the brave, and it takes a lot more guts to break an evil cycle than to simply perpetuate it.Seyed Abbas Araghchi is the Iranian foreign ministerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It had to because this is not only a policy conflict.Between the administration and the opposition are actual opposites of principle: among those committed to inclusion and those to exclusion; truth and lies; kindness and cruelty; the protection and destruction of systems that in turn protect the climate or public health.It seems possible that what will ultimately emerge is a clarified sense of principles and a deeper commitment to them (which is why part of the conflict is over American history itself).On one hand, there are the heads of the federal government and their spokespeople, whose lies are part of their disdain for the electorate and the rule of law. Those lies also get served up as the justification for their cruelty – the cruelty directed toward federal workers, immigrants, children in this country in need of food and healthcare, including vaccines, and the millions of people currently starving or devastated by preventable disease around the world sinceElon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” gang destroyed USAID.Americans are waking up. A grand reckoning awaits us | Robert ReichRead morePoliticians’ lies were once decried and punished when detected, in a process that often led to contriteness and apologies from the liar. Even the act of lying was a furtive one when people feared detection and its consequences. Now liesarethebackboneofthe Trump administration’s utterances – from likely lying about the inhabitants of the small boats they are blowing up in the Caribbean, to lying about vaccines, the economy, climate, polls, laws, history, race, immigration and pretty much everything else.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt specializes in grotesque falsehoods in praise ofDonald Trump’s health, intelligence, success, and popularity. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary,peddlesliesabout health and healthcare and the science behind them. Vice-President JD Vance has likewise lied about a broad range of subjects, but his venom has been particularly directed at immigrants, who he falsely accuses ofdire economic impactsandoutlandish crimes. White House adviser Stephen Miller has told the same lies with even more venom. But Trump is first and last the liar-in-chief.It’s clear that many on the far right are now part of a subculture that celebrates and revels in cruelty and viciousness and doesn’t mind dishonesty. Trump officials sometimes seem baffled by the response from the rest of us who aren’t part of it, but apparently they don’t think we matter. We’re not their target audience, and this indifference to the opinion and values of the majority is itself a testament to their commitment to minority rule. It’s our job as the opposition to matter. And we have.The immigrant-rights opposition is motivated by solidarity with those under attack, underwritten by compassion. FromLos AngelestoChicagotoCharlotte, North Carolina, people have risked their own physical and legal safety to stand with those under attack by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), andorganized,trainedand otherwisedone the worktoprotect their neighbors. It has had a major impact on the ability of ICE to persecute immigrants and the Brown and Black people whose immigration status doesn’t seem to matter to these goon squads – sometimes as specific as preventing a person from being hauled away, sometimes as broad as theunprecedentedproteststhis year.Trump is shamelessly covering America in his name | Mohamad BazziRead moreFor example, the Chicago Tribunereportsthat on 25 October, “agents deployed even more teargas, this time right before a children’s Halloween parade inIrving Park, where a resident raced out of his house, still in his Chicago Blackhawks pajamas, to confront feds who’d tackled a man in his front yard.”Others, as lawyers, judges, protesters, journalists, scientists and educators, have defended truth, facts, science and law to protect human beings and the social and natural systems we depend on. They have stood up for the authority of truth that authoritarians seek to squelch or corrupt. The withholding and corrupting of information by the administration is corrosive to democracy, and it comes from a kind of elitism that regards the rest of us as not deserving the truth – and maybe suckers who will buy the lies (which plenty on the right actually are, and most of the rest of us aren’t).Facts, truth, science, history are themselves democratic. The causes of the civil war, Covid-19 and the climate crisis are the same whether you’re a billionaire or a busker, and money can’t buy you out of that – though it can buy you a social media platform or a network news corporation to corrupt.The opposition has been marked most of all by solidarity (which is by definition alliance and commitment to those who are not the same as you), an embrace of difference. I do not believe there has been anything like this level of solidarity with immigrants and refugees before, from the crowds showing up in the streets to the US senatorwho flewto El Salvador to try to rescue the kidnapped and persecutedKilmar Ábrego García. I hope that it gives rise to a shift in the Democratic party’s discourse about immigrants and refugees, from a watered-down acceptance of their characterization as a burden and a problem, to recognition of their irreplaceable contributions to this country, economically and otherwise.The attempts to secure truth and maybe justice forJeffrey Epstein’s victims has also been driven by solidarity with the victims and a sense of principle that the Trump administration and Trump himself don’t share. Their victimization was the result of the radical inequality between poor girls and young women and wealthy men, so one of the underlying questions is about equality, about whether we will have a nation in which everyone’s rights matter, in which everyone deserves protection by the law.Through the lens of history, Trump’s legacy will be more of a blotch than a Maga masterpiece | Simon TisdallRead moreIt has been remarkable how this scandal that refuses to die down was what caused widespread Republicandefection, when members of the House and Senate voted so broadly to release the files and someRepublicansspokeopenlyagainst Trump himself. Polls show Trump’s own popularity and that of his handling of the economy and immigration hasdeclinedradicallyover the course of the year.It was not clear when 2025 began what kind of opposition to theTrump administrationthere would be and how effective it would be. Many at the beginning of the year feared a powerful administration whose destruction went unchallenged, but it has been challenged and it has stumbled, faltered and backed down in many situations.The administration now seems to be getting more extreme and reckless as it grows more desperate, chaotic and unpopular. We enter 2026 with radical uncertainty about the fate of this country – but also with the clarity that people have the power to determine what it will be, if they continue to show up and stand on principle.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Averse to unpleasant candor, the Democrats’ governing body functions more like a PR firm than a political organization devoted to grassroots capacities for winning elections. The party’s leaders pose as immune from critique, even if they have led the party to disaster.Unwilling to depart from the party establishment’s culture of conformity, the DNC has remained under theBiden-Harris shadowthroughout 2025. Release of an official autopsy might have shown that party leaders actually want to encourage public discourse about the missteps that enabled Donald Trump to become president again. But the DNC is proceeding as if there’s nothing to be learned from the tragic debacle of 2024 that its leaders don’t already know – and they don’t need to share their purported wisdom with anyone else.In early December, the DNC featured Kamala Harris as the keynote speaker at the semi-annual meeting of its 450 members. Predictably, her formulaicspeechreceived a standing ovation. No matter that in recent months, on the long book tour promoting hercampaign memoir, Harris was notablyincapableof responding with any coherence to questions about why as vice-president she claimed that Biden was fit to run for president in 2024 or, for that matter, to be president for another four years.The DNC’s refusal to release its autopsy is in keeping with a pattern of evading hard truths that led virtually every elected Democrat in Washington to go along with President Biden’s insistence on running for re-election until his awful debate performance in late June 2024. Meanwhile,big majoritiesof Democratic voters were continually telling pollsters that they didn’t want Biden to run again.An autopsy report with any value would not dodge such matters. Nor would it elide sensible questions about how much money went to insider consultants and advertising contractors as the Harris campaign managed to spend $1.5bn during the hallowed 107 days of her presidential campaign last year. An autopsy might also probe the moral and political consequences of nominee Harris continuing to toe the Biden line for huge arms shipments to Israel while its military continued to slaughter Palestinian civilians in Gaza;duringthe campaign andafterward, polling showed that she would have gained a substantial boost of votes by calling for an arms embargo.Months ago, news accounts surfaced that release of the DNC’s autopsy would be postponed until after the November election. The draft autopsyreportedlyavoided casting blame on Biden or Harris or other Democratic leaders. But as it turned out, even such a tepid autopsy would be too hot for the DNC leadership to handle.In mid-December, when DNC chair Ken Martin announced the decision to withhold the autopsy from public view, hisrationalereeked of elitism, perfumed as pragmatism: “Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.” The actual message to the party’s base – including millions of loyal volunteers and small donors – was that they couldn’t be trusted to know what party chiefs have learned from a report based on hundreds of interviews with people in all 50 states. At the DNC, the political calculus is that the basis for sharing such information should be need-to-know, and ordinary Democrats don’t need to.Martin’s explanation for hiding the autopsy – his claim that winning in the future would be hampered by the “distraction” of assessing the past – is backwards. Public candor about why Democrats lost the White House is not a “distraction” – it’s vital for disrupting the party’s repeated compulsion of making the same mistakes all over again.A former chair of the progressive caucus in the California Democratic party, Amar Shergill, was cogent when mentioned Martin in this acidX post: “Bury the report that will help Democrats understand how and why they lost.”The DNC is now replicating the kind of tacit disdain for rank-and-file Democrats that fueled the 2024 catastrophe. Despite the lopsided poll numbers against Biden running for re-election, the attitude from the Biden White House and congressional Democrats was: we know much better than Democratic voters what they should want.Days before the DNC announcement about ditching its autopsy, my colleagues at RootsAction released our own in-depth autopsy,assessingwhat went wrong in 2024 and how to make crucial changes for the midterms and 2028. Written by journalistChristopher D Cook, the autopsy (“How Democrats Lost the White House”) focuses on these key points:Voterdisenchantment:Losing 6.8 million voters who supportedJoe Bidenin 2020 proved pivotal in the close 2024 election. Harris’s inability to mobilize those pro-Biden voters was a massive failure.Biden’sbetrayal:Biden’s stubborn decision to seek re-election, and his refusal to step aside until very late in the process, robbed Democratic voters of open primaries and undermined Democrats’ chances.Abandoning theworking-classbase:With millions of Americans feeling desperate because of rising costs, the Harris campaign lost this Democratic base by bowing to corporate donors’ interests and failing to challenge the impact of corporate greed in escalating inflation.The Gazaeffect:Harris lost many voters – especially young people, Arab-Americans and Muslim Americans, with sizable consequences in Michigan and other swing states – due to her refusal to indicate any openness to shifting her policy position on Israel and Palestine.Losingyoungvoters:Extensive evidence shows a huge drop-off in Democratic support among young voters aged 18-29.Some of the bleakest findings in the RootsAction autopsy about the 2024 election involve similarities with the findings in the RootsAction autopsy about the 2016 election, “The Democratic Party in Crisis”. On matters such as the party standard-bearer’s support for corporate power and militarism, as well as failure to connect with young people and the working class while pandering to mythical troves of moderate Republican voters, the names Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris could often be swapped with complete accuracy.As public scrutiny of the Democratic party’s recent history continues to be off the table at the DNC, one factor is its chair’s view that vigorous intraparty debate is unseemly. Before becoming DNC chair, Martin had told me on two occasions (once in 2019and more politely early this year when he was making calls before the chair election) that he doesn’t think Democrats should be criticizing each other in public.The future of the Democratic party is crucial because – given the structural realities of the American political system – this party is the only electoral vehicle for ending Republican control of the federal government. Anger and disgust with the Democratic leadership is fully valid. Yet strong progressives like representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Summer Lee and Ro Khanna would not be in Congress if they hadn’t run as “Democrats”.While ousting the Republicans from power is essential, progressives need to be fighting the Democratic party’s power structure that keeps impeding progress on that momentous task. Blockage of the official autopsy is symptomatic of the DNC’s deference to party leaders who engineered the disastrous 2024 presidential campaign.Martin won the DNC chair job almost a year ago without the support of Democratic heavyweights like Senator Chuck Schumer and representatives Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, who all backed Martin’s main opponent. Martin is not a favorite of many old-guard officials in the upper reaches of the party, and an autopsy with even a modicum of criticism in their direction might have sparked some kind of revolt. Martin opted to avoid any such problem by deep-sixing the autopsy.“It’s about protecting people who fucked up,” a DNC member told me. “Ken is trying to hold the DNC together. The decision about the autopsy is about trying to keep peace within the party.”But a party unable to publicly examine its own failings is unlikely to climb out of the rut that proved so helpful toDonald Trumpin 2024.Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

Certainly, the news that his cancer treatment will bescaled backhas come as a welcome personal relief, but it will also present opportunities for further overseas travel next year, likely to include a state visit to the US to mark the 250th anniversary of its foundation.It has been a year that has seen the king grow into the role of a silent but effective diplomat, navigating Donald Trump’s visit while demonstrating the UK’s support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine. Overseas trips have included a historic visit to the Vatican topray publiclywith the pope, and successful visits as head of stateto Canada– shortly after Trump hadsuggestedit might become the US’s 51st state – andto Australia. Moreover, the king has hosted the biggest number of inward state visits to the UK foralmost 40 years. For his use of the monarchy’s soft power to support UK foreign policy and strengthen international relations, Charles has won plaudits.He has been praised too for hisopenness about his health– a significant departure from centuries of secrecy surrounding such matters in the British monarchy. First came the announcement – in early 2024 – that the king had been treated for an enlarged prostate; then the news of his cancer diagnosis; and now its effective treatment. This has undoubtedly done much to make the king seem more relatable and empathetic, and has consolidated hispersonal approval ratingamong Britons at 62%, according to an October poll by Statista.But for all this, the fly in the ointment has and will remain hisbrother Andrew, despite him being stripped of his titles and facing imminent banishment from Windsor Park’s Royal Lodge to a property on the Sandringham estate. It is a scandal that has engulfed the family and continues to raise profound and potentially existential questions for the monarchy. In October, on a visit to Lichfield Cathedral, Charles washeckled by a protesterwho asked, “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?”, and whether the king had “asked the police to cover up” for his brother. While the protester was swiftly bundled off and silenced, questions about the lack of transparency and suggestion of a conspiracy of silence won’t go away.Walter Bagehot, the Victorian journalist and political essayist, argued that the British monarchy’s “mystery is its life”; and that “we must not let in daylight upon magic”. This has, for more than 150 years, provided the justification for our constitutional monarchy to remain shrouded in secrecy, above scrutiny, and protected from sustained critique. As Bagehot wrote: “Above all things our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about it you cannot reverence it.”King Charles hails reduction in cancer treatment as ‘milestone’ in his recoveryRead moreYet automatic deference or reverence is no more. Contemporary expectations of transparency and accountability are finally beginning to focus on the monarchy. Silence now suggests there is something to hide, and this erodes public trust and with it acceptance, never mind affection, for the institution. Indeed, public support for the monarchy reached itslowest level on recordthis year, with more Britons than ever before questioning its future. While a majority still supports its continuation, the figure has steadily declined since 2022.There are questions around what was known and ignored regarding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. What further questions of accountability and transparency may arise? Should it not be more widely known and considered that as monarch, our head of state, has sovereign immunity and so cannot be tried in court? And then there is the little-known fact that the king’s consent is sought for all legislation that affects the “personal property or personal interests of the crown”. Legislative exemptions from the Equality Act 2010 means that royal household employees cannot pursue discrimination claims (based on race, sex, age, etc) through an employment tribunal or court. Moreover, the monarch’s exemption from the Freedom of Information Act prevents scrutiny of how royal funds are spent and conceals the extent to which the monarch may attempt to influence government policy through private lobbying efforts. This, many would argue, fundamentally undermines democratic accountability.This year the House of Commons library published aresearch briefingon the finances of the monarchy. It has not made headline news, yet it raises very real questions about the institution and the sources and scale of its wealth, all at a time when the government is struggling to balance the books. The report tracks how the value of the sovereign grant, the monarch’s official funding, has risen to £132.1m for 2025/6, due in part to soaring profits from the crown estate. The king also received £28.7m in 2024/5 from the Duchy of Lancaster and a private undisclosed income from investments, inherited wealth and income from family estates such as Sandringham and Balmoral. Since 1993 the monarch and heir voluntarily pay income tax, but not on the sovereign grant, and nor do they automatically pay capital gains or inheritance tax. Questions as to what constitutes “public” and “private” money should be asked, and a clear separation made between state and royal wealth.The royal family has consistently been reactive rather than proactive when it comes to change and public opinion, and continues to believe in privilege and privacy at all costs. Yet for the monarchy to survive and thrive, and the king to continue to play a role as a unifying figurehead, supporting charitable causes and exercising soft power internationally, he needs to embrace openness and accountability. Reverence towards the institution is all but lost, but without transparency and letting in the “daylight”, it risks further alienation, mistrust and fatal irrelevance. As the king is praised for the openness with which he has spoken about his health, perhaps he might reflect on the expectations the public may have of a truly modern monarch.Anna Whitelock is a professor of the history of modern monarchy at City St Georges, University of LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He’s also in discussions with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, about a role for the army on the streets, while also contemplating whether the private security force that protects Jewish places – the Community Security Group – should be armed too.It is an understandable reaction to the horror at Bondi on 14 December and his thinking is no doubt driven by a sense of responsibility to act.“I think you can expect changes now,” he said before New Year’s Eve.“It’s not just about confronting terrorism or crime, it’s about making the public feel safe when they’re out with their family in the community.“We can have no ambiguity about the state’s responsibility to protect the people ofNew South Wales. It is our highest responsibility … and I know that there’d be a degree of trepidation after the horrible events in December.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“But I want the public to be assured that there is a comprehensive and massive police response to these terrible terrorist events.”Personally, I am not sure I would feel safer by seeing NSW police carrying high-powered weapons.I feel apprehensive when I step off a plane at a foreign airport to be confronted with people in military-style uniforms carrying dangerous-looking guns.Rather, I would like to see police and our security agencies be on top of any violent extremists well before they are able to obtain weapons or bombs or drive a truck into a crowd.This type of intelligence gathering requires an entirely different type of policing.It requires working with the leaders and members of our multicultural community. It involves building trust and being part of the community, not apart from it.Community policing has been adopted by most Australian police forces – and it’s not just a philosophy or an attitude. It’s about real engagement, through restructuring police organisations and altering the daily activities of officers.It’s about empowering police to think and to interact with people, to identify crime proactively. It relies on the community sharing their knowledge of crime and their concerns by developing trusting relationships.During Operation Shelter, a police operation that began in the aftermath the terrible events at Bondi, the most visible signs – apart from loud helicopters – are the groups of young officers in shopping areas in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.The police are friendly. They talk to people in cafes and shops, and exude a vibe that they are there for the community.Would people feel such a connection with them if they were carrying assault rifles? I doubt it.A more militarised approach is used in other countries, notably in Latin America and more recently in parts of Donald Trump’s America.The theory goes that deploying the military or militarised police forces will deter criminals in high-crime areas and push offending rates down.However, this style of policing comes at a cost: it often results in a loss of civil liberties for the rest of the law-abiding population, who are forced to comply with orders, searches and other heavy-handed tactics.NSW may expand Jewish security organisation CSG’s right to carry guns after Bondi attack. How would it work?Read moreA 2023 study, led by Brown University associate professor of political science Rob Blair,studied a militarised crime intervention in Cali, Colombia, and found little evidence to support the idea that military policing reduces crime.In 2018, Cali had a homicide rate of 46.7 per 100,000 residents, more than triple that of the capital of Bogotá. In an effort to reduce crime, the government developed a program – Plan Fortaleza – that involved recurring, intensive military patrols targeting high-crime areas in the city.The authorities and the military agreed to have monitors with the patrols, because they genuinely wanted to see if it worked. The crime rate fell slightly when the patrols were there but rose immediately once the operations ended.There are other costs of arming police.A study by Deakin University in 2020, Primed and Ready,looked at the number of fatal shootings by police across four countries. Australia has had more fatal shootings by police than the UK (where general police are unarmed) despite having less than half the population. Canada was even worse, where police carry semi-automatic pistols and shotguns in their patrol vehicles.“It is generally accepted that a police officer with a firearm is likely to make different choices about how to handle a volatile situation than a police officer who does not have a firearm,” the study’s authors said.“The latter will, of necessity, focus on de-escalation and containment. By contrast, an officer carrying a firearm has the option of fatal force from the outset.Another study from 2013noted that about 42% of fatal police shootings in Australia involved a person with mental health issues. Such deaths has led the NSW police to trial the Pacer program, where mental health experts accompany police to calls. It’s been highly successful in de-escalating incidents.Before we rush to arm our police with high-powered weapons, its worth studying the data, looking at the evidence and evaluating whether the advantage of having higher-powered weapons more readily available outweighs the other potential effects.What might we lose as a society if we make police more imposing and scarier figures on our streets?Anne Davies is the NSW state correspondent for Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsNew South WalesOpinionNew South Wales politicsAustralian police and policingBondi beach terror attackChris MinnscommentShareReuse this content"

We had no plans, so we met at a local cinema and then wandered the long street between our houses, pausing for a drink or two in various bars and chatting to strangers doing the same. We stopped when we became hungry and shared a plate of curries and drank beer in the window of an Indian restaurant, watching the parade of partygoers outside. Then we walked to the top of the hill to watch the fireworks lighting up the sky.It was after midnight as we strolled back but we weren’t quite ready to call it a night, and we found ourselves in a games arcade where a bunch of women were cramming into a photo booth to take a strip of black-and-white photos together. Their enthusiasm was infectious and so we waited until they were finished and did the same. I now have the strip of photos stuck on my fridge, secured under a magnet for a local plumber. In them, we are both grinning wildly at the camera, our faces squashed close, the years of friendship evident in our expressions.Bow-tied snooker players and hushed commentary: the joys of Pot Black | Nova WeetmanRead moreWhen I was cleaning up my parents’ house after my dad died, I found boxes of photographs that I’d left behind when I moved out. They chronicled my teens and 20s and showed faces that I’d long forgotten. Among them was a single rectangle black-and-white frame that looked to be cut from a much-longer strip of photos. I like to imagine that, after crowding into the photo booth and posing for the shots, the three of us couldn’t afford more strips, so we cut this one up and took a panel each. In the shot, I have long hair pulled tight into a ponytail but my smile is much the same as it is now.I don’t remember when we posed for the photo but it would probably have been on a rare night out in the city as we trekked in on the train from the outer eastern suburbs and spilled out to all the promise of the grown-up world.I stuck this single frame next to the New Year’s Eve photos on my fridge. Two nights out, nearly 40 years apart. And a record of who I was as a young friend and of who I am now. Looking at the photos, I decided that I needed more to fill my fridge and so these became the beginning of something bigger. Now, whenever I’m out late with friends and we pass a photo booth, I drag them in so that I can add to the mini gallery of faces I love looking at each day.There is something about the strip photos that preserves friendship for me in a way that a single photograph does not. Perhaps it is because the photographs exist as a series of changing poses that suggests evolution or complexity to a friendship, where a single image captures an isolated pose. Or perhaps it is due to being squashed together and staring up at the lens, waiting for the flash that never seems to go off when you imagine it will, and finally when it does come you’ve already given up posing so the images are more candid than any you prepare for.My dad died suddenly while I was in Japan. A memory of him lives on in my fridge | Nova WeetmanRead moreDespite most of us carrying mobile phones equipped with technology that takes far better photographs than a booth does, crowding into a machine with friends to take strip photos is still a thing. I wonder if it is because there is something magical about having to wait by the booth for the strip to finish printing and pop out into the tray before we then crowd around to check if our hair looks OK or if our smile is straight. The rarity of waiting for the photos to print seems to increase the joy.I have thousands of photographs on my phone snapped without much consideration for form or composition and I rarely look at them. But a strip photo is proof of something, it’s tangible and real. And importantly, these tiny squares don’t tell the whole picture of whatever is happening because there is no background. They aren’t an attempt at capturing an event like other photos are. These are something simpler, a reminder of a mood, a feeling, a connection between us and the people we care about. And they are a record of a moment in time that we can stick on our fridge.Nova Weetman is an award-winning author of books for children and young adults, including The Edge of Thirteen, winner of the Abia award 2022Explore more on these topicsPhotographyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

He wouldn’t be tolerated today, but don’t assume our system is flawlessTue 30 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 15.19 ESTShareAnd so thenew year honours list is out. The people – some of them at least – have spoken: here comes a fresh tranche of the great and good.Many questions remain about this process of elevation, but it’s worth saying that in the past, there were many more. As we think about the probity of politics now, fromPPE procurement scandalstoa one-time MEP bribed by the Russians, one might frown – but things have been degrees worse.A hundred years ago, if you wanted a knighthood, say, a baronetcy or even a peerage and, worthy or not, were prepared to pay for it, you called on a man namedArthur Maundy Gregory, who had set up in a large office almost directly opposite Downing Street.Liveried servants, their uniforms so closely modelled on those of House of Commons messengers that you could not tell the difference, would usher you into Gregory’s office, where the man himself, immaculately dressed and usually wearing a monocle, would greet you and point out the framed photographs of the crowned heads of Europe on his walls. They included the futureKing George VI, at whose wedding toElizabeth Bowes-Lyon(later the queen mother) he had been an usher.Despite his respectable appearance and ingratiating manner, Gregory was a scoundrel and a chancer. He had had various careers, as an actor, impresario, editor of vanity publishing magazines, club owner, self-proclaimed spy master and police informant and would maybe eventually even become a murderer. As he chatted, the telephone on his desk would ring and he would explain that No 10 was calling, without mentioning that he himself lived in an apartment at number 10, though Hyde Park Terrace, not Downing Street.View image in fullscreenMaundy Gregory, circa 1920s.Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty ImagesGregory would explain to you the scale of fees to help grease the wheels to the next birthday honours release: £10,000 for a knighthood, £40,000 for a baronetcy and £50,000 for a peerage – huge sums; multiply by 47 to get an idea of the modern equivalents. His commission probably totalled £30,000 a year and the rest went to party funds, mainly the prime minister, David Lloyd George’s. The hard-faced men who had done rather well out of the first world war might not have liked the “Welsh wizard”, but they were prepared to pay an honours tout like Gregory for their titles. Some of them, shovelled towards honours, were out-and-out crooks – Gregory either didn’t know, or didn’t care.Lloyd George himself did not look too closely where the money was coming from.As he told a Tory politicianlater: “You and I know perfectly well it is a far cleaner method of filling the party chest than the methods used in the US or the Socialist party … Here a man gives … to the party and gets a baronetcy. If he comes to the leader of the party … and says you must do this or that, we can tell him to go to the devil … The worst of it is that you cannot defend it in public.”Eventually, the awards got so disreputable that King George V complained about the rogues he was expected to confer honours on. “Disagreeable and distasteful” he said, privately of course. And the Tories also objected to their own potential donors being stolen by Lloyd George’s fixers. After they got into power in 1924, theHonours (Prevention of Abuses) Actwas finally passed, but the only person who has ever been tried under the legislation was Gregory himself; he went to prison for two months (freed after seven weeks for good behaviour) and was fined £50 with 50 guineas costs. On release from Wormwood Scrubs, he was met by a taxi and taken immediately into exile in Paris, where he received a monthly pension (in brown envelopes) for keeping his mouth shut about who he’d sold to. In those days, baronetcies (scarcely awarded these days) and peerages were hereditary and one or two third-generation descendants of Gregory’s honorands are still knocking about.Couldn’t happen now, could it? No, but let’s not be complacent. The other day, a friend of mine, a highly respectable professional, happened to be reading my book on Gregory when an unexpected and startling email popped into their mail box. “Have you ever considered independent recognition for (your) career impact, through attaining a royal honour such as an MBE, OBE, CBE or even a knighthood or damehood? Your leadership … feels very aligned with what these honours and awards look to recognise.”The company which sent the email says its clients are 6.5 times more likely to attain a royal honour and that it has an 80% success rate for king’s awards for enterprise. Its fees, it says, are based on the length of an honours nomination that it prepares for clients. I’m not sure Maundy Gregory could have put it better himself.Stephen Bates is a former senior Guardian correspondent and the author ofThe Man Who Sold Honours, published by Icon BooksDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The rich and famous are being punished for their conspicuous vacuityTue 30 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 15.19 ESTShareWhen Katy Perry and five other women were launched into space in Jeff Bezos’sBlue Origin rocket, no doubt they expected to be celebrated as trailblazers. Cast your mind back to April, and the event was getting wall-to-wallnews coverage. The crew, also including Bezos’s then-fiancee Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, were in spacefor about 11 minutes, during which Perry sang a rendition of Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World and revealed the setlist for her Lifetimes tour. On their return, the pop star kissed the ground and showed a daisy to the camera – a tribute to her daughter, Daisy.Well, talk about crashing back down to earth. Instead of being hailed as a giant leap for 21st-century feminism, the voyage turned into a colossal PR failure. Itwas ridiculedfor being tone-deaf, an out-of-touch luxury ride for the super-rich during a time of economic hardship. There were so many mocking memes and hot takes that Perry lateradmitted feeling “battered and bruised”at being turned into a “human piñata”. “I take it with grace and send them love,” she said, “cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for the unhinged and unhealed.”But the Blue Origin backlash reflected a broader cultural shift. As the now-viral refrain from Kourtney Kardashian goes, “Kim, there’s people that are dying.” The public’s tolerance for the promotion of celebrity as an end in itself is disappearing fast. In a world beset by economic uncertainty, political upheaval, wars and environmental breakdown, is it any surprise we increasingly want to see those with big platforms use them for something more than self-promotion?Of course, Jeff Bezos’s Venice wedding this summer, estimated tohave cost £37m, was uber-glamorous, and any A-lister worth their buck was invited. We saw the photos of Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Ivanka Trump and the Kardashians boarding water taxis to tour the Venetian lagoon. Once these images would have inspired envy or aspiration; now they arouse anger and feed “eat the rich” narratives.View image in fullscreenKaty Perry kissing the ground upon return to Earth after a flight on Blue Origin New Shepard NS-31, Van Horn, Texas, 14 April 2025.Photograph: BLUE ORIGIN/AFP/Getty ImagesOur celebrities were once distant figures whose lives functioned as escapism. Social media has eroded that distance, drawing stars into the same feeds, crises and conversations as everyone else. Now, when they appear indifferent, it reads as disdainful.Take Sydney Sweeney, whose advert for American Eagle jeans caused one of thebiggest controversiesin pop culture this year. In it, the blond-haired, blue-eyed star of Euphoria is framed as having “great jeans” – playing on the pun with “genes” – which critics claimed evoked eugenics and white supremacy. Even Donald Trump got involved,calling it“the hottest ad out there” after it was reported that Sweeney hadregistered as a Republicanvoter in Florida months before his election. Many saw Sweeney’s silence as complicity. “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear,” the actorsaid in November.Fast forward a few weeks, and Sweeney finally conceded she should have addressed the controversy around the ad. She also spoke out against “hate and divisiveness”. The generous interpretation is that it took time to work out the right response, but cynics may point out that the contrition coincided with Sweeney’s latest film, Christy, underperforming at the box office.Film execs could be forgiven for believing that merely having an A-list name in a title could get people into theatres – after all, it’s been the established way since the dawn of Hollywood. But Sweeney’s experience also speaks to a broader recalibration in the film industry itself. This season, films starring the likes of Margot Robbie, Dwayne Johnson, Julia Roberts, Keanu Reeves and Daniel Day-Lewishave all struggled at the box office. One popularpost on Redditsaid it was “simply because the star system no longer exists and a single name is not enough to convince a person to go to the cinema”. Instead, what resonated were films that challenged existing power structures as well as having a solid cast, such asRyan Coogler’s Sinners, a vampire film rooted in Black history, or Paul Thomas Anderson’sOne Battle After Another, about a retired revolutionary and his mixed-race daughter taking on the state.It’s no longer enough, it seems, to celebrate celebrity. Even Taylor Swift, who built a career on emotional vulnerability, faced a muted response when her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, prioritised songs about showbiz and herfiance’s manhoodover grander concerns. Accusations that Swift was detached from the anxieties of the wider world were compounded when shefailed to challenge the Trump administrationusing snippets from the album on social media (in stark contrast to other musicians, such as Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo, who havepublicly objected to similar political appropriation).Last year, Swift was on a list of celebrities that social-media userswere encouraged to blockbecause they had not publicly commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Perhaps such strength of feeling was behind the increasing number of artists who have felt empowered to speak out about the scale of death and suffering in Gaza over the past 12 months. But there are also potential repercussions for those who do make political statements – and not just about the Middle East. The suspension of the US TV host Jimmy Kimmel (over comments made about the killing of Charlie Kirk) demonstrated that powerful institutions are willing to act against public figureswho challenge them.There is also the risk of celebrities sliding into performative activism. On her new Substack, Charli xcx recentlyreflected on the artist’s responsibilityto the public. “Some people seem to have developed a connection between fame and moral responsibility that I’ve never really understood,” she said. Meanwhile, Jennifer Lawrence has saidthe onus shouldn’t be on artiststo fix the world’s problems. But in an age when many have lost trust in institutions that once shaped public morality, from political leaders to the media, it’s hardly surprising that celebrities are being looked to to fill the vacuum. In 2025, people don’t want their celebrities in space, they want to know what they stand for on the ground.Nadia Khomami is the arts and culture correspondent at the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Noise aboutKeir Starmer’sdurability quietens with MPs being away from Westminster’s tearooms and murmuring corridors, but WhatsApps zing to and fro just as busily: should he stay or should he go?Any party that has fallen so far, so fast would doubt its leader.At minus 54%, Starmer has been declared the “most unpopular PM ever”, a title also held at one time by each of his four predecessors. Given how little Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Starmer have in common, whoever comes next may join their “most despised” club in this time of anti-politician volatility.Internally, Labour wrangles over what’s gained from changing the face at the top and what’s lost in political stability after the mad Tory years of No 10’s revolving door. Post-Brexit referendum, changing PMs four times in eight years all but destroyed the once “natural partyof government”. With everything “unprecedented”, history is no guide, old party loyalties are dying and new parties are making extravagant promises.In the Times, Fraser Nelson, the recent Spectator editor, discourages Labour fromditching its leader, warning it not to “hallucinate about miraculous powers of a fresh face”. A new PM would need a new mandate, he writes: “Without this, cabinet rifts become harder to control; backbenchers harder to tame. Things start to fall apart. Usually, such leaders end up calling an election either to seek a personal mandate (Theresa May) or put the party out of its agony (Sunak). Or just because he can no longer control parliament (James Callaghan).” But everyone cherrypicks from history, and this advice is not from a Labour well-wisher.Disingenuous counselcomes from the Sunday Times: “Labour still does not have a good reason to dump its elected prime minister.” Failure is a good reason.Peter Kellner, pollster and analyst,chooses from historythe example of John Major’s success. Replacing Margaret Thatcher in 1990 after she had sunk to her lowest, his ratings soared to 61% and he scored a fourth consecutive Tory victory in 1992. Major was remarkable only inhis insignificance, butThatcher’s unpopularityhad become an albatross. That’s what Labour’s would-be defenestrators say of Starmer:voters on the doorstepdetest him. The venom against a man who is serious and decent, with animpressive tally of good done, is a mystery to me. He might lack oratory and charisma, he might waver in direction – but after the prime ministers we have just suffered, this sinister detestation springs from a deeper fury against governments and ruling politicians. How long would a new leader’s bounce last?However, if May’s elections return cataclysmic results, with backbench and cabinet in foment and no light on the horizon,Labourmay do what it has never done. To avoid being the first formally ousted Labour PM, Starmer could with elegance and dignity stand down, saying: “I have done my best – time now for someone else.” That never happens, but we live in unprecedented times.When it became undeniable that the 2010 election would be lost, Gordon Brown should have stood aside, enhancing his reputation. A self-effacing Starmer resignation would make selecting the next leader a less damaging drama. The obvious candidates are good – Wes Streeting, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham are all clever and practised – but they all have to prove what “change” means.Don’t bother swapping leader for the optics and oracy. Labour MPs need a united reason why, with neither the dismal dirge ofBlue Labournor a fanciful Corbynite reprise. “Change” has to mean escape from the ill-conceived manifesto by openly declaring: “Since that was written, the world has changed beyond recognition: Donald Trump is president, tearing up alliances; Europe is at war; the global economy is threatened by a gigantic AI bubble; the far right is on the march.” Discard tax pledges that distort budget priorities. Abandon Brexit red lines, freeus to get as close as Europe will agree. Bring in proportional representation immediately to rescue democracy for five-party politics. Cleanse donations from Westminster.The government has been overwhelmed by lack of money, and that won’t change. Considering the Resolution Foundation’sgrim assessmentof its constrictions, a new leader has to say how they would do any better. What new bellows could ignite the embers of growth? Admit the magnitude of the problem with honesty to call out Nigel Farage and Green fantasy accounting. Tell us what government is for – it’s not just a matter of better words.Let me tell you the good things the government has done in 2025 – because it certainly won’t | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIt may be impossible for Labour MPs to agree on either the person or the policies of a new leader. Putsch attempts against Brown failed due to strife over a successor. Cabinet resignations calling publicly for him to “stand aside”, several plots, arebellious letterto all Labour MPs from two former cabinet ministers and a likely challenger disappearing in the crucial plotting hours made good stories: all Labour coverage became about possible assassination. That’s the risk of rumbling, indecisive insurrection.If enough Labour MPs have the nerve, the plan, the organisation and the clarity of purpose, then “’twere well it were done quickly”. Why wait for certain election calamity in May? With no crystal ball, so far it looks to me by no means sure that enough of them will summon the mutual forbearance across factions to agree a new way forward. The measure of successful “change” would be raising Labour’s ratings, seeing off Farage and doing those most difficult things the country needs. If that doesn’t happen, Labour might look back on the achievements of the Starmer era and wonder why they did it.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Ghosting is the humane optionPhineas HarperEither say you can’t make it well in advance or keep stummTue 30 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 11.44 ESTShareAs New Year’s Eve looms, I implore you to heed this party etiquette advice.There are only two correct times to decline a party invitation: well in advance or not at all. The last thing any stressed-out host wants to receive, in the moments before their big event begins, is a sudden flood of 11th-hour RSVPs from guests announcing that they’re not coming. And yet, as anyone who regularly organises large parties in Britain knows, that’s exactly what they tend to be sent. It needs to stop.Having an invitation turned down in advance stings a little, but it is genuinely helpful. It provides a sense of potential turnout to help gauge catering and expectations. A decline on the day, however, is infuriatingly useless. Food and booze will already long since have been ordered, and it’s way too late to invite another friend to make up the numbers.Worse, getting a string of hastily typed apologies just hours before kick-off is an almighty buzzkill. Spending the day preparing, cleaning, baking and making Spotify playlists – only to be hit by a wave of rejection just as you’re feeling most vulnerable about who will turn up – sucks.There’s nothing wrong with guests reneging on party invitations per se. Shit happens. That’s life. Never mind. But rather than adding to your host’s headaches, the polite way to bow out of an event you find yourself unexpectedly unable to attend is to simply keep your mouth shut and your phone in your pocket. Ghosting, in this case, is the best approach.Worst of all is vibes-death by group chat. I’ve learned the hard way never to make the mistake of creating a WhatsApp group for a party in which guests can also post. No matter how many 🕺 messages and 🍸 emojis are exchanged in advance, come the day, every invitee in the group will receive the same barrage of energy-sapping dropout messages as a parade of guests inevitably pronounce they “can’t make it after all”, like the world’s worst hype men.OK, if it’s a small event – a dinner perhaps – and you suddenly can’t attend, sure, send a short note of apology followed by some grovelling (possibly via a card or flowers) a few days later. But for gatherings any larger than 10, just keep stumm.Most organisers of large parties will have probably anticipated flakiness anyway, and will have invited enough people to ensure a banger regardless of dropouts. But no host wants to hear about how you “somehow double-booked” yourself while they’re elbows-deep in party prep. Your last-minute bailing is your loss. Keep it to yourself.Phineas Harper is a writer and curatorExplore more on these topicsSocial etiquetteThe hill I will die onChristmascommentShareReuse this content"

At least France has woken up to its predicamentTue 30 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 30 Dec 2025 11.20 ESTShareLong before Versailles dazzled the world, the Louvre rose from the banks of the Seine as a royal residence. Charles V kept hiscelebrated library here; Henri IV installed his cabinets of paintings, objets d’art and arms, and created within its walls a veritable city of artists, where cabinetmakers, tapestry-makers, painters and armourers lived and worked. Under Louis XIII, coins, medals and the Louvre’s printing press were added; under Louis XIV came casts, antiquities and the academies of architecture, the arts and the sciences.The Enlightenment demanded that the masterpieces of the art world be made public; the revolution answered. On 8 November 1793, ordinary citizens were admitted to the Louvre’s Salon Carré and Grande Galerie for the first time, transforming a royal palace into a national art museum. Continually evolving through redesign, reconstruction and reinvention, it has survived revolutions, arson and Nazi occupation. Within its labyrinthine galleries, audacious thefts have unfolded in broad daylight, while secret acts of bravery left barely a trace in history. The Louvre is a place of enduring mystery and fantasy, belonging to both France’s collective memory and the world’s imagination. This year, however, a succession ofthefts,leaksandinfrastructure failureshas forced the French to look again at what the Louvre has become – and what it risks losing.More than a century beforeOctober’s extraordinary heist, another daylight robbery caused an international sensation. On 21 August 1911, Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian handyman who had worked at the museum,removed the Mona Lisafrom the wall, slipped it out of its frame, and walked out with it hidden under his coat. Convinced he was righting a historical wrong, Peruggia thought he was repatriating an Italian treasure stolen by France – in fact, Leonardo da Vinci had brought it with him when invited by François I. It took more than 24 hours for the Louvre to notice the Mona Lisa had disappeared, and another two years to recover the painting. In the meantime, crowds queued simply to stare at the empty space on the wall.Twenty-eight years later, Jacques Jaujard, the museum’s deputy director,saved the Mona Lisaand the entire collection from the Nazis through a highly secret and audacious operation, just 10 days before the second world war broke out. With the help of hundreds of curators, loyal employees and art students, Jaujard oversaw the packing and transport of 1,862 cases of treasures to remote castles deep in France. When the Nazis arrived in Paris in June 1940, they found the Louvre empty – and Jaujard waiting at his desk.The Louvre is made of such extraordinary tales. Scandalous thefts, mystery and acts of heroism have helped make the Louvre the most visited museum in the world today, with a recent average of almost 9 million visitors a year (and close to 10 million in 2019). Over time though, this popularity has become both a blessing and a terrible burden, and daring jewel heists are only the most eye-catching of the museum’s problems: it is bursting at the seams, at times literally.In recent months, theCampana gallery, which houses nine rooms of ancient Greek ceramics, has closed over fears of the ceiling collapsing. Water pipes have burst, damaging the Egyptian antiquities library and 400 or so historic documents, including records of the first archaeological excavations in Egypt in the early 19thcentury. Laurence des Cars, the current director of the Louvre, had warned of the urgent need to modernise the museum, but seemed to wait for somebody else to act. There is some speculation that some sort of state of emergency may need to be declared, to prevent further damage to both the collection and the Louvre’s reputation. Staff represented by trade unions have been onrolling strikessince 15 December to pressurise the management and government into swift action.The grand redesign of the Louvre, the “renaissance” announced earlier this year byPresident Macron, can not come soon enough. With acost estimatedat €1.15bn, to be partly funded by taxpayers, the plan includes a room dedicated solely to the Mona Lisa with an independent entrance, new galleries, updated facilities and a spectacular eastern entrance to complement IM Pei’s glass pyramid. State-of-the-art security, water, heating and electronic systems are also high on the agenda.Meanwhile, we French have taken to rolling our eyes in despair and embarrassment at each new Louvre “misadventure”. Oh no, what now? Has someone flown away with the Winged Victory of Samothrace via drone? At this point, nothing would shock us.A parliamentary committee investigating the theft of the crown jewels in October has now delivereddamning conclusions. Over the past decade, internal reports had repeatedly warned of the Louvre’s inadequate IT and security infrastructure – one highly secure password, hilariously enough, was simply “Louvre”. Yet these warnings remained unread and buried in drawers. Many have questioned the last two directors’sense of prioritiessince 2018: was it sound to spend €105m on new acquisitions while allocating only €27m for maintenance?Finally, it seems, the urgency of the Louvre’s predicament has been grasped. In the coming weeks, the name of the winning architect for the grand redesign should be announced. Macron has stipulated that work should begin no later than 2027, and be finished by 2031. Part of the funding will come from visitors: starting in January, non-EU nationals will pay €32 for entry, while EU residents will pay €22 (under-18s and EU students will still get free admission). Seen through French eyes, mass tourism has contributed to the Louvre’s challenges, and it is only natural that it should help fund its solution.The Louvre, at once iconic and vulnerable, revered and imperfect, carries the weight of history while grappling with the pressures of modernity. It embodies the contradictions ofFranceitself: proud yet self-critical, global yet intensely local, eternal yet in urgent need of care. With sufficient will, funding and a bit of luck, the Louvre will survive the present chaos – and French pride will remain intact.Agnès Poirier is a political commentator, writer and critic for the British, American and European pressExplore more on these topicsMuseumsOpinionFranceEuropeMona LisaPariscommentShareReuse this content"

This is a question I have been asking myself since 14 December. Which is not to suggest that I felt safe – or maybe comfortable is a better adjective – being Jewish in public before theBondimassacre, but is to say that the question has suddenly become far more urgent.I do not feel safe wearing a kippah because I fear that to many Australians this would be interpreted as a sign that I support Israel. I do not want people to make assumptions about my politics based on my appearance. And, more prosaically, in terms of my fear, I do not want to be shouted at when I’m going to the shops. I do not feel safe wearing a kippah because all of my life I’ve overheard non-Jewish people sharing antisemitic conspiracy theories. Greedy, cheap, power hungry, in control of the media. A host of conscious and unconscious biases inform how people react to Jews – to wear a kippah is to invite these reactions.In the battle against antisemitism we must accept that Zionism means different things to different people | David SluckiRead moreAnd, finally, I do not feel safe wearing a kippah because I know there are people who want to murder Jews – and I know also that, despite everything, there are many who simply seem unable to accept this as fact.The truth is, like many secular Jews, my sense of safety and acceptance in Australian society has always depended on my secularness, which is another way of saying on my invisibility. Invisibility, here, is no accident. It is made possible, I know, by my whiteness. And enabled too by the foresight of my parents, who gave me an English name and adopted Australian customs (ie sporting teams) when they immigrated here. And, my invisibility is also aided by my partner, who is non-Jewish and non-white; together we hardly look like a historically typical Jewish couple.But our first child was born earlier this year and I’d like her to grow up proud of her cultural heritage. And, for her, invisibility will mean something quite different. Today, she is unlikely to be read as Jewish by other Jews. She is also unlikely to be read as white. And, in this moment when Jews have been gunned down for celebrating their faith, and politicians are scrambling to leverage our grief for political wins, and the Jewish Australian community has a renewed focus on security, I worry that my daughter will one day feel doubly unsafe: unsafe being Jewish in public, unsafe being Jewish in the Jewish community.Jewish safety will not be found by weaponising the differences between antisemitism and other forms of hateSo, what does Jewish safety mean after Bondi?The trouble is I do not want to live in a fortress. I do not want to live in a society whereprotest is banned, where politicians legislate whatpolitical slogans are acceptableand what are not, where armed police patrol Bondi and stand guard outside Jewish schools, whereuniversities and cultural institutionsare continually surveilled, where our borders are closed and migrant communities are treated as suspect. I do not want my safety to depend on poorly thought out authoritarian policies enacted in a kneejerk race to score political wins. And, make no mistake, these policies are poorly thought out. Banning legitimate political debate and protest will make it easier for extremists to radicalise people who already feel disenfranchised and silenced by our political system. Doubling down on the conflation of anti-Israel protest with antisemitism will only lead more people to disregard and discount threats to Jewish safety.And, I worry, what will living in a fortress do to the Jewish community? A fortress requires walls and gates, guards and moats, a people inside and a people outside. A Jewish fortress, then, requires policing of Jewish identity, a list of who to let in and who to keep out. But this is not the Jewish community I know. My Jewish community is open and expansive. It begins with my parents, who every Friday welcome into their home my and my siblings’ non-Jewish partners. It extends also to the many non-Jewish friends who have joined us for Seders and Rosh Hashanna celebrations, and who help us practise our culture. And, most importantly, it includes my daughter, who by the strict laws of the Torah would not be considered Jewish, but who, by any other measure, is, at least for our little community, its heartbeat. Who, in my Jewish community, will be allowed inside the fortress?So, what does Jewish safety mean after Bondi?The trouble is, safety is a relational concept. One is not safe in the abstract; one is safe from something. Those who want us to live in a fortress are very clear here. For them, Jewish safety means safety from Palestinians, pro-Palestine protesters and Muslim migrants, and the path to Jewish safety is immigration reform. This is an Islamophobic, misinformed and dehumanising view of Jewish safety, but one we must engage with because it is being spread across our news and social media. It’s also a view of safety taken straight from the playbook of far-right populists: weaponise a legitimate fear to build a political coalition by attacking a minority group.After Bondi andManchester, it is legitimate for Jewish people to be fearful of the ways Islamic State and other terrorist groups have been able to reach and radicalise Muslim men. But, as Ahmed al-Ahmed’s courage and countless other acts of solidarity and compassion since Bondi show, the problem is radicalisation – it is not Muslim communities. Neo-Nazis and far-right nationalist influencers and political parties, all avowedly antisemitic and Islamophobic, are successfully reaching and radicalising Christian, secular, white, black and brown men here and across Europe and North America. And, as Christchurch and Orlando and the daily experience of a multitude of different people attests to, Jewish and Muslim and LGBTQ communities are all at risk from a febrile media, technology and political ecosystem that is colliding with toxic masculinity, widening wealth inequality and widespread social isolation to create ideal conditions for radicalisation.Australia’s gun laws have long been the envy of the world. They must remain so, especially after Bondi | Gideon Meyerowitz-KatzRead moreThere are many subtle differences between antisemitism, Islamophobia, homophobia and racism, but we are living through a polycrisis of hate, which creates points of convergence in the lived experience of our Jewish, Muslim, LGBTQ and migrant communities. Graffiti on schools and places of community gathering. Abuse on the street and online. Doxing and harassment of prominent community members. Property damage, physical assaults and intimidation. Massacres. Jewish safety will not be found by weaponising the differences between antisemitism and other forms of hate, or the strained relationships between Jewish and Muslim communities.So, what does Jewish safety mean after Bondi?Jewish safety after Bondi will only be found by tackling radicalisation head on, which can only be achieved by working hand in hand with the communities (including the Jewish community) in which radicalisation and its impacts are taking place. This means that the first step on the path towards Jewish safety after Bondi is healing inter-community relationships. And, while the Jewish community is categorically not responsible for antisemitism, we are responsible for articulating and sharing a vision of Jewish safety that will make this healing possible. This is a vision of Jewish safety that recognises that a fortress will never protect us, that our safety cannot be secured on the backs of other communities, that what threatens us is processes of radicalisation and the social conditions that enable them, and that these processes are best addressed not through repression or othering but instead through community outreach, education and mutual respect.And, for my daughter, this is a vision of Jewish safety that will encompass and protect and nurture her, within the Jewish community and beyond.Glen Berman is chair of the board of directors at GetUp and a senior researcher and PhD candidate at the Australian National UniversityExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinionBondiAntisemitismcommentShareReuse this content"

The show was plagued with woeful writing, cringe-inducing character development (justice for Miranda!) and just 71 seconds of fan-favourite Samantha. But for a moment there, as the third series started, it looked likeAnd Just Like Thathad finally hit its stride. Then came an episode all about Seema’s natural deodorant. No wonder creator Michael Patrick King announced that this would be the final series. It ended on a bum note; the closeup of Miranda’s toilet flooded with poo was just way too symbolic. Still, there’s no denying that fans have had a hoot dissecting every single “wtf?” episode. And as Carrie – a single woman once more – danced around her palatial townhouse to Barry White’s You’re The First, The Last, My Everything, who didn’t let out a little sob?All’s FairView image in fullscreen‘Can Kim Kardashian act? Of course she can’t’ … Kardashian with Naomi Watts in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyCan Kim Kardashian act? Of course she can’t. But that was almost the least of All’s Fair’s problems. The recipient of a very rarezero star reviewin the Guardian (and, it must be said, richly deserving the absence of every one of those stars), it was hard to know where to start with listing the problems with this Ryan Murphy clunker. The hilariously leaden writing? The tedious veneration of wealth and consumption? The almost wilful parade of cliches? Performances so bad they felt almost spiteful?Let’s just say “all of the above” and never speak of this show again. Except a second season has been commissioned so we’re probably going to have to.AKA Charlie SheenView image in fullscreenWay too indulgent … AKA Charlie Sheen.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixGiven the restraining orders, the domestic violence allegations and the parental failures, it’s fair to say that Charlie Sheen has been a bad boy. Not that you’d really have known it from this three-part documentary which chuckled along at Sheen’s various bouts of self-destructive hedonism while struggling to tell us anything we didn’t already know about the Hollywood hell-raiser. Instead, it felt as if this loose cannon was being indulged, so any sympathy this series might induce should be reserved for the people who have had to endure close contact with this charming but flippant egotist.The Iris AffairOf course we knew it was preposterous from the get-go: a drama about a supercomputer known as Charlie Big Potatoes that could either save the world – or destroy all of humanity. We stuck with it out of sheer love for Niamh Algar and Tom Hollander … but by the end, it felt like even they had stopped bothering. Hollander barely cared when he died, and Algar ended up slicing Charlie with an axe … in super slow-motion. Talk about giving up the ghost.MobLandView image in fullscreenBafflingly bad accents … Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan in Mobland.Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/APShady characters meeting in deserted boxing gyms? The Prodigy’s Firestarter jackhammering away in club scenes? The late 90s called and wants its gangland drama back. Actually, that is unfair on the gangland dramas of the late 90s. Many of them look a little dated now, but at least they didn’t suffer the ignominy of having to indulge Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren’s baffling Irish accents. But there were many other problems with MobLand. Mainly that it was just really dull; a dispute over drug-selling territory between various cockney picaresques which Nick Love would probably dismiss as a bit basic.With Love, MeghanView image in fullscreenA deliberate provocation? … With Love, Meghan.Photograph: Jake Rosenberg/NetflixGiven the extent to which she grinds the gears of the nation’s performatively enraged, right-wing culture warriors, it’s almost tempting to admire the Duchess of Sussex’s various televised ventures into twee homemaking as deliberate provocations. But then you watch them and are forced to admit that actually, in this one instance, they might have a point. It’s like watching the Liberty catalogue come to life before your horrified eyes; a wine o’clock poster with delusions of grandeur; a parade of snoozing dogs, humming beehives, Hallmark platitudes and pointless crafting “hacks” you’ll forget instantly. All underpinned by vast, largely unearned wealth. Ugh.Victoria BeckhamView image in fullscreenA cagey non-event … Victoria Beckham.Photograph: NetflixThere are clearly interesting things to be said about both Victoria Beckham and her struggles with vocation, self-image, self-acceptance. But for whatever reason, this three-part series chose not to say them. Instead, the experience was akin to consuming a sales catalogue. Victoria clearly has good reason to bridle at what she describes as her “miserable cow” image. But sadly, she didn’t do herself any favours with this cagey non-event of a series.The InheritanceView image in fullscreenWay too try-hard … Elizabeth Hurley as The Deceased and Rob Rinder as The Executor in The Inheritance.Photograph: Channel 4It should have been the next Traitors – except even camper, with Liz Hurley playing dead and executor Robert Rinder overseeing her inheritance. What more could you ask for? As 13 normies battled it out, there was plenty of backstabbing and squabbling. But the rules quickly became bewildering: it’s still too confusing to explain what exactly was happening in the weekly division ceremonies. Even more disappointingly, we only saw glimpses of Hurley via videos recorded for the contestants. The Inheritance ended up reeking of a show that was trying way too hard to live up to something way beyond it.Too MuchView image in fullscreenIcky … Megan Stalter as Jessica in Too Much.Photograph: PAHow do you follow a show that defined a generation as much as Girls did? The pressure on Lena Dunham was immense when she released this starry romcom about Jessica, a rosy-eyed New Yorker who lands in London with a broken heart. Meg Stalter took her biggest role to date by the horns and was joyous to watch as she revelled in Austen levels of romantic ideals, all while falling for indie guy Felix (Will Sharpe). But it was all very glossy and, ironically, was not enough. Plus, the amount of celebrity friends involved felt icky.Mitchell & Webb Are Not HelpingView image in fullscreenNot even good enough to be ‘patchy’ … Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping.Photograph: Channel 4David Mitchell and Robert Webb’s previous sketch series, the largely excellent That Mitchell and Webb Look, had a skit pondering the innate patchiness of the sketch show. We only wish that this return to the format rose to the status of “patchy”. Given the shrewd recruitment of talented younger comics Stevie Martin, Krystal Evans, Kiell Smith-Bynoe and Lara Ricote, expectations were high. But sadly, most of it didn’t land. Sweary Aussie Drama was a single joke milked to a husk but repeated in every episode. Mitchell seemed too willing to slip into Would I Lie to You? auto-rant mode. The writing room sketches, meanwhile, simply provoked the thought that they should probably have stayed in there a while longer.The Twisted Tale of Amanda KnoxView image in fullscreenA total mess … The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox.Photograph: Andrea Miconi/DisneyThis dramatisation of the story of Amanda Knox was executive produced by Amanda Knox and pretty much exclusively showcased the perspective of Amanda Knox. So, while there probably is an interesting drama to be made about the 2007 murder in Perugia of British student Meredith Kercher, this isn’t it. Of course, the story of Knox’s wrongful conviction and eventual exoneration is interesting in itself but the material needed to be handled sensitively. Instead, the series struggled painfully to find the right tone, lurching awkwardly from oddly jaunty, slightly mannered farce to inevitably, real-life horror. Twisted? Arguably. A total mess? Very much so.Prime TargetView image in fullscreenMore farcical by the second … Leo Woodall as Edward Brooks with Quintessa Swindell as Taylah Sanders in Prime Target.Photograph: Apple TV/PAWe love Leo Woodall … but did we buy him playing the greatest maths genius since Euclid, a man so smart he’s on the brink of a prime number discovery that could ruin society as we know it? Nope! This globe-trotting thriller about the NSA spying on – and killing off – intellectuals, and the man with the elaborate formula they were after, frankly got more farcical by the second. Silliness-by-numbers.1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue StoryView image in fullscreenInfamous … 1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Story.Photograph: Channel 4/DrumThis hagiography followed the OnlyFans star renowned for sexual escapades such as proudly sleeping with men who look ‘barely legal’ as she prepared for her biggest feat yet: having sex with 1000 men (or 1057, as it turned out) in the space of 12 hours. What on earth would possess her? What we wanted was way more interrogation of Bonnie Blue’s actual psyche, plus those of the men in the queue to have sex with her – some donning balaclavas and, fascinatingly, many others not. They could at least have spoken to the legendary mum who showed up to haul her son out of the queue. What we got was horrific shots of Bonnie making snow angels on a floor full of used condoms and absolutely no interrogation of her infamy whatsoever. And to think, the documentary-maker has a teenage daughter too.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2025 in TVAnd Just Like ThatDavid MitchellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.With such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto onThe Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”View image in fullscreenHall-of-mirrors feel … Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor in Superman.Photograph: Jessica Miglio/© 2025 Warner Bros. Ent. All Rights Reserved. TM & © DCThere was more baldness inSuperman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage aboutperceived wokenessadded a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.Is it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thrillerM3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.If Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr inThe Naked Gunreboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.View image in fullscreenTruly psychotic … Danny Huston in The Naked Gun.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/APIn the goopy, grungy world ofThe Toxic Avengerreboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such asBryan Johnson.In 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulishMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby inTron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully fromthe original 1982 Tron– seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.View image in fullscreenPale and pampered … Kevin Bacon in The Toxic AvengerBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satireMountainheadtook the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.As Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world.

Hours earlier, four young locals had been wrangled into being live presenters at their quiet village Sunday school. Despite dead air and awkward line delivery, it was the poor transmission quality that made the stars – Michelle Hornby (31), Jonathan Brown (27), James Warburton (25) and Deborah Cowking (21) – apologise and cut the inaugural broadcast. But Cowking, not realising they were still on air, slipped past the censors and summed up the evening’s vibe perfectly: chaotic, amateur and unrelentingly British.This was TheTelevisionVillage – a first-of-its-kind social experiment from 1990 that had the Lancashire village of Waddington “watch, make and become” television. For a short spell in the early 90s, the Ribble Valley was worth a fortune, as Granada Television shipped £3m worth of cutting-edge TV equipment to the rural hills of north-west England. Hidden cameras were set up in villagers’ living rooms to record viewing habits, day and night. Meanwhile, Channel 4 filmed the entire thing for a six-part documentary series. All of this was to monitor how people would react when the number of channels made the leap from four up to 30 – offering everything from sport, film and even porn, with villagers having access to terrestrial, cable and satellite channels, including from Europe and the US.View image in fullscreenWorth a fortune … Granada Television shipped £3m worth of cutting edge kit to the tiny Ribble Valley.Photograph: Courtesy George Francis LeeBut one of the new channels caught the village’s attention more than any other: Waddington Village TV. Granada felt that local programming and local TV stations would be the future, so they gave villagers a station they had control over to see how popular it would prove. With dedicated presenters and sets put together with old settees and gaffer tape, the DIY station became an eclectic outlet, broadcasting self-written soap operas, horoscope readings and magic tricks. Think cheesy stock music and thick Lancashire accents. Yet without autocues, makeup or professional technicians, WVTV became a smash hit, gobbling up 95% of its available audience, technically making it the best-performing station in the world. When Coronation Street was knocked off its pedestal, Granada knew something was up.Numerous people recall the broadcast being interrupted. It turned out a sheep had chewed through cable wires“The villagers all loved it,” says Cowking from a seat in the Lower Buck Inn in Waddington, “because they’d see themselves, see their families, see the vicar.” According to Cowking, Granada hadn’t anticipated the channel’s success: “When they first started filming us and doing it, they actually said: ‘Don’t worry about it, it probably won’t even air.’”None of the team of four had wanted to be presenters, but the village of about 400 had a small pool of willing participants. Brown had volunteered to help out with the cameras, but instead found himself in front of them.Most of the ideas for WVTV programming came from this Waddington four. Students from then-Lancashire Polytechnic were tasked with producing the shows, which were recorded in front of a live audience. There was the vicar’s Thought for the Day, keep fit classes and a cooking programme by the butcher’s wife Barbara. “In a small community you run out of things you can do a feature on,” Cowking admits. “But when you think about it, Barbara probably came before Nigella Lawson.”“We weren’t journalists,” Brown says. “We still had to live in the village when the TV people had gone.”People were climbing on their roofs and turning their aerials to get the village channel instead of Coronation StreetThis lack of formal training came back to bite the presenters multiple times. Hornby remembers being chastised by a producer for ruining “continuity” after getting a perm; Terry Jones of Monty Python fame tried to eat the studio’s pet goldfish during an interview; and the whole production was put at risk when a Weetabix box that was being used as a prop to hold up scripts out of sight of the camera was accidentally broadcast, potentially breaching advertising rules. Numerous people involved with the station recall the broadcast being interrupted, only for it to turn out that a sheep had chewed through cable wires.Waddington’s kids were also roped in, with three hours every Saturday dedicated to programmes made for and by young villagers. Gilly Czerwonka, a teacher at the time, helped gather a pool of children to write and star in the shows – often without any form of parental consent. She recalls one episode where the youngsters acted out a robbery on Waddington post office and high-tailed it in a car she had to drive.Despite gaffes and a low budget, the presenters were a smash hit with the locals, and WVTV made news across the globe, with the 21-year-old Cowking even receiving fanmail. But the coverage wasn’t without its snobbery.“There was a lot of condescension,” says Luise Fitzwalter, the editor of The Television Village, “these ‘hicks from up north’ – which was absolute nonsense.”“Everyone adored it,” she continues. “People from far and wide were climbing on their roofs and turning their aerials to get the village channel instead of Coronation Street. Granada said to me: ‘What have you done?! Our flagship programme!’”The production side of the experiment was a monumental task, with engineers, researchers, producers and camera operators living in Waddington for two months in the lead-up. Fitzwalter says they thought it would be “great, great fun and terribly naughty” to persuade the global manufacturers of the latest tech – from widescreen TVs to Sky – to send their prototypes to a remote village in Granadaland. Though the cabling had been hidden in the stream that runs through the village’s award-winning scenery, the imposing, aerial-adorned command centre in the car park of the Higher Buck pub caused Cowking’s mother to exclaim: “If nana came back to life now, she’d think the sputniks had landed!”View image in fullscreen‘If nana came back to life now, she’d think the sputniks had landed!’ … Waddington village, home to a huge command centre covered in aerials.Photograph: Courtesy George Francis LeeNaturally, the parish council wanted to keep an eye on things – as did the Independent Broadcasting Authority once they found out what was happening. “We had created a channel without asking anyone if we could,” Fitzwalter laughs. The village channel even made adverts for local firms, but allegedly had to return the money after the IBA caught wind.Just before launch, legal tangles around copyright threatened to kill the entire project. Until, according to Fitzwalter, Granada company secretary Alastair Mutch said: “Oh stuff it, let them sue.”Luckily for Granada, no complaints ever came in, nor did the porn channel spur outrage. “We agonised about it,” says Mark Gorton, the second director of the experiment. “We went round with forms, basically saying that if people were driven mad by smut that it wasn’t Granada’s fault.”We put cameras in people’s homes and filmed them watching television. The rules of reality TV didn’t exist“At the last minute on the night of the launch we bottled it and left it out of the package. Only to be greeted by a delegation of village folk who arrived at the head end and demanded it be switched on.”Gorton points out how The Television Village was a precursor to today’s deluge of social experiment programming: “We treated it as an investigation. It was pre-reality TV, so the way it was made was like an observational documentary. We put cameras in people’s homes and we’d film people watching television. Gogglebox cast them brilliantly, but we just let people be people. The rules of reality TV didn’t exist.” “We were the original Gogglebox!” Brown adds proudly. This televisual wild west is best encapsulated by Gorton’s memory of watching two hours of one villager wordlessly watching television before falling asleep to the 10 o’clock news.Despite the impact of WVTV, none of the villagers got paid for their involvement – not even the four stars who did shifts every weekday. Hornby speaks of having to juggle her presenting responsibilities with two young children, and her brother Brown still feels let down after everything ended: “The TV people went, it all switched off, and that was it – gone.” Warburton, who now owns the Lower Buck pub, prefers not to discuss the project at all.The major findings of the experiment were that viewers loved sport and film, much to the glee of Sky, who had provided these channels. But more surprisingly, it found people love programming made by the people around them. There was a buzzing sense that the hyper local was the future of entertainment.Thirty-five years later, the experiment has been proven correct. But instead of charming local production studios, hyper local programming today is pumped out by accounts on YouTube, Facebook and TikTok. History has shown WVTV as one of the earliest examples of user-produced content, well before everyone had the ability to record and publish whatever they wanted.“What has come to pass over the 35 years,” Gorton says, “is that anyone can present a television programme. We’ve learned anyone can be good – can be great – at it.”The experiment had launched in March, and by late April the cable was fished from the Waddington stream and the cameras were packed away. Brown and Cowking had aspirations to enter television professionally, but life seemed to have other plans. Today, many of the young people of Waddington have no idea what took place in 1990, when for a few months cameras seemed to outnumber people – when the village was full of chatter about satellites, aerials and invisible waves from space. A number of those involved have since passed away. The only permanent reminder of the experiment is an easily missed wood-cased silver plaque by the war memorial that reads: WADDINGTON The Television Village.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He called the friend several unprintable names while acknowledging: “I’m only calling you that because culturally that’s how I know how to express myself.” The friend’s reply to the torrent of insults: “I hear you and I receive that.” The whole thing, Shabazz says, made him “miss the good old days, when men handled beef like men”.The bit encapsulates a dilemma of modern masculinity – how attempts at enlightenment battle with alpha-male impulses. On social media, the manosphere clamors for our attention, extolling traditional masculine virtues such as authority, protein powder and the stamping-out of empathy. Meanwhile, other voices point out the absurdity of that image and call for thoughtful, emotionally attuned understanding of manhood.In short: it’s a ridiculous time to be male. And that’s good news for a genre of social media comedy that has emerged between the Hims ads. If 2024 was the year ofthoughtful masculine standup, 2025 was the year of the self-mocking man sketch.Comedy from standup toSaturday Night Livehas long found fertile ground in shifting notions of masculinity. But in the past few years, comedians have developed followings with short sketches that cast them as flailing young men, stumbling their way through social situations that threaten their identities or expose them as clueless try-hards. And like all good comedy, they also expose a truth – in this case, about the absurd and contradictory experience of manhood in the 2020s.Some sketches emphasize the weirdness of male friendship.In one, a woman teaches a group of guys how to be real friends (“I learned that texting your friends just to check in is nice and not totally weird,” says one). Inanother, a man is on cloud nine after a friend makes a shockingly intimate request: “text me when you get home.” Other sketches tackleself-importance(like the guy who says “partner” instead of “girlfriend”), mockmale fragility(“how do you get the algorithm to respect you?”), or riff on theperformative maletrope. Then there are parodies of various iterations of man in 2025 – the insufferablefinance bro, for instance, or the “grown man convinced he has haters” – “lions don’t lose sleep over the opinions of sheep,” he informs us.As society interrogates masculinity, so do these comedians. Sample question: is it OK for guys to love board games?This is the quandary at the heart of aSahib Singh sketchthat begins with him deeply invested in a game of Wingspan, a board game about birds. When his friends point out his enthusiasm – “he’s smiling!” – he backtracks in a panic: “I hate board games. I hate birds, too. I only know about indigo buntings ‘cause I used to hunt them.” On his way home, he asks ChatGPT if it’s OK for men to “enjoy board games a lot” and flees from a female friend who encourages emotional honesty. In his rush to escape, he’s knocked down by a passing car; lying on the street, he types another question into ChatGPT: “Is it gay to get hit by a car?”Like others in the genre, the sketch confronts what another comedian, Robert Webb, has described as the fundamental definition of traditional masculinity: “the pursuit of not being a woman.” Singh, who has more than a million TikTok followers, and his fellow comics play with self-doubt and the conflict between our internal selves and the carefully crafted personas we show the world – a particular problem for insecure men, but surely one everyone can relate to. And as is often the case in these sketches, the comedian plays a version of himself. When you’re the target of your own joke, you can be brutally honest and win some understanding from the audience at the same time.Dan Carney, another prominent TikTok comedian, also routinely plays himself – or at least someone with the same name – as in anaccountof his visit to a Pride parade as the straight boyfriend of a bisexual woman that’s received more than half a million views. In a series of cringe-inducing attempts to demonstrate his allyship, as he asks attendees awkward questions and demands to have his picture taken, he embarrasses his partner. “She didn’t even want me to come,” he says proudly. “I insisted.”“I don’t want the joke to be at anybody else’s expense but my own,” Carney, who generally plays a naive, buffoonish version of himself, says in an interview. “Playing a well-meaning character allows me and the audience to explore a subject matter earnestly and without feeling like anybody’s under attack.”Carney says he’s not focused on making a statement – but he does find masculinity funny. Much of that humor derives from insecurity, as in Singh’s sketch. Inanotherof Carney’s videos, he hires a private investigator to determine whether he’s gay. He also points to the gap between social media and reality: “I mean, it’s gotten so ridiculous,” he says. “As a man, I’ll go online and I’ll doomscroll, and there will be some jacked guy telling me that I’m not working hard enough, and usually I’m, like, eating a Crunchwrap Supreme in bed at 2am.” And what’s always funny to him, he says, is people who take themselves too seriously.These self-serious, bro comedians nowadays are funny for reasons that they’ll never understandDan LicataThat’s the kind of man the comedian and actor Eric Rahill has spent years parodying: the guy who posts narcissistic messages about his triumphs and struggles, all under the guise of motivating the masses. “To everyone who’s ever dealt with depression – this is for you,” Rahill says in oneclip, before doing a huge number of possibly fake pullups.In another, he sits in a boat drinking: “Italy, wine and a new relationship with God. Life is good,” he says, before noting that later that day he nearly killed all his friends after “I severely overestimated my boating abilities trying to impress my guy friends”.Rahill is among the early practitioners of this style of social media comedy; the pullup clip was posted to TikTok in 2021. And of course, this recent crop of self-mocking man clips didn’t emerge out of nowhere. They have a predecessor, for instance, in the YouTube and Vine videos of Rahill’s collaborator Conner O’Malley, who has played characters ranging from ared-pilled YouTuberto a very sadAI “entrepreneur”. Meanwhile, SNL has frequently parodied modern manhood in sketches like“Man Park”, where women take their male partners to a dog-park equivalent to try to socialize them, and“Straight Male Friend”, in which Bowen Yang celebrates having a simple-minded dope around. Andthe film Friendship, in which Tim Robinson’s desperate character tries to win the approval of a cooler guy, might be considered a long-form version of a social media sketch.View image in fullscreenA still from Friendship.Photograph: Republic Pictures/PAOthers have blended the forms; the comedian Dan Licata – another O’Malley collaborator – filmed a standup special,For the Boys, last year in front of a crowd of teenage boys at his own high school, as a character whose sense of humor, rich in dick jokes, has never quite matured beyond that age. Interspersed amid the set are brief sketches in which he, a man who once broke both his legs jumping off a roof, tries to “impart wisdom” to today’s teens as they prepare for illustrious careers. “Dumb masculinity, I think, is very funny,” Licata says in an interview. “A lot of these self-serious, bro comedians nowadays are funny for reasons that they’ll never understand.”The ascent of too many self-serious bros has inspired plenty of legitimate concern over the future of young men,seduced by the manosphereandswinging to the political right. But self-mocking man comedy offers an alternative narrative of modern masculinity: it’s a study in conflicting demands and expectations, a clash between honesty and performance. These comedians’ ability to poke fun at themselves is, if nothing else, testament to a self-awareness that my gender sorely needs.Explore more on these topicsComedyMenSaturday Night LivefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I pick what I read based on what I’m craving, and almost exclusively search the recommendations of a few book bloggers I trust for tropes I’ve previously enjoyed.This means I almost always know what I’m about to read – and it can put books on a pedestal of expectation. If the book hooks me, I’m disappearing into it for hours. And if it fulfils my hopes, I’m spurred on to read more of the same. But if not, I have to force myself through a handful of pages a day and my momentum is lost.Enter: month-long reading drought.Which is why I’m enlisting strangers who read in different ways (such as, I don’t know, reading the entireBooker longlist) to break my patterns.

Oddly, I don’t think I’ve read any books set there.I’m assuming this will be an endearing adventure about the mischief a reserved gay philosophy teacher gets up to with his larger-than-life elderly mother.

I’ve never been drawn to short stories – I love being immersed in a vivid large world, growing attached to characters over time.Some of the short stories reaffirm this, feeling a little cold and unfulfilling.

It is the same reason I love being immersed in book communities on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.I’m back at Gleebooks this morning, catching up with Jennifer.I tell her I loved The True True Story of Raja the Terrible (and His Mother) and she goes straight into recommending me more novels.But the next book I’m reading is James Islington’s sequel The Strength of the Few.

After decades of talk, Francis Ford Coppola’s forever-gestating dream project Megalopolis debuted in movie theaters in fall 2024, and promptly flopped at the box office, grossing a paltry $14m worldwide against a budget around $120m, much of which was put up by Coppola himself. Not even a series of splashy Imax presentations, including some with a live-actor element, could entice more than a relative handful of curious cinephiles out of the house to witness Coppola realize his ambition of making a movie about a visionary, time-stopping architect (Adam Driver) and the decadent city only he can save with his brilliant blueprints.‘He’s a jump-off-the-cliff kind of guy’: inside Francis Ford Coppola’s chaotic Megalopolis shootRead moreSome of the movie nerds showed up to watch Driver speechify, to immerse themselves in digital evocations of a futuristic, Rome-New York City hybrid, and enjoy the eclecticism of a cast that also includes Laurence Fishburne, several members of Coppola’s family, SNL’s Chloe Fineman, a number of semi-canceled actors encouraged to ham with impunity, andAubrey Plazaas Wow Platinum. A bunch of the movie’s original viewers had some fun making jokes on social media; a few mounted genuine defenses in the digital pages of Letterboxd and the like. But unsurprisingly, the movie did not figure into year-end awards consideration. After months-to-years of buildup, the movie left theaters within a few weeks, and was available to stream at home a little while later. For most movies, that’s a recipe for disappointed shrugs.Then something happened. Or rather, one thing didn’t happen:Megalopolisnever made it to the kinds of subscription-streaming channels that sometimes leads to a quick rediscovery (or, in some cases, couch-dwelling derision). The movie was briefly available to rent or buy on video on demand, but disappeared from those outlets relatively quickly, and didn’t surface on other common home-video formats in North America. (It was released on physical media in some other countries.)Instead, Coppola launched asix-city speaking tourover this past summer, screening the movie and engaging in a two-hour lecture about some of its broadest themes (topics on the agenda included “time”, “work”, and “war”). If you missed this, intentionally or otherwise, you might still be able to catch Megalopolis on this coming New Year’s Day, when it will screen again in what Coppola claims to hope will become an annual tradition. He also supposedly plans for a “director’s cut” – sorry, then what was it we watched last fall, exactly? Someone else’s cut – called Megalopolis Unbound: longer, weirder, maybe some dream sequences. (Was the whole movie not his own dream sequence?)If you can’t wait that long and want some kind of glimpse of the Megalopolis world at home, there’s also a whole separate documentary:Megadoc, directed by Mike Figgis, is available to rent after its own festival-and-theatrical run this past fall. It includes scraps of alternate versions of the film from its lengthy development, including a table read with Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman, and a rehearsal with a young Ryan Gosling. There’s also apparently plenty of Plaza staying in character as journalist Wow Platinum. It’s not the full Megalopolis, but it’s more extensive than most DVD special features these days.Meanwhile, he’s selling those lecture tickets and also someextremely fancy watches; given how much he’s paid for his dream-project movie, it’s no wonder he’d want to get as many releases and cuts as possible out of the experience. He’s also performing a more eccentric version of a practice common to contemporary cinema: branding. Megalopolis does not exactly promise a sequel – it’s more of an all-on-the-floor movie, which is why the idea of a director’s cut feels so loopy despite it running well under 150 minutes – and anyway, that would cost another arm and a leg. But maybe he can force the cult-movie issue by more tightly controlling the movie’s distribution. There is something chic about scarcity in art, after all, and there will always be interest in Coppola as an artist in what is likely the final decade-and-change of his life. For the moment, he seems willing to parlay that interest into making Megalopolis happen.In some ways, it’s a brave rebuke to the half-ephemeral, half-disposable nature of contemporary film culture. An environment re-oriented toward streaming, influencers and online weirdos can burn people out on buzzy movies before they’re even released with memetic obsessiveness; movies from major film-makers can go straight to Netflix and get shuffled around the tiles until they’re nestled in between glorified Hallmark movies and Dateline-level true-crime docs; where movies can make hundreds of millions in theaters and unceremoniously turn up as one more option on your smart TV three weeks later.View image in fullscreenFrancis Ford Coppola in Megadoc.Photograph: Elliefilm Megadoc LLCCan Coppola will this into being on his own, insisting that his movie has been misunderstood before others have a chance to reclaim it more organically? It seems unlikely. I had a blast seeing Megalopolis in Imax last fall, but the idea of paying to see Coppola ramble about it and the state of the world only fills me with dread. Even the idea of an extended cut feels a bit like when Zack Snyder tried to gin up interest in two additional versions of his Netflix sci-fi movies Rebel Moon. Choosing the object of a cult is something that, well, actual cult leaders do; movie cults are more endearing because they choose their own targets, rather than being manipulated into joining.Strapped for cash: why Francis Ford Coppola is flogging his watchesRead moreStill, there’s precedent for this kind of ongoing exhibition. Though the New Year’s Day screenings aren’t in Imax, those specialty large-format theaters do sometimes run into dry spells where studios don’t have the latest blockbuster ready for them. (Just last week, some Imax theaters, in between Zootopia and Avatar sequels, were hosting combined revivals of Sinners and One Battle After Another, though both movies are available at home.) Fathom Entertainment and cheap-to-distribute digital prints have brought a rep-house sensibility to some multiplexes. The weekend after Diane Keaton’s death, three of her signature movies were screening at AMCs around the US.Moreover, the ritualization of Megalopolis would probably be more widely admired if the movie itself had a better reputation. (Recall the similarly intentional scarcity of Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s film Memoria, which initially showed in just one theater at a time, and even now remains relatively difficult to find.) Re-releasing the movie on New Year’s Day is appealing because Megalopolis is, in fact, a New Year’s-y movie: shiny, ridiculous and hopeful – and more than a little fake. Movies get unsolicited “45th anniversary” or theme-month revivals all the time now. Who says a museum-quality, agreed-upon classic should be the only cinema allowed to turn itself into a weird little holiday? Coppola would probably prefer to imagine that the ideas of Megalopolis are too nagging, far-reaching, and ambitious for people to let go. But the movie offers little more than vague, sometimes questionable platitudes in reference to how to build a better future as a society. What it has to offer is an experience – a quixotic quest to build a better, or at least weirder, in-person cinema.Explore more on these topicsMegalopolisFrancis Ford  CoppolaAdam DriverAubrey PlazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

How about a new year’s resolution not to watch – or make – anything this grim ever again?Lucy ManganTue 30 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTShareWe are always aware, I think, of man’s inhumanity to man. The latest true-crime documentary fromNetflixis here to remind you that this is an umbrella term. It is undoubtedly rarer, though precisely why is unclear, but women can inflict the most awful suffering too – and here, a pair of them do so on children.Evil Influencer: The Jodi Hildebrandt Story is the latest offering from Skye Borgman, who is the undisputed queen of the genre, specialising in high-end takes on the most extreme, the most only-in-America stories of depravity you could (not) hope to find. She made her name with 2017’sAbducted in Plain Sight, about the case of Jan Broberg, who was kidnapped not once but twice by Robert Berchtold, a close friend of the Brobergs and a sexual predator who effectively groomed the whole, spectacularly naive family.The Girl in the Picture, five years later, tells the story of a young woman known as Sharon Marshall, found after her death in a suspicious hit-and-run accident to have been living under multiple aliases as the kidnap and rape victim of a fugitive on the run from the FBI for decades.I Just Killed My Dadcompleted an unholy trinity of films from Borgman, with an examination of why 17-year-old Anthony Templet shot dead his apparently loving father and waited calmly outside for the police to arrest him. Spoiler alert: Templet’s father was nothing like the man he seemed.All the films are sober, unsensationalised looks at their subjects. They allow all the witnesses and any living victims time to speak freely and thoughtfully, and they interleave testimonies about the effects of events and perpetrators’ actions with facts, timelines and evidential hurdles faced by police and prosecutors in the cases with consummate skill.Evil Influencer is no different. It has measured accounts from the police detective Jessica Bate, put in charge of the case when it became clear that the 12-year-old boy ringing at a stranger’s door was not a young prankster but a malnourished escaper from the nearby home of supposed therapist Jodi Hildebrandt, and covered in injuries indicative of severe abuse and torture. When the police searched Hildebrandt’s home they found his similarly starved and terrified sister sitting shaven-headed in a closet, ropes and handcuffs hidden in a safe room and assorted other evidence that supported the boy’s story.Eric Clarke, the county attorney who would put together the case against Hildebrandt and the children’s mother, Ruby Franke, adds thoughtful commentary to his explanation of how proceedings unfolded. Franke had, with her husband, Kevin, been a popular pair of influencers showing followers how to raise a happy family in accordance with Mormon beliefs. Hildebrandt, herself raised within the faith, was a life coach who specialised in helping members of the Church of Latter-day Saints (LDS) who were going through marital difficulties resolve them. She was on LDS bishops’ list of approved advisers and her clients were thus primed to trust her, even when her “advice” mostly comprised inducing shame about sexual desire (especially male) and quickly shaded into all but enforcing separation of couples so, it seems, she could better control them as individuals. Male and female former clients talk about the power she came to wield over them (and the money they paid her in the process) and the damage she did to their relationships with their spouses and children.Ruby Franke fell under her sway and became her business and possibly sexual partner too, and, with Hildebrandt assuring her that they were doing it all for Christ, participated in the abuse of the two children.Like Borgman’s previous films, and indeed like any entry into the true-crime genre, what it doesn’t do is escape accusations of voyeurism and exploitation. Evil Influencer lays out an appalling but very simple story of extreme child abuse done in the name of God by someone who was able to convince others – and maybe herself – that He was working through her.Clarke (an LDS member himself) and others have interesting things to say about how early religious training in “a strong church” can make people more susceptible to being led to extremes, but it is not delved into deeply enough to give the film the heft it needs to transcend its essentially grubby impulses. A new year’s resolution to do better than make or watch more of this stuff might improve us all.Evil Influencer: The Jodi Hildebrandt Story is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsDocumentaryTV reviewUS crimeTelevisionNetflixFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some threw themselves overboard. And others were thrown into the sea.In The Zorg, Siddharth Kara tells two stories. The first is of a harrowing incident aboard the eponymous slave ship – the murder of 132 Africans by the British crew. The second relates how that event came to play a role in the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, in large part through the work of a dazzling array of committed campaigners. One of these was Olaudah Equiano, author of one of the few surviving accounts of the Middle Passage from the perspective of an enslaved person, in which he described it as “a scene of horror almost inconceivable”.The tale begins in Liverpool, a city which at its economic zenith was responsible for 40% of the European slave trade. Investing in slavery was a profitable activity not just for the elites but for the lower classes as well. One investor, William Gregson, saved up his rope-making wages, ploughed them into the trade and eventually became a rich burgher and mayor of the city. Gregson financed the slave ship The William, which left Liverpool for west Africa in October 1780 with Capt Richard Hanley at the helm. It was loaded with commodities to trade at slave markets, such as tobacco, firearms, knives and “India goods” such as chintz and Maldive cowrie shells, 400lbs of which was “the going rate … per African male”.Around the same time, a Dutch slave ship named the Zorg (later referred to by the British as the Zong) had departed the Netherlands. The Dutch had been supporting and supplying arms to the American revolutionaries and in December 1780, Britain declared war on them. The Royal Navy gave British ships permission to seize Dutch property at sea: carte blanche for piracy. The Zorg was captured by a British captain and anchored off the Gold Coast. Meanwhile, on one of his slave shopping trips, Hanley had picked up a fleeing British governor called Robert Stubbs who had been kicked out for corruption. Stubbs had been tasked with handing over gifts of gunpowder and brandy from King George III to the Asante Kingdom but had likely pilfered them, souring diplomatic relations and threatening the flow of slaves.When Hanley arrived at Cape Coast Castle, a fortress at the centre of the British slave trade with a 1,000-capacity slave dungeon below it, he found the Zorg and took it on. He overloaded it with slaves, placed 12 of his own crew on it and made Luke Collingwood, a ship’s surgeon of questionable nautical competence, the captain. A few months later, in August 1781, the Zorg left Accra with “442 slaves, 17 crew, and 1 passenger”, the depraved former governor Robert Stubbs, on board.Kara is particularly skilled at using sources to bring to life the general hell of being trafficked on a slave shipThe Zorg’s journey was fraught. Dysentery – “the flux” – tore through the ship. Scurvy followed. The captain sickened and became delirious, appointing Stubbs to take command. Thus, “a ship full of decay and death was being commanded by a passenger”. Kara is particularly skilled at using contemporaneous sources to bring to life the general hell of being trafficked on a slave ship. The testimony of Alexander Falconbridge, another ship’s surgeon turned abolitionist, is especially powerful. He describes how enslaved people’s skin was often rubbed down to the bone from lying packed close on bare wood, their flesh pinched and torn between the planks. Elsewhere a Liverpool captain’s eyewitness account describes “two Eboe women” who had “by some means got overboard to swim ashore” being devoured by sharks.By late November 1781 the Zorg was miles from Jamaica and short on water. The crew decided to jettison some of the enslaved Africans, who had endured months in the obscene conditions below deck. What drove this unspeakable plan of action was not ensuring the survival of the people on board – the Africans had begged to be allowed to live even without water rations – but economic greed. Maritime insurance did not cover the death of enslaved people from natural causes, but did cover the “necessity” of throwing them overboard for the ship’s safety, for example, in the event of an insurrection. Over the course of several days, the crew drowned “those Africans who would be worth less at auction, either due to gender, age, or state of illness”: the weak, the sick, women and children, including a baby born during the crossing.Back in Liverpool, when the sums were done, Gregson was not pleased with the return on his investment. He filed an insurance claim seeking £30 per lost slave – several thousand pounds today. The insurers declined to pay. In March 1783, Gregson took them to court and won a trial by jury, arguing that the throwing of the slaves overboard was “necessary”.According to Kara, “there is a direct line of causality between the public exposure of the Zorg murders and the first movement to abolish slavery in England”. Twelve days after the trial, an anonymous letter was printed in one of England’s most widely read newspapers. The author, who claimed to have been in court when the case was heard, argued compellingly against slavery, with the case of the Zorg as prime example of its evil. Equiano read the letter and took it to Granville Sharp, an abolitionist friend, who filed a motion for a new trial. At a hearing to decide whether to proceed, the events on board the Zorg were reviewed with a forensic level of detail: exactly what the abolitionists had hoped for.In spring 1787, the founding members of the Society for the Purpose of Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade first met. Over the subsequent years, they wrote letters, made speeches, organised petitions, lobbied parliamentarians and aristocrats and meticulously documented the particulars of the slave trade through archival research and fieldwork. “Their efforts,” writes Kara, “would lay a blueprint for the pursuit of social justice.” In 1807, after years of setbacks, the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was finally passed.The story of the Zong slave ship: a mass murder masquerading as an insurance claimRead moreWho or what should get credit for the abolition of the slave trade is a matter of debate. That the Zorg was influential is evident in JMW Turner’s painting, The Slave Ship, initially titled Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, which was inspired by the events of 1781. Turner exhibited it in London in 1840 to coincide with the first World Anti-Slavery Convention. While slavery has been near-universal in human culture, its abolition following a sustained civil mass campaign was unprecedented, and an affirmation of the power of the pen, persistence and moral courage.Unlike in his other work – including Pulitzer finalist Cobalt Red, which meticulously documented human rights abuses in the mines of Congo – Kara has had to fill in some gaps in the historical record. Imaginative flourishes sit awkwardly next to rigorously researched accounts, and the book has a chimeric feel. Part thriller, part serious nonfiction – whatever it is, The Zorg effectively illuminates one of the darkest chapters in our history, using powerful storytelling and documented fact to assemble a portrait that haunts the reader long after finishing it.The Zorg: A Tale of Greed, Murder and the Abolition of Slavery by Siddharth Kara is published by Doubleday (£22).

However, her talent as an artist was not equal to her good intentions and she produced what was described as the worst restoration in history.Amid the storm of mockery and bad publicity over what became known as the Monkey Christ, Giménez took to her bed with an attack of anxiety, losing 17kg (37lb) in the process. However, she soon found that notoriety had an upside as people began bidding to buy her own art, which she sold on eBay, and she later donated the proceeds to a Catholic charity.The botched restoration became first an internet sensation and then a tourist attraction and the church began charging for admission. Ryanair laid on special flights to Zaragoza, the nearest airport, and today thousands of people continue to visit the village to see her work.View image in fullscreenBefore and after: the Ecce Homo mural and Giménez’s restoration.Photograph: Centro de estudios Borjanos/APNot only has the picture’s fame provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum’s two caretakers, but the €600,000 it has brought to the village helps fund places at Borja’s care home for elderly people.In 2023, Behold the Man (English for Ecce Homo), an opera based on the story written by Andrew Flack, a US public relations expert, with music composed by Paul Fowler had its world premiere at Opera Las Vegas.Giménez was not well enough to attend but her niece was there on opening night to represent the family.Eduardo Arilla, the mayor of Borja, said in his tribute to Giménez that she had lived a hard life. She was widowed while still young with two disabled children, one of whom died of muscular dystrophy.Arilla said the greatest homage that could be paid to anyone was what they had done with their life, emphasising the benefits she had brought to Borja. He said the Ecce Homo centre would be named after her, and perhaps a street or a square.The local church said in a statement: “Cecilia was a devoted mother and a fighter, a strong woman, but above all we should talk about her generosity which has won her the whole world’s affection.”Explore more on these topicsSpainReligionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, the photo shoot was never conducted.”Months later, towards the end of March, Nelson contacted Taylor to request that she pose for a photoshoot “with the express intention that the resulting images … would be published exclusively in the July 2025 issue of Vogue Portugal”, court documents state.Taylor agreed to pose but “at no point” authorised or licensed Nelson the right to make any other commercial use beyond the exclusive magazine issue, the complaint alleged.The photoshoot occurred in May and the images from that shoot appeared in the July issue of Vogue Portugal as planned.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHowever, on 4 September Nelson sent Taylor and Ubaldi a presentation of selected images that Nelson indicated she wanted to sell as “fine art prints” on her websites.“Immediately” after receiving Nelson’s proposal, Ubaldi informed Nelson that Taylor objected to such use of her image and explained that Nelson did not have Taylor’s licence or permission to sell the photos as “fine art prints” or “zines” and that “the only permitted use of the same had been for inclusion in Vogue Portugal”.Taylor alleged that Nelson was “well aware of [her] antipathy to such an expanded exploitation of her image” and that no agreement existed authorising Nelson to sell copies of the photoshoot, the court documents state.Nelson continued to seek a licence from Taylor, who “rejected each such request, and no such agreement was ever reached”, the documents state.Making Taylor’s rejection of Nelson’s “efforts to exploit the [photoshoot for] commercial purposes perfectly clear”, Ubaldi wrote to Nelson on 15 September: “We are not interested in a buyout of these images … I cannot be clearer about this – [Taylor] does not want you to sell images of her face, or her body as fine art prints.Amyl and the Sniffers win song of the year at 2025 Apra awardsRead more“If you had been transparent with her in advance of the shoot about your desire/intentions to sell the photos, she would have said no to the shoot. If you had any notion or desire to sell pictures of [Taylor] to recoup your costs, you should have disclosed this beforehand. We simply would have said no to the shoot.”But on 20 September, Taylor discovered that Nelson was selling “fine art prints” containing the pictures on her website and using the photos to promote her commercial enterprises, court documents state.“Moreover, after the foregoing interactions, [Nelson] expanded their exploitation … by offering a specially designed ‘zine’ that consisted exclusively of both published and unpublished images from the Vogue Portugal article,” the complaint stated.“Not only was this done without Ms. Taylor’s permission and in direct contravention of her wishes, but it appears to have been done in retaliation of Ms. Taylor’s demands that [Nelson] stop their unlawful exploitation of Ms. Taylor’s name, image and likeness for [her] commercial interest,” it alleged.Nelson’s Instagram and Facebook accounts continue to feature Taylor’s images without licence or authorisation from her, the complaint alleges.The complaint stated that “fans recognize Ms. Taylor’s likeness for its rebellious spirit and blend of a distinctive Australian ‘pub rock’ aesthetic – featuring mullets, footy shorts, and an unrefined style – with the style of 1970s punk”.“Accordingly, Ms. Taylor has built a substantial fan following based upon not only her musical talent, but also her image and personal brand.”The complaint alleges Nelson’s use of Taylor’s image has been likely to “cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive” regarding Taylor’s endorsement of Nelson’s commercial activities.It also alleges Taylor will “continue to suffer” harm, including “lost profits and damages to her reputation, brand, and business interests”.Nelson told the Guardian that as the matters were before a court it would not be appropriate to comment publicly but added that she denied the allegations and would address all claims through the proper legal process.Explore more on these topicsAmyl and the SniffersAustralian musicShareReuse this content"

Two women sweltering on the top bench seemed to sweat more over my question than over the clouds of sauna steam – the result of a beefy Finn ladling water on the wood-fired coals with a grim determination to broil us all.“Hmmm, yes, it will bring people to Oulu, which is good, but we don’t really know much about it,” said one of the women. “We know it’s happening, but we haven’t had many details.”Outside, queueing for the pleasure of a dip in the frozen river, the question elicited the sort of shrug rarely seen outside France. “We know it’s happening because the posters and signs are everywhere and people are talking about it, but we don’t know exactlywhatis happening,” said another woman, steaming in the sub-zero air.View image in fullscreenOulu can be found on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea.Photograph: VisitOuluThere are many reasons to visit the Finnish city of Oulu, which sits on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea: it hosts theAir Guitar world championships; is home to the world’s onlyScreaming Men’s Choir(20-40 suited, shouty men); and holds the annualPolar Bear Pitchingevent, where would-be business leaders pitch money-spinning ideas while standing in icy water. The presentations tend to be brief.Oulu, Finland’s fifth most populous city, is 100 miles south of the Arctic Circle. It is a short drive from huskies and sled rides; it offers sea, rivers, rapids, lakes, woods, nature trails and reserves; and there is cross-country skiing as well as almost 600 miles of cycle lanes. You can see the midnight sun in summer and the northern lights in winter. It is a leading light in solar power and renewable energy – and it has saunas. Saunas on lakes and on rafts, saunas in hotels, free saunas by the roadside and in most homes. A century ago, 95% of all children were born at home, often in the sauna. Today, most parents-to-be choose a hospital but introduce their offspring to the sauna at an average age of 4.5 months.A survey has declared Finland the world’s happiest country for the eighth successive yearPlus, the Oululainens have a cheery disposition, as do most Finns according to a survey that declared Finland theworld’s happiest countryfor the eighth successive year.These are all positives to attract visitors to this northern Nordic city that began as a settlement on Sami land in the 1600s, then became a trading site for wood tar, salmon and Nokia phones, and is now a European digital hub and a “living laboratory” (where innovations are tested in a real-world environment) for new technologies.View image in fullscreenA floating sauna on the Oulu River.Photograph: Jukka LappalainenSadly, few of these esoteric attractions featured on a trip organised by the city’s Oulu 2026 culture committee, which chose highbrow over the shouty men and pretend guitarists.The city’s diverse €50mCapital of Culture programme, spread across 39 sites and four counties, is aiming to attract up to 2.5 million visitors – 20% up on an average year – with the theme “Cultural Climate Change”. Highlights include a freeFrozen Peopleelectronic music festival, held on the iced-over Bothnian Bay – provided it is frozen next year. Also on the calendar is theLumo Art & Tech festival, plus theArctic Food Lab, celebrating local cuisine (wild fish, berries, mushrooms), and a Sami opera,Ovllá, about the Indigenous people of Sápmi – the local word for Lapland – which covers northern Finland, Norway, Sweden and Russia’s Kola Peninsula.“Its a unique opportunity for Oulu,” said Piia Rantala-Korhonen, chief executive officer of Oulu 2026, who estimates that for every euro spent, there will be a €5 return for the city. “Climate change is already happening and is a big concern here: the ice and snow are disappearing. Last year, we had to cancel the skiing marathon for only the second time in 100 years because there was no snow,” she said.View image in fullscreenAn Arctic Food Lab event, where people sample local delicacies.Photograph: oulu2026Out on Oulu’s unseasonably slushy streets, most locals are cheerfully enthusiastic about 2026. “It will be nice to have people come here and discover our city,” said Matti, a student at one of Oulu’s two universities. “I am looking forward to it.”Thirty meters under the city, you can find the Kivisydän (“stone heart”), a vast state-of-the-art car park that diverts vehicles away from the centre and doubles as a walkway when it rains and an emergency bomb shelter. It is a reminder of Finland’s proximity to Russia and the increasing alarm over its aggressive neighbour since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Behind the Kivisydän’s steel doors, a vast red stone column stands like a beating heart. The car park could house the entire city, our guide told us.But does it have a sauna? I asked.“I don’t think so, but we’re Finns. If necessary, we can build one in a couple of days,” he said.Were I a publicist for Oulu 2026, I would have hired Finland’s best air guitarist to accompany the screaming men with a few riffs while standing in an icy river. Instead, after a traditional salmon soup dinner hosted by the city – followed by a sauna – we were treated to a cosy Norse tale. When 19th-century Oulu sailors became drunk and rowdy on merchant ships carrying tar to Liverpool, local legend has it that the Liverpudlian landlord would urge them to “keep peace”. This is now a popular toast.As we raised glasses of local schnapps, I can think of many exclamations a scouse pub owner might make to an inebriated Finn. “Keep peace” is not one of them. Still, surrounded by the world’s happiest people, it seemed churlish to argue.Then it was off to the sauna.The trip was provided byOulu 2026This article was amended on 30 December 2025. The saunsa was on the Oulu River, not Lake Oulu.Explore more on these topicsFinland holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For many, the draw is the end-of-year party season – better known as“Detty December”, a phrase popularised by Nigerian singer Mr Eazi in the late 2010s. This wave of travel used to simply be a time for diasporans to reunite with their families for Christmas, but in recent years it has evolved, with young people – who call themselves IJGBs (I Just Got Back) – making the most of the buzzing nightlife in cultural capitals Lagos and Accra.This annual diaspora homecoming is now being fictionalised in The Full Picture by Canadian author Jessica Carmichael, a YA coming-of-age romance bringing the family reunions, festivities, and endless traffic of December to life on the page. The novel follows Robyn, a Canadian university student, who travels to Ghana during winter break for the first time since her Ghanaian mum died. On her trip, she uncovers family secrets and finds herself in a love triangle with Osei, her grandmother’s neighbour, and Kelvin, Osei’s childhood friend. The book was published by Hibiscus Press, which Carmichael founded herself with funding support from Edmonton Arts Council.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to write a story that made people feel as if they were back there’ … Jessica Carmichael.Photograph: Arinze ArehLike her protagonist, Carmichael is a Canadian of Ghanaian and Bajan descent. Growing up in Canada, she did not see YA fiction with characters that looked like her, and the African fiction she came across often tended to be more serious – so she wanted to represent young Africans in a light yet thoughtful way.Her novel isn’t the first fiction to explore the Detty December phenomenon; a Nigerian publication, Noisy Streetss, has published short story anthologies on “Love in Detty December”. But in The Full Picture, Carmichael captures Detty December in Ghana in longform fiction from the perspective of a diasporan travelling home. “It is something that you don’t really see in fiction,” says Carmichael, adding that she would “love to see more”.Carmichael points out that there is scope for Detty December fiction to be explored from other cultural perspectives, given that people from the world over travel to west Africa in December. She would love to see stories “from a Black American perspective, from a Caribbean perspective”.It was after visiting Ghana for the first time in 2019 to see her grandmother that Carmichael was inspired to write her novel. At the time, it was theYear of the Return, a government initiative that invited the Black diaspora to visit Ghana to commemorate 400 years since the arrival of the first recorded enslaved Africans in Virginia. Carmichael says the trip “changed the trajectory of my life”.‘Detty December’: Nigeria’s diaspora flock to Lagos for party seasonRead moreOn her return to Canada, she read a lot of Ghanaian fiction that brought her closer to her culture, and later decided she wanted to write a novel herself. Her book features all the hallmarks of Detty December, from the vibrant nightlife to the inflated prices and different diasporas coming together to reconnect with their cultures. “I felt that there was a massive gap in the market, and I wanted to write a story that could make people feel as if they were back there when reading it,” she says.Carmichael sees her novel as a departure from other writing on diasporic travel and migration. She had noticed a trope of disillusionment and alienation from the culture in books on diasporans travelling home. Visiting Ghana herself, Carmichael’s experience was very different – she felt embraced and welcomed by the local community.Carmichael hopes her book – which has found fans on TikTok – will inspire more people to write about Detty December. “I’m all for it, because you go for maybe three, four weeks and you come home and you’re back to regular life. So I think it would be amazing to relive it in fiction.”Explore more on these topicsBooksFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We might imagine it as a version of Cape Town – birthplace of the author, and of JM Coetzee, whose endorsement appears on the back cover.Soraya, a 19-year-old woman from the Muslim quarter, is sent by her mother to work as a maid in a wealthy part of town. Her new employer, the elderly Mrs Hattingh, is a settler who fondly recalls her days “when I was a girl in England”. When the novel opens, in 1920, Mrs Hattingh lives alone: her husband is dead, and her son, Timothy, fortunate to have survived the war, lives far away in London.The house, Mrs Hattingh proudly says, is one of “the Cape’s good homes”. Soraya is given an instructional tour through its many rooms: “Pantry, dining room, sitting room, guest room, gun room”; “You will dust daily”. Soraya may be the daughter of a washerwoman, but her father is a religious calligrapher “with the hands of a scholar”. While she’s careful to limit her replies to her employer to a subservient “Yes, madam”, it’s largely her interior narrative – fiercely intelligent and wildly alive – that transports us through this slim, tense novel.Though the house is outwardly grand, Soraya notes signs of decay: Mrs Hattingh, she realises, must have lost some of her fortune during the war. Now, in addition to Soraya’s other tasks – already rapidly expanding beyond housework to include gardening and live-in companionship – she “will be expected to collude in her deceits”: to help Mrs Hattingh hide the facts of her reduced circumstances from her neighbours.But Soraya has already enacted a deceit of her own: she arrived at Mrs Hattingh’s house with a letter of recommendation from a former employer which she claimed not to be able to read. In fact, Sorayacanread. She withholds this from Mrs Hattingh, she says, as some employers “prize education in their servants, others resent it”. It’s less trouble, in other words, to keep it quiet. But it later becomes clear that this omission is based on her mother’s firm instructions: “Always keep something back. There is no need for them to know what you are truly thinking.” Not so casual a deceit after all, then: rather, a strategic attempt to assert agency.And despite being from different worlds, the two women emerge as worthy opponents in the silent power struggle that forms the central conflict of the novel. Each feels certain of her superiority over the other. Each is trapped by the house, and haunted by its ghosts. Each secretly despises the other, and longs to be reunited with her own family – Soraya with her parents, siblings, and fiance, Nour; and Mrs Hattingh with her beloved son, Timothy. It is on Master Timothy’s impending visit home that the engine of the story initially turns, as the women busy themselves with preparations. But Soraya’s deceit carries terrible consequences, and as the pressure builds, so does her anger. She begins to have visions of “this house all aflame”, her employer’s “whole body a burning log”.We’re clearly meant to root for Soraya as narrator, but it’s worth pointing out that Davids’s treatment of Mrs Hattingh is one of the novel’s great strengths. She’s depicted, initially, as unbearably patronising (“I always hire your people if I can help it, Soraya”). Later, there’s a subtle shift, showing the Englishwoman as so lonely and deluded that it felt almost uncomfortable to have her held up as a figure of ridicule. It’s a mark of Davids’s skill, her empathetic range, that she finds space for human understanding of this difficult character, for ordinary sympathy, before the end. Cape Fever is a cleverly told and ultimately satisfying novel, by an author bold enough to reveal uncomfortable truths.Cape Fever by Nadia Davids is published by Scribner (£16.99).

Here’s 10 films to look out for.1. The DebRelease date:in cinemas 15 JanuaryRebel Wilson makes her directorial debut and co-stars in this adaptation of Hannah Reilly and Megan Washington’s 2022 stage musical, praised by the Guardian’sCassie Tongueas “a women-centred, lovingly local story with big laughs and big pop choruses”. The story centres on two characters: a big-hearted farm girl (Natalie Abbott) who pins all her hopes on shining during her school Deb (which makes me wonder whether she’s seenCarrie…) and her more pessimistic cousin (Charlotte MacInnes). The Deb premiered at the 2024 Toronto International film festival but has beendelayed by legal dramas.2. We Bury the DeadRelease date:in cinemas 5 FebruaryIn the latest from horror maestro Zak Hilditch – whose oeuvre includes the awesomeThese Final Hours– America has accidentally deployed a weapon of mass destruction off the coast of Australia (oops!) and it’s turned a large swathe of the population into zombies. Led by Daisy Ridley as an American woman who travels to Tasmania in search of her missing husband, and whose job is to collect corpses, the film has been generating good buzz since premiering at the 2025 South by Southwest festival.IndieWire’s Katie Rife, for instance, called it a “top-notch” work “with compelling performances, urgent pacing, and gorgeous cinematography”.3. JimpaRelease date:in cinemas 19 FebruaryThe latest drama from Adelaide-based auteur Sophie Hyde is her biggest production yet, with two excellent actors in the lead role: John Lithgow as Jim, a longtime gay rights activist, andOlivia Colmanas his film-maker daughter, Hannah. But it’s still clearly a personal project, inspired by the death of Hyde’s father and starring her non-binary teenager (Aud Mason-Hyde) as Hannah’s non-binary teenager Frances. The story involves Hannah travelling with Frances from Adelaide to Amsterdam to reconnect with her father.4. TenzingRelease date:TBCView image in fullscreenGenden Phuntsok as Tenzing Norgay. Tom Hiddleston plays Edmund Hillary and multi-Academy Award nominee Willem Dafoe stars as expedition leader Colonel John Hunt.Photograph: Kirsty Griffin/AppleJennifer Peedom has built a reputation on big-spirited, visually sumptuous documentaries that chart the majesty of the natural world and the intrepid souls who venture into it –Mountain,RiverandSherpaamong them. The latter touches on the story of Tenzing Norgay, who along with Edmund Hillary became the first person known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. Norgay’s now the subject of Peedom’s first narrative feature: a biopic starring Genden Phuntsok in the titular role and Tom Hiddleston as Hillary.5. Death of an UndertakerRelease date:TBCActor turned director Christian Byers’ feature debut is a darkly comic hybrid documentary set in a Sydney funeral parlor, where he shot the film piecemeal over eight years. Byers plays a fictionalised version of himself, Sparrow, a steadily unravelling employee tasked with the funeral trade’s rather esoteric duties, including the occasional exhumation. The film’s aesthetic is warped as all get-out, with a scratchy, surreal, banged-up visual palette that reminded me of the grimy VHS-esque look of Harmony Korine’sTrash Humpers.6. Crowded HouseRelease date:TBCView image in fullscreenNick Seymour, Neil Finn and Paul Hester of Crowded House at the Montreux festival.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/REX ShutterstockI wasn’t a huge fan of Richard Lowenstein’s previous documentary,Mystify: Michael Hutchence, but I’ll watch anything from the veteran film-maker who has helmed many fine films includingEcco Homo,He Died with a Felafel in his Handand the stone-cold classicDogs in Space. No prizes for guessing which beloved rock band is the subject of his next doco.7. Bear CountryRelease date:TBCOld mate Russell Crowe has not one, two, three buteightupcoming titles listed on his IMDb page. Among them is this US/Australia co-production (adapted from Thomas Perry’s 2010 novel, Strip) in which he plays a strip club owner who, after being robbed several times, reacts like many protagonists in grindhouse revenge movies, writing the thieves a sternly worded letter. Kidding: he of course takes matters into his own hands. Rusty and director Derrick Borte previously collaborated on Unhinged, which isn’t great but does featurea scarily good performancefrom Crowe.8. MockbusterRelease date:TBCHow do you launch a career as a “legit” film-maker by working forThe Asylum, a production company known for pumping out dreadful bargain basement genre knockoffs? By making a film about the entire doomed experience! Adelaide director Anthony Frith captures the process in this amiably low-key and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny documentary, some of the jokes coming from The Asylum’s disarmingly self-aware staff. Says one: “We make shitty movies … we’re barely above porn.”9. The FoxRelease date:TBCView image in fullscreenJai Courtney plays a hunter who does a deal with a talking fox.Photograph: MadmanThe feature debut from Dario Russo, creator of the cult TV animationDanger 5, is a curious sounding comedy starring Jai Courtney as a hunter who takes relationship advice from a talking fox – as you do – after his fiancée cheats on him. The synopsis from the Adelaide film festival, where it premiered in October, tells us to expect “talking magpies, magic holes, and lots of yapping Jack Russells”.10. The DebtRelease date:TBCIndigenous Australian horror movies are still in very short supply, 2024’sThe Moogaiand Tracey Moffatt’s pioneering 1993 filmBedevilbeing among the genre’s only entrants. So this scary movie,led by South Australian First Nations film-makers, is particularly welcome. At this point not much is known about the plot; the official synopsis tells us that “Anna and her 10-year-old ward become trapped in a terrifying ordeal” in which she must “make a choice: end her life or the life of the child”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian filmTom HiddlestonDaisy RidleyOlivia ColmanJohn LithgowDocumentary filmsRebel WilsonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there are a few too many sentimental moments to properly work as social-realism, or anything close to convincing drama, which is disappointing given its creator, Don Ng, is a journalist-turned-director making his feature debut. It’s set in London, where Bosco (a sensitive performance by Yiu-Sing Lam) has arrived fromHong Kongfleeing the government’s crackdown on political freedom, though he doesn’t really talk much about the situation back home.Bosco is sent to live with other asylum seekers on a military base while his application is processed. Some of the best scenes turn out to be gentle observations of his sense of dislocation: walking around the local corner shop, for example, with its aisles of unfamiliar food. At a bus stop he meets Yasmin (Tsz Wing Kitty Yu), another asylum seeker, who writes letters to her student doctor boyfriend in Hong Kong, in prison for giving first aid to anti-government protesters. Bosco and Yasmin hang out together, though it’s obvious that for him the friendship feels like something more.Ng’s script has a habit of raising issues without exploring them. Bosco gets a cash-in-hand job at a car wash, where the illegally employed workers seem happy enough; and there’s no suggestion of exploitationor unsafe working conditions. Then, one of the asylum seekers at his accommodation is threatened with deportation to Rwanda. In another storyline, a young British man falls in with a far right group protesting against immigration. It all feels muddled and contrived – a further script edit might have resulted in a more rewarding drama.No Time for Goodbye is in UK cinemas from 1 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsMigrationRefugeesHong KongAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

You must carefully place climber Aava’s hands and feet to make your way up a forbidding mountain, camping on ledges and bandaging her fingers as you go. Like real climbing, it is challenging and somewhat brutal.PC, PlayStation 5;29 JanuaryView image in fullscreenOnwards and upwards … Cairn.Photograph: The Game BakersReanimalA two-player animated horror game in the Tim Burton mode, minus all the whimsy. In a setup reminiscent of the famously discomfiting games Limbo and Inside, a brother and sister must escape a twisted mockery of their home town, finding their friends as they go. They are stalked by horrible spike-limbed monsters and grotesquely reanimated creatures. Genuinely frightening and artistically impressive.Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation5, Xbox;13 FebruaryResident Evil RequiemCapcom’s horror series is very old, but it still comes up with new ways to make your skin crawl. In Requiem we play as bookish Grace, whom the game’s director calls “the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history”, and the confidently combat-proficient cop Leon S Kennedy, pursued by monsters through the iconic Raccoon City.Nintendo Switch 2,PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox;27 FebruaryPokémon PokopiaView image in fullscreenHow does your garden grow? Pokémon Pokopia.Photograph: NintendoImagine droppingPokémoninto the world of Animal Crossing, with a hint of Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic. This family-friendly Nintendo game has you building and tending habitats for Nintendo’s beloved creatures. You play as a Ditto, the shape-shifting pink blob, which can helpfully transform into other Pokémon, using those other critters’ abilities to bring a barren landscape back to life and build a vibrant town.Nintendo Switch 2,5 March007 First LightThe most anticipated James Bond game since the Nintendo 64’s GoldenEye 007. Made by IO Interactive, famous for Hitman, it stars a younger, twentysomething Bond who has not yet earned his 007 status, and hopes to blend the expected car chases, shootouts and gadgets with some genuine spycraft, as Bond infiltrates parties and digs for information.Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox;27MaySarosView image in fullscreenHostile aliens … Saros.Photograph: Sony Interactive EntertainmentFrom the Finnish developer behindReturnal, the exceptional, intelligent time-loop sci-fi shooter, this mysterious action game stars another stranded astronaut on a different hostile planet, one where a dying sun is sending its creatures and colonists mad. Long-time gamers will recognise the lineage of arcade bullet-hell shooters in this very modern action game.PlayStation5;30 AprilGrand Theft Auto VIIt has been in development for more than a decade and, despite several delays (GTA VI was on this very listlastyear), expectations have never been higher for the biggest game in the world. It’s a crime storyanda love story, featuring the series’ first female protagonist, Lucia, and her boyfriend, Jason, and set in Rockstar’s fictional Floridian state of Leonida. There has been so much to satirise about contemporary America since 2013’s GTA V that Rockstar’s writers will surely have been spoilt for choice.PlayStation 5, Xbox;19 NovemberMarvel’s WolverineView image in fullscreenMarvel’s Wolverine gets his claws into new foes.Photograph: Insomniac Games/ MarvelThe modern Spider-Man games have gone down a storm, so it’s no surprise that developer Insomniac is now turning its attention to a different Marvel hero. This new game features an ensemble X-Men cast and a whole lot of gratuitous comic-book violence, as Wolverine sticks those adamantium claws through a succession of foes trying to chase him down.PlayStation 5; date TBCWitchbrookLooking for an alternative to established wizarding-school fiction? Witchbrook is a charming pixel-art slice-of-life game about a witches’ college.

Two women sweltering on the top bench seemed to sweat more over my question than over the clouds of sauna steam – the result of a beefy Finn ladling water on the wood-fired coals with a grim determination to broil us all.“Hmmm, yes, it will bring people to Oulu, which is good, but we don’t really know much about it,” said one of the women. “We know it’s happening, but we haven’t had many details.”Outside, queueing for the pleasure of a dip in the frozen river, the question elicited the sort of shrug rarely seen outside France. “We know it’s happening because the posters and signs are everywhere and people are talking about it, but we don’t know exactlywhatis happening,” said another woman, steaming in the sub-zero air.View image in fullscreenOulu can be found on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea.Photograph: VisitOuluThere are many reasons to visit the Finnish city of Oulu, which sits on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea: it hosts theAir Guitar world championships; is home to the world’s onlyScreaming Men’s Choir(20-40 suited, shouty men); and holds the annualPolar Bear Pitchingevent, where would-be business leaders pitch money-spinning ideas while standing in icy water. The presentations tend to be brief.Oulu, Finland’s fifth most populous city, is 100 miles south of the Arctic Circle. It is a short drive from huskies and sled rides; it offers sea, rivers, rapids, lakes, woods, nature trails and reserves; and there is cross-country skiing as well as almost 600 miles of cycle lanes. You can see the midnight sun in summer and the northern lights in winter. It is a leading light in solar power and renewable energy – and it has saunas. Saunas on lakes and on rafts, saunas in hotels, free saunas by the roadside and in most homes. A century ago, 95% of all children were born at home, often in the sauna. Today, most parents-to-be choose a hospital but introduce their offspring to the sauna at an average age of 4.5 months.A survey has declared Finland the world’s happiest country for the eighth successive yearPlus, the Oululainens have a cheery disposition, as do most Finns according to a survey that declared Finland theworld’s happiest countryfor the eighth successive year.These are all positives to attract visitors to this northern Nordic city that began as a settlement on Sami land in the 1600s, then became a trading site for wood tar, salmon and Nokia phones, and is now a European digital hub and a “living laboratory” (where innovations are tested in a real-world environment) for new technologies.View image in fullscreenA floating sauna on the Oulu River.Photograph: Jukka LappalainenSadly, few of these esoteric attractions featured on a trip organised by the city’s Oulu 2026 culture committee, which chose highbrow over the shouty men and pretend guitarists.The city’s diverse €50mCapital of Culture programme, spread across 39 sites and four counties, is aiming to attract up to 2.5 million visitors – 20% up on an average year – with the theme “Cultural Climate Change”. Highlights include a freeFrozen Peopleelectronic music festival, held on the iced-over Bothnian Bay – provided it is frozen next year. Also on the calendar is theLumo Art & Tech festival, plus theArctic Food Lab, celebrating local cuisine (wild fish, berries, mushrooms), and a Sami opera,Ovllá, about the Indigenous people of Sápmi – the local word for Lapland – which covers northern Finland, Norway, Sweden and Russia’s Kola Peninsula.“Its a unique opportunity for Oulu,” said Piia Rantala-Korhonen, chief executive officer of Oulu 2026, who estimates that for every euro spent, there will be a €5 return for the city. “Climate change is already happening and is a big concern here: the ice and snow are disappearing. Last year, we had to cancel the skiing marathon for only the second time in 100 years because there was no snow,” she said.View image in fullscreenAn Arctic Food Lab event, where people sample local delicacies.Photograph: oulu2026Out on Oulu’s unseasonably slushy streets, most locals are cheerfully enthusiastic about 2026. “It will be nice to have people come here and discover our city,” said Matti, a student at one of Oulu’s two universities. “I am looking forward to it.”Thirty meters under the city, you can find the Kivisydän (“stone heart”), a vast state-of-the-art car park that diverts vehicles away from the centre and doubles as a walkway when it rains and an emergency bomb shelter. It is a reminder of Finland’s proximity to Russia and the increasing alarm over its aggressive neighbour since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Behind the Kivisydän’s steel doors, a vast red stone column stands like a beating heart. The car park could house the entire city, our guide told us.But does it have a sauna? I asked.“I don’t think so, but we’re Finns. If necessary, we can build one in a couple of days,” he said.Were I a publicist for Oulu 2026, I would have hired Finland’s best air guitarist to accompany the screaming men with a few riffs while standing in an icy river. Instead, after a traditional salmon soup dinner hosted by the city – followed by a sauna – we were treated to a cosy Norse tale. When 19th-century Oulu sailors became drunk and rowdy on merchant ships carrying tar to Liverpool, local legend has it that the Liverpudlian landlord would urge them to “keep peace”. This is now a popular toast.As we raised glasses of local schnapps, I can think of many exclamations a scouse pub owner might make to an inebriated Finn. “Keep peace” is not one of them. Still, surrounded by the world’s happiest people, it seemed churlish to argue.Then it was off to the sauna.The trip was provided byOulu 2026This article was amended on 30 December 2025. The saunsa was on the Oulu River, not Lake Oulu.Explore more on these topicsFinland holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I like to include this as part of a spread of mixed hot and cold dishes – a jolly, festive update on cheese and pineapple on a stick (which is admittedly hard to improve on). Then, a high-impact, low-effort dish: za’atar roast carrots with labneh and pistachio. On a whim, I hung a carton’s worth of plain yoghurt in muslin for labneh the other week, and now I can’t stop – it takes just 30 minutes for a soft-set, which is what you want here (for a firmer set, leave it to hang for an hour).Hot halloumi platter with pineapple salsa (pictured top)To get ahead, keep the cut pineapple in a large bowl in the fridge, the chopped mint and chilli in a small bowl, and the red onion and lime juice in another small bowl. Mix just before serving.Prep20 minCook15 minServes6, as asnack or side1 smallripepineapple, peeled, cored and cut into small chunks1 small red onion,peeled and very finely chopped1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped15g mint, leaves picked and finely choppedFinely grated zest and juice of1-2 limesA pinch of sea salt flakes½tbsp olive oil2225ghalloumi, patted dry and cut into ½cm-thick slicesIn a bowl, mix the pineapple, onion, chilli, chopped mint and lime zest, then add the lime juice and salt a little at the time, tasting as you go, until the flavours are nice and punchy (depending on how juicy they are, you may not need both limes).Heat the oven to 70C (50C fan)/gas very low. Put your largest frying pan on a medium heat, add a little olive oil, then lay in a single layer of the sliced halloumi. Fry for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown and crisp, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and put in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining halloumi in batches.To serve, arrange the hot halloumi on a platter, dress it with the pineapple salsa (you will not need it all) and serve immediately.Za’atar roast carrots with labneh and pistachiosView image in fullscreenRukmini Iyer’s za’atar roast carrots with labneh and pistachios.This is a lovely dish to serve as part of a meze spread, It can also all be prepared in advance, and put together at the last minute.Prep10 minCook40 minServes4500g natural yoghurt1kg carrots, peeled and cut diagonally into 1cm slices2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2tbsp za’atar45ml olive oil1tsp flaky sea salt2tsp maple syrup75g pistachiosJuice of ½ lemon1 small handful fresh mint leaves(optional)Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Tip the yoghurt into a muslin or clean cloth set over a sieve, bring the corners of the cloth together and gently twist so the yoghurt is completely encased in a ball. Fasten with string (or a rubber band) and tie to a cupboard handle with a bowl underneath to catch the liquid.Meanwhile, tip the sliced carrots into a large roasting tin (they should almost sit in one layer), then toss through the garlic, za’atar, olive oil and salt. Cover tightly with tinfoil and roast for 20 minutes.Remove the foil, drizzle over the maple syrup, then return to the oven for a final 10 minutes. At the same time, pop the pistachios on a baking tray, and put them on a lower shelf of the oven to toast (if your oven is fierce, rescue them after six to eight minutes). Roughly chop the toasted pistachios into chunky pieces.When you want to serve, warm through the carrots for 10 minutes in the oven, if need be. Untwist the cloth, spread the labneh over a platter and arrange the carrots on top. Squeeze over the lemon juice, scatter over the pistachios and mint leaves, if using, and serve warm or at room temperature.Explore more on these topicsNew yearQuick and easyFoodSnacksCheeseFruitStarterVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

They arrived in Spain in the 16th century, through trade with Flanders, and were often paired with pork, which we love. Here, however, I caramelise them with onion, thyme and sweet vinegar, then serve on crisp baguette with soft cheese and pine nuts. A small bite with big flavour, and just right with a glass of oloroso – perfect for festive times.Caramelised brussels sprout andpancetamontaditosPrep15 minCook35 minMakesAbout 20 canapes1 tbsp olive oil125g sliced panceta(Spanish bacon), or pancetta, finely chopped1 medium onion, peeled and finely sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced300g brussels sprouts, finely sliced3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped2 tbsp sweet apple vinegar2 tbsp soft light brown sugarSalt and black pepper20 slices fresh baguette150-200g soft curd cheese, whipped, or whipped cream cheese50g pine nuts, toastedHeat the oil in a large frying pan, then fry the chopped panceta for about five minutes, until golden and crisp.

Add the onion to the pan and fry gently for 10 minutes, until soft and golden.Add the garlic, sprouts and thyme, and cook slowly, stirring often, for another five to 10 minutes, until the sprouts are tender and wilted. Add the vinegar and sugar, then cook for a further five minutes, until the contents of the pan are nice and sticky. Season generously, stir the crisp panceta into the sprouts and take off the heat.Arrange the bread on a large platter, and top each slice with a spoonful of the caramelised sprout mixture. Spoon on a dollop of the whipped cheese, scatter over a few toasted pine nuts and serve warm.Explore more on these topicsFoodSpanish food and drinkNew yearVegetablesPorkSnacksBreadrecipesShareReuse this content"

The only real rule is to keep things to just one bite – no one wants to be manoeuvring a fork, after all. “People just want a big hug of comfort food with a decadent twist,” says Max Bergius, founder ofSecret Smokehousein east London. “If you’ve got a bit of smoked salmon left, get that on blinis and top with lumpfish caviar, which is only £2-£3 per 50g pot.” Mini fishcakes would also be just the ticket: “Whether you’ve got leftover smoked haddock or hot smoked salmon, fold it through mashed potato, mix with dill, lemon and fried leeks, then roll in panko and deep-fry.”Ella could also have a ball with croquetas, too, says Nieves Barragàn Mohacho, chef-director ofSaborandLegado, both in London. “Make the bechamel up to three days ahead, then use leftover ham or chicken, or mushrooms, for the filling. Whizz old bread into crumbs to coat, then fry.” Sausage roll fillings are, of course, another natural home for those crumbs, or use them as a jacket for chicken pieces, says Joanna Brennan, co-founder ofPump Street Bakeryin Orford, Suffolk. “Seasoning-wise, all you need is a bit of lemon zest and thyme, and they’ll sing so much more.” Incidentally, she adds, croissants make excellent crumbs, too: “You know how people use cornflakes to bread chicken? Well, croissant crumbs are also delicious.” (As are croissant crisps: “Thinly slice croissants, bake low and slow, then dip in melted chocolate flavoured with orange zest.”)One of Luke Ahearne’s “favourite things” at this time of year is a leftovers sandwich, and that doesn’t have to stop post-Boxing Day, says the chef atMotorinoin London: “Get some ham and turkey in an airtight container and freeze.” While you’re at it, set aside some cranberry sauce and honey ham glaze in the fridge. Come 30 January, defrost the meat, then pop in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven with the reserved glaze for 20 minutes. “Cool and slice thinly, then lay on top of some sourdough and start building sandwiches with lots of cranberry sauce. Cut into bite-sized pieces and, honestly, it’s a winner.” Leftover turkey, meanwhile, could be turned into a spicy, crisp salad, says Luke Selby, chef partner ofPale Hallin Wales: “There’s always a bit of turkey leg left over, and it’s perfect for something punchy.” Shred the meat, then crisp slowly in a pan, and toss with leftover cranberry sauce loosened with lime juice, a spoonful of soy and a little chilli oil. “Finish with fresh herbs [coriander and mint, say] and some sliced spring onion, and serve in little gem leaves.”Veg, meanwhile, can be scrubbed up and ready to party with a big batch of bubble and squeak. “Mix all your leftover veg with herbs, then season and add flour,” Ahearne says. Stamp out to “roughly the size of blinis”, then store in the freezer. “Refresh in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 10 minutes and top with whatever you like – perhaps roast beef and grated horseradish?” Word to the wise, though: save a stash for brunch the next day.Got a culinary dilemma?
