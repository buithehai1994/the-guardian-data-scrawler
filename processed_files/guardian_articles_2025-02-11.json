Zelenskyy said he was ready to negotiate, but wanted Ukraine to do so from a “position of strength”, and said he would offer American companies lucrative reconstruction contracts and investment concessions to try to get Trump onside.“Those who are helping us to save Ukraine will [have the chance to] renovate it, with their businesses together with Ukrainian businesses. All these things we are ready to speak about in detail,” he said.Zelenskyy will travel to the Munich Security Conference later this week, where he expects to meet the US vice-president, JD Vance, one of the most hostile towards Ukraine among Trump’s inner circle. At last year’s conference, Vance, then a senator, refused to meet Zelenskyy, and he has previously said he does not “really care what happens to Ukraine, one way or the other”.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy being interviewed at the presidential administration in Kyiv.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianZelenskyy also plans to meet other members of Trump’s team as well as influential senators in Munich, but there is “not yet a date” to meet Trump himself, he said, although his team is working to fix one. Trump said over the weekend that he would “probably” meet Zelenskyy this week, and it is possible that the Ukrainian president could fly to Washington from Munich.“We are hoping that our teams will fix a date and a plan of meetings in the US; as soon as it is agreed, we are ready, I am ready,” he said.Zelenskyy switched between Ukrainian and English to make his points during the interview, conducted on Monday afternoon in a lavishly decorated room inside the heavily fortified administration building in central Kyiv.During the first phase of the full-scale invasion, his communication skills and passionate pleas were credited with forcing reluctant western leaders to back Ukraine with weapons and financial support. Now, in Trump, Zelenskyy faces a new challenge, with a major sceptic on continuing support for Kyiv becoming the leader of the country’s biggest ally.We are talking not only about security, but also about money …In a Fox News interview aired late on Monday, Trump said the US had spent hundreds of billions of dollars on Ukraine in recent years. “They may make a deal, they may not make a deal,they may be Russian some day,they may not be Russian some day, but we’re gonna have all this money in there and I said I want it back,” said Trump.It means that along with Zelenskyy’s oft-heard messages about the geopolitical and moral risks of allowingRussiato prevail in Ukraine, he has added some new ones, tailor-made for the US president. Most notable is the idea that the US will get priority access to Ukraine’s “rare earths”, a prospect that has piqued Trump’s interest enough for him to mention it several times in recent media appearances. Trump on Tuesday said he was dispatching US treasury secretary Scott Bessent to Ukraine, which was reported by Reuters to discuss rare earth mineral resources.Zelenskyy said he pitched this idea to Trump back in September, when the pair met in New York, and he intends to return with “a more detailed plan” about opportunities for US companies both in the reconstruction of postwar Ukraine and in the extraction of Ukrainian natural resources.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in September last year.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APUkraine has the biggest uranium and titanium reserves in Europe, said Zelenskyy, and it was “not in the interests of the United States” for these reserves to be in Russian hands and potentially shared with North Korea, China or Iran.But there was a financial incentive, too, he said: “We are talking not only about security, but also about money … Valuable natural resources where we can offer our partners possibilities that didn’t exist before to invest in them … For us it will create jobs, for American companies it will create profits.”Zelenskyy said it was crucial for Ukraine’s security that US military support continued, giving the example of US-made Patriot air defence systems. “Only Patriot can defend us against all kinds of missiles, only Patriots. There are other [European] systems … but they cannot provide full protection … So even from this small example you can see that without America, security guarantees cannot be complete,” he said.The first weeks of Trump’s presidency have given Ukrainians plenty to worry about. There was the global freeze on USAid projects, which in Ukrainetorpedoed hundreds of organisationsworking on everything from army veterans to schools and bomb shelters. Then, there was Trump’s admission in aninterviewwith the New York Post over the weekend that he had already spoken to Putin by telephone in an attempt to begin negotiations. When asked how many times, he said only: “I’d better not say.”Zelenskyy said it was “very important” that the US president met a Ukrainian delegation before meeting Putin, but stopped short of criticising Trump for his opaque statements. “Clearly he doesn’t really want everyone to know the details, and that’s his personal decision,” he said.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy hopes to have a meeting with Trump very soon.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianZelenskyy is used to treading carefully when it comes to Trump; soon after he was elected in 2019 he was reluctantlysucked into a US impeachment dramaover a phone call between the two presidents. Now, he again finds himself walking a diplomatic tightrope, with Ukraine’s survival potentially dependent on the US president’s decision to continue support.On the USAid freeze, Zelenskyy said: “We aren’t going to complain that some programmes have been frozen, because the most important thing for us is the military aid and that has been preserved, for which I’m grateful … If the American side has the possibility and desire to continue its humanitarian mission, we are fully for it, and if it doesn’t, then we will find our own way out of this situation.”Trump’s public pronouncements on Ukraine so far have been fragmented and often contradictory, but one theme that has prevailed is that while he wants to make a deal to end the war, Europe should be responsible for maintaining the peace afterwards. In response, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has floated the idea of a European peacekeeping force that could be deployed to Ukraine at some point after a ceasefire deal. Zelenskyy said such a mission would only work if it was deployed at scale.“When it comes to Emmanuel’s idea, if it’s part [of a security guarantee] then yes, if there will be 100-150,000 European troops, then yes. But even then we wouldn’t be at the same level of troops as the Russian army that is opposing us,” he said.Europe is still a long way from agreeing to deploy combat-ready troops to Ukraine, a move that Putin would be unlikely to agree to in negotiations, and Zelenskyy said a softer peacekeeping mission would be unlikely to work unless it came with guarantees that it would stand against Russia if Moscow resumed hostilities.View image in fullscreenZelenskyy: ‘Without America, security guarantees cannot be complete.’Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian“I will be open with you, I don’t think that UN troops or anything similar has ever really helped anyone in history. Today we can’t really support this idea. We are for a [peacekeeping] contingent if it is part of a security guarantee, and I would underline again that without America this is impossible,” he added.If Trump does manage to get Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table, Zelenskyy said he planned to offer Russia a straight territory exchange, giving up land Kyiv has held in Russia’s Kursk region since the launch of a surprise offensive there six months ago.“We will swap one territory for another,” he said, but added that he did not know which part of Russian-occupied land Ukraine would ask for in return. “I don’t know, we will see. But all our territories are important, there is no priority,” he said.As Zelenskyy turns his attention to Trump-whispering, he said it was still too early to pass judgment on the previous administration. Relations between Kyiv and Washington were said to be increasingly frosty as Zelenskyy’s team grew frustrated with Joe Biden’s focus on managing the risks of escalation.Asked whether he thought Biden would go down in history as the man who helped save Ukraine, or the man who responded too slowly to meet the challenge from Putin, Zelenskyy laughed and said it was “very difficult” to say at this stage.He criticised Biden’s initial unwillingness to provide Ukraine with weapons – “this lack of confidence gave confidence to Russia” – but said Ukraine was grateful for all the help that followed.The full evaluation, he said, would only emerge with time: “History shows that there are many things that you just don’t know, what happened behind the scenes, what negotiations there were … it’s hard to characterise it all today because we don’t know everything. Later we will know, we will know everything.”Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Let all hell break loose.”Netanyahu’s threat came as Trump hosted King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House on Tuesday for a tense meeting, where the two were to discuss the ceasefire and Trump’splan to “take over” Gazaand expel the region’s more than 2 million Palestinians. Trump has said that he could withhold aide from Jordan and Egypt, two US allies, unless they agree to his plan.In a quick back-and-forth with reporters before a closed-door meeting with Abdullah, Trump in effect endorsed an Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and said there was “no reason to buy Gaza” because “we’re going to take it”.Asked whether Saturday remained his deadline for Hamas to deliver all the hostages, Trump replied: “Yes.”It was not clear whether Netanyahu is also demanding that all 76 captives still held in Gaza be released, or just the three hostages scheduled for release on Saturday under the ceasefire. The prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for further information.But the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after more than 15 months of fighting that has killed just under 47,000 Palestinians and more than 1,700 Israelis is close to collapse.Since the deal was agreed, there have been persistent concerns over Netanyahu’s willingness to transition from the first to the second phase of the agreement: the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said he will quit Netanyahu’s coalition if the war does not restart after the first phase, which could force the prime minister to choose between his government and the deal.Israel’s Channel 12 reported that the cabinet agreed that if three hostages were released on Saturday, as planned, then Israel would continue to commit to the ceasefire.But in a sign that Israeli authorities may be preparing for hostilities to resume, Netanyahu also said on Tuesday evening that he had directed the Israeli army to increase reinforcements in the Gaza area “in preparation for various scenarios”.“In light of Hamas’s announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, last night I ordered the IDF to amass forces inside and around the Gaza Strip,” said Netanyahu. “This operation is being carried out at this time. It will be completed in the very near future.”Hamas on Monday said it would delay the release of Israeli hostages indefinitely over “violations” of the ceasefire deal, prompting Israel’s defence minister to put the country’s military on alert with orders to prepare for “any scenario in Gaza”.On Tuesday, Hamas had softened its stance, deriding Trump’s ultimatum and reiterating its commitment to a diplomatic solution to the crisis.Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said: “Trump must remember there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the [Israeli] prisoners. The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters.”In a statement late on Tuesday, Hamas reiterated that it was committed to the ceasefire deal, and claiming that Israel would be “responsible for any complications or delays.”The Israeli security cabinet meeting to discuss negotiations on the second phase of the deal was brought forward on Tuesday and lasted more than four hours.Smotrich, who voted against the ceasefire deal, appeared to support Trump’s comments. He wrote on X on Tuesday: “Everyone now.”A day earlier, the army cancelled all leave for soldiers in the Gaza division, a move suggesting it has become more likely that hostilities could resume.In Tel Aviv, protesters blocked roads on Monday night and Tuesday, demanding the return of all hostages, as some relatives accused the government of sabotaging the deal.Replying to reporters’ questions in the West Wing, Trump overturned decades of US policy on Israel by in effect endorsing the annexation of the West Bank. “I think that’s going to work out very well,” he said, adding that it would “work out automatically”. “It’s in good shape. We discussed it, other people are going to discuss it with me. West Bank is going to work out very well.”He also discussed his putative plan to “take over” Gaza and expel the Palestinians to neighbouring Jordan and Egypt.Reversing previous statements, Trump said that he was not prepared to buy Gaza, but that “we’re going to take it, we’re going to hold it, we’re going to cherish it.”Trump announced the Gaza plan late last week to the apparent surprise of Netanyahu and to his closest aides. Neither the Pentagon, nor the state department had made plans for a US military campaign or rebuilding effort in the Gaza Strip before Trump’s announcement.But the plan has angered Arab states, who have said that the decision would effectively scuttle another of Trump’s key goals: establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.Abdullah, who was sitting next to Trump, did not respond to questions about Trump’s plan to “take” Gaza. That would be discussed behind closed doors, he said, but said both sides should also “wait until the Egyptians can present ideas”.Later on Tuesday, Abdullah said that his country would take in 2,000 sick children from war-torn Gaza but pushed back against Trump’s plan to take over the territory.“I reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position. Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaHamasDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

And while the vast majority of the collection – over 5m records – has been made public, researchers estimate that 3,000 files haven’t been released, either in whole or in part.The FBI did not say in its statement what kind of information the newly discovered files contain. The FBI in 2020 opened a central records complex and began a years long effort to ship, electronically inventory and store closed case files from field offices across the country. The agency said a more comprehensive records inventory along with technological advances allowed it to quickly search and locate records.‘I came down here to die’: the untold story of the first JFK assassination attemptRead moreJefferson Morley, vice-president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination, called the FBI’s disclosure of the files “refreshingly candid”.“It shows that the FBI is serious about being transparent,” said Morley, who is also editor of the JFK Facts blog.Morley said it sets a precedent for other agencies to come forward with documents that haven’t yet been turned over to the National Archives.Trump’s order last month directed the national intelligence director and attorney general to develop a plan to release classified records related to Kennedy’s assassination. A spokesperson for the office of the director of national intelligence said that as required by the order, a release plan has been submitted, but offered no details about the plan or a timeline for when records may be made available to the public.The collection was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president. In his first term, Trump said he would allow the release of all of the remaining records but ended up holding some back due to potential harm to national security. And while files continued to be released under former presidentJoe Biden, some remain unseen.The assassination fueled conspiracy theories for decades. Kennedy was fatally shot in downtown Dallas as his motorcade passed in front of the Texas School Book Depository building, where 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. Two days after Kennedy was killed, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer.The Warren commission, established by then president Lyndon B Johnson to investigate the assassination, found that Oswald acted alone and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But that conclusion never quelled a web of alternative theories over the decades.Gerald Posner, author of Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK which concludes that Oswald acted alone, said it’s possible that the newly discovered files are repeats of documents that are already in the National Archives’ collection or they could be documents the review board for the collection had previously said it didn’t want.“If they are really new assassination documents, then it raises a whole bunch of questions about how they were missed for all of these years,” Posner said.He said the “wow” would be if they are related to Oswald or the investigation.The documents released over the past several years from the collection have offered details on the way intelligence services operated at the time, and include CIA cables and memos discussing visits by Oswald to the Soviet and Cuban embassies during a trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. The former Marine had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning home to Texas.Morley said the CIA’s surveillance of Oswald has been the “emerging story over the last five to 10 years”. He said there could be information on that in the new files.Explore more on these topicsJohn F KennedyFBIDonald TrumpJoe BidenUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing – and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn’t scalable or sustainable,” the statement said.“So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.”The decision to no longer acknowledge Black, LGBTQ+ and women’s holidays is another move on the growing list of changes that Google has made following the start ofDonald Trump’s second presidency.US immigration is gaming Google to create a mirage of mass deportationsRead moreThe tech behemoth recently announced that it would berolling back its previous commitmentto diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in its employment policies following the US president’s orders tocurb DEIin federal agencies in one of his first moves as president.Google also revealed in late January that users in the US would see the name of the Gulf of Mexico changed to the “Gulf of America” and that the company would start using the name “Mount McKinley” for the mountain in Alaska currently called Denali after executive orders fromTrump signedduring his first day in office.

The uncertainty, just over halfway into the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, complicates talks on the far more difficult second phase. It also jeopardises the pause in the devastating fighting and the increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza that the truce has made possible.Some analysts believe that Hamas initially made the concessions that helped bring about the ceasefire in part because it is sensitive to public opinion among Palestinians inGaza, and recognised that to continue the conflict could cause it lasting damage.The same holds true during the fragile ceasefire, with Hamas keen to get credit for continued calm and avoid blame in the event of a return to hostilities.That Hamasstill has a powerful presencein Gaza despite massive damage done in Israel’s offensive seems clear. Successive handovers of Israeli hostages have been carefully choreographed to showcase the militant group’s military power, but Hamas has also deployed hundreds of officials from the municipal authorities it still controls to clear rubble, rehabilitate clinics, reopen schools and monitor markets.Aid workers in Gaza report that many of their prewar contacts in the local administration are back in their posts.“Hamas are pretty visible on the streets. Police are back on the beat and patrolling main junctions. Ministries are also reopening. It’s like the war never happened in some ways,” said one senior UN official last week.But experts point out that the widespread presence of Hamas does not imply extensive support.“The level of control is not a measure of popularity,” saidHugh Lovatt,a specialist in Palestinian politics at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “We have polling data over the years and, though there are always caveats, there is still a consistent historical trend and that is that support for Hamas tends to hover around the mid-30s in percentage terms.”An unpublished survey conducted just before the ceasefire last month revealed an apparent decline in levels of support for Hamas, though it remains the most popular party in Gaza.The new survey, carried out by the Ramallah-basedPalestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research(PCPSR), asked people in the territory if they supported “very extreme actions” to protect and defend Palestine.“This was on a continuous scale and roughly 25% were above the midpoint in support of extreme violence, so a minority,” said Scott Atran, the anthropologist who oversaw the research.When asked what would be a “realistic and acceptable” ending to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, just under half of the population said some division of territory betweenIsraeland Palestine, either along the pre-1967 borders or those suggested by the UN in 1947, while slightly more than half preferred a dissolution of Israel, with a single Palestinian state under Islamic law the most preferred solution of all. The least preferred was a single democratic state with equal rights for Arabs and Jews.The survey also showed that a significant proportion feel that rule by Islamic law – a key part of the ideology of Hamas – is important and that around half believe that a military solution is more likely than a diplomatic solution. For most in Gaza too, the Palestinian-Israel conflict is primarily religious rather than political, the survey suggested.Atran said: “Hamas has only the support of a fifth of the population – a steep decline from a March 2024 PCPSR poll that showed majority support for Hamas in Gaza. In fact, the most frequent response on leadership was that no one truly represents the Palestinian people … So there is an evident leadership gap.“Yet, the survey also indicates that Gazans – women as much as men, old and young – are willing to sacrifice for their land and sovereignty, including to fight and die, even at the cost of their own family safety and security … or the promise of a better life elsewhere.”View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians making their way from central Gaza to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APA significant problem for researchers is that few in Gaza are prepared to openly criticise Hamas. The movement, which seized control of Gaza violently in 2007 after winning an election, has a long history of ruthless repression of dissidents.A poll by PCPSR releasedin Septembershows 39% in Gaza supported the attacks by Hamas into Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict, 32 percentage points lower than six months earlier. Hamas killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 250 in the attack, while the ensuing Israeli offensive cost the lives of more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and devastated swaths of the territory.“It is important to note that support for [the 2023 attack] does not necessarily mean support for Hamas and does not mean support for any killings or atrocities committed against civilians,” the PCPSR said, pointing out that up to 90% of respondents “believe that Hamas … did not commit the atrocities depicted in videos taken on that day”.Instead, the pollsters said, support for the 2023 attack was motivated by how the attack had focused regional and global attention on Palestinian grievances.The poll also found that 36% in Gaza chose “armed struggle” as the most effective way to end Israeli occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state, the lowest level since September 2022. Hamas was the preferred political party of 35% of respondents, down slightly.In the immediate aftermath of the ceasefire last month, some residents expressed pride that Hamas had survived the onslaught.“Name me one country that could withstand Israel’s war machine for 15 months,” said Salah Abu Rezik, a 58-year-old factory worker. He praised Hamas for helping to distribute aid to hungry people in Gaza during the conflict and trying to enforce a measure of security, describing Hamas as “an idea” that could not be killed.But others voiced anger that Hamas’s attack had brought destruction to Gaza.What do Hamas delay and Trump threat mean for Gaza ceasefire deal?Read more“We had homes and hotels and restaurants. We had a life. Today we have nothing, so what kind of a victory is this? When the war stops, Hamas must not rule Gaza alone,” said Ameen, 30, a Gaza City civil engineer, who was living in Khan Younis.To prevent such views spreading further, Hamas will need to divert blame if the ceasefire collapses.One accusation made by Hamas on Monday was that Israel was deliberately hindering the entry of stipulated amounts of aid, such as 60,000 mobile houses and 200,000 tents, as well as heavy machinery to remove rubble, and fuel. Help with the humanitarian crisis and reconstruction is a priority for most in Gaza. Israel denies the charge.Lovatt said successive polls among Palestinians showed that “there would always be space for a conservative, Islamist-leaning party” in Gaza and the occupied West Bank too.“So even if you get rid of Hamas or it moderates further then there is potentially a segment of this Islamist support base which will look for a new political home,” he said.“If you exile or kill the leadership, you are not addressing the challenge of this limited if substantial conservative Islamist base. If you want a credible political track you need to integrate that constituency.”Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Thanks to the wealth of wiki knowledge out there, you can get the gist pretty quickly. There’s a dude with magical powers, fearsome pectorals (and the platinum hair of a Finnish metal band lead singer) named the Witcher, AKA Geralt (voiced here by Doug Cockle); he wanders around a medieval-ish countryside battling monsters, partly for hire and partly out of the goodness of his own gruff heart. He’s like a ronin or a knight or TV-show amateur detective of the Lovejoy vintage, but with a sword. Geralt’s wisecracking sidekick Jaskier (Joey Batey) is cowardly and comical, and plays a lute-like instrument on which he performs ballads celebrating Geralt’s heroics. We also meet (mostly in flashback) Geralt’s on-off romantic partner Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) who can visit his dreams in order to flirt with him, but she’s less of a big deal here than in other Witcher products.Instead, Geralt and Jaskier wash up in a seaside kingdom where merpeople and regular humans are at loggerheads because the humans keep decimating the oyster beds in search of pearls. Shockingly, they don’t make use of the oysters as food, which depletes food sources for the various fantasy animals the merpeople feel are their buddies because they all live in the sea together. It’s the equivalent of a post-colonial western where the merfolk are the Native Americans and the humans are rapacious land-grabbing whites. But the script also threads in a star-crossed lovers’ story involving a mer-princess and a dopey human prince which plays out like a blend of Romeo and Juliet and The Little Mermaid. Plus, because no gen-Z skewed animation would be complete without a trans subtext, there’s a bit of that too at the end.That said, all the biology and gender stuff is quite confusing here because at one point the mer-girl and human-boy fall out and she says she liked him better when they only “fucked and didn’t talk” – but then a big fuss is made about how they can’t marry because they couldn’t consummate their union, given the genital incompatibilities of fishy mer-bodies and human ones. Clearly, it’s best not to overthink any of this.Like The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, an earlier feature animation also onNetflix, this was made at a Korean animation outfit called Studio Mir who do a pretty bang-up job of pitching the look between the prevailing animation styles of Europe and Asia, to create something highly exportable to every continent. Movements are very fluid, but expressions limited and there are buckets of cartoon gore, in a deep ruddy red that recalls mass-produced tonalities of fake Persian carpets.The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep is on Netflix from 11 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFilm adaptationsScience fiction and fantasy filmsNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

Such incidents are commonplace for officers and rarely garner much furore. But this particular case has captured the attention of football fans around the world.Sam Kerr, the captain of the Australian women’s football team and Chelsea’s star striker, was at the centre of the incident in the early hours of 30 January 2023. When the charge of racially aggravated harassment was filed against her last year, the hearts of many sports fans around the world sank.Sam Kerr trial: conduct of police was ‘completely unacceptable’, defence claimsRead moreBut as more details emerged, specifically the revelation that she was being dragged through British courts for calling a Metropolitan police officer “fucking stupid and white”, the picture became more complex.Over the weekend, before Kerr wascleared of the charge on Tuesday, the Australian sports minister, Anika Wells, publicly backed the footballer, saying she had the nation “behind her”.At the heart of the case was a question around privilege and who, on that night, held it. On paper, the answer was Kerr, who is one of the best-known and highest-paid female footballers in the world.However, in the course of her exchange with PC Stephen Lovell, Kerr felt her fame and fortune meant less than her race and gender that night. Officers refused to believe her claims of being “held hostage” in a cab and instead accused her of wrongdoing.Kerr and her partner, Kristie Mewis, had been on a night out in London before they hailed a taxi home. The court heard that Kerr had been sick in the cab and a dispute began over paying for cleaning costs.After this, they claim they were locked in the taxi, which begun speeding and swerving, leaving them feeling “terrified” for their lives. They feared they were being kidnapped or could die in a crash.The situation soon went southThis led to Mewis smashing the taxi’s window in an attempt to escape. Unbeknownst to the couple, the taxi driver had rung the police during the journey and was told to drive to Twickenham police station.When the taxi parked outside the station, Kerr crawled out of the broken window and opened the car door from the outside to let Mewis out. The pair approached a marked police car and described feeling “relieved” when they came into contact with officers. The situation soon went south.After telling officers about their alleged ordeal, their claims were quickly dismissed.Kerr described feeling “antagonised” by officers and said her treatment was a “racial fucking thing”. She also asked them to “believe women for once” and made several references to Sarah Everard,who was abducted and murderedby a police officer in London in March 2021.During the exchanges, Lovell called Kerr “little Missy” and said: “Do you think a taxi driver that was going to rape and kill you would drive you to a police station? No.” After this, she called him “sick” and a “white privileged man”.At one point, an officer asked Lovell whether Kerr, Mewis and the taxi driver were all “getting nicked”, to which he responded: “He’s not getting nicked.”Kerr’s lawyer, Grace Forbes, called the conduct of police and their failure to take the couple’s claims seriously “completely unacceptable”. She said Kerr and Mewis had described allegations of dangerous driving and false imprisonment against the driver. No further inquiries were made into their claims.On the night, Kerr and Mewis told officers they had called police from inside the taxi. Officers doubted their assertion, saying they had no record of their call. The couple said the call handlers hung up on them, which Lovell said “they wouldn’t do”. In the course of the trial however, it emerged that the pair did call emergency services and the operator said they would call back. When they did, the couple were in the police station and the call went to voicemail.At various points in the exchange, Kerr showed Lovell her bank account and made reference to lawyers. Kerr told the court that she tried to make a show of her privilege to make “myself feel protected” because she felt “powerless” in the situation.It was after Lovell doubted Kerr’s assertion she had called police for a second time that she called him “fucking stupid and white” which prompted her arrest. A short while after this, she came into contact with a female officer and broke down sobbing because she felt like “someone was going to finally help us”.0:38Sam Kerr seen leaving court during racially aggravated harassment trial – videoThe case is likely to spark a wider debate about free speech and race, particularly around how people of colour can express their opinions and grievances. In the UK, there has been a number of high-profile cases involving people of colour being charged with a racially aggravated public order offence. Kerr, whose father was born in India, identifies as White-Anglo-Indian.Marieha Hussain, a British Asian woman, was charged with such an offence last May for depicting former UK prime minister Rishi Sunak and former home secretary Suella Braverman as coconuts at a pro-Palestine rally.She was found not guilty months later.Last March, a Black man wasacquittedafter being charged with racially aggravated malicious communications for sending a raccoon emoji to a Black Conservative politician on social media.Unlike in those cases where comments were directed at other people of colour, Kerr, aimed her words at a white man.Despite mainstream discussion in recent years about race, power and privilege based on skin colour, Kerr’s high-profile trial shows that, in the UK at least, these debates have had little bearing on the law.Or, as prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones told the court: “The law does not discriminate between different races when it comes to racist language.”Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

MPs scratch heads over Trump’s latest moveJohn CraceIgnore the issue? Praise the president? Blame the opposition? No one in the Commons has a clue how to deal with looming US tariffs on steelTue 11 Feb 2025 14.08 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 14.11 ESTShareSee no evil. Hear no evil. Speak no evil. Hide under the duvet and hope the world forgets you exist.Up until now, the UK government’s strategy for dealing with President Trump has worked out pretty much OK. Wherever possible, do nothing to create waves. To be ignored is very heaven.Even when pushed, still do nothing. Except fall over yourself to say how brilliant The Donald has been. No flattery can ever be too much. The president’s plan to turn Gaza into a leisure resort was brilliant.Keir Starmercouldn’t believe no one had thought of that before. Or rather he could believe it because only Trump could aspire to that level of genius.Only it turns out that crawling doesn’t get you everywhere. Because in the past 24 hours, the US has said it will impose 25% tariffs on steel imports. With no exemptions for the UK. So what happens now? Take it on the chin? Thank you so much, Mr President. It was so kind of you not to set the tariffs any higher. Or fight fire with fire? Impose reciprocal sanctions.There were just 25 MPs in the Commons – including the frontbench teams of the three main parties – to try to discover the answers at the urgent question tabled by the shadow trade minister, Harriett Baldwin. Maybe a trade war just doesn’t interest politicians any more. Or maybe, like the government, everyone was doing their best to pretend that nothing much had really happened. Noises off. Much ado about nothing.The junior trade minister,Douglas Alexander, certainly gave the impression that, given the choice, he would also rather have been doing something else. This was definitely not the kind of day he had returned to frontline politics for after a gap of nearly a decade.“Cool heads” were the order of the day, he insisted. Now was not the time for a kneejerk reaction. The tariffs weren’t due to come into force until 12 March so there was no need to panic. In fact, he couldn’t really believe the Tories had bothered to raise the issue. So very tiresome of them.Maybe everything would just go back to normal if we went back to ignoring the situation. Maybe The Donald had a master plan. You never could tell. So really the best course of action for the government was to maintain its silence. The markets hadn’t been spooked by the threat of tariffs and neither should we. It was hard to tell if there was an act of geopolitical creativity or one of craven nihilism.“We want a stable trade policy with the US,” Dougie continued. I suppose we are all allowed to dream.He concluded his opening remarks by saying he hoped to work constructively with Trump. To somehow find a way of letting The Donald know he had been absolutely right to impose trade tariffs on the UK – it was exactly in the interests of both countries and the government couldn’t have been more thrilled not to have been made exempt.However, there was a small risk, the tiniest risk, of causing inflation in the US and losing jobs in industries that relied on steel. Much as had happened in 2018. Not that that had been a bad thing. It had been a very good thing. Just what the US economy had needed. But still something to think about. If the president did want to think. We were easy either way.By the time Dougie had sat down for the first time, no one was any the wiser what the government planned to do about tariffs. Which meant Alexander had done his job perfectly. He wasn’t just keeping everyone guessing. He was keeping himself guessing. He genuinely doesn’t have a clue what to do.But then – as became abundantly clear when listening to the pitiful unhappy few who had made the effort to turn up to the UQ – no one else did either. Least of all Harriett. She has built her parliamentary career on not knowing much about anything.Her analysis, if you can call it that, was that the tariffs were a direct result of Starmer not having flown to the US for a one-to-one meeting with The Donald. It didn’t seem to have occurred to her that you generally need an invitation to the White House. Turning up and banging on the door doesn’t tend to cut it.No matter. Baldwin was adamant that Trump wouldn’t have imposed tariffs if we had been even nicer to him than we already had been. Even though he had done it to the UK when the Tories had been in power. Harriett is dim enough to think this is a good thing. Somehow makes Trump look stronger and more powerful. Why don’t we all have more trade wars?“We must strain every sinew for the big, beautiful free trade deal,” she rhapsodised. Now she was out the other side of the looking-glass. What free trade deal was that? The one the Tories had tried and failed to get after the Brexit referendum. This was just fantasy. In what world did anyone imagine The Donald would respond to calm and logic. That’s to misread his psyche. The whole point of him is that he’s narcissistic and whimsical. There is a mind-body split. The words pour out of his mouth with no connection to the brain.Dougie sat and stared. It had finally dawned on him that he was looking at an idiot. Let him try to correct a few points. There was no trade deal. And there was no one for the government to talk to about tariffs in the US as the Senate had not yet confirmed Trump’s trade representatives. Plus, it was a bit much for the Tories to make such a fuss as they had presided over the decline of the steel industry.That left the few remaining MPs to add their thoughts. Liam Byrne asked for a moment’s silence and for us all to remember Peter Mandelson in our prayers. He would be needing all the help we could offer. Stella Creasy suggested we might like to strengthen our ties with the EU. Alexander looked horrified. Careless talk costs lives. Julian Lewis wondered if we ditched the Chagos deal then we might persuade the US to ditch the tariffs. It’s a thought.The Donald traded in uncertainty, said Dougie. And he, for one, loved him for it. Trump was perfect just the way he was. Everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. There were still four weeks. Lie back. Relax. It may never happen.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchDonald TrumpTrade policyKeir StarmerSteel industryDouglas AlexandercommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a troubling portrait of masculinity, but one which offers hopeLucy ManganTue 11 Feb 2025 18.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 18.37 ESTShareChristine Yoo’s intelligent, compassionate and deeply moving film, 26.2 to Life: Inside the San Quentin Prison Marathon, follows some of the inmates of the California maximum-security facility. The men, most of whom are serving life sentences, are preparing to run 100-odd laps of the heavily guarded prison yard, along a barely marked track, weaving in and out of prisoners who do not know or care to stay out of their way. All of them are subject at any time to a minor or major lockdown that will interrupt or even cancel the race for which they have trained all year. They can wear non-prison-issue clothes to run in, but their shoes are the property of the state and have to be booked in and out by each man at every session.The 1000 Mile Club, as the runners are known, are trained by a group of volunteers led by Franklin Ruona, an experienced marathon man himself. A naturally quiet and watchful soul, he doesn’t talk to the men about their crimes unless they want to. His view is that they are people who have not had his luck or advantages: “I just feel like I am my brother’s keeper,” he says. In the febrile prison atmosphere, he is an oasis of calm.Yoo focuses on a handful of Frank’s charges, cutting between the unfolding race and the unfolding of their stories in a way that shows how much discipline running has brought to their lives, and the meaning it has given to their years inside – even those with virtually no prospect of release. But as they pound time after time around the dusty yard, it also illustrates the waste and futility of the actions that brought them to this point. Yoo interviews the prisoners in their cells about their backstories and their crimes – murder and manslaughter, generally with many years’ “enhancements” added on for the use of guns – and we are asked to contextualise, but not forgive (especially when Yoo goes beyond the prison walls to interview inmates’ family members). That said, it is clear that, as in most documentaries of this ilk, we are being told only one version of each story; we do not hear anything from the victims.Nevertheless, the profound and systemic poverty, the endemic drug trade and violence in certain cities all over the US remains extraordinary. Most of the men talk about growing up with violent or drug-addicted parents, and not knowing what to do with their anger as they grew up. It is as much a portrait of masculinity as the straitening it represents – the repression, the emotional illiteracy, the sheer loneliness of it, which explodes outwards and hands on misery to other men and often to the wives, girlfriends and other women in their way.Inside San Quentin’s marathon club: ‘For that day they are runners, not criminals’Read moreAnd yet, there is earned hope here. In Rahsaan, originally sentenced to 55-to-life for second degree murder, but gradually returning to his roots as a child who was a computer whiz and in the gifted class at school, and throwing himself into work as a mentor, journalist and participant in non-profit news organisation the Marshall Project. In Tommy Wickerd (“Bullshit is what I believed in,” he says of his swastika tattoos), who is working hard towards his GED and repairing the damage his incarceration has done to his son. In Markelle “the Gazelle” Taylor, the child of a horrifically abusive stepfather, a talented high-school athlete (his participation in the San Quentin Marathon theoretically qualifies him for the Boston marathon), whose early experiences turned him into a violent drunk whose involvement in the death of a premature baby is hard to consider with equanimity.There are points – during Markelle’s account of his crimes, for instance – where you feel 26.2 to Life has a moral duty to push harder, that it is in danger of letting the uplifting narrative (the power of sport to unite men, the Corinthian spirit finding its way into the prison yard) exert too strong a pull. But in the main, it stays clear-eyed and crosses the finish line in fine form.26.2 to Life: Inside the San Quentin Prison Marathon aired on BBC Four in the UK and is on iPlayer now.

Five Australian wedding celebrants reveal what the job has taught them about modern romanceGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailKatie StrickTue 11 Feb 2025 15.15 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 17.57 ESTShareAwedding-obsessed primary school teacher riding the rollercoaster of online dating. A queer youth worker looking for a slow-burn relationship offline. A divorced TV presenter hoping for a second shot at love.These are some of the young Australians navigating the world of apps, ghosting and modern romance in 2025 – all of whom also happen to be registered celebrants officiating weddings for loved-up couples in their spare time.The number of registered marriage celebrants in Australia has shot up by 20% since 2018, according to the Attorney General’s Department, as demand for non-religious weddings and civil ceremonies grows. There are now more than10,000 commonwealth-registered marriage celebrantsin Australia and it’s not just retired schoolteachers and married sixtysomethings taking up the work as a side hustle or full-time job.“Celebrants are diverse,” says Debbie Payne, chair of The Celebrants Network. These days, you’ll find twenty- and thirtysomething celebrants conducting ceremonies in shorts, drag and cowboy boots – and maybe even taking to the dancefloor afterwards if they’re one of the increasing number offering DJ services too.So what can conducting weddings for a living teach you about your own love life? We speak to five single celebrants on the frontline.‘Everyone assumes you have your love life sorted ’Melanie Jacklyn, 32, primary school teacher from Sydney who became a celebrant in 2023View image in fullscreenMelanie Jacklyn officiates the wedding of Emily and Liam Scurr.Photograph: Hayley Morgan PhotographyI’ve always been obsessed with weddings, so becoming a celebrant felt like a perfect side hustle when I decided to go part-time from teaching. My then boyfriend and I broke up a few months into the job and I do think marrying other couples played a part. He was a great partner but I’d watch couples take their vows and say these amazing things to each other and something in me knew he wasn’t the right person for me for ever. Life is long and life is hard – you need to say your vows and mean it. If it’s not a hell yes, then it’s a no.It’s funny how everyone assumes you have your love life sorted as a celebrant. But the truth is the ghosting and the woes of modern dating are still the same. It hasn’t helped me understand the single male mind at all.The moment I knew: we were rehearsing a difficult dance move – and I caught her head before she hit the floorRead moreSome men I date love that I have my own business, while others are intimidated – and for me that’s the easiest red flag in the world. I’m proud of being a celebrant. People don’t realise how much work goes into it: the year of studying, meeting with couples, creating a bespoke ceremony, asking all the right questions.The reward is being up there next to two people during the most intimate moment of their lives. I love watching all the other moments of connection in the room: the bridesmaid seeing her BFF get married, the daughters watching their parents finally say “I do”. It’s easy to feel alone as a single person at a wedding but being a celebrant has taught me that friendship and familial love are just as important as romantic love.‘Slow-burn relationships are hot’Shan Mann, 27, youth workshop facilitator from Melbourne who qualified as a celebrant in 2022View image in fullscreen‘I had lots of intense, whirlwind relationships before becoming a celebrant,’ Shan Mann says.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianCelebrants in their 20s, particularly queer ones, are a rare breed.I call it my love project, marrying couples in my spare time. I qualified in 2022 and the first wedding I facilitated was for friends of friends in a gorgeous old butter factory in Victoria. I’d hired my own PA system and, five minutes before the ceremony, I turned it on and there was this horrible screeching sound. It completely threw off my sense of zen.Then I remembered it was about the couple, not me, and within five minutes it was as though I’d taken drugs. That moment, when I look at these two people and we all breathe together – it’s one of the most ecstatic, transformative things I get to do.It’s also been an incredible discovery process for my own love life. I had lots of intense, whirlwind relationships before becoming a celebrant. Since then I’ve realised that kind of love isn’t sustainable. Slow-burn relationships are hot among the couples I’ve married – many of them were friends before becoming lovers – and that’s been transformative for my own relationships: that idea of platonic love and how it can grow. At the end of the day, you need someone you can be joyful and have a laugh with.I’m not against dating apps but I’ve reached a beautiful place now where most of my romantic encounters are organic – mostly on the dancefloor, but not when I’m working, of course.‘It ended up pulling me through that dark period’Glenn Millanta, 46, actor and TV presenter from Sydney who qualified as a celebrant in 2017View image in fullscreenGlenn Millanta (right) with groom Zac Brookes.Photograph: Henry BrodbeckBecoming a celebrant felt like a perfect combination of my skills as a TV presenter, actor, public speaker and creative. I was married with three kids when I first qualified. I remember driving home from weddings, wishing the things these gushing couples were saying to each other were things my then wife would say to me. It was a lonely time: we tried couples counselling and I fought to keep the family together but in the end we let the marriage go.I was still working as a celebrant during the divorce so I had to rely on my acting skills. After one wedding I remember sitting in a gutter and crying for about 40 minutes. It was devastating but in a strange way I think it ended up pulling me through that dark period because it combined everything I do best: helping couples to write their vows, working the crowd, injecting a bit of fun into ceremonies – like asking guests to share their best marriage advice. It felt like a divine calling.I’ve married everyone from a former Miss Australia to AFL star Luke Breust over the last eight years and hearing their stories has meant I’ve never once given up on love. My oldest child recently said to me: “Daddy, I really want you to have a girlfriend now”– and after two years off, I think I am ready.Just because I didn’t get the love story I wanted the first time around, it doesn’t mean I won’t have that one day. I’ve just had to accept that it might be different to the traditional setup I always pictured.‘I’m not looking for anything short of earth-shattering love’Jas Kerry, 37, broadcast producer from Sydney who qualified as a celebrant in 2024View image in fullscreenJas Kerry conducts the wedding ceremony of Lexi and Matt.Photograph: Liam JonMy housemate and I both marry couples in our spare time and it’s fun to come home and compare the stories we hear on the celebrant circuit: brides coming into their ceremonies on boats; couples making their guests wait in the rain for two hours while the weather passes; grooms walking out at the altar. As a celebrant, you have to be ready for anything.I’ve been single for the last seven years and becoming a celebrant has definitely made me more realistic about dating. It’s exposed me to new people and new relationship dynamics: one couple had a 15-year age gap and were a beautiful example of a blended family. It’s given me hope that relationships can come about at any time in life and they’re not always a perfect formula.No, being single doesn’t make me miserable. It’s the key to living my best life | Jill StarkRead moreHaving said that, I’m not looking for anything short of earth-shattering love – that’s the point I’ve reached now. It’s not that I’m looking for movie perfection. It’s just got to be absolutely fantastic for me to sacrifice all the absolutely fantastic things that are already in my life.I was never that girl yearning to walk down the aisle but, if I find myself in a relationship in the future, it won’t be getting married that makes me feel at peace; it’ll be the day-to-day commitment.‘I do sometimes wonder what I’m missing out on’Aaron McDonnell, 36, government relations manager from Melbourne who qualified as a celebrant in 2018View image in fullscreenAaron McDonnell with bride Courtney Brown and groom Jarrett Miller.Photograph: Corinna & Dylan PhotographyWhen I give advice to a couple during a ceremony, I always caveat it with something self-deprecating about being hopelessly single. I can hardly dictate what love is and tell couples not to pack up when things get tough when all I have is one failed five-and-a-half-year relationship.My ceremonies are fun and nontraditional. I’ve done 10-person weddings in the snow. I’ve married a butcher and his wife in his butchery, which stunk. I’ve done one in a hot air balloon; others in Italy and Thailand. Sometimes, I slip up, like the time I told a crowd we were there to “witness Ryan and Sarah make love”, or another where I said I was marrying “Shaun and Porn” instead of “Shaun and Paul” – I’m lucky my crowds have always taken it well.Sometimes it’s only when I have a quiet moment after a wedding that I realise how important my job is. I cried on the way home from one recently – I’d found out the groom had been diagnosed with cancer only three weeks before.I became a celebrant the year after my only relationship had ended and it’s funny: I write beautiful wedding scripts but, when it comes to romantic love and intimacy in my own life, I’m not looking for it. I do sometimes look at this amazing journey people are on and wonder what I’m missing out on but I’m at peace with that. I’m happy being single.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleMarriageFamilyRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At various points in the last few months, experienced prognosticators have offered upConclave,Wicked,A Complete Unknown,September 5,The BrutalistorEmilia Pérezas their pick, the race shifting with the smallest shred of new intel.Last month’s Golden Globes, which saw Emilia Pérez and The Brutalist win the major film awards and then theOscar nominations, also led by the same two titles, seemed to firm up a clearer two-horse race. But the films were unusual Oscar bets to say the least. One a crime musical about a trans cartel boss and the other a three-hour-plus drama about architecture, both featuring languages other than English, both with smaller budgets than the Academy tends to reward. Even though we had more tea leaves to read, it felt difficult to passionately anoint either as a surefire thing.‘They chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her’: has the Emilia Pérez backlash gone too far?Read moreBut then the past weekend showed us why such reticence had been hard to shake asSean Baker’s frenetic comedyAnorasurprised most with a trio of major wins. First on Friday night, it took home best picture at the Critics Choice awards and then on Saturday it won the top prize at the Producers Guild awards before Baker won best director at the Directors Guild awards.While the first is not as much of an important precursor (past winners have been similar but there are more deviations than usual from Roma to The Power of the Dog to Boyhood), PGA and DGA do tend to provide a clearer sign of where we’re heading. Since it started back in 1989, the winner of the PGA award for best theatrical motion picture has mirrored the eventual best picture Oscar winner in all but 10 ceremonies (1917, La La Land, The Big Short and Little Miss Sunshine were the four most recent occasions). Similarly, the winner of the DGA award for outstanding directing of a feature film has only clashed eight times (Argo’s Ben Affleck being the last, and most famous, example).View image in fullscreenMark Eydelshteyn and Mikey Madison in Anora.Photograph: APBefore this weekend, some had started to prematurely position Anora as a potential bridesmaid of the season, having left both theGolden Globesand the Gothams without a single award (if Anora wins best picture it would be only the sixth time since 1975 that a film without a single Globe achieves this). Even at Friday’s Critics Choice awards, the film hadn’t won a single award throughout the night until it walked away with best picture at the very end. StarMikey Madison, who plays the titular character, had been seen as a potential best actress frontrunner – the film is dominated by her brash breakout performance as a sex worker swept off her feet – but it had seemed the race was favouring comeback queenDemi MooreforThe Substanceor perhaps Fernanda Torres forI’m Still Here, further proof of the Academy’s increasingly international voting base. Madison might still be unable to stop either train (a woman under 30 hasn’t won the award since 2016 and her ingenue narrative is perhaps less alluring and textured than her main competition) but Anora is a film that rests entirely on the shoulders of herself and writer-director Baker, making it hard to see how at least one of them doesn’t get swept up too. Baker would be the more likely here, nominated as writer, director, producer, as well as editor, a win representing a slow embrace for an unconventional Oscar talent (pre-Anora, his movies had netted just one nomination to date – The Florida Project’s Willem Dafoe for best supporting actor).If he or the film wins, it would further reflect how a younger, more diverse voting base are still tweaking if not exactly redefining what an Oscar movie now is (this is the post-Oppenheimer year after all). The best director nominees this year exclude many of the bigger players – Wicked’s Jon M Chu, Dune: Part Two’sDenis Villeneuve– and focus more on those who did a lot with a little (Anora’s budget was $6m, The Brutalist cost $10m and The Substance was made for $17.5m). The actingnominees also snubbedprevious A-list winners such as Nicole Kidman, Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie in the place of 13 first-timers.While, from afar, a film like Emilia Pérez might have seemed like a choice that would reflect a more progressive base – it’s quickly become one of the most reviled Oscar contenders in years. A film about a trans woman in Mexico has been rejected by many trans people and many Mexicans as well as by critics, with the film scoring the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating out of this year’s crop. The LGBTQ+ advocacy group Glaadcalledit “a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and said it represented “a step backward” for representation, while the film has beenaccusedof perpetuating Mexican stereotypes. Its deceptive success at the Golden Globes shows that, despite some structural improvements with who votes for the awards, the Globes are gonna keep Globesing regardless (this year also saw Pamela Anderson nominated over Marianne Jean-Baptiste).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It might not affect supporting actress nominee Zoe Saldaña, who is still favourite in her category, but it’s had an undeniable impact on the film’s overall chances, with Gascón removed from both the campaign trail and any “for your consideration” advertising. Those voters who may have seen an Emilia Pérez vote as a force for social good might now be less sure and so many have been considering where those votes might now go. There’s an argument to be made for Wicked, another musical that embraces inclusivity with a positive message, but Anora could also fill the gap in a different way. It’s another Cannes-premiering female-led film made on a shoestring budget (about $15m less than Emilia Pérez) that represents the bold vision of a film-maker who is finally getting wider recognition after a number of impressive indies. While bigger, male-led films such as Oppenheimer will always remain in the race, victory for Anora would fall in line with what’s become more of the best picture norm, a smaller film that could (Parasite’s budget was $11m, Coda’s was $10m and Nomadland’s was $5m) with a female lead (Nomadland, Coda, Everything Everywhere All at Once, The Shape of Water).With odds now dramatically slashed, Anora has become the betting favourite for best picture but with the Oscars not taking place until 2 March, we’ll have to wait and see if Sean Baker’s Cinderella story gets its happy ending.Explore more on these topicsAnoraOscarsSean BakerAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week in tech:Elon Muskand Donald Trump flood the zone and deploy brinkmanship as a negotiating tactic; USImmigrationand Customs Enforcement learns search engine optimization amid arrests and deportations; and Spotify tries to soften its algorithmic image with human-centric public relations. Thank you for reading.Flood the zone: Trump has executive orders; Musk has DogeDonald Trump has issued a record number of executive orders since his presidency began: ending birthright citizenship, banning gender transitions for anyone under 19, pardoning the rioters of the January 6 attack, and more. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man in charge of the “department of government efficiency”, has raided an equally dizzying swath of federal agencies with the stated goal of “slashing waste, fraud, and abuse”. Among the half-dozen bureaus are the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Education, Department of Labor and, most viciously, the US Agency for International Development (USAid). Trump and Musk are doing their utmost to “flood the zone” – a tactic that the former Trump administration strategist Steve Bannon hastoutedas one that will purposefully overwhelm the opposition and the media. Bannon is right; it’s tough to keep up.Trump and Musk share a flair for brinkmanship. They force their opponents to accept a version of what they want by forcing negotiations to the point of mutually assured destruction, then retreating. Trump declared he would use executive orders to impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported to the US from Mexico and Canada, enormous penalties to exact from the country’s two biggest trading partners that threaten to send all three economies into tailspins. However, Trump delayed the tariffs a month after Canada and Mexico each agreed to staff up their borders with the US with 10,000 troops.Musk preaches that he’s dissolvingUSAid. He might yet – the agency’s name has been taken off its door – but the likelier outcome seems like a diminished version of the agency will be folded into the state department. Secretary of state Marco Rubio has declared himself head of the agency as workers are locked out. Musk’s fingerprints were visible on the “fork in the road” email received by all 2 million employees of the US government. Will they all resign, evacuating and disabling the government? Extremely improbable. Does a partial buyout of a workforce achieve the same result as a layoff? Yes.Musk has used this playbook many times before, most notably with X, née Twitter. He yanked office leases so fast that the company failed to pay rent it still owed. He fired about three-quarters of the workforce and left the question of severance to the courts after some ex-employees sued. It seems inevitable Musk will owe less after negotiating payouts via lawsuits. The edgy approach hasn’t always worked out for Musk, though. With X, he tweeted often about how bad the social network was to gain attention, threatened to buy it, signed a contract for the $44bn purchase, then did his best to pull out of the agreement. He was forced to go through with it, though, and acknowledged X was overvalued in a recent interview. When a judge invalidated his $56bn pay package at Tesla, he said he would consider walking away from the company without the compensation. The judge didn’t blink and ruled his pay excessive a second time. Musk has neither left Tesla, nor does he have an existing pay package.Silicon Valley software companies like to say they move fast and break things, iterating their products in service of innovation. I would call what Elon Musk does moving so fast he might break everything. It seems to be one of the things Trump likes best about him. The president himself is not so different. Remember when the USalmost went to war with Iran? He called off airstrikes while the planes were in the air.Musk’s next target seems to be Medicare and Medicaid. What will break there, and who will it break?Read about who is helping Elon Musk lay waste to the US governmenthere.The logical end of SEO: a mirage of deportations in Google search resultsThere are several ways to gameGooglesearch to boost a website to the top of the results page, the most valuable real estate on the internet. In fact, a whole field is built around it called search engine optimization, or SEO. Google’s algorithm works by looking at various factors on a webpage to determine if it is relevant and authoritative. Government web domains already get authoritative bonus points.View image in fullscreenLaw enforcement walk with Leonardo Fabian Cando Juntamay as he was detained in the Bronx during ICE led operations to apprehend illegal immigrants on 28 January 2025 in New York, NY.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesSEO tactics are in the hands of every middling recipe blogger in the United States, why wouldn’t the government know about them? US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) updated thousands of press releases on 24 January, making old press releases seem new in Google search results, befuddling a longtime immigration lawyer’s search for enforcement actions.My colleague Dara Kerrreports:News of mass immigration arrests has swept across the US over the past couple of weeks. Reports from Massachusetts to Idaho have described agents from Ice spreading through communities and rounding people up. Quick Google searches for Ice operations, raids and arrests return a deluge of government press releases. Headlines include ICE arrests 85 during 4-day Colorado operation, New Orleans focuses targeted operations on 123 criminal noncitizens and, in Wisconsin, ICE arrests 83 criminal aliens.But a closer look at these Ice reports tells a different story.That four-day operation in Colorado? It happened in November 2010. The 123 people targeted in New Orleans? That was February of last year. Wisconsin? September 2018. There are thousands of examples of this throughout all 50 states – Ice press releases that have reached the first page of Google search results, making it seem like enforcement actions just happened, when in actuality they occurred months or years ago. Some, such as the arrest of “44 absconders” in Nebraska, go back as far as 2008.All the archived Ice press releases soaring to the top of Google search results were marked with the same timestamp and read: “Updated: 01/24/2025”.Read the full storyhere.Spotify plays up the human side of its recommendations while going big on AI featuresBjörk recently calledSpotify“probably the worst thing that has happened to musicians. The streaming culture has changed an entire society and an entire generation of artists.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joan Cros/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockHow to counter such bad publicity as the doyen of experimental music deriding your company? Spotify was ready, though. The company had been on the charm offensive in advance of its sunny earnings report last week, when itposted its first-ever full-year profit. CEO Daniel Ek said he saw “potential for transformative shifts in music discovery” in recent developments in AI.In mid-January, the Wall Street Journalpublished a profileof Spotify’s eccentric head of editorial, with the headline and subhead: The Playlist Power Broker Who Makes or Breaks New Artists: Spotify is known for its algorithmic recommendations, but Sulinna Ong brings a human touch to finding new hits. Ong told the paper she spends three hours a day lying on the floor listening to new songs. How whimsical, how human! She positioned herself as the anti-android soul within the mechanical beast: “AI machine learning is amazing at parsing large data sets, but when there is no data, for example, on a new release, on a new artist, what does it do?”I doubt how much humanity Ong is able to inject. Spotify’s playlists are certainly big tastemakers, but serving 640 million users doesn’t happen with loving curation by hand, and the app is placing less emphasis than ever on the human touch. It algorithmically generates playlists based on your music taste and the activity you search for, eg “Running Mix”, “Daily Drive”, or “Feel Good Cleaning Mix”, humans not included. The streamer laid off about 1,700 employees in December 2023, including many of its human playlist makers. Four months later, it rolled out the AI playlist generator, which was probably trained on the labor of those curators, that allows users to populate playlists based on text prompts like a musical ChatGPT.Spotify has positioned Ong in the pages of WSJ like a bishop on a chess board. Every interview with a current employee of a tech company that makes it into print happens with a predetermined goal in mind. An executive as senior as Ong won’t go near a journalist without the blessing of a dozen public relations professionals and Spotify executives. Such sit-downs are selectively and strategically deployed in service of the narrative those executives believe will drum up consumer support and dollars. She’s not on the payroll to sit for photoshoots, though perhaps she can listen to an hour of new songs while posing.What tune is Spotify singing, then? The company is emphasizing the humanity of its recommendations even as its financial and product decisions scream AI. The public doesn’t like AI going near art; hundreds of artists in music and other disciplines have spoken out against generative AI and accused its developers of stealing their work. As a tech company, though, Spotify wants AI to refine its recommendations at the scale of hundreds of millions. That’s where its money is going; that’s what the engineers are working. As a music company, it needs the semblance of a human touch. Enter Sulinna Ong, its persuasively human mascot.I expect more companies will follow the same public relations playbook, spending big on AI but emphasizing the small tweaks humans make. EvenBjörkherself is not immune.

We have the family group, with Parker Posey (possibly Parker Poseying it slightly too much in a part that doesn’t demand as much kookiness as she brings to it) as Victoria Ratliff, a heavily medicated Southern belle and wife of wealthy businessman Timothy (Jason Isaacs). They are the parents of three children: the enjoyably appalling chip-off-the-old-block Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger – and the answer to your first question is yes, he is; the answer to the next one is, no, he’s actually very, very good); idealistic daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), who is writing her thesis about eastern religion and at whose behest they chose Thailand as their holiday location; and sweet, gentle Lochlan (Sam Nivola), who may be trying to work out how to come out as gay in a family that does not seem to accommodate much difference.We have the odd couple, Rick (Walton Goggins) and his much younger girlfriend Chelsea (played by Aimee Lou Wood, ofSex Educationfame). Goggins is in his happy place as Rick, a tortured soul fibrillating on the edge of violence and who has come to the resort seeking its owner.

Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) is a successful actor, Laurie (Carrie Coon) is a high-flying lawyer recovering from a recent divorce and Kate (Leslie Bibb) is a stay-at-home mom who appears to have it all, including a nice line in character assassination, depending on which of her friends is present or absent. Their dynamic – not mean girls, but not quite the ride-or-dies they think they are – is beautifully depicted.Further out from the centre – so far – we have a tender romance blossoming between hotel security guard Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) and “health guru” Mook (Lalisa Manoban), and possibly another between returning character Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) and another staff member, as she embarks on a research trip for her own wellness enterprise.It all makes for a rich stew of possibilities and White adjusts the seasoning and turns up the heat with the skill of a Michelin-starred chef. What is the source of Rick’s suffering? Why is Timothy getting calls from the Wall Street Journal? Which of the friend trio is going to crack first, and how? Is there more or even less to Saxon than meets the eye? And is Piper really as anodyne as she seems? No one else inThe White Lotusever has been.View image in fullscreenTender romance … Mook (Lalisa Manoban) and Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOAs ever, White has his eye on the wilful ignorance and hypocrisies of the US economic elite. The power dynamics around sex and class come under scrutiny once more, but this time religion is interrogated too. Specifically the western appropriation of eastern faiths and practices – you know, the good bits; the bits that can be packaged as vague “spirituality” rather than an organising principle around which to build a moral life.That said, the last series had less satirical bite than the first – which relentlessly went after its marks and never missed a chance to skewer the unthinking arrogance or active malevolence of Americans rich enough to have distanced themselves from the herd. And, on the evidence of the first few episodes, it seems that the third series may have moved even further from the original’s MO. But the precision of the storytelling and the realisation of every character, from the most central to the most peripheral, remains masterly. Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses. Come on in, the water’s lovely – until the bodies start floating past.The White Lotus is on HBO in the US and Binge in Australia on 16 February and on Sky Atlantic/Now on 17 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsThe White LotusTV reviewTelevisionTV crime dramareviewsShareReuse this content"

The real thing is bad enough: a pale copy doesn’t stand a chance here or in the USTue 11 Feb 2025 09.39 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 12.41 ESTShareIt’s fun thatKeir Starmerhas finally unveiled a personality – it’s just a shame it’s the radio edit of someone else’s. I’m sure you can guess whose.Announcing plans to make it easier to buildnuclear power stationslast week, the prime minister was willingly drawn into some kind of call and response answer to a BBC question, fixing one eye on the cameras and gibbering: “I say: build, baby, build.” Yowch. Hope he sees this, king! On the other hand, this delivery slightly reminded me of Daniel Craig’s accent in Knives Out, of whichone co-star opined: “I remember the first time he did that on set, there was kind of a moment of silence after he finished and just a smile on everyone’s face.” Mm. Likewise.Anyway, we must leave Netflix’s most successful detective from … Kentucky, is it? … and return to Starmer, whose apparent desire to come off as a Chinese restaurant’s Donald Trump impersonator may well be putting a smile on the face of whoever in the White House is charged with monitoring the US-UK special relationship. (Please don’t picture a single novelty hamburger phone on a desk manned by Bryson DeChambeau.) The point is: Starmerlikes American thingsnow.Many of us will have seen versions of this syndrome before, sometimes in acquaintances who adopt mid-Atlantic accents after a couple of drinks, or have perhaps gone on a two-week fly-drive to Orlando and admired “the can-do” so much that they werethisclose to getting a Route 66 tattoo before they flew home. Which, let’s face it, they can still do at that place next to the Sue Ryder when they’re waiting for the car to get its MOT on Thursday week.As I say, having witnessed this before, we might have expected the prime minister’s next symptoms to be talking in a supercool way about “freeways” and “seltzer”, and saying “I could care less” when he meant he couldn’t. But no.Instead, Starmer opted on Monday to releasephotos and footageof illegal migrants being escorted on to planes to be deported – just like the Trump administration did last week, would you believe. The White House version had far more of an eye on iconic image, of course, with a line of deportees stretching back from the maw of a military plane, while Starmer and the Home Office preferred to cast their montage as the“journey” of an illegal migrant, a phrase so reality-TV-esque that I half expected to find the PM standing at the plane steps with an iPad and the catchphrase “before you go, let’s have a look at your best bits”.Trump has been in office for precisely 23 days, while Starmer seemingly spent about 23 years being the prime minister in waiting, repeatedly indicating to the British public that he had a huge number of ideas. A lot of these currently seem to have been boiled down to offering a bowdlerised, PG take on Trump’s R-rated blockbuster. Does anyone want to see that?They might, with a different actor in the role. What we can say for sure is that no onebelievesit when it comes from Starmer. Trump can put some deportees on a plane and everyone calls him strong; Starmer does it, and social media lights up with people scoffing it’s just a publicity stunt.In many ways, the only thing more guaranteed to backfire than trying to out-Trump Trump is trying to do a watered-down version of him to appeal just enough to some people – at the same time as being just acceptable enough not to drive others away. The president has his own laws of physics, which don’t apply to others. It goes without saying that you have to work with him, but doing so in a way that smells inauthentic to your own public may only make your situation worse. What’s Starmer going to do – shy away from the luxury hotel plan for Trump’s “Gaza Riviera”, but compromise by building a couple of competitively priced B&Bs?It’s straight from the Trump playbook: Labour is tearing up the machinery of government | George MonbiotRead moreIn terms of seeming cool in front of the new cock of the world leaders’ WhatsApp group, though, it turns out Starmer could care very much. Or couldn’t, I suppose, depending on whether you’re reading this column in an American accent or an English one. He’s not the only one, obviously. There is something particularly hilarious about men who are not at all like Trump trying to act their version of Trumpishly. I felt I saw it again last week, when Peter Mandelson was asked about his dealings with Jeffrey Epstein, and replied: “I’m not going to go into this. It’s an FT obsession and frankly you can all fuck off. OK?” Ooh! New style of diplomatic language just dropped. Ambassador, you are spoiling us, etc.At time of writing, Starmer had yet to tell the nearest interviewer his favourite TV programme isLandman, but we do keep hearing that he has a great rapport with the US president built up in multiple phone calls. Please God they remain classified. I’m not sure I can handle the expected cringe of seeing a readout of their badinage, or – worse – the full record. During the last Trump presidency, the Washington Post published a leaked transcript of a phone call between the US leader and the then Australian premier Malcolm Turnbull. “I have had it,” fumed Trump by the end of this call. “I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.”And yet – of course, of course – it was Turnbull for whom thecall played badly, not Trump. Something for Downing Street’s would-be Apprentice candidate to bear in mind.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourDonald TrumpTrump administrationImmigration and asylumMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

I didn’t pay my tax on time, because I didn’t want to cash in my premium bonds before the end of the month, because maybe I’d win a million pounds. H reckons if she applied herself seriously to writing erotic fanfic, she would definitely make a million pounds. D was wondering what the maximum amount of compensation would be for a range of workplace accidents, what limb you’d have to lose for a million pounds. She’s dreaming. She’s a graphic designer.One million pounds has been the objective unit of gigantic wealth for as long as I’ve been alive. There has never been any point in two million and it would sound unbelievably pedantic to wish for three. That’s 50 years, during which time the value of one million pounds has changed quite a lot. Half a century ago, you could have bought an island, and now you might get a house with a well-made kitchen island. Yet the word has meant “unimaginably massive” all that time. It never even respected currency variation – when a photo caption once ran “Elizabeth Taylor arrived looking like a million dollars” and the newspaper sub added, per house style, “(£565,000)”, people found that ridiculous; of course she didn’t look like £565,000. If she looked like a million dollars, she looked like a million pounds.Has it been this way for ever? Have we been fantasising about a million pounds ever since a million actually meant a billion, and correspondingly, are we condemned by convention for our fantasies to get smaller and smaller, in real terms? Actually, no; almost a century ago (1934), it was a thousand pounds. “Darling,” someone says to the harlot in Evelyn Waugh’s A Handful of Dust, “what does the country do to you? You look like a thousand pounds.” If money words could get anywhere close to conveying their value, there would have been some gradation, a good few decades ago when pretty people looked like 257 grand before they leapt up to six figures. But it’s hard to do metaphor and denomination at the same time, and the poet always wins.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The medical establishment, populated as it is with hopeless dinosaurs, hasn’t yet absorbed its full significance, and you won’t find it on the NHS, or through mainstream providers in the United States or Europe. But quietly, almost magically, it is already changing lives.View image in fullscreenLucca’s World with (l-r) Danish Hussain as Dr Kumar, Juan Pablo Medina as Andrés, Bárbara Mori as Bárbara and Julián Aguilar Tello as Lucca.Photograph: Maria Medina/NetflixThe device that provides this treatment, the Cytotron, is the subject of the Mexican movie Lucca’s World, the No 1 non-English-language film on the world’s biggest streaming platform last week. It follows one family – led by a remarkable mother, Bárbara Anderson, on whose memoir the movie is based – as they turn every stone in pursuit of a better life for their little boy. And as soon as Anderson learns about the Cytotron, there is very little room for doubt about its remarkable properties. By “stimulating the damaged brain cells in order for them to become more active and create new connections”, the device can apparentlyrestore the functions that have been destroyed by Lucca’s severe cerebral palsy. “The Cytotron will mark a before and after in the history of medicine,” we learn. It’s “scientifically supported”. Yes, it’s eye-wateringly expensive – $50,000 for a single course of treatment in the movie– but that’s because it’s unprecedented.An old-school doctor in the filmobjects that the inventors of the device – basically a pimped-out MRI machine that directs radio waves at the patient – would “already have the Nobel prize for medicine” if their claims stacked up. He quickly realises that he is hopelessly wrong. After the machine works its magic, Lucca takes some hesitant supported steps, and says “mama”; a postscript tells us that he has “started walking and talking”. The viewer is left with the same lesson as Anderson: failing to pursue such a prospect is “surrender”, or “giving up”. The only worthwhile imperative is in the promise she makes her son: “I promise I won’t rest until you get better.”As parents of a toddler with cerebral palsy, we understand that resolution better than most. In the year and a half since our son suffered a significant brain injury after he stopped breathing in his sleep, we have read countless research papers, consulted every expert who will talk to us and paid through the nose for treatments whose efficacy we will never know definitively.Disabled people aren’t here to inspire you | Charlie SwinbourneRead moreThe parts of the movie that deal with that desperate search will be instantly recognisable to any family in the same boat. So, too, is the depiction of how alarming it is to find that the science is much more ambiguous than you would hope, that the most rigorous specialists in the field will tell you that this is more often a world of “worth trying” than “definitely do”. Through all of this, we have also learned that if you aren’t your child’s most reliable advocate, you can’t expect anyone else to be.But another lesson we have learned is the crucial importance of keeping a foot in the reality-based community. The more we watched Lucca’s World, and the more we read, the more astonished we were that Netflix would release this movie, and spread its fantastical message to many millions of viewers. While the film begins with a disclaimer saying that some scenes have been altered for dramatic purposes, the average viewer would surely expect a film based on a true story to have at least a passing relationship to the truth; and the truth is that for the vast majority of parents who long for something similar for their own children, Lucca’s World is an unattainable one.In publicity for the film, Andersontold Infobae Mexico: “I never recommend … nor promote [the treatment]. I only describe the journey of taking an experimental treatment that, in the case of my son, worked.” You can decide for yourself how that statement squares with the movie’s postscript, which tells us that “Bárbara, Andrés and a group of investors bought two Cytotrons and opened the first clinic outside India”. One of these deviceswas provided to theFederico Gómez Children’s Hospital of Mexico, which briefly ran a study into the Cytotron’s use. Last week, the hospitalsaid thatthe study was discontinued after a year because of a lack of progress.If you are looking for the vaunted “scientific support” for the Cytotron, you might look at a rival enterprise in Mexico, Neurocytonix, which markets the device as the Neurocytotron. They conductedthe only visible studyon its efficacy as a treatment for cerebral palsy, completed in 2021. Neurocytonix has used the completion of this “gold standard” randomised clinical trialin marketing communications. But almost four years after the study’s completion, the results still have not been published. A generous description of that hiatus would be “highly unusual”. The experts who have helped us with our own son’s care have a pithier description. Last week, the Mexican Society of Pediatric Neurologyissued a statementwarning that no clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the Cytotron.When we asked Neurocytonix for comment, they distanced themselves from the film and told us that a second phase of the study was completed last year, saying that “multiple manuscripts are in preparation for publication” without addressing why it has taken so long. They emphasised that the treatment remains unproven, and said that Bárbara Anderson’s lack of scientific training “may have led to misinterpretations of scientific evidence”. (Netflix declined to comment.)As for another of the movie’s heroes, Rajah Vijay Kumar, the Indian doctor and serial inventor who came up with the Cytotron: he previously drew attention when he launched Shycocan, an electron-producing device which claimed to stop the spread of coronavirus in closed spaces “by photon mediation”. That was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),it was reported.But it wasn’t, andmanyreputablescientists say that it has never been backed up by evidence.Then there’s Lucca himself. The film is a dramatisation, and we don’t know exactly what his life post-treatment looks like. But we can say this: the actor in the movie “walked” with the soles of his feet squarely on the ground, not something that Luccaappears able to doin videos of him using a supportive device on his mother’s Instagram feed. Lovely though those moments are – we’ve had them ourselves – credible physiotherapists do not see themas a reliable predictorof functional walking in children with severe cerebral palsy.And several years after he said “mama” on his own,a recent updateshows Lucca undergoing treatment where a speech therapist opens and closes his mouth to form consonants on his behalf.If Lucca has seen any benefits, that’s wonderful. But there is no available scientific evidence that they are replicable for anyone else. Nonetheless, parents are flocking to Neurocytonix, and trying to come up with tens of thousands of dollars for a “research donation” that the company asks for, since it would be illegal to charge for a treatment not approved by Mexico’s medical regulators:the page after pageof Google results for “gofundme neurocytonix” are a portrait of undaunted hope. For everyone else, the Netflix movie provides,as one reviewer says, a “feelgood note to end on”. A better phrase for this is “inspiration porn”: the designation of disabled lives as a handy pick-me-up when you’ve got a case of the Mondays, to be quietly set aside if the messier truth threatens to intervene.Above all: Lucca’s World perpetuates the idea that children like our son are broken and must be repaired, rather than whole people who deserve every chance to live full and happy lives. It divides parents into those who make their children better, and those who surrender. It tells its audience that stories like Lucca’s have a simple, happy ending. But these stories don’t conclude with a bow around them. They are much more complicated and beautiful than that.That isn’t how Lucca’s World sees the little boy without whom it would not exist, though. The very last shot Netflix gives us is of the real Lucca, smiling at the camera, perfectly himself.

The shoddy share price says the stock market doesn’t have “increased confidence” in BP’s current approach, and it sounds as if the board doesn’t either. The strategy will be “fundamentally reset” on 26 February,chief executive Murray Auchincloss said on Tuesday, and there will be “a new direction for BP.”Cue long City checklists of ideas for that new direction. Less investment in renewables and more in oil and gas? Almost certainly. Other members of the BigOilclub have edged away from past promises to be slightly greener, and some never made them in the first place.Or how about going a step further and breaking up the company, separating the fossil fuel operations (exploration, production, refining and trading) from the low-carbon and renewables ones (wind, solar and biofuels)? That would definitely qualify as a fundamental reset but feels highly unlikely to happen. Companies such as BP don’t split themselves up voluntarily. And, since the same management wasbuying full control of a big Brazilian biofuels joint ventureas recently as last summer, it would be odd to deem that operation non-core now.Thus the guess here is that Auchincloss will unveil a souped-up version of what he has been doing anyway for the past year. That is to say, finding more ways to make renewables “capital light”, as with the move to shove most of the offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japanese company Jera, and boosting the budget for oil and gas. The latter would probably involve hurrying up disposals because the current high borrowing levels don’t leave much room for financial manoeuvre. Certainly, the vow to reduce fossil fuel production by 25% by 2030 looks to be toast,to the dismay of campaigners.The suspense will be over in a fortnight and, in the meantime, the vacuum may be filled by a missive from Elliott,the activist New York hedge fund with an undisclosed stake. Elliott doesn’t always hit the mark – its manifesto at GlaxoSmithKline in 2021 waspure waffleand its attempt to force energy firm SSE to split itself into twonever gained traction– but it would be pushing at an open door at BP. Even shareholders who supported the original 2020 vision to reduce oil and gas production by 40% can see that BP, at the current share price, is a sitting duck for a takeover if nothing changes.But, whatever version of a resetBPemerges, the new direction will be more credible under a new chair. Helge Lund, in the seat since the first day of 2019, is too closely tied to share price failure and BP’s inability to carry its investors with it.Nobody would pretend his job was easy. At one end of the spectrum, some investors wanted BP to run harder with renewables; at the other, sceptics never truly signed up. Meanwhile, BP has been blown around by events. The pandemic, when oil prices plunged, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sent prices soaring again, upset the underlying financial calculations.The missing ingredient, however, was any sense of clarityfrom the boardroom about what BP wants to be. Authority was absent.Auchincloss, one could argue, is as closely associated with the muddle because he was the finance director before he became chief executive. But he’s clearly there to stay. Thus, if BP really wants to signal a fresh start, the chair is the place to look.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour ministers, it seemsPolly ToynbeeA bill that would ban the creation of these images without consent was watered down by the government. This is where timidity gets youTue 11 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 05.49 ESTShareAt an away day last week, Keir Starmer told his cabinet that they must become “disruptorsif you don’t want to be disrupted”. Yet timidity, caution and hesitation have damaged too many of Labour’s bold policies. Will Starmer’s new message percolate through to the cabinet – and to their junior ministers, civil servants and official lawyers? This week, one policy decision that went largely unnoticed suggests his party is still far from embracing disruption.Tens of thousands of deepfake porn images areproduced every week, many of celebrities, mostly of ordinary women. These obscene AI-generated images have the power to destroy lives, roaming the internet for ever. They can be sent to friends, family, children, school friends, present or future employers. Those who create these poisonous pictures often turn out to be close friends, or people seeking revenge. Nobody thinks this is OK. Indeed, sharing deepfake porn became a criminal offence in the 2023 Online Safety Act.But a loophole means it’s not an offence tocreatedeepfake porn, only to share it. The Tory peer Charlotte Owen, a longtime campaigner on the issue, introduced a private member’s bill in the Lords last year that wouldban people from creatingsexually explicit photographs, films or digitally produced images without consent. The bill is urgently needed, since the existence of such images allows perpetrators to blackmail, intimidate and terrify their victims. But in our tribal political system, private members’ bills never succeed without government say-so, no matter how reasonable those bills may be.The government instead promised to include the provisions of Lady Owen’s bill in thedata billdebated in the Lords last week. But it was watered down in crucial ways. The only penalty for creating a deepfake porn image would be a fine, with no possibility of prison, however many times the offence was repeated, however dreadful it may be. A storm erupted: a host of angry Labour peers spoke out against the Ministry of Justice under-secretary Frederick Ponsonby. When he refused to relent, they abstained very publicly; peers such as Helena Kennedy, Ayesha Hazarika, Jan Royall and Jim Knight remained on the red benches during the vote. Many others stayed away. As a result, the government suffered astonking loss.The bill moves into the Commons this Wednesday: will the government reconsider, or, as some fear, water it down even more? The reasons for this remain entirely mysterious. There is no lobby pushing for the rights of deepfake porn-makers. Lady Kennedy led theLabour challengein the Lords last week, and told themabout a woman whose deepfake pictures were sent around her child’s school. The KC and crossbench peer David Pannick said courts should have “the option of imposing a sentence of imprisonment”. Elizabeth Butler-Sloss said a fine is no deterrent to a company or person “inordinately rich” nor to “someone extremely poor” who doesn’t have the money to pay it. For those rightly wanting fewer people imprisoned, this would be a tiny number, but a vital deterrent. However, Lord Ponsonby just reaffirmed: “We think it more appropriate this should be a fine-only offence.”The Guardian view on violence against women: put victims and survivors first | EditorialRead moreThe other key change the government tried to make was even more bizarre. It added the provision of a defence of “reasonable excuse”. But no one, including Ponsonby himself, could actually think of any valid “reasonable excuse” for making an obscene image without someone’s consent. The government lost overwhelmingly and deservedly on both points. The hapless minister, by all accounts a decent man, was a lamb to the slaughter. Goodness knows what he actually thought he was defending, but ifLabourare now to be the “disruptors”, every MP, peer and especially every minister should be arguing ahead of debates that they should not be forced to defend the indefensible.Who drafted the government position? Perhaps civil servants, or lawyers claiming improbably that “reasonable excuse” was needed to conform to the European convention of human rights, on freedom of expression.Will justice ministers, whips or anyone sensible step in and restore the provisions of Owen’s original bill? I tried in vain to get a reply from Jess Phillips, parliamentary under-secretary of state for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, but received no reply from her office. The Ministry of Justice tells me the line has not changed (yet).Much that happens in parliament never reaches the public. But this episode is an apt example of a cautious state of mind that has damaged Labour throughout its first months. The party has too often softened its commitment to vital policies that all Labour members support. It is too prone to risk-averse officialdom. If Labour is now seen to backtrack on the whole thing, this will only help undermine the public’s trust in its politics, and its radicalism. With terrible choices ahead in the spending review, Labour should be shoring up its position on everything it can right now – with no vacillating, pressing full steam ahead on disruption.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At the time, Atwater was a junior member of the Reagan administration, but he would later go on torun George HW Bush’s presidential campaignin 1988 and then become chair of the Republican National Committee in 1989.In perhaps the most revealing, and most infamous, portion of the interview, the hard-charging Republican operative explained to Lamis how Republican politicians could mask their racism – and racist appeals to white voters – behind a series of euphemisms.You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘[N-word, N-word, N-word]’. By 1968 you can’t say ‘[N-word]’ – that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites … ‘We want to cut this,’ is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ‘[N-word, N-word]’.Got that? No need to utter the N-word out loud as there were plenty of other “abstract” ways to say it.Today, more than four decades later, DEI has become the new N-word; the new rightwing abstraction deployed byRepublicansto conceal their anti-Black racism. DEI – short for diversity, equity and inclusion – is thrown around by high-profile conservatives, from the president of the United States downwards, for the express purpose of undermining Black people in public life.No one is safe from Trump’s racist agenda | Bakari T SellersRead moreDon’t believe me? In arecent interviewon Fox News, the White House counselor and former Trump lawyer Alina Habba declared that the administration’s 27-year-old press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, “is overqualified, brilliant and was well-versed and ready … she didn’t need a thick binder ... unlike our last press secretary who was put in there for … DEI reasons”.For the record, the “last press secretary”, Karine Jean-Pierre, is the Black daughter of Haitian immigrants. Is she less qualified than her successor? Well, let’s compare résumés, shall we?Neither Habba herself, nor Leavitt, are Ivy League grads.Jean-Pierre is.Neither Habba herself, nor Leavitt, worked in two different administrations before securing their top White House positions.Jean-Pierre did.Neither Habba herself, nor Leavitt, has served on three different election-winning presidential campaigns across three different decades.Jean-Pierre has.So when Habba says Jean-Pierre was appointed White House press secretary for “DEI reasons”, what else could she be alluding to other than that she is a Black woman?When the Republican congressman Tim BurchettcalledKamala Harris – the then sitting vice-president, former senator and former attorney general of the country’s most populous state; a woman who would have entered the Oval Office with a longer record in elected office than Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump – a “DEI hire” within 24 hours of her becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, what else could he have been referring to other than that she is a Black woman?When a viral tweet (26m viewsand counting) from a popular far-right account (that is alsoamplifiedby Elon Musk) referred to Brandon Scott – the mayor of Baltimore who was elected with 70% of the vote and previously served eight years on the city council, including a stint as city council president – as the city’s “DEI mayor”, what else could it have been trying to point to other than that he is a Black man?DEIisthe new N-word. In fact, the Black podcaster Van Lathanarguesthat DEI is now “worse than the N-word” and has become “the worst slur in American history”. The term “DEI hire”, he explains, “is not just being used to undermine the qualifications, capability and readiness of Black people … DEI is placing the blame of all of society’s ills at the feet of these people.”Plane crash?Blame DEI. Wildfires in LA?Blame DEI. Bridge collapse?Blame DEI.DEI is a racist dogwhistle. BlameBlack peopleis the not so unsubtle message.You now cannot turn on the television or log on to social media without coming across a prominent conservative blathering on about the evils of DEI. Toquotethe loathsome Fox host Greg Gutfeld, DEI “can be used to explain everything … except, unlike racism and climate change, which the left found under every rock, every issue, DEI is, indeed, under every rock because the Democrats put it there.”This isn’t a good-faith critique of diversity programs or policies – whether they actuallywork or not; whether theyrestrict free speech; whether they are corporatebox-ticking exercises. No, this is the weaponization of a three-letter term to denigrate Black people and pretend the political and economic advancement of minority communities over the past 60 years was a mistake. (“If I see a Black pilot, I’m gonna be like, ‘Boy, I hope he is qualified,” the rightwing activist and top Trump ally Charlie Kirkcasually remarkedlast year.)So why on earth is our “liberal” media credulously giving Republicans the benefit of the doubt on this? Treating their obsession with DEI as anything other than what it is? Anti-Black racism. The new N-word. A three-letter slur that seeks to, once again, mainstream bigotry and discrimination in the United States. (“DEI halftime show,”tweetedthe far-right influencer Jack Posobiec during the Super Bowl on Sunday night.)For years, Donald Trump has been plagued by allegations that he used the N-word while filming The Apprentice. In 2024, a former producer on the NBC reality showclaimedTrump used the racial epithet in 2004 to describe Kwame Jackson, a Black finalist on the first season of The Apprentice. In 2018, the former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newmanclaimedin her book Unhinged that Trump was caught on tape during the making of The Apprentice saying the N-word “multiple times”, according to three of her sources.At the time, Trump vociferouslydeniedthat he had ever used the N-word: “I don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have.”But the awful truth is that, these days, he doesn’t even need to have such a word in his vocabulary. He and his acolytes have another, more insidious one that serves a similar racist purpose: DEI.Mehdi Hasan is the CEO and editor-in-chief of the new media companyZeteoExplore more on these topicsRaceOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

This theory explains whyDarren LoucaidesIn just a few years, Kennedy and his dangerously popular ‘diagonalist’ politics have gone from the fringes of the web to, perhaps, the White HouseTue 11 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 11.14 ESTShare“Back at home in the United States, the newspapers are saying that I came here today to speak to about 5,000 Nazis,” Robert F Kennedy Jrtold a large crowd in Berlin. Estimated at 38,000 people, the crowd was a mix of hippies, anti-war types, Green party voters and anti-vaxxers, rubbing shoulders with a smattering of skinheads. It was late August 2020 and a group called Querdenken had rallied this motley crew together in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions.“Governments love pandemics,” Kennedy said. “They love pandemics for the same reason they love war – it gives them the ability to impose controls that the population would otherwise never accept.”Last month, in Senate confirmation hearings for his appointment as the US secretary of health and human services, Kennedy was questioned on having previously compared the Center for Disease Control’s work tothat of “Nazi death camps”, callingCovid-19 a bioweapongenetically engineered to target black and white people while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, and blaming school shootings on antidepressants. “He has made it his life’s work to sow doubt and discourage parents from getting their kids life-saving vaccines,”said the Democratic senator Ron Wyden. “It has been lucrative for him and put him on the verge of immense power.”Kennedy has gone from courting the conspiratorial fringes of the internet to the halls of the White House. He could be confirmed within days. With hindsight, the Berlin speech he gave five years ago was the moment a dangerous new political phenomenon went global. It’s called diagonalism.Coined by the political theorist William Callison and the historian Quinn Slobodian,diagonalism describesthe union of disparate groups across the political spectrum around a suspicion of all power being involved in conspiracy. Diagonal movements see big tech, big pharma, banks, climate science and traditional media as accomplices in totalitarianism, evidenced by Covid mandates through to innocuous intergovernmental proposals such as the “great reset” and15-minute cities.For diagonalists, the control of electoral processes by powerful interests means that governments are de facto illegitimate. And so they advocate for distributed power – not to empower any community, but the individual. By definition they are susceptible to far-right radicalisation. Callison and Slobodian trace their use of the term back to Querdenken – which roughly translates as “lateral thinkers” – the group that organised the Berlin rally addressed by Kennedy.RFK Jr’s claim about Black people’s immune systems is ‘unscientific and terrifying’Read moreKennedy recalled his uncle’s visit to the same city decades earlier, even repeating the historic line “Ich bin ein Berliner”. “And today again, Berlin is the frontline against global totalitarianism,” he said, before working through a bingo card of conspiracy theories. An extended “quote” Kennedy read from Hermann Göring’s testimony at the Nuremberg trials, including that “the only thing a government needs to make people into slaves is fear”, was copy and pasted across social media for months afterwards – even thoughthere is no recordof Göring saying those words.But Kennedy’s Berlin speech and the Querdenken rally itself were not merely notable for the controversy they caused. In drawing together veterans of anti-war and anti-globalist groups alongside health influencers, environmentalists and the far right, Querdenken became the blueprint for diagonal movements. Through its anti-power conspiratorial framing and the mirroring of methods used by decentralised grassroots movements, Querdenken was able to draw diagonal lines across pre-existing political allegiances, cultural divides and single issues, such as the climate or vaccines, to forge a mass coalition of support. Kennedy himself epitomises this new coalition – one that was nascent at the time, but is now at the heart of Trumpism.As a former environmental lawyer, Kennedy spoke witheloquence and passionin the past about corporations contaminating rivers and polluting the skies, the plight of asthma especially afflicting black people, and the existential threat of the climate crisis. In the Berlin speech, Kennedy mingled conspiracy theories with genuine concerns and anxieties held by the public. He said he saw “people who want leaders who are not going to lie to them, people who want leaders who will not make up arbitrary rules and regulations to orchestrate the obedience of the population. We want health officials who don’t have financial entanglements with the pharmaceutical industry, who are working for us and not big pharma.”In her bookDoppelganger, Naomi Kleinwrites powerfully on how diagonal movements and influencers often identify real issues that progressives had grown timid about – the sway of oligarchical wealth over politics, the rise of digital surveillance, the impact of rampant capitalism on our mental and physical health. But instead of articulating the actual causes or plausible solutions, they have constructed bogus metanarratives. Rather than increasingly antidemocratic billionaires, it was an organised cabal of global elites, unaccountable deep-state bureaucrats who secretly ran the world – or, at the furthest end, blood-sucking satanists, as QAnon followers believed. A mirrorworld had emerged. And it is demagogues such as Trump who have benefited.“Despite claims of post-partisanship, it is right-wing, often far-right, political parties around the world that have managed to absorb the unruly passions and energy of diagonalism,” says Klein, “folding its Covid-era grievances into preexisting projects opposing ‘wokeness’ and drumming up fears of migrant ‘invasions’. Still, it is important for these movements to present themselves (and to believe themselves to be) ruptures with politics-as-usual; to claim to be something new, beyond traditional left-right poles.”While the crowd that listened to Kennedy’s speech that day in 2020 was a heterogeneous mix, a few miles away, a mob of far-right activists and QAnon supporterstried to storm the Reichstag, home to Germany’s parliament, after one of their number falsely announced Trump was in Berlin to liberate the country. The violent scenes would be replicated in the more deadly assault on the Capitol on 6 January 2021. This was the extreme end of diagonalism exploding into life. (An investigation I led into Covid-sceptic groups found that by then, Querdenken and others hadbecome obsessed with Trump– and gravely radicalised.)IfRobert F Kennedy Jris confirmed to Trump’s cabinet, a once-staunch environmentalist and defender of women’s reproductive rights turned conspiracy theorist and super-spreader of health misinformation will dictate health policy in the US.

A new settlement is neededTue 11 Feb 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 19.20 ESTShareIn one of David Lodge’s famous campus novels, a young English literature lecturer pictures her university as “the ideal human community, where … people were free to pursue excellence and self‑fulfilment, each according to their own rhythm and inclination”. A non-academic friend comments wryly: “Well, it’s nice work if you can get it.”Nice Workwas written in 1988, in part as a fictional response to the Thatcher cuts to higher education at the time. It’s safe to say a contemporary equivalent would need a different title. Forty years on, universities like to sell themselves along the lines of Robyn Penrose’s romantic vision. But the marketised reality for modern university staff, particularly those at the sharp end of a deepening funding crisis, is another world altogether.As the Guardianreportedthis month, almost a quarter of universities – including prestigious Russell Group institutions such as Durham and Cardiff – are taking a scythe to budgets and planning to shed staff. The Office for Students (OFS), the university regulator established in 2017, haspredictedthat 72% of higher education providers in England could be in the red by 2025-26. Up to 10,000 redundancies or job losses are in prospect. The Royal College of Nursing has warned that nursing courses are being “engulfed” by the cuts, even as the care sector seeks to fill 40,000 vacancies. Arts and humanities subjects are also in the line of fire.Airily, the OFS is calling for more of the same, recommending “bold and transformative action … while continuing to deliver for the students of today and tomorrow”. Easy to say, extremely hard to do. But what about the poor bloody infantry?Demoralised university staff, whose pay has beendecliningsteeply in real terms, are not responsible for the dysfunctionalmarketisationof higher education, which is at the root of today’s financial black hole. Successive Conservative governments are, having failed to foresee how treacherous the politics of raising tuition fees would be. Nor did academics have anything to do with the decision toimposevisa restrictions on high-fee‑paying foreign students, which has compounded the problem. Yet it is they who must bear the brunt of Westminster’s cumulative mistakes, in theformof acute job insecurity, insufficient resources, pressures from panicked managers and increasingly untenable workloads.As one vice-chancellor rightly told the Guardian, this unfolding crisis is largely passing under the radar. The drip-drip nature of the bad news being delivered on campuses up and down the country is relentless but dispersed. That does not make it any less stressful for those attempting to fill gaps in teaching left by departed colleagues, or for a thirtysomething humanities lecturer wondering whether, after years of impoverished study, their job will even see them into middle age.At present, Labour is doing little to help. In November, Bridget Phillipsonannouncedthat the annual tuition fees cap would go up in line with inflation from April, the first rise for eight years. A £285 rise to £9,535 will modestly increase the debts of individual students, while doing little to address the overall problem. A new settlement is desperately needed – one that properly restores a sector that delivers a public good to the public realm. And which enables a sense of professional vocation, for those who work within it, to be renewed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it is unclear what recent attacks on NHS England’s Amanda Pritchard will achieveTue 11 Feb 2025 13.25 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 19.20 ESTShareIt was presumably a coincidence that last month’shighly critical reporton NHS finances from the House of Commons public accounts committee (PAC) was published just hours before Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s chief executive, appeared before the health and social care committee. Thereportaccused leaders at the organisation and the Department of Health and Social Care of lacking “drive” and “ideas”. That same day, immediately after Ms Pritchard’s evidence, the health committee issued a statement. Echoing the PAC, it said Ms Pritchard and her team lacked “drive” and “dynamism”.NHS England hit back at the PAC, claiming that MPsdid not fully understandthe financial processes at issue. Wes Streeting was reported to have “full confidence” in Ms Pritchard, making it clear that her job is not on the line. But this two-pronged attack must have stung. While critical reports like the PAC’s are part and parcel of parliamentary scrutiny, it is highly unusual for public servants to be rebuked for their oral evidence.Even Ms Pritchard’s admirers would not claim that presentation is her strongest suit. The frustration of MPs on the health committee at what they regarded as long-winded answers was obvious toanyone watching. But Ms Pritchard is not a politician, and one reason for a lack of clarity in her answers was that the publication ofcrucial guidance, including updated targets, had been postponed by ministers.While MPs, like voters, are understandablyimpatient for improvement, the expectations of the people with operational responsibility for the health service should be realistic. Given funding constraints, and the fact that NHS England’s structure (with its 42 integrated care boards) is still bedding in, it is unclear what demands for transformation really mean – beyond a wish that things were better than they are. Julian Kelly, Ms Pritchard’s deputy, explained that most of the £10.6bn increase to the organisation’s budget in 2025-26 will be absorbed by salary and national insurance rises, inflation and the £3.5bn allowed for rising costs caused by an ageing population and new treatments.With a government desperate for progress, and under a high-profile and ambitioushealth secretary, political pressure on the NHS will rise further. The PAC report raised concerns about productivity targets. On Monday, the Office for National Statistics published datashowing a declinein the last quarter of 2024, contradicting NHS England’s claims. These conflicting findings, which are produced by different methodologies, are a concern in themselves.Sorting out this confusion should be a priority for thenew permanent secretaryof Mr Streeting’s department, who is due to be appointed shortly, along with a new chair of NHS England. The filling of these two vacant posts means Ms Pritchard is likely to find she has less room to manoeuvre; the high level of autonomy granted to NHS England by the Conservatives is in the process of being reduced.This is not the only power struggle taking place. Another dynamic sees integrated care boards – with their duties to improve public health in partnership with councils – competing with bighospital trustsfor influence and resources. One view of Ms Pritchard’s difficulties is that she is caught in the middle.Holding public sector bosses accountable is the job of MPs and they are right to take it seriously. But underminingNHSleaders also carries risks. Politicians should be mindful of strengths as well as weaknesses.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He is now nearly 30, and – by the skin of his teeth – alive. He has tried to kill himself five times. He has rarely wanted to die, but many times he has wanted to stop living.One of those times when he was distraught and suicidal, I rang the child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) out-of-hours “emergency line” repeatedly and left desperate messages. I didn’t even receive a call back that week. The times someone did respond, it was to tell us to call the police to pick up my desperate, terrified child to take him to a hospital where no one cared and he was regarded as a bedblocker. We stopped doing that.He will no longer engage with any form of mental health services; he is too traumatised by the lack of caring and continuity, as am I. Even after repeated suicide attempts, he was always discharged from their care after one appointment as he seemed fine on that day.Somewhere along the journey, a Camhs psychologist told us that his case was too complex for them to handle and he needed the “top tier” of therapy: waiting list of two years. In the meantime, Camhs could offer three sessions with a therapist, most of which was going through his history, which they already had on file from every other appointment. This was the only time he saw the same practitioner more than once.When we checked on the waiting list 18 months later, Camhs had no record of him being on the list and had lost his notes. One staff member was justifiably upset and suggested we make a formal complaint, but what would that achieve?My son tries to keep his struggling to himself. He feels seeing a doctor is pointless; I tend to agree. On the thankfully rare occasions when he sinks to suicidal thoughts again, he has rung the Samaritans. Last time (at 1am) they told him they were busy and asked him to ring back later. He didn’t, and now considers them to be another closed door.After 20 years of this, I still dread the call that tells me he has finally had enough of this fight. He has never been to a friend’s wedding, but has been to the funerals of six friends who have taken their own lives. Their tales of mental health services are almost interchangeable.Name and address suppliedCamhs requires an immediate, urgent overhaul of its services. It dangerously offers hope when the reality is years on a seemingly never-ending waiting list. We are in year three of waiting despite Camhs assessing the case as urgent in 2023. The first year included making a formal complaint as Camhs misplaced urgent referral paperwork for six months, despite repeatedly communicating that all was in hand.A second formal complaint about the long delays (including our MP’s involvement) produced a response of “we are committed to providing support” – yet, still, nothing – alongside a refusal to confirm whether treatment will even commence in 2025.Staff have come and gone. Camhs is an utter travesty, with the warmth of an iceberg – and yet nothing will change. No lessons learned.Name and address suppliedMy heart goes out to Jen Bridges-Chalkley’s family and friends. Thank God we didn’t lose our son to suicide, but he has been lost to us in every meaningful way. Our son found school tremendously challenging and – at age 10, after three meltdowns a day, working with his doctor and the school, a police visit and a suicidal letter to his doctor – he had an emergency referral to Camhs.We had a year as a family with an overworked Camhs psychiatrist. It transformed our family’s mental health. That was 2010 and referrals were tough, but Camhs saved our family. Fast-forward to Covid isolation, bullying, GCSE exams and the death of his grandmother (my mother), and everything fell apart again for our son. At age 16, his meltdowns were back, he became isolated from his peers and went for long walks post-midnight on busy roads. He was befriended by a woman with two children who told him we were abusive parents and didn’t love him. We spoke to Camhs, which concluded he didn’t warrant its services.Our doctor, the police and social services became involved and still we were rebuffed by Camhs, even for the two-year waiting list. I used my inheritance to pay for his therapy, a psychiatric ADHD evaluation and medication. He now lived in the woman’s lounge. Social services and his college cut us off, treating the woman as his “person with care”; me and his dad were forced to pay her child support.He blocked me on his phone. He refuses to meet with us. He’s 18 and I haven’t seen or spoken to him in six months. If the local Camhs had been a functioning service, I’m sure we would still be a family and not in living bereavement.Name and address suppliedIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted onfreephone116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

In the past two years, countries around the globe have adopted frameworks of digital rights. We must not be left behind.We are asking the government to:Invite the public to have their say in a deliberative process that will shape the declaration.Establish a national digital rights network, including the diversity of civil society; legal experts and academics; tech companies and industry representative bodies, to guide the declaration’s development and ensure policy reflects the values of UK citizens.Adopt the declaration and integrate digital rights into future policy decisions.The declaration would not be legally binding, but would provide cohesive and foundational principles to guide policymaking. By developing this, the UK can build trust in our emerging digital policies and help responsible innovation to drive growth that benefits us all.Polly CurtisCEO, Demos;Prof Robert TragerCo-director, Oxford Martin School AI governance initiative;Prof Gina NeffExecutive director, Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy, University of Cambridge;Maeve WalshDirector, Online Safety Act Network;Jim KillockExecutive director, Open Rights Group;Dr Jeni TennisonExecutive director, Connected by DataHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

You can only hold out for so long against them, theManchester Citymanager suggested. They tend to find a way. This Madrid victory was built on their cut and thrust up front, the slickness of their bursts, the sheer speed of them.For a good while, it felt as though Erling Haaland would be the story; another striker who is not in the business of being shackled. The City No 9 had drawn blanks in all four of his previousChampions Leagueties against Madrid. He had a point to prove and he proved it, twice putting his team in front, the second for 2-1 coming from the penalty spot after Phil Foden, on as a substitute, had been fouled by Dani Ceballos.Even Total Haaland cannot stop Manchester City’s continuing nightmare | Barney RonayRead moreIt merely stirred Madrid to greater efforts. How were they behind? They had created so much, the City goalkeeper, Ederson, excelling in his efforts to keep them at bay. Kylian Mbappé, the central point of the Madrid front line, had scored the first equaliser, albeit with a finish that owed more to luck than judgment.Now Madrid pushed again. They refused to accept they would not take a lead back to the Bernabéu for the second leg of this playoff tie. Leading the way was Vinícius Júnior, who was simply frightening off the left. Rodrygo was not bad on the other flank, either. Ancelotti’s team got their second equaliser towards the end when they worked the ball to Vinícius on the inside right and his shot was pushed out by Ederson but only as far as another substitute, Brahim Díaz, who shot home. Díaz, the former City player, did not celebrate. The move had begun with a loose pass out by Ederson.The winner came in stoppage time and, if Madrid left it late, few people could say they did not deserve it. City have capitulated too many times this season and more fingers will be pointed at them. But it was more about Madrid’s talent, their remorselessness. City could not live with it.Guardiola had made an enforced change at the interval, Rico Lewis coming on for the injured Manuel Akanji at right-back and Vinícius gave him a torrid time. Vinícius punished him decisively at the last. It was a poor pass back by Mateo Kovacic, who had also entered as a substitute, but Lewis was on his heels, slow to react.Vinícius nicked the ball away from him and flicked on the afterburners. When he chipped over Ederson, it was Jude Bellingham, the final member of the fab quartet, playing as a No 10 when Madrid had possession, who raced in to tap into the unguarded net. Who else, as Bellingham might have put it.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham slides in to score the winner.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe tie needed no hype but it got it all the same. “Aclasico,”Carlo Ancelotti had called itand it did not disappoint. The history between the clubs pulsed, the epic showdowns, especially in the previous three seasons; one quarter-final, two semi‑finals – meetings that defined the competition, the winners going all the way to lift the trophy; City once, Madrid twice.Manchester City 2-3 Real Madrid: Champions League playoff player ratingsRead moreThere was also the more recent Ballon d’Or shemozzle, Madrid havingboycotted the ceremonyafter City’s Rodri won rather than Vinícius. The City fans had a jibe at the ready in the shape of a pre-match tifo. “Stop crying your heart out,” ran the words above an image of Rodri kissing the trophy. There were Ballon d’Or‑based taunts and boos from the home crowd for Vinícius. On reflection, perhaps it was not that wise.Madrid were bright at the outset. Vinícius sashayed around one challenge to release Mbappé, who saw Ederson save his shot and moments later the City goalkeeper denied Vinícius at close quarters. On the rebound, Ferland Mendy’s effort was blocked in front of the line by Nathan Aké.City were in front when Jack Grealish, given a rare start, lobbed a lovely ball into the area for Josko Gvardiol, who chested down for Haaland to finish. Was Haaland offside? The video assistant referee took an age to check before clearing him. Sadly, Grealish did not last much longer, injury forcing him off.Vinícius rattled the crossbar after a step‑over and a slide inside, while there was a flurry from the visitors before the interval. Federico Valverde, playing at right-back as Ancelotti contended with a defensive injury crisis, banged a shot high. Mbappé twice went close; the second attempt steered wastefully over. For City, Foden worked Thibaut Courtois from distance and Akanji looped a header on to the top of the crossbar from a corner.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland celebrates with Josko Gvardiol after scoring Manchester City’s first goal.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APIf Vinícius was in the mood, his acceleration blistering, then so was Haaland. Perhaps he sensed vulnerability in Madrid’s emergency central defensive pairing of Aurélien Tchouaméni and Raúl Asencio. Haaland’s movement was sharp, his physicality to the fore. He almost made it 2-0 at the start of the second half, taking a Kevin De Bruyne pass and seeing his shot deflect and hit the crossbar.Back came Madrid. Bellingham went close with a header. Mbappé drew a fine reflex save out of Ederson. The equaliser was coming and it did so when Ceballos chipped a half‑cleared free-kick back in for the run of Mbappé, whose side-on volley was more shin than boot. It spun in apologetically.It was all Madrid. Valverde lashed inches past the far post. Bellingham was denied one-on-one by Ederson. And yet the tie swung when Foden switched the ball from one foot to the other and Ceballos, already committed, stopped him illegally. After Haaland converted from the spot, it swung hard in the other direction.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityReal Madridmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They set up a League Cup final tie with Manchester City, reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League and FA Cup and are seven points clear at the top of the WSL table. Kerr has had a difficult four months. The Australian suffered a swathe of homophobic abuse in November after the announcement that her and partner, Kristie Mewis, are expecting their first baby together.Shortly after, the news broke that a vehicle hit her 90-year-old grandmother, leaving her in a critical condition, while the player was in New South Wales for the wedding of international teammates Emily van Egmond and Kat Thompson.After Kerr’s court case at Kingston crown court, the player said she was now “fully focused on getting back on to the pitch” and looking forward to an exciting year.“Following today’s not guilty verdict, I can finally put this challenging period behind me,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Welsh ­supporters have been warned, ­however, there is “no magic bullet” that will instantly revive the national team after theirdismal 22-15 defeat by Italyon Saturday.Gatland has departed “by mutual agreement” after 14 successive Test defeats, the worst run in the country’s 144-year international rugby ­history. Gatland, 61, had been contracted until the 2027 World Cup but Abi Tierney, the Welsh Rugby Union chief exe­cutive, acknow­ledged “there was a mounting sense that it wasn’t working” and said the ­decision was “in the best interests of the Wales squad”.The Breakdown | Time for Wales to face the Six Nations music as faith and form nosediveRead moreThe Gloucester-born Sherratt, 47, worked previously for Worcester, Bristol and the Ospreys before ­taking over as Cardiff’s head coach in 2023. He also had a brief stint with Wales in 2017 but has now been parachuted into Gatland’s old role for their remaining three Six Nations fixtures.While Tierney praised Sherratt’s abilities as “a people person”, she conceded Welsh rugby was at “a low ebb” after a grim 12 months. “It’ll be hard to make changes in a short space of time. There’s no magic bullet. If they can show hope and ambition, I’ll be grateful to Matt.”The WRU’s stated goal, however, is for the national men’s side to return to the top five in the world by 2029. The WRU wants the next permanent head coach to be in place for the two‑Test tour to Japan this summer and says “all options are open” regarding ­Gatland’s successor. The longer-term candidates to replace Gatland may include Glasgow’s Franco Smith or the Wales‑based Simon ­Easterby, now in temporary charge of Ireland with Andy ­Farrell currently focused on coaching the British & Irish Lions in Australia this year.The announcement brings down the curtain on a long and eventful era. Gatland helped to steer Wales to three grand slams, two World Cup semi-finals and a record sequence of 14 victories in his successful 12-year initial stint in charge but could not conjure something similar second time around.Even Gatland accepts it is “the right time for a change” having presided over just six victories in 26 Tests, with a win ratio of just 23%, since­replacing Wayne Pivac in December 2022. “I’ve reached the end of this particular chapter, but I remain grateful to all those in Wales who have supported me, to all the players who have played for me and to all those around me, especially my management team, who have contributed to what we have achieved over the years.”This week, however, Wales sank below Georgia to 12th in the world rankings, their lowest position, and their next fixture is against the Six Nations frontrunners Ireland on Saturday next week. Despite Gatland’s positive overall record – he was in charge of Wales for 151 games which yielded 76 wins, 73 defeats and two draws – recent results made his departure almost inevitable. “We are grateful to Warren for all he has done for the game in Wales,” Tierney said. “He remains our longest-serving and most decorated head coach in terms of the silverware he has won.”View image in fullscreenWarren Gatland has left his second stint as the Wales head coach by mutual consent.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersThe WRU had previously backed Gatland to remain but is now relying on Sherratt to inject fresh ­enthusiasm into the squad. “I’m not going to come in and overthink it,” Sherratt said, suggesting he wanted the team to pursue a more attractive brand of rugby. “That’s what I believe in. I do think we’ve got a duty [to ensure] people enjoy watching rugby.“I took my boy to watch three games last year. I took him to a ­Liverpool game and he loved it. A cricket game and he loved it. And a rugby game and he asked to leave after 50 minutes. I’m at that stage of my career where it’s important to me that people enjoy watching a team. Not at the expense of losing, but let’s take the brave option.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIt all feels a long way from Wales’s glory days under Gatland, who has also successfully coached the ­British & Irish Lions and was in charge of ­Ireland between 1998 and 2001. Last month, he described this ­season as “a challenging time” but said he would be sticking to the methods that had previously served him well. “It has been tough. You do ­question ­yourself. For me it’s also about ­looking back and asking why have we been success­ful? You have to trust your own instincts and experience.”For years Gatland had a long record as an excellent selector and motivator, as underlined by Johnny Sexton in his autobiography, Obsessed. “What I liked about him was that he had a good sense of what ­players needed and wanted. I liked the way he talked, liked the buttons he pressed. I wouldn’t rate him as highly as Joe [Schmidt] or Andy [Farrell] as a technical coach but those two are among the best ever. As a manager and a selector I thought Gats was quality.”Gatland was certainly a hard‑nosed strategist who, despite hailing from Waikato, developed a real affinity with Wales and its people. He knew what rugby meant to them and how much it hurt when the national team were losing, regardless of their playing resources.The question that will now be being asked is whether jettisoning the head coach will make a significant difference. Off-field politics and financial issues continue to undermine Welsh rugby and the loss of a clutch of now-retired ­senior ­players made Gatland’s job even harder.The former England wing and Guardian columnist Ugo Monye, ­however, believes the current squad lost faith in Gatland a while ago. “I reckon the Welsh players have switched off,” he told The Sports Agents podcast. “I’ve been in those positions. You’re listening to the coach and you’re just rolling your eyes.”Explore more on these topicsWarren GatlandWales rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

A different storm awaits on Wednesday when Liverpool cross Stanley Park one last time intent on silencing taunts about blowing the league at the home of their oldest rivals and containing the fallout from ashock FA Cup exit at Plymouth. There is nowhere else Moyes would rather be than in its midst of it all.“Strange it was rearranged,” the 61-year-old said, reflecting on the opportunity that has blown his way since theMerseyside derby was postponedon 7 December, the inevitable consequence of 70mph winds. Everton have changed owners and manager since then. A new era in a new stadium begins at Bramley-Moore dock next season and, thanks tothree successive league winsunder Moyes, Everton have newfound belief in remaining a Premier League club when they get there.‘Not acceptable’: Slot demands derby response from Liverpool after Cup exitRead moreWednesday, however, is about the old. The 120thderby to be held at a stadium that hosted its first on 13 October, 1894,Evertonwinning 3-0. The score is 41-41 at Goodison in all competitions. It is also the last game scheduled to be played under the Goodison floodlights at present. A huge part of Merseyside football history is about to disappear.Moyes has been immersed in the fixture since his first, in December 2002, ended in a goalless draw at Anfield. Wayne Rooney hit the crossbar and Steven Gerrard embedded his studs in Gary Naysmith’s thighs. Moyes sounded more like a football fan than manager when contemplating the significance of his 23rd Merseyside derby.“We’ve got a derby game which has been going on for 130 years, all of them at Goodison or Anfield,” the Everton manager said. “It is incredible that it is now coming to an end at this stadium. Will it be rougher or tougher because this is the last one? I don’t think so. But the stadium has played a big part in building this up to being a more explosive derby.“I will tell the players about what it means to the supporters [who plan to line Goodison Road to greet the team coach before kick‑off], although if I have to tell them that you’d have to question where they are in their footballing world. The last one at Goodison is a big thing. Everyone here is trying their best to make the last few games memorable and to put on a spectacle.”Everton’s players put one on in thecorresponding fixture last season. Their 2-0 victory was a highlight of Sean Dyche’s reign with wider ramifications for Everton’s Premier League status and Liverpool’s title chances. But while Arne Slot has fine-tuned Liverpool into a stronger title‑winning position this season, Everton are scrambling for safety and starting over yet again. Moyes believes the gulf in quality between the Merseyside rivals may never have been greater.View image in fullscreenDavid Moyes has led Everton to three successive league wins since returning to the club.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockThe Scot won only three of his 22 league derbies first time around – all at Goodison – but in finishing aboveLiverpoolthree times in 11 full seasons as Everton manager he showed the gap can be bridged. “The task is a big one, let’s not kid ourselves, but it’s a one‑off game, especially this one,” Moyes said. “There is a gulf between the teams in quality at the moment and obviously that is shown in the league position as well.“I don’t think Evertonians want me to kid them or tell them any lies.

It took a long time to build that up. Now the gulf has come back. There was a gulf there when I first took over but I think at the moment it is back to that level again, if not further. I feel it was a big achievement to finish above Liverpool because they were always challenging for trophies, or around it, so it meant we had done something right.”Moyes did it without spending, or wasting, the money that his successors at Everton had in the early years of Farhad Moshiri’s ownership. Profitability and sustainability rules again constrained the club in the January transfer window but, with those restrictions expected to ease in the summer, the Everton manager hopes to start anew.“This football club spent lots and lots of money to try and get there and it didn’t necessarily work. We have tried to be that club that challenges the big boys by our spending but, looking back, there probably would have been a slightly better way to do it. I am hoping that we can start building again.”Explore more on these topicsEvertonLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With one match left to play on Wednesday, Jos ­Buttler’s team have six defeats and one ­victory. Should they endure a one‑day international series whitewash, it won’t be off‑Broadway: the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, with its six‑figure capacity, awaits.A year ago it was the Test side that tumbled to a 4-1 defeat. That tour began with a famous victory in Hyderabad and a tasty fifth-Test decider was in the offing when ­England took a first-innings lead in the fourth. Then came the contractually obligated ­collapse to spin before an innings defeat in the final Test.The tourists have had periods of promise here but were thumped at the start and end of the Twenty20 series, and the ODIs have extended a strain of misery that goes back ­decades. England have not won a white-ball series in India for 40 years. This was always going to be a difficult first assignment for Brendon McCullum as white-ball head coach, up against history, the T20 World Cup champions and a crack 50-over team, too.Quick GuideBumrah out of Champions TrophyShowIndia's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out of the Champions Trophy after failing to recover from a lower back injury in time for the tournament, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) announced on Tuesday.Bumrah, the highest wicket-taker in the recent test series with Australia which India lost 3-1, had back spasms during the final test in Sydney last month, which also ruled him out of a five-match T20 international series with England. His absence will be a major blow to India, with the 31-year-old widely considered one of the best all-format fast bowlers in the sport.\"Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy due to a lower back injury. The men's selection committee has named Harshit Rana as Bumrah's replacement,\" the BCCI said in a statement.Rana has played two ODIs, both of which came against England this month, picking up four wickets. The BCCI added that spinner Varun Chakaravarthy, who took 14 wickets in a five-match Twenty20 series against England in January and February, would replace batter Yashasvi Jaiswal.India are in Group A in the Champions Trophy and meet Bangladesh in Dubai on 20 February, before taking on defending champions and rivals Pakistan and ending their group campaign against New Zealand.ReutersIndia squad:Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill (vice captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But the final ODI cannot be an end-of-term fling.Ben Duckett has acknowledgedthat the upcoming Champions Trophy is the priority, that victory there would forgive a series defeat here. But while this is not a side that lacks in optimism, the defeats, ­piling up, must be nibbling away inside, right? England have not won a 50-over series since September 2023. A win, even one that’s consolatory, feels required before a cut-throat major tournament that will feature only three group-stage games.Amid the difficulties, enter Tom Banton. The Somerset batter was called up for the final ODI after Jacob Bethell sustained a hamstring injury last week and is expected to replace the Warwickshire left-hander in the squad for the Champions Trophy, a substantial promotion after three years in international exile.Banton’s story began in 2019 when he was the kid too gifted to ignore after England’s World Cup win, a handful of appearances clocked up in both white-ball forms over the subsequent two years. Everything came in a rush. Lean times on the T20 merry-go-round left him pushed into the background.View image in fullscreenThe absence of Jacob Bethell’s bowling will reduce the number of options the England captain, Jos Buttler, has at his disposal.Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/APHis 2024 was fruitful in the Blast, while a prolific red-ball campaign – 891 County Championship runs at 49.5 – included a remarkable 46 at No 11 against Surrey with an ankle injury. The crocked right-hander used his bat as a walking stick before flaying away with minimal footwork. He finds himself back in England gear after a couple of hundreds in the ILT20 last month.It is a slightly odd call from ­England to replace Bethell with Banton, a southpaw who bowls handy spin substituted by a right-hander who can keep wicket. Banton is largely a top-order man in T20s but his 50‑over identity is a mystery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the 26‑year‑old expected to play in Ahmedabad, he will have to find his one-day tempo against a rampant bowling lineup at a gargantuan venue. It’s a tough ask.Banton joins a batting group in need of someone to play the long game, with four half-centurions in the first two ODIs but no one yet to reach 70. Ravindra Jadeja has caused plenty of grief, six wickets and two red-inkers with the bat. The thing for England to cling on to?

Matt Peet’s side completed anhistoric quadruplelast year and have all the hallmarks of a side that could sweep aside all comers again.Will Wigan dominate 2025 just like they did in 2024? Can the likes ofWarrington, Hull KR and Leeds put up a credible challenge? And who is in a struggle to avoid finishing bottom? Here is the Guardian’s team-by-team guide to the new season.Castleford TigersIt is a fresh start for Castleford in 2025 with the legendaryLeeds Rhinoshalf-back Danny McGuire taking the reins in his first head-coaching role, but he has inherited a tough situation in West Yorkshire. The Tigers struggled throughout 2024 and, while they have added some new recruits, their Challenge Cup defeat against the Championship side Bradford on Sunday underlined this may be another season of struggle.CoachDanny McGuireCaptainSam WoodKeyplayerJudah RimbuLastseason10thPrediction11thCatalans DragonsFew clubs are as intriguing as the Dragons going into 2025. They have undergone a recruitment overhaul with big names including the Sydney Roosters star Luke Keary heading to the south of France. But with such a big turnover of players it is difficult to predict how Catalans will perform. Expect them to start slow and improve, but the battle for the top six is so tight that any sluggish opening could be costly.CoachSteve McNamaraCaptainBenjamin GarciaKeyplayerLuke KearyLastseason7thPrediction8thView image in fullscreenLuke Keary has swapped Sydney for south west France.Photograph: Mark Evans /AAP/AlamyHuddersfield GiantsThere are a cluster of teams at the bottom end trying to avoid the wooden spoon and Huddersfield look destined to be one of them. They are desperately lacking in the half-back department and are already struggling with injuries. Luke Robinson’s first full year as head coach could be a chastening one and any big change to their IMG score could put them in danger of relegation by the end of the year too.CoachLuke RobinsonCaptainLeroy CudjoeKeyplayerTom BurgessLastseason9thPrediction12thHull FCIt has been a bruising few years for Hull, culminating in an 11th-place finish last season. That is unacceptable for a club the size of the Black and Whites, and the Australian John Cartwright has been assigned the hefty task of restoring them to the upper echelons ofSuper League. They will improve in 2025 – how could they not – but this will be a long-term rebuild.CoachJohn CartwrightCaptainAidan SezerKeyplayerAidan SezerLastseason11thPrediction10thView image in fullscreenNew skipper Aidan Sezer has joined from Wests Tigers.Photograph: James Gourley /AAP/AlamyHull KRIt was a season to remember for the Robins in 2024, though it ended in familiar fashion: still without a major trophy since 1985. That run has to end at some point. Could it be this year? Perhaps. They have not sat around idly, recruiting the NRL superstar Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and the England winger Tom Davies, among others. Willie Peters’s side will be right in the mix again but can they get over the line in a big game?CoachWillie PetersCaptainElliot MinchellaKeyplayerMikey LewisLastseason2nd and Grand Final runners-upPrediction3rdLeeds RhinosAnother year, another failure to make the playoffs for Leeds Rhinos in 2024. But Brad Arthur’s first full season as Leeds coach will probably lead to a change in that regard, with Arthur already making his mark in West Yorkshire after taking over midway through last year. Their legendary winger Ryan Hall returns for a second spell at Headingley – and this feels like a Rhinos squad capable of pushing themselves back in the conversation when it comes to trophies in 2025.CoachBrad ArthurCo-captainsCameron Smith and Ash HandleyKeyplayerBrodie CroftLastseason8thPrediction5thView image in fullscreenBrodie Croft evades the tackle by Seth Nikotemo of Wakefield Trinity.Photograph: Touchlinepics/AlamyLeigh LeopardsLeigh are now a bona fide top-end Super League club – and the recruitment they have done for 2025 suggests that theme will continue. Mainstays of their recent success such as John Asiata and Tom Amone have left but the Leopards have dragged down the average age of their squad and look primed to compete again. Watch out for the full-back David Armstrong, signed from the NRL club Newcastle. He could light up the Super League.CoachAdrian LamCaptainLeadership groupKeyplayerDavid ArmstrongLastseason5thPrediction4thSalford Red DevilsHaving survived a winter of financial turmoil when it seemed certain their squad would be broken up, Salford have new owners and renewed optimism about what they can achieve. They strengthened a squad that finished fourth last year and are certainly going to be in the conversation for the playoffs again. But the competition around them is tough, and any test of their squad’s limited depth could be important.CoachPaul RowleyCaptainKallum WatkinsKeyplayerMarc SneydLastseason4thPrediction6thSt HelensThe Saints came within a whisker of missing out on the playoffs for the first time in Super League history last year. The early signs suggest they might be embroiled in a similar fight in 2025. It is tight in the middle of the table, with Paul Wellens’s side in a five-way battle for three spots in the top six. Tristan Sailor, son of the legendary Wendell, headlines their new recruits.

They return with a revamped, modernised Belle Vue, an A grade from IMG and a different force to the club who were relegated in 2023. They quietly fancy their chances of making the playoffs; and it cannot be ruled out completely. They certainly will not be in any battle for the wooden spoon, but a top six spot might be a stretch too far.CoachDaryl PowellCaptainMike McMeekenKeyplayerJake TruemanLastseasonChampionship Grand Final winnersPrediction9thWarrington WolvesSam Burgess’s first season in charge at Warrington was hugely encouraging. A Challenge Cup final and a playoff semi-final resembled real progress; but, likeHull KR, success for them will now be defined by winning a trophy. They have the tools to do so, and could easily be Wigan’s closest challengers. The form of the England captain George Williams, arguably Super League’s best player, will be key.CoachSam BurgessCaptainGeorge WilliamsKeyplayerGeorge WilliamsLastseason3rdPrediction2ndWigan WarriorsCan anyone stop the all-conquering champions in 2025? The easy answer would be no. Matt Peet’s side won a historic grand slam last year, becoming only the fifth side in rugby league history to win every trophy on offer in a single season. Worryingly for their rivals, there appears to be no weaknesses in their game, and the smart money would be on a third successive Super League crowd for a Wigan side who are Super League’s elite force at present.CoachMatt PeetCaptainLiam FarrellKeyplayerBevan FrenchLastseason1st and Grand Final winnersPrediction1st and Grand Final winnersExplore more on these topicsSuper LeagueCastlefordCatalans DragonsHuddersfield GiantsHull KRHull FCLeeds RhinosanalysisShareReuse this content"

The current handicapper, Martin Greenwood, however, takes less notice of past performances at the track and I Am Maximus will line up just 8lb higher in the weights compared to last year’s race.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowSouthwell:11.55 Moon Over The Sea 12.25 Smokey Malone 12.55 Agent Mayfair 1.30 First Ambition 2.05 Mumayaz (nap) 2.40 Ash Wednesday 3.15 Manyana Blue 3.50 McKenna 4.20 Cut To The Chase (nb).Hereford:1.10 Tommy The Tank 1.43 Play It Again 2.18 Simple Getaway 2.53 Boys Of Wexford 3.28 Olivia Kate 4.03 Reallyntruthfully 4.38 Race To Base.Wetherby:1.55 Wendigo 2.30 Sound And Fury 3.05 Live Conti 3.40 Getaway Drumlee 4.13 Il Va De Soi 4.48 Royal Rhythm.Kempton:4.25 Brasil Power 5.00 Galette 5.30 Perfect Parole 6.00 Megalithic 6.30 More Than A Feelin 7.00 Cajetan 7.30 Upepo 8.00 Stacey Racey.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There is always a minus to balance every plus in the National, however, as Willie Mullins, I Am Maximus’s trainer, conceded. “It’s top weight and it’s tough, but we had an idea that it would be,” Mullins said. “My worry is that sometimes when they go back, they don’t like it, but he looked to love it last year so hopefully he’ll come back and be as good as he was last year.”The top three horses in the early National betting all carry the green and gold colours of JP McManus, as Gavin Cromwell’s Inothewayurthinkin, fourth home in the Irish Gold Cup this month and set to carry 11st 5lb, is priced up at 10-1, while Iroko, from Oliver Greenall’s and Josh Guerriero’s stable in Cheshire, is the first British-trained runner in the lists at 14-1.Horses trained in Ireland filled six of the first seven places at Aintree last April and both Mullins and Gordon Elliott have multiple entries in the latest renewal. Mullins highlighted the chances of both the 33-1 shot Meetingofthewaters (10st 7lb) – yet another runner for the McManus operation – and the recent Thyestes Chase winner, Nick Rockett (11st 8lb), at Tuesday’s annual lunch in Liverpool to unveil the weights.“I think Meetingofthewaters has a lovely weight,” Mullins said. “He ran very well last year and I think my eye was drawn to him when I saw his weight. He’s one I like.”Ireland’s challenge is likely to be further strengthened by Intense Raffles, theIrish Grand National winnerlast year, from Tom Gibney’s stable near Trim in County Meath.Intense Raffles (10st 10lb) has had two quiet runs over hurdles since his success at Fairyhouse last April, when he was the youngest horse in the field, and will have one more outing in a chase – in order to qualify for Aintree – as Gibney primes the seven-year-old to be at his peak on the first weekend in April. At around 16-1, he is possibly the pick of the early prices.“We’re hoping to get serious now as we get a bit closer,” Gibney said. “All being well, he’ll run again, not this weekend but the next weekend at Fairyhouse. It was a great performance [in the Irish National] and if we can get him back to that, I’d be very happy.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingGrand NationalHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Cutting methane, a gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, wouldgive the world breathing space in the fight to control temperature rises, many scientists have said.The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been assessing the use of 3-NOP and says the additive has undergone rigorous testing over 10 years. According to Bovaer’s manufacturer, DSM-Firmenich, the additive is now approved in 68 countries and given to more than 200,000 cows.But what should have been an exciting announcement of a pioneering scheme to help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quickly became a social media storm about the health effects of the additive, with people videoing themselves throwing away products by the brand and pouring milk down their sinks in protest.On 2 December, the Reform MP Rupert Lowestated on Xthat he “won’t be consuming anything containing Bovaer”, and had requested that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs undertook “an urgent review of its use in our food system”.Some posters had been linking to a report by the FSA published in 2023 that found 3-NOP “should be considered corrosive to the eyes, a skin irritant, and potentially harmful by inhalation” to humans handling it.The agency eventually had to release further guidance on the safety of using Bovaer, stating that the additive breaks down in the digestive tract and is therefore not present in milk produced by the cows ingesting it, so would not pose any risk for human consumption. The guidance above would only apply to handling 3-NOP in its pure form at the manufacturing stage.Other concerned social media users pointed to claims that 3-NOP could cause cancer. However, the results ofa UK government assessmenthad concluded: “The additive is not carcinogenic at the recommended inclusion rate.”Somehow Bill Gates got dragged in too, with one variant of the conspiracy arguing that he was using his wealth to invest in population control – referring again to the concerns that if handled in its pure form, 3-NOP could cause male infertility.While the Microsoft co-founder has no connection to Bovaer, or its manufacturer, he hasinvested in a rival startupcalled Rumin8, which develops a similar methane-reducing product using seaweed to break down the gas.Arla released a statement dismissing any involvement from Gates in the trials, and DSM-Firmenich, a Swiss-Dutch company that develops products for the health, beauty, and nutrition industries, said it had “fully developed” Bovaer and that the company had “no other investors”.The FSA website said: “The FSA safety assessment concluded there are no safety concerns when Bovaer is used at the approved dose.“More than 58 studies on potential risks were evaluated and it was concluded that the additive is safe at twice the recommended dose. The additive is metabolised by the cows so does not pass into the milk. It was not found in milk in any of the trials presented to the FSA.”Answering questions at a press briefing on Monday about the scale of the misinformation, Dr Sinéad Waters, a senior researcher in host microbiome interactions at the University of Galway, said, “It’s a good wake-up call to scientists because really communication is with the farmers.“We want to bring everyone along with us on the journey. Communication is key, we need to do more of that, not just with the farmers but with the general public.”Also speaking at the briefing at the Science Media Centre was Prof Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the FSA. He said: “The overwhelming response we saw from the public was confusion rather than jumping on board. The more communication and transparency the better.”Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsCattleBiologyFarmingClimate crisisFood & drink industrySocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

A leading immigration barrister has claimed that it is a breach of international law.The development will be seen as the latest evidence that Keir Starmer’s government has adopted a hardline “hostile environment” stance on asylum to fight off a poll surge by Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.Senior Tories claim that the government’s new border security bill, which passed its second reading on Monday, will repeal parts of the Illegal Migration Act, which would stop irregular arrivals from becoming British citizens.One Labour MP has joined charities in calling for the government to reverse the guidance with immediate effect.Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, wrote on X: “This should be changed asap. If we give someone refugee status, it can’t be right to then refuse them [a] route to become a British citizen.”The changes, first disclosed by theFree Movementblog, were introduced to guidance for visa and immigration staff on Monday.Described as a “clarification” to case worker guidance when assessing if a claimant is of “good character’, it says: “Any person applying for citizenship from 10 February 2025, who previously entered the UK illegally will normally be refused, regardless of the time that has passed since the illegal entry took place.”In another new entry to the same guidance, it says: “A person who applies for citizenship from 10 February 2025 who has previously arrived without a required valid entry clearance or electronic travel authorisation, having made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship.“A dangerous journey includes, but is not limited to, travelling by small boat or concealed in a vehicle or other conveyance.”Most people who enter the UK on small boats are eventually granted refugee status. A majority of those granted refugee status eventually claim British citizenship. Seeking UK citizenship costs £1,630 an application, and there is no right of appeal against a refusal.Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister and editor of the blog, wrote on Bluesky: “This is bad, full stop. It creates a class of person who are forever excluded from civic life no matter how long they live here. It’s also a clear breach of the refugee convention.”Article 31 of the UN refugee convention says: “The contracting states shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees.”Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the move “flies in the face of reason. The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities.“So many refugees over many generations have become proud hard-working British citizens as doctors, entrepreneurs and other professionals. Becoming a British citizen has helped them give back to their communities and this should be celebrated, not prevented.”The Home Office was accused on Monday of“enabling the mainstreaming of racism”after releasing footage for the first time showing people being removed from the UK.The government believes its record on migration could help retain Labour voters tempted by Farage’s party. On Sunday, it released footage of immigration raids for illegal workers, prompting the MP Diane Abbott to say: “Trying to present ourselves as Reform-lite is a big mistake.”Home office insiders said the guidance rules were tightened so that the government would replace the ban that was imposed by the cancelled Illegal Migration Act.The IMA disqualified refugees who arrived in the UK by irregular means from claiming UK citizenship.A Home Office spokesperson said: “There are already rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship.“This guidance further strengthens measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused.”Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeImmigration and asylumRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

The cache of thousands of messages spans a period from 2019 to 2022.‘Vile’ Labour WhatsApp group exposes toxic divisions in Andrew Gwynne’s power baseRead moreGwynne is also alleged to have sent messages suggesting a local cycling campaigner should be “mown down” by a lorry, and hoping a pensioner who didn’t vote Labour “croaks it” before an election.“I’m shocked and upset, and not just myself [but] my family, my partner, my children, have been profoundly distressed by this,” the cyclist told the Guardian on Monday.In further messages seen by the Guardian, Gwynne refers to a constituent as a “grade-A wanker” and says: “The public are arseholes. I know, I’ve met them …”He also described a constituent as “an illiterate retard” and a fellow councillor as a “fat middle-aged useless thicket”.In a post on X, Gwynne apologised for “badly misjudged” comments, saying: “While very sad to have been suspended, will support [Labour and the prime minister] in any way I can.”A second MP, Oliver Ryan, who represents Burnley in Lancashire, and was previously a councillor in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was suspended by the party on Monday over his membership of, and comments in, the group.Posting on X, he said some of the comments made in the group were “completely unacceptable”.“I regret not speaking out at the time, and I recognise that failing to do so was wrong,” he said.It is thought that about 44 people were members of the WhatsApp group.Those suspended by Labour are two from Stockport and nine from Tameside councils.Reddish, part of Stockport, used to be in Gwynne’s constituency of Denton and Reddish before boundary changes.It is understood the Tameside councillors include Gwynne’s wife, Allison Gwynne, former council leader Brenda Warrington, and Claire Reid, a member of Labour’s national policy forum.One post in the group by Allison Gwynne suggested local children “always enjoyed swimming in street rubbish/raw sewage”.According to party insiders, the chat was originally set up to discuss routine business, such as campaign literature, and electioneering, but soon turned “nasty”.Gerald Cooney, the former Labour leader of Tameside council in Greater Manchester, said he had told senior party officials about the WhatsApp group “well over a year ago”, and raised it several times.A Labour source said the party had not received any formal complaint about the WhatsApp group.One senior member of the Tameside Labour group said the party was “in chaos” and some were “fuming” at being suspended.“I know from talking to councillors some of them are fuming because they’re being associated with those vile posts. Just by their suspension it looks like they’ve been involved but they’ve never posted anything on that group,” they said.“Tameside Labour is in chaos now. We’ve got to consider the position of the leader because she appointed those people [Gwynne’s allies] to cabinet positions just a few months ago, with the blessing of the national party. This is completely untenable.”“As part of our WhatsApp group investigation, a group of councillors have been administratively suspended from the Labour party,” a spokesperson said.“As soon as this group was brought to our attention, a thorough investigation was launched in line with the Labour party’s rules and procedures and this process is ongoing. Swift action will always be taken where individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour party members.”Explore more on these topicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I gave it a second reading as I thought it would be strengthened and it sounds like it is going in the wrong direction.”On Tuesday, Leadbeater said the billwould still have the strongest safeguards of any country in the worldand the panel, with a senior lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, would have more expertise to spot potential abuse.Opponents of the bill circulated a list of 80 MPs who had directly cited the judicial safeguards as a key reason to support it. The bill passed its first Commons hurdle in November with a majority of 55.But several MPs said they believed the bill had materially changed since they cast their votes, with one describing it as “pulling the rug from under us.”Another said they were concerned that having a decision made by social workers or lawyers was a very different method to a decision by a judge, as they did not necessarily have to be neutral on the issue.At least one MP is understood to be preparing to announce they will switch their vote at the final Commons stage, which is expected to take place on 25 April.A group of eight Labour MPs opposed to the bill, including Antonia Bance, Jess Asato and James Frith, said in a statement that the process had become “chaotic” and the bill had changed “significantly from what was presented to parliament at second reading.”“Supporters of the bill insisted that [High Court scrutiny] was a key part of the protections for vulnerable and marginalised people,” they said. “Yet despite repeated assurances until just days ago the proponents of the bill have changed their argument - and fundamentally changed the bill.”The Labour MP Anna Dixon, one of those who proposed an amendment to slow down the bill’s progress in November, said: “If the proponents of the bill can U-turn on something as fundamental as the role of the high court, it seriously calls into question whether the rest of the bill is fit for purpose.“Attempting to change the law on assisted dying through a private member’s bill has, as I feared it would, resulted in fundamental issues being rushed over.”The former home secretary, James Cleverly, who voted against the bill, said the government should now scrap the private member’s bill and give it government time.“It’s clearly got support from Keir Starmer,” he told LBC.“It should be taken over as a government bill and given the proper scrutiny in detail that it deserves. I’m not convinced that this is the right way forward. But if this does end up on the legislation books, if this does become law, it is absolutely key that the best quality legislation is passed, not just something that gets rattled through.”On Thursday, the full amendment is expected to be tabled for the committee of MPs who are scrutinising the bill. However, a vote is not expected to take place until after parliament’s February recess.Amendments tabled by Leadbeater are also likely to be amended by MPs who are sceptical of the change. More than 350 amendments have already been submitted by MPs.One senior MP working with those in favour of the bill said they believed there was enough time to win many MPs over to the change. “A lot of people are not living and breathing this – they need to have it explained beyond the headline – in the end I don’t think we will lose a lot of people,” they said.Speaking to the BBC, Leadbeater defended making the change at this stage in the process, saying it was in response to evidence heard from witnesses.But Kruger said it was a key safeguard that had convinced MPs to vote in favour of the bill initially. “I don’t think it would have passed the House of Commons if this new system [was in place].”MPs on the committee – which includes Leadbeater and Kruger – began the formal scrutiny of the original bill on Tuesday, when MPs clashed over an amendment which would use stronger criteria to assess mental capacity of a patient.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It also wants to see promisedplanning reforms to minimise further legal challengesof the kind that havepreviously held upits runway plans.Woldbye is expected to say: “A third runway is critical for the country’s future economic success, and I confirm we will submit our plans for a third runway to government this summer.“Ahead of then, as part of a phased expansion programme and supported by the government’s clear backing, I am today confirming multibillion-pound investment plans, 100% privately funded, to upgrade our terminal buildings, enhance passenger experience, and improve resilience and sustainability.“This is vital investment and will ensure Heathrow remains globally competitive and a jewel in the country’s crown – the UK’s gateway to growth.”A Heathrow-commissioned report by Frontier Economics,cited by Reeves, has estimated that more than 60% of growth from building another runway would accrue in regions outside the south-east of England.Several hundred thousand tons of steel would be needed, and Woldbye is expected to sign a charter in Scunthorpe pledging to maximise the use of UK steel in the runway’s construction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An alliance including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic claimed that customers were paying in total £1.1bn more each year than they would if charged in line with other major European airports – and warned that expansion plans would make Heathrow even more expensive.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayAirline industryHeathrow airportLondonAir transportSteel industryLincolnshirenewsShareReuse this content"

United employees are yet to be contacted formally by management regarding their jobs potentially being in danger, but it is believed they are braced for this to occur.Ineos blames ‘deindustrialisation of Europe’ for ending All Blacks dealRead moreAfter becoming the single largest minority shareholder last year Ratcliffe injected £300m into the club. But despite this funding the redevelopment of United’s Carrington training base, the long-term financial situation remains challenging due to the on- and off-pitch costs remaining high.In the January window United bought only Patrick Dorgu from Lecce for £25m despite Ruben Amorim’s squad needing a major overhaul – the majority of the players he inherited on becoming head coach in late October not being suited to his 3-4-3 system.How much finance Ratcliffe’s proposed redundancies will generate for the summer transfer market is unclear. United’s limited winter window budget came despite the 250 previous cuts and offoading 75% of Marcus Rashford’s £365,000 weekly salary by loaning him to via the deal struck with Aston Villa.In late November United’s accounts revealed the club had to pay £21.4m to sack Erik ten Hag and hire Amorim as the Dutchman’s replacement. Ten Hag was removed on 28 October, with his coaching staff René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar, Pieter Morel and Ruud van Nistelrooy all following. A total of £10.4m was paid in compensation to do so.Signing Amorim, plus the coaching quintet of Carlos Fernandes, Jorge Vital, Adélio Cândido, Emanuel Ferro and Paulo Barreira who followed him from Sporting, cost a further £11m.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

We need a step-change in the way we do safeguarding.”The Church of England is beset by shame and division. Can it survive?Read moreEarlier, Prof Alexis Jay, who chaired the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and separately advised the C of E on safeguarding, also said it was “absolutely necessary” for the synod to back full independence.“Church safeguarding, as it stands, falls below the standards of secular organisations, and I do not think that can continue when it has also led to such serious weaknesses,” she told the BBC.Abuse survivors protested outside Church House in Westminster on Tuesday morning, pleading with synod members to make the C of E’s safeguarding processes fully independent.The vote on the most pressing issue facing the C of E came three months afterJustin Welbyannounced his resignation as the archbishop of Canterbury after being criticised in a report onJohn Smyth, a sadistic abuserof young men, that found opportunities to halt his actions were not taken. The report and Welby’s departure plunged the church into turmoil.Since then, Cottrell has facedrepeated calls to resignover alleged failings over dealing with abuse. John Perumbalath alsostepped down as bishop of Liverpoolafter allegations of sexual misconduct were revealed by Channel 4 News.Joanne Grenfell, the bishop of Stepney and the C of E’s lead bishop on safeguarding, told synod members on Tuesday that the church needed to act to “end a painful and shameful time of reckoning” on abuse. Radical change was necessary, even though it would be complex and lengthy, she said.After her motion was amended, she said she was “disappointed that we have not done as much as we could have done today”.The Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, who represents the C of E in the House of Commons, said the church was facing a “watershed moment” and that it must show parliament and the public that it is “fully committed to change”. Full independence was the “first step towards restoring trust”, she said.However, Jonathan Gibbs, the bishop of Rochester, argued that retaining local safeguarding professionals within the C of E’s structures, where they could “see and challenge the way things are done day by day” offered the “best chance for changing the culture” of the church.The decision to stop short of full independence was likened to taking a “slow train … that might be derailed” by synod member Rev Canon Paul Cartwright.After the vote, Fr Robert Thompson, a London priest who has campaigned for safeguarding to be made fully independent of the C of E, said he was disappointed.“My hope is that the ambition and vision [of full independence] remains our ultimate destination,” he said. “The majority of survivors and victims want this, as well as those watching us in parliament and the public at large. The reputation of the church and any moral authority that we have in the nation requires this to remain our ultimate goal.”Outside the meeting before the debate, Craig Freedman, an abuse survivor, said the church should “close its doors” if it did not back full independence. “I have lost all my faith. As far as I’m concerned, the church has persecuted me throughout my life,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismChristianityReligionChild protectionRape and sexual assaultChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

It has indicated a preferred scenario where copyright restrictions are relaxed for AI developers, provided they flag what works they use and if the creative industries have the opportunity to “opt out” of the process. It describes such an outcome as “the primary object of this consultation”.“Why have a preferred choice if it is an open consultation?” said Kidron.The other options are: to leave the situation unchanged; require AI companies to seek licences for using copyrighted work; and allow AI firms to use copyrighted work with no opt-out for creative companies and individuals.The row over copyright returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday with the second reading of the data (use and access) bill, which contains amendments from Kidron passed in the Lords last month.“What I say to MPs is, if you are members of a government that has put all its chips on growth, why is that same government undermining creative industries that bring£126bn to the UK economyand is giving away for free the property rights of 2.4 million people who work in those industries? The creative industries impact every constituency, region and nation,” she said.Kidron’s amendments aim to tackle the unauthorised use of copyrighted material to train the AI models that underpin products such as chatbots and image generators.The amendments, which can be removed by the government in the Commons, subject AI companies to UK copyright law wherever they are based and allow copyright owners to know when, where and how their work is used in AI systems. It also requires the naming of web crawlers that are used to scrape copyrighted data for use in AI models.“For more than 300 years we have had a gold-plated copyright regime but now the tech companies and the government are walking around saying it is unclear,” said Kidron. “Actually, it’s not unclear. Tech firms have come in with their [web] crawlers, taken all the copyrighted material, said ‘whoops it’s unclear’. But it is not unclear.”She added: “My amendments mandate that companies have to account for where and when they take the material and make it transparent. It makes copyright law fit for the age of AI. It makes tech accountable.”Campaigners for theprotection of the rights of creative professionalshave come out against the government proposal to allow AI companies to train the models on copyrighted work – unless creatives opt out of the process in what the government is calling a “rights reservation” system. The opt-out proposal has been met with scepticism from opponents of the government consultation, who say there is no evidence of a “water-tight” rights reservation process in any country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AI models such as the GPT-4o model powering theChatGPT chatbotare “trained” on huge amounts of data taken from the internet, where they in effect learn to spot patterns in that information – allowing them to predict, for instance, the next word in a sentence or to create realistic images.Kidron said pushing ahead with the changes would benefit the tech sector at the expense of its creative counterpart.“The government is suggesting a wholesale transfer of wealth from a hugely successful sector that invests hundreds of millions in the UK to a tech industry that extracts profit that is not assured and will accrue largely to the US and indeed China.”A government spokesperson said it was “important that everyone remains open-minded about this consultation and what it could deliver for all parties”.The spokesperson added: “This consultation remains open and is part of an ongoing conversation, and no move will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives: increased control for right holders to help them license their content, access to high-quality material to train leading AI models in the UK, and more transparency for right holders.”The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said he “very, very deeply” respected the work produced by the UK creative industries. Speaking to the Guardian last week before Kidron made her comments, Kyle said the present legal situation regarding copyright was “not tenable”, a situation reflected bylegal standoffsbetween tech businesses and the creative sector.“I’m working really carefully with the tech sector so that we can produce the reassurance they need, that there will be technical solutions to things like transparency and making sure that those remarkable people, who create remarkable pieces of art, are respected for it.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyComputingChatGPTBeeban KidronnewsShareReuse this content"

This is reflected in our signing of agreements on sustainability and cybersecurity today at the Paris AI Action summit,” the spokesperson said. “However, we felt the declaration didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.”Confirmation of the snub came soon after the US vice-president,JD Vance, took to the stage at the Grand Palais to criticise Europe’s “excessive regulation” of technology and warn against cooperating with China.Asked if Britain had declined to sign because it wanted to follow the US lead, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said they were “not aware of the US reasons or position” on the declaration. A government source rejected the suggestion that Britain was trying to curry favour with the US.But a Labour MP said: “I think we have little strategic room but to be downstream of the US.” They added that US AI firms could stop engaging withthe UK government’s AI Safety Institute, a world-leading research body, if Britain was perceived to be taking an overly restrictive approach to the development of the technology.Campaign groups criticised the UK’s decision and said it risked damaging its reputation in this area. Andrew Dudfield, the head of AI at Full Fact, said the UK risked “undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation” and that there needed to be “bolder government action to protect people from corrosive AI-generated misinformation”.Gaia Marcus, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, which focuses on AI research, said the UK’s actions “go against the vital global governance that AI needs.”The Élysée Palace said more countries might sign the declaration in the hours after the two-day summit.Vance’s hard-hitting speech, in front of leaders including theFrench president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, indicated dissatisfaction with the global approach to regulating and developing the technology. Starmerdid not attend the summit, with the tech secretary, Peter Kyle, representing the UK.Vance, in his first trip abroad as US vice-president, warned against the EU’s regulatory approach, stating that “excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Singling out the DSA, which regulates social media, the vice-president said: “It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet. And it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation.”Vance also referred to the risks of partnering with “authoritarian” regimes, in a pointed allusion to China – without mentioning the country directly. Referring to exports of CCTV and 5G equipment – key Chinese tech products – by authoritarian governments, he said there was a cost: “Partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term.”As the Chinese vice-premier, Zhang Guoqing, sat yards away, Vance added: “Some of us in this room have learned from experience partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true, just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley, if you aren’t paying for the product: you are the product.”Vance started his speech by cautioning against an excessive focus on safety, in an apparent criticism of the first global AI summit in the UK in 2023, which was badged as the AI Safety Summit. He indicated that he thought the Bletchley Park meeting was too cautious, referring to gatherings about cutting-edge technology that can be “too self-conscious, too risk averse”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)JD VanceChinaEuropeUS foreign policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

I’m a parent, that’s it. I’m no expert on youth crime, but I do know that we’re in a crisis and that we’ve got to stand up and do something and there has to be joined-up thinking.”Elba’s appearance at the event was to support thePremier LeagueKicks programme, which provides free, weekly football sessions across the country for young people at risk of antisocial behaviour, including youth violence.View image in fullscreenThe actor met players and coaches from the West Ham Foundation, part of the Premier League Kicks programme.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAfter meeting teenagers and coaches from the West Ham Foundation, which runs the local sessions in Dagenham, Elba joined community leaders from across the country involved in the programme, some of whom have been affected by knife crime or serious youth violence, to discuss the issue.In the course of the discussion, the topic of trauma arose, particularly how it was a common experience among those involved in, or affected by, youth violence.Elba said he had asked some of the teenagers whether the sessions helped young people “stay away from knife crime and violence”. They told him they did.“There was a massive real impact of it and that sense of belonging was important in the understanding about trauma, dialogue and understanding. You never know what any of these kids are going through at home, what their environment is. But here feels like family.”Last month, Elbafronted a documentaryhighlighting the issue of knife crime in the UK. Before its release, he called for kitchen knives to be sold only with rounded ends, and, last year, he urged the government to ban the sale of machetes and “zombie” knives.After Southport, Westminster is floundering. It should look to Idris Elba | Martin KettleRead moreElba told the Guardian he had decided to host the documentary because he did not understand the issue “as much as I needed to”. He said: “It’s one thing saying: we’ve got to stop knife crimes, we’ve got to ban knives, but understanding why was really important to be effective in messaging.”Last September, Elba participated in a summit on knife crime. He was joined by the prime minister, Keir Starmer; the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and those who had lost loved ones to knife crime.Elba said he was confident that the government would “pay attention” to the issue. “I’m hoping that the recent awareness that we’ve seen happen is enough of a driver to push them to do change. Needless to say, no – one wants to see any more needless or senseless deaths,” he said.View image in fullscreenElba with some of the young people at the West Ham Foundation session.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianStephen Clayman, the national lead for knife crime for the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council, said that grassroots initiatives such as the Premier League scheme could “make the biggest difference”.“We’ve got to think about what young people would be attracted to,” he said. “Anything that could get attention of someone who is distracted by other things in their lives, gives them a route in and helps them make better life choices.”He said such programmes needed investment to continue running. “Whether that’s government investment or private investment from other industries, it is fundamental that we don’t give up because this is where you make the biggest difference,” he said.Explore more on these topicsKnife crimeIdris ElbaYoung peopleCrimePolicePremier LeagueLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

As a bonus it would turn a part of this protected area south of the capital, Prague, into a nature-rich wetland.First drafted in 2018, the project had a building permit but was delayed by negotiations over the land, long used by the military as training grounds. Yet before the excavators got the green light to begin digging, the herbivorous rodents set to work building a dam of their own.‘Beaver-bombing’: unauthorised rodent releases on the rise in English riversRead moreBohumil Fišer from the Czech Nature Conservation Agency told AFP: “They built a wetland with pools and canals. The area is roughly twice larger than planned.”The beaver family then moved on to a gulley encircling the ponds, in which the conservationists wanted to build little dams to allow overspill that would help flood the area.Among nature’s great engineers, beavers have long been championed by environmentalists for their ability to protect against flooding, improve water quality and boost wildlife.So far the beavers have built at least four dams in the gulley and are working on more.No 10 blocks beaver release plan as officials view it as ’Tory legacy’Read moreFišer, who manages the area, said: “We were only discussing [building the dams in the gulleys] with the water company and the forest company which owns the land.”He said the estimated savings to the Czech purse reached 30m Czech koruna (£1m).Fišer said: “It’s full service: beavers are absolutely fantastic and when they are in an area where they can’t cause damage, they do a brilliant job.”Despite the good beavers do to the land around them, the rodents have their critics, with farmers and others complaining of the destruction they cause by felling trees. But any farmers whose land could be at risk are located far from the site, which was declared a protected area in 2016.Fišer said: “We don’t expect any conflict with the beaver in the next 10 years.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAnimalsCzech RepublicEuropeShareReuse this content"

Under the2020 policy, Goldman had stated that it would only take on a company’s initial public offering if the company had at least one board member from a diverse background.Deloitte US has instructed staff working on contracts for the American government to remove pronouns from their emails, becoming the latest company to change policies in wake of Trump’s anti-diversity push.The consultancy and accounting giant reportedly gave contracted staff until 7 February to scrub pronouns from email signatures, while also announcing it would end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programme.The instructions were sent in an email to 15,000 staff in Deloitte’s government and public services practice, which explained the move was meant to “align with emerging government client practices and requirements”.Staff were also told on Monday that the company was planning to “sunset” its annual diversity report and wider DEI programming, according to a report by the Financial Times.Goldman said it was reacting to a court decision that removed a requirement by Nasdaq, the tech-led stock market, for companies to disclose board-level diversity information.“As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,” Goldman said in a statement. “We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.”It is the latest sign that private companies are bowing to pressure from the White House to ditch DEI policies that conservatives claim result in “reverse discrimination”.Trump usedexecutive orders last monthto reverse DEI policies in the federal government. Government staff are now required to report any colleagues they believe are furthering DEI efforts “in disguise”, and have received emails warning of “adverse consequences” if they fail to report any colleagues who are still carrying out DEI measures.While the orders do not apply to private companies, Trump has asked the US attorney general’s office to look into ways that it can get them to apply to the private sector.The shareholder advisory service ISS is also bowing to anti-diversity pressures ahead of the annual general meeting season.The company – which helps shareholders including large pension funds and asset managers decide how to vote at AGMs – said that from 25 February, it would no longer recommend voting against any US company’s board members for failing to hit gender/ethnicity leadership targets.ISS said it reflected the fact that companies and investors would be considering how and whether “they should adapt their specific policies and practices to the evolving market and governmental activity”, after Trump’s executive order.“In light of these developments, ISS will indefinitely halt consideration of certain diversity factors in making vote recommendations … [and] will no longer consider the gender and racial and/or ethnic diversity of a company’s board when making vote recommendations with respect to the election or re-election of directors at US companies.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mangione also carried fake identification and a notebook expressing disdain for the US’s rapacious private health insurance industry as well as its wealthy executives, investigators have alleged.Federal prosecutors later charged Mangione with interstate stalking and using a firearm to commit murder. Meanwhile, in a case to be pursued in parallel inNew York, state prosecutors charged him with murder and terrorism.The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, said Mangione deserved the terrorism accusations because the killing blamed on him was a “frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation”.Mangione could face the death penalty if convicted in federal court while his state charges carry a maximum of life imprisonment. He has pleaded not guilty.A group calling itself the December 4th Legal Committee raised the money on GiveSendGo that Mangione’s defense team has said it would accept. The group’s page says it is “not here to celebrate violence” but believes “in the constitutional right of fair legal representation”.In remarks to ABC News, Friedman Agnifilo said Mangione “plans on utilizing [the money] to fight all … of the unprecedented cases against him”.Apollpublished in late December by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago concluded that most Americans believe the health insurance’s profits – aided greatly by routine denials of coverage – shared some responsibility for Thompson’s slaying. But the survey found about 80% of Americans believed Thompson’s killer had either “a great deal” or “a moderate amount” of responsibility for the murder.Despite that poll, some who have contributed to Mangione’s legal defense fund on GiveSendGo made it clear that – in their eyes – he had done nothing wrong.“Let’s defend the [right] for self defense,” one contributor wrote on the platform. “Mangione’s actions were an act [where] he [defends] his own right to life.”Another wrote: “Free the guy, his work here isn’t done (he’s innocent)!”Mangione was an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland family. He appeared to have cut himself off from friends and relatives in the months before Thompson’s murder, posting frequently in online forums about his struggles with back pain.He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, the insurer has said.Thompson was married and had two children in high school. He had worked at UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became the leader of its insurance arm in 2021.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingUS crimeNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

In one example, investigators revealed how a clan took control of distributing mussels and other seafood to restaurants in two seaside villages.While Cosa Nostra bosses these days try to resolve disputes peacefully to avoid attracting attention, weapons were found in Tuesday’s blitz, police said, while reporting incidents of brutal beatings.The old rules of top-down organisation and membership until death still hold sway but police said clan leaders were “up to date”, using encrypted smartphones to communicate to avoid traditional meetings.Letizia Battaglia: Life, Love and Death in Sicily review – the bloody reality of life under the mafiaRead moreDespite numerous arrests over the years, the Sicilian mafia “still manages to attract a large number of young people who embrace its principles” and offer to work for them, police said.The investigation also revealed a wide network of informants, with a clerk in the Palermo prosecutors’ office arrested last November accused of passing on files.For many years, the Sicilian mafia terrorised the Italian public and state, and became notorious for the killings of anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.But that led to a fierce state clampdown and the ’Ndrangheta is now considered Italy’s wealthiest and most powerful mafia, controlling the bulk of cocaine flowing intoEurope.Explore more on these topicsItalyMafiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I behaved like a sports person, like I was one more member of the team. I should have been more cold-blooded and adopted a more institutional role.”The sixth day of the trial in San Fernando de Henares in Madrid began with evidence from David Morillo, who has been deaf since birth and was presented by the defence as an expert lip reader.During the pre-trial, Rubiales claimed he asked Hermoso if he could give her apiquito(a peck). Based on video evidence, Morillo said that the accused asked for abesito(little kiss), the same meaning but a different word, a distinction Rubiales dismissed as irrelevant.Morillo added that, as Hermoso’s back was to the camera, he couldn’t confirm whether she gave her consent.Rubiales denied trying to coerce Hermoso into making a statement minimising the incident, saying that, given the media attention the kiss had attracted, he suggested they calm things down by making a joint statement, but Hermoso refused to comply.The court also heard a recording of an interview Hermoso gave to a Spanish journalist immediately after her team’s victory in which she dismisses the kiss as an “anecdote” in the context of the euphoria of becoming world champions.However, on the trial’s opening day, the footballer told the court that “one of the happiest moments” of her life had been ruined by the kiss and its aftermath.If convicted, Rubiales –who resigned as the federation presidenta month after the incident – could face two and a half years in prison: one year for sexual assault over the kiss, and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso to downplay what happened.The trial continues on Wednesday with the testimony of the former head coach of the women’s national team Jorge Vilda, the former Spanish football federation sporting director Albert Luque and the federation’s former marketing chief Rubén Rivera, for their suspected roles in putting pressure on Hermoso. All three deny the charges against them.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen's footballSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But for an increasing number of cities across Europe that are grappling with large visitor flows, they have become a hated symbol of overtourism.“They can pose a trip hazard as they are normally fastened with a chain to either signage poles or bike stands,” the council said in a report. “The units are left lying on the ground without any protection, resulting in public issues as they may become contaminated.”The council concluded that “lockboxes being used in the public realm will be removed and destroyed”.Key lockboxes are the latest flashpoint over European cities’ battle with holiday accommodation platforms.Last month, Paris joined Marseille, Nice, Lille and Annecy inbanning them in public places. Any repeat offences would be punishable by a fine of up to €1,500 and €3,000 (£1,252 and £2,504).In December, Italy alsobanned keyboxesamid concerns not only over their visual impact but the potential security risks of having people checking in to properties without any identity checks.Dublin city council said that lockboxes should be wall-mounted and located beside the entry to a house or apartment.“However, it is becoming increasingly common in Dublin city centre that lockboxes or keyboxes are being placed in the public domain, attached to bike stands and street signage poles,” it said.To “prevent visitors being stranded with no accommodation on arrival”, the council will be issuing letting platforms, including Airbnb and Booking.com, with instructions to give their hosts six weeks’ notice that the keyboxes will be removed.Dublin city councillor Dermot Lacey, who has led the campaign against the keyboxes, said some of the Temple Bar area was “littered” with them, and landlords seemed happy to “keep on buying new lockboxes” but not removing the old ones.Last May, Lacey asked the city to organise the removal of the boxes, with the council’s chief executive Richard Shakespeare confirming that “landlords of holiday lets are treated the same as landlords of standard lets regarding their responsibilities under the litter bylaws”.Explore more on these topicsOvertourismIrelandAirbnbnewsShareReuse this content"

The average weight of the escaped fish was 5.5kg (12.1lbs), they said.Norwegian authorities were on site on Monday inspecting the facility and issued an order to expand the company’s efforts to recapture the fish.Vegard Oen Hatten, a spokesperson for the fisheries directorate, said: “Normally, fish farmers are only allowed to conduct recapture operations within a 500-metre zone around the facility in the event of an escape. However, based on the potential scale of this incident, Mowi was instructed to extend recapture efforts beyond this zone.”Mowi said it was “a serious and very regrettable situation” and that fish caught by registered fishers could be delivered to fish “reception centres” around the area in return for the 500 kroner bounty.Escaped salmon pose huge environmental problems, campaigners say. They endanger wild salmon by reducing their genetic diversity, increasing infection from sea lice and intensify competition for spawning grounds.In Norway, which exports 1.2m tonnes of farmed salmon a year, the problem is such that last summer wild salmon numbers dropped to a historic low, resulting in the closure of 33 rivers to salmon fishing. This summer 42 rivers and three fjords have been proposed for closure.“27,000 farmed salmon on the run is a disaster for wild salmon,” said Pål Mugaas, a spokesperson for Norske Lakseelver (Norwegian Salmon Rivers).“Science has proved that interbreeding between wild stocks and farmed salmon produce offspring that in the long term has low survival rate in nature.”The Norwegian scientific advisory committee for Atlantic salmon has classified escaped farmed salmon as one of the major threats to wild salmon. Two-thirds of wild Atlantic salmon stocks in Norway are believed to have genetic interference with escaped farmed salmon.Despite acknowledging that the wild North Atlantic salmon is under“existential threat”, Norway’s environment minister, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, last month ruled out a ban on open-net fish farming at sea.Instead, he said he planned to seek an “acceptable level” of pollution for the wild salmon population.A Mowi spokesperson, Ola Helge Hjetland, told thenewspaper VG: “It is very regrettable and something that should not happen.”Mowi did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment.Explore more on these topicsNorwaySeascape: the state of our oceansFishFishing industryOceansEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The remarkable Japanese musician talks about magical islands, sonic sorcery and playing gigs with her eyes shutDale Berning SawaTue 11 Feb 2025 11.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 11.20 ESTShareWhen Ichiko Aoba stood up to perform at London’s St Martin-in-the-Fields in September 2024, most people couldn’t actually see the Japanese singer at first. The Georgian parish church has no stage, just a postage stamp of a red platform. And Aoba is not that tall. “I was a bit nervous,” she says. “Venue staff had told me it would be difficult for people to see, so I kept thinking about how I might massage people, loosen them up.”Aoba, 35, is speaking over video call from Tokyo. Her vibe in conversation is much the same as on stage: quiet but not shy, thoughtful, funny and direct. At St Martin’s, she walked down the aisle, guitar in hand, sat down on the flagstone floor, big white skirts billowing up like powdery snow, and started to sing, unamplified. The audience hushed. Aoba said, “Come closer”, and everyone who could did.View image in fullscreenThe cover artwork for Luminescent CreaturesPhotograph: HermineSince her 2010 debut, Kamisori Otome (Razorblade Girl), Aoba’s quietly astonishing music has earned her a horde of devoted fans. She’s an accomplished guitarist with a voice like a wind chime and a similarly airborne way with a melody. She sells out big venues immediately, and has been sought out by Japan’s musical statesmen Ryuichi Sakamoto, Cornelius and Haruomi Hosono. And yet she says: “I don’t really think of myself as a musician. I just love sound. Sometimes I’m still surprised when I’m described as an artist.”She has an artist’s CV by any measure: eight studio albums, eight live albums, a contribution to the soundtrack of the 2017 Ghost in the Shell. Yet Aoba says with a smile: “If I hold being a musician as my baseline, it feels constricting. I rather want to hold on to having fun, feeling surprised. To link those together” – she joins her fingers – “is to live a happy life.” This month, she releases her ninth album, Luminescent Creatures. To guitar, strings, chimes and keyboards, she sings about scattered light and things that glow in the dark; the aurora, a tower, a flag. In April, she will perform the album in full at the Barbican in London.Aoba was born in Urayasu, not far from Tokyo Disneyland, and raised near Kyoto. At school she variously sang in a choir, played clarinet in a brass band and drummed in a light music club. But after meeting the Japanese eight-string guitarist Anmi Yamada, with his singular, freewheeling songwriting, she took flight. She would learn his songs then have masterclasses with him over the phone. These days, to record her music, she says she needs to be so relaxed she’s almost asleep.If I just let go and truly believe that the music will be my protection, I can reach a state that is almost meditationHow on earth does she achieve that? “I have to trust the moment,” she says. “If I’m focused on this being my song, or that person being in the audience, or the light being too bright, or the sound feeding back when I play” – she does a neat bit of air guitar – “it doesn’t work. But if I just let go” – she shakes both hands in the air – “and truly believe that the music will be my protection, I can reach a state that is almost like meditation.”It’s a pretty accurate description of her audiences, too. She nods. “When people write to me, they’ll say they had a great time at a concert but also that, on a deeper level, they found a space where they felt safe, or where they found they could forgive.” She shows me a pile of decorated envelopes that she fans out in front of her then stacks under her head like a pillow: “These make me so happy. I keep them by my bedside.”Aoba loves ancient Japanese and onomatopoeia. She wonders about what plants remember. She has visions of landscapes that she has never visited and she is drawn to the idea of sound as a means of wayfinding: whale song, sonar, echolocation. When I mention Daniel Kish, the blind runner who listens his way through the forest at speed, she beams and claps. “Sometimes,” she says, “during a gig, I’ll close my eyes just to see how long I can play before I make a mistake. Often I think of making an album as like talking to a friend, telling them about whatever interesting thing has happened that day.”When Aoba launched her official fan community on Patreon, she called it Atóllba, after “atoll” because she imagines it to be just that: a magical island, an iridescent safe space, in which like-minded people can gather. Her critically acclaimed 2020 album, Windswept Adan, was billed “the soundtrack to a fictional movie”. Is Luminescent Creatures also insular, a world of it own? “This time, instead of a story, it’s like a dictionary,” she says, “with each track a seed I’m planting.”Google the title for the second song, 24° 3′ 27.0″ N, 123° 47′ 7.5″ E, and you realise it’s the coordinates for a lighthouse in the sea at the very edge of Japanese waters. “I hoped that some people might find the island,” she says. “But mostly, I hope that the album itself is a lighthouse of sorts.”Luminescent Creatures is out on 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMusicIndieFolk musicJapanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We enter a gender-breaking world of occult worship – and catsEliza GoodpastureTue 11 Feb 2025 10.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 12.32 ESTShare‘Of course the women were important,” said the artist Roland Penrose in 1982, “but it was because they were our muses.” Penrose was talking to the art historian Whitney Chadwick, who was interviewing him for a book she was writing about women surrealists. “They weren’t artists,” insisted Penrose, who thought she shouldn’t even be writing about them. But Chadwick did anyway – and the result, her 1985 bookWomenArtists and the Surrealist Movement,fundamentally changed our understanding of both surrealism and female artists.In the 40 years since, many of the women Chadwick wrote about have gained wider fame, but the past few years have seen an explosion of interest in surrealist women. Last year was the 100th anniversary of the Surrealist Manifesto, which was actually two competing manifestos published by competing groups of (male) surrealists in Paris. So it’s unsurprising that we saw so much interest in the movement. But itisstriking that the centennial prompted a flurry of interest in the women – who were actually excluded from those groups. Indeed, many weren’t even in Paris. Why the sudden broadening of the lens?View image in fullscreenHair-raising … a work by Claude Cahun from 1936.Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/ShutterstockWhen Chadwick asked the surrealist Leonor Fini about Penrose’s muses claim, she responded with characteristic directness, calling it “bullshit”. Fini was born in Argentina and spent time in Italy before ending up in Paris. She was openly bisexual and spent the later part of her life living in a polyamorous relationship with two men – and dozens of cats. “I am a painter,” she once said, “not a woman painter.”Her words reflect the complex politics of pursuing art as a woman. While their lives were defined by their experiences of being born women, and many of them made art that was explicitly about femininity and sexuality, they also bucked assumptions based on their gender that were made by their male peers and by the viewing public.View image in fullscreen‘Neuter is the only gender that suits me’ … Claude Cahun.Photograph: Album/AlamyClaude Cahun, as early as 1914, went even further than Fini in her radical identification as lesbian and non-binary. She is famously quoted as saying: “Masculine? Feminine? It depends on the situation. Neuter is the only gender that always suits me.” Currently the subject of a touring exhibition courtesy of London’s Hayward Gallery, Cahun’s photography was made with her partner, Marcel Moore, a lesbian who also lived androgynously.Even among surrealist women who did not identify as queer, there is often an element of queerness to their work – either through an exploration of the “divine feminine”, or through a more fundamental sense of enigma. The late US scholar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick described “queer” as an “open mesh of possibilities” between genders and sexualities, a defining way of using the word that has made it such a sweeping term today, sometimes meaning no more than “impossible to categorise”.Fini and Cahun were based in the surrealist centre of Paris, but many of the other women receiving new attention were not. Ithell Colquhoun was a British surrealist and is currently the subject of amajor retrospective at Tate St Ives. It is a seismic exhibition that forcefully makes the case for Colquhoun’s powerful legacy. Colquhoun was connected to so many occultist and spiritual groups in Britain that it’s hard to count them all. From druidism to Tantra to Christianity, she spent her life seeking a higher truth, all reflected in her work.View image in fullscreenSeeking a higher truth … Ithell Colquhoun.Photograph: Guy Carrard/© Man Ray Trust / ADAGP Paris, Centre PompidouLike Fini, Colquhoun was attracted to people of all genders, and her art was often explicitly sexual. She made one painting that depicted castrated male bodies, and it was immediately censored for its shocking content. Other works show abstracted, vulva-like landscapes, explore goddess imagery, and deploy techniques that introduce an element of chance – to allow the unconscious to take over the creative act.There has long been a connection between women and magic – think of witches, goddesses, healers and storytellers. And for almost as long, this connection has been weighted with a sense of threat. The mystical, intangible power women could wield threatened patriarchal systems and needed to be controlled. In western art, it was written off as foolish or irrelevant. Colquhoun was pushed out of the British surrealist group because of her fascination with occult sects, which came to dominate her work.Surrealism, although it is distinctly strange, was not concerned with the supernatural. The movements in Paris and Britain both rejected it. Their interest in the unconscious mind was largely scientific, even if it was also irrational (or perhaps anti-rational). Today, though, there is much more interest in these themes: Colquhoun’s biographer Amy Hale has called it the “Shamanic turn”, as our collective consciousness becomes more open to esoteric beliefs. Last autumn, the London gallery Lévy Gorvy Dayan hosted Enchanted Alchemies, a show that focused on mystic and occult surrealists. Almost all women, they included Eileen Agar, Leonora Carrington, Fini and Colquhoun.View image in fullscreenExplicitly sexual … Ithell Colquhoun, Scylla (méditerranée), 1938Photograph: Joe Humphrys/© Spire Healthcare, © Noise Abatement Society, © SamaritansMary Wykeham, a British surrealist whose work features in the Hepworth Wakefield’s current exhibitionForbidden Territories: 100 Years of Surreal Landscapes, found spiritual fulfilment in a slightly different way: after a tumultuous lifetime spent as a wartime nurse, political activist and professional artist, she became a nun. Many of her surviving works are on paper, making them more fragile and smaller-scale. They are filled with swirling or geometric lines, almost completely abstract. Like all surrealist work, they strive to unlock the unconscious mind, bypassing rationality in favour of an often disquieting exploration of the inner self.Another British surrealist, Lee Miller, followed an entirely different path: after building a successful career as a surrealist photographer and model in Paris, she became a photojournalist during the second world war. Miller was present at the liberation of the concentration camps Buchenwald and Dachau, and the photo of her taking a bath in Hitler’s tub has become iconic. Often remembered more as a model and muse – she was married to Penrose – Miller recently had her story retold inLee,a film starring Kate Winslet in the title role.View image in fullscreenMaruja Mallo.Photograph: Album/AlamyMaruja Mallo, shortly to be the subject of a major retrospective at the Centro Botín in Santander, Spain, lived and worked in Madrid. She knew major Spanish surrealists like Salvador Dalí and Federico García Lorca, but unlike them she remained in Spain for her whole career – aside from her exile to Argentina during the civil war. Her work incorporated Spanish folk imagery, but became more geometric and abstract. Mallo was a writer as well as a painter, contributing to magazines and books.Surrealism was an especially multidisciplinary movement. Along with writing, film-making was popular, tying the movement to modernity despite its impulses towards timelessness. This plethora of mediums reflects how surrealism is, at its core, a practice of thinking radically differently, using words as well as images – any medium in fact, so long as it brings the unconscious out into the world.“We are in a wave of rediscovery around women generally,” says Tate St Ives curator Katy Norris, “and it’s allowing us to recognise differences among them – they weren’t a single breakaway group.” In fact, the basic surrealist impulse of dreams, sexuality and obsession had a global reach and appeal: unlike previous avant-garde movements in the early 20th century, which often sought to overturn previous -isms, surrealism quickly stopped being so centralised. The diversity among its adherents’ lives, styles and priorities is huge. “Surrealism responds to uncertainty,” says Norris, “so it speaks to us now in times of uncertainty.”View image in fullscreenShamanic … Leonor Fini.Photograph: Album/AlamyThat impulse to examine one’s inner self feels very familiar today. But the magnanimity of the surrealists – with their unflinching drive to put themselves into their art in all their irrational, weird glory – is different from the tide of social media-driven, self-critical narcissism that’s so prominent today. The fierce individualism of these artists, these women who were so relentlessly themselves, is a tonic. It’s no wonder they are capturing public attention like never before. In a world that feels increasingly unpredictable, there’s a real resonance in women embracing instability and using it to fuel their creative work. It is, says Norris, “a perfect storm”.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Very good. And let’s add murder, cannibalism, body horror, obsession, rage …Lovely. Are we talking about Friday night out in a town centre near you?Literary genre, mate.I thought it was all about romantasy these days?Sex’n’dragons?Romantasy’s soooo 2024, keep up.What aboutRebecca Yarros?True, the latest in her Empyrean series isbreaking all sorts of records.Cosy crime, too.Correct – looking at youRichard “Thursday Murder Club” Osman.And the return of the romcom.Also correct – looking at youEmily “Funny Story” Henry. Femgore is more interesting though.Hardly new, though, is it? Women getting killed, yawn.No, this is where femgore is different. We’re not talking about female victimhood, exploitation and fetishisation, but a reaction to that.Listening now. Go on. Publisher Romilly Morgandescribed to Cosmopolitanmagazine a world created by women “in which they are the ones in control, playing with the exact mundane and everyday brutality they have been exposed to for decades”.Yay! Revenge!No, it’s more interesting than that – not just about women getting back at the patriarchy but also “the complicated relationships between ourselves, and our bodies and with other women, too.”Ooh. Examples please!So you’ve gotThe Lamb, by Lucy Rose, about a tricky mother and daughter relationship …A bit likeBernardine Evaristo’s Booker-winning Girl, Woman, Otherthen?Yeah, kinda, except they’re both cannibals, and Mama picks up “strays” and … well, eats them.

I did my best to address the situation and made light of it as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued.“I then tried to ignore them, hoping they’d settle down, but when the disruption persisted into the second half of the show, I asked the audience around them if they were being bothered by the noise. They all shouted ‘yes’ and when I asked for a show of hands at least 40 people raised theirs.”The statement added: “At that point I had no choice but to take action. The lady who was escorted out did bear a striking resemblance to Lisa Riley, though I don’t see how that’s an insult. This was only the second and third time I’ve had to ask someone to leave during my 114 shows over the past three years of this tour.“As a comedian, you never want to eject anyone, but when repeated disruptions make it impossible to continue, it’s important to consider the experience of the rest of the audience, who’ve paid to see a show without interruption.”Riley herself defended Kay, writing on Instagram: “Please draw a line under this now, I am not offended, never was offended. I love Peter Kay to pieces. Laughter is my favourite medicine … It’s a laugh, it’s funny.”Philip Peters, the man ejected for shouting garlic bread,told MailOnline he was treated “like a terrorist”by security staff. The 54-year-old said he was left with bruises after six security officers physically removed him from the auditorium, with another three taking his adult son.“The security guards came over to me and said: ‘You are going to have to leave – Peter Kay doesn’t like people shouting out,’” he said. “I thought they were going to warn me off but they stood me up, brought me to the stairs, which were dead steep. I have massive bruises in my leg. I haven’t been able to walk properly at work today. My arms are all covered in bruises.”One attender wrote of the moment on X: “I’ve lost a lot of respect for Peter Kay after the way he treated the heckler … having him removed by force by his entourage, and cracking jokes about it over the 3-4 mins it took. No manners. Huge waste of money.”Another fan said the comedian “killed the atmosphere in the arena”, and called his actions “completely inappropriate and unacceptable”. Others said the exchange was “embarrassing” and “very harsh”.However, there were fans who defended Kay’s actions. Jo Llewellyn, who was sitting near those ejected, told MailOnline: “The guy he chucked out absolutely deserved it. He was extremely drunk even before the show started and continued to make a nuisance of himself as the show went on.“For those of us who sat beside him he ruined the gig. And as for the lady, she was a few seats behind and the people she sat next to also commented that she had been a huge pain and was disrupting the show for others.”Llewellyn said she was glad the individuals were removed because they were spoiling the show for others. “And if people were so offended at the hecklers being chucked out, why did the crowd near them cheer loudly when they were removed?”Explore more on these topicsPeter KayComedy (Stage)ManchesterEnglandGreater ManchesterComedy (Culture)newsShareReuse this content"

A memoir is what you can remember, and you remember mostly stupid things, catastrophes, revenges, and times of political horror, so I put those in – but I also added moments of joy, and surprising events and, of course, the books.”The 85-year-old author has previously published 17 novels, 19 books of poetry, nine short story collections, eight children’s books, three graphic novels, and 11 nonfiction works – but never a memoir.“My publishers made me do it,” shetold British Voguewhen asked why she felt now was the time. After originally thinking it would be “boring”, she came round to the idea when her publishers said they were after a “memoir in a literary style”.Subtitled A Memoir of Sorts, Book of Lives is described as a “landmark publication” by UK publisher Vintage. “As we travel with Atwood along the course of her life, more and more is revealed about her writing, the connections between real life and art – and the workings of one of our greatest imaginations.”Born to an entomologist father and dietician mother in 1939, Atwood was encouraged to be independent and connect with nature, spending much of her childhood in the wild forest of northern Quebec.Encounters with bears, poets, Hollywood actors – and of course with the author’s late husband, Graeme Gibson – will all feature in the memoir, in which Atwood will also reveal the seminal moments in her life that inspired her most famous novels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Since it launched in 2008, it has amassed a loyal following, including Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift. The key to its success is that it excels at simple, everyday jewellery, including fine chains, huggie earrings and gold bangles. The gold vermeil coin pendants have long been an MV signature.The brand is known for its flash sales and has a wide selection of discounted pieces at itsBicester Villagestore.

It’s just about flavour, that’s all it’s about. Flavour, excitement, innovation, and trying to take it to a new space of deliciousness.”The number of vegans in the UK increased by 1.1 million between 2023 and 2024, according to researchconducted by Finderlast year. It estimated that the number of people who had adopted a plant-based diet was 2.5 million, representing 4.7% of the adult population.Plates London was one of 26 restaurants given an accolade at the ceremony.Moor Hall, a modern European restaurant in the village of Aughton about 10 miles from Liverpool, became only the 10th restaurant across the UK and Ireland to hold the coveted three stars. It opened in 2017 and received its first two Michelin stars in the two following years.Michelin said: “At Moor Hall, Chef Mark Birchall and his team have continued to hone their craft and have now achieved new levels of excellence. The ingredients, many from the kitchen garden, are outstanding; the chefs’ culinary technique is hugely impressive; and the judgment of flavours, of when to prioritise simplicity and when to add complexity, is exemplary.”Birchall said: “I think you kind of dream about these things. You kind of almost act it out in your mind of how you would be, but the the emotion is incredible.”A first Michelin star was awarded to 22 new restaurants, including nine in London, three in Ireland and two in Scotland, while Gorse in Cardiff became the first restaurant in the Welsh capital to achieve the feat.Greek restaurant Oma, in Borough Market, London, received its first star after it had earlier won the Opening of the Year award.This year’s ceremony, in which five new Green stars were awarded for commitment to sustainability, was held as the Michelin Guide celebrates its 125th anniversary.Explore more on these topicsMichelin GuideVeganismVegan food and drinkLondonRestaurantsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Being ridiculous isn’t sexy.”Kors, who used to love a revealing gown, says naked dressing “is boring now. I grew up infatuated with Cher. I would be waiting to see what she wore, how naked she could be, how amazing she could look”.Only last year he dressed the country singer Kelsea Ballerini for the Met Gala in a daring nude mesh gown embroidered with strategic silk rose buds, inspired by the scene in the film American Beauty in which Mena Suvari lies in a bathtub, covered only by petals.But 2025 “is crazy enough already”, he said before his show. “Every five minutes there’s a news alert. When the world is this crazy, you need to feel confident and comfortable. What has happened in LA is apocalyptic, and the idea of stepping on to a red carpet in a crazy gown just now feels out of step.”View image in fullscreen‘We need to calm down’: models in subtle colours on the runway at the Michael Kors fall/winter 2025 show.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/WWD/Getty ImagesFashion has gotten “preposterous”, he added. “Everyone wears too much make up and has too much hair.

On the catwalk, this spirit was channelled into loose dresses with trailing ties – “my woman lives in the city, her clothes should have movement when she walks. A little something to catch the wind” – and evening blazers in bias-cut black silk.No boning, no corsets, no stilettos. “There’s not a tight dress in the whole collection,” Kors noted. “That feels like a costume from another time.”Kors is a vocal and high-profile Democrat, who contributed more than $300,000 (£241,000) to Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. But asked for his thoughts on Melania Trump, who often wears his label, he rowed back to neutrality. He was careful to make it clear that the first lady buys his clothes, rather than being given or loaned them. “She has shopped in our store on Madison Avenue for many years. I often see her wearing pieces she has owned for a long time,” he said. “Listen, the reality is, you are talking about a woman who wears clothes well.”View image in fullscreen‘Beautiful lines with warmth’: a model is cocooned in a chocolate brown fur-like ensemble at the Michael Kors fall/winter 2025 showcase in New York City.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/ReutersMinimalism is not to Kors’ taste. “I like beautiful lines, but with warmth. I like clothes that look delicious,” he said. Looks were drenched in single shades of aubergine, chocolate brown and bottle green.His customers have an urban palette, Kors believes, and while they say they want to wear colour, they don’t shell out for anything that strays too far from black. The mood was high-end comfort dressing: coats with shearling-lined pockets for warmth, soft leather boots that slouched and wrinkled just so, instead of shiny riding boot styles.Kors, a beloved character in the Manhattan fashion world, took his catwalk bow to rapturous applause as always. But his brand is in trouble, suffering a 12% decline in sales last quarter.The Capri conglomerate which owns Michael Kors has been left stranded after an attempted merger with the larger Tapestry group, owner of Coach, was blocked by the US Federal Trade Commission in November. The merger would have created an American luxury conglomerate able to compete with the European giants, putting Kors on a surer footing.Without the merger, the future looks uncertain. John Idol, Capri’s CEO, acknowledged that prices would have to come down, suggesting that they could fall by up to 40% this year.Explore more on these topicsNew York fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

Nine digital communication tips from an expertYou might need to brush your hair to go ‘camera on’, but showing your face can forge trust. Andrew Brodsky tells us what he’s learned about digital communicationLauren MechlingTue 11 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 12.38 ESTShareAndrew Brodsky has been working from home far longer than most of us. Twenty years ago, at age 16, he was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia that required a bone marrow transplant, and he spent the following month in an isolation room where visitors had to put on a mask, full-body gown and gloves.“I got early experience interacting with people from a distance,” the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin professor says. An early interest in virtual communication took hold, growing into a PhD dissertation and the cornerstone of his business consulting practice.The Texas resident still receives regular immunoglobulin infusions. Owing to his immunocompromised status, he teaches his popular business school classes via Zoom from a home office decked out with color-coded bookshelves and a cleverly placed photo of his dogs, Tater and Minnie, directly behind his camera (more on that later).In his new bookPing: The Secrets of Successful Virtual Communication, he lays out the data he has gathered on the science of communicating through screens. He spoke with the Guardian about how to find fulfilling connection in an ever-fractured and disembodied world.1. Check in digitally before swinging by IRLAt the office, it can be tempting to wander over to a colleague when you spot them at their desk. But now that casual IRL encounters are fewer and further between, people don’t always take warmly to an out-of-the-blue approach. “It doesn’t matter if you work from home or if you work from the office – we’re all virtual communicators,” Brodsky said. Swinging by your co-worker’s cubicle used to be the norm if you had a question or a juicy tidbit to share, but these days it’s safer to send an instant message to see if they will be free to chat in a bit.View image in fullscreenAndrew Brodsky’s Ping: The Secrets of Successful Virtual Communication.Photograph: Courtesy Simon Acumen2. Unlearn the ‘email urgency bias’We are wired to sense that all emails require an instant response – a brain trigger that can drain our own productivity. “When we get an email, we tend to think the sender expects a response quicker than they actually do,” Brodsky says. “So this creates a whole lot of extra stress on us, because we feel like we need to reply right away.” He recommends designating three or so periods a day to tend to emails, and notes that there is nothing wrong with getting back to somebody later that day unless they specified that the matter was urgent.Likewise, it never hurts to clarify to your recipient that your query does not constitute a five-alarm emergency. “If you’re sending an email and you need a quick reply, put the word ‘urgent’ in the subject header,” he says. “Otherwise, say at the end of your email that this can wait till we talk in the next few days.”3. Use cozy Zoom backgrounds, not kooky onesIs a Zoom background worth a thousand words? One of Brodsky’s more intriguing hypotheses is that a video meeting can be more intimate than an in-person one held in an anodyne conference room. Brodsky looked at research showing that bookshelves and plants both work well to help establish a connection. Cozy items such as Christmas trees or a photo of a pet, like Brodsky displays, can connote warmth and personal dimension. Unsurprisingly,a studyabout video chat backgrounds and professionalism found that a novelty background such as a walrus on ice or the inside of a spaceship tended to get the lowest ratings. So delete that image of Bianca Jagger raging through Studio 54 on a white unicorn.4. Don’t fret about your email timestampsIs anybody’s body clock wired to thrive exactly from 9am to 5pm? Some of us (present company included) get our best work done before the sun rises, while others don’t get a chance to buckle down and put together email replies until after their family members are drifting off to sleep. Yet there is a commonly held perception that it isdisrespectful of boundariesto bother somebody outside of regular working hours. Brodsky isn’t terribly concerned about the time of day that an email is fired off. “If you were to say: if you could respond in the next couple days, that would be great. That takes the pressure off the next response,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes, meetings actually do save timeBack when Covid reared its head, a lot of companies went overboard on scheduling meetings, perhaps fearful of losing track of employees’ whereabouts. But recentstudiesshow that reducing the number of meetings can lead to higher productivity. That said, Brodsky believes that certain meetings can save time – especially if they entail a conversation among few members.Brodsky hypothesizes about the conversation we’re having. “Each of my answers are five paragraphs long,” he says. “This interaction, over email, would have taken potentially 10 times as long as this hour-long call that you and I are having.”6. Short daily updates can show diligence and engagementA dominant theme in Brodsky’s book is mastering the theater of productivity. “The vast majority of jobs don’t have objective measures of performance,” he says. “So in most jobs, there’s always some strong, subjective component that’s happening on the manager’s side. So unfortunately there’s this need to be mindful and strategic about your communication and how you present your work.”He illustrates with two fictional examples. One employee sends her manager an elaborate five-paragraph email update about everything she did during the week on Friday. Another worker sends his manager a few sentences via Slack every day. According to Brodsky, research shows that the constant communicator likely seems more productive. Communicating more frequently and casually “can be useful for showing your engagement when they can’t necessarily see you”.7. Go ‘camera on’Yes, it’sexhausting, and you might need to brush your hair. But showing your face in a video meeting and reading your colleagues’ expressions can forge a bond and trust. Sorry!8. Avoid the all-hours work communication trapThe toll of overextension is what you might expect, Brodsky says. Some research “shows that there’s basically this curvilinear effect of after-hours communication on both work performance and your relationships”, he says. “Too much after-hours communication just burns you out.”Not only that, but over-availability can diminish your stock. “If you’re thinking about work outcomes, your relationships with your coworkers and your performance, you would probably think, the more communication you have, the better. But that’s not true, because your burnout ends up undermining that, and you also are sort of underselling yourself, right?”9. Typos may be more meaningful than you thinkTypos are a mainstay of the digital age – we dash off texts, Slacks and emails while we are ordering groceries or pretending to pay attention during meetings. In his research with American University professor Hayley Blunden, Brodsky learned a few things. First, the obvious: typos make you look less intelligent. But that’s not their only effect; they also convey emotion. “It’s like an amplifier,” Brodsky says. “Typos make an angry email seem angrier or happy emails seem happier. And if you make one? You can move on.”Pingis out from Simon Acumen on 11 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyUS work & careersWork & careersCareersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 11 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareI often find green cabbage boring. How can I make it more interesting?The cabbage family is vast and, just like most families, its members differ hugely in shape and size, from long and pointed to rotund with solid hearts. What the green members all have in common, however, is their receptiveness to multiple situations, from braising to layering into lasagne, which is good news for those who think they’re a bit dull.Merlin Labron-Johnson, chef/owner ofOsipandThe Old Pharmacy,both in Bruton, Somerset, is no such person, though: “Cabbages are much more versatile than people give them credit for,” he says, “but you do need to apply a bit of imagination.” That might mean blanching the leaves, stuffing them with sausagemeat – “sometimes, I add pistachios, too” – then rolling and braising in the oven. “That’s an interesting way to use up a savoy cabbage.” He suggests serving these cabbage parcels with some pumpkin puree. Alternatively, put hispi in a pot roast: halve the cabbage and lay it cut side down in a hot pan with lots of oil, to get some nice caramelisation. “Finish it in the oven, then carve and dress with chopped herbs, toasted nuts [almonds or hazelnuts, say] or pine nuts, perhaps a few raisins, and a bit of vinegar and olive oil.”Chef Daniel Watkins, meanwhile, would be inclined to fire up the barbecue – even in winter. “It’s my favourite way to bring out the best in all sorts of ingredients,” says the man behind the menu atHoly Carrotin London, which is why you’ll find him outside by the barbecue year-round. “I like to grill hispi cabbage over an open flame and, once it’s beautifully charred, brush with a blend of butter [plant-based, for preference] and miso, or a rich XO sauce, which adds a deep, umami kick.” And if you’re up for a project, he suggests sauerkraut, for which shredded cabbage and salt are roughed up and packed into a sterilised jar. Once fermented, Watkins recommends frying the kraut until crisp, then folding it through some velvety potato puree. Or take a leaf out ofNigel Slater’s book and combine sauerkraut, softened onions, chopped parsley and walnuts, wholegrain mustard, grated fontina and some seasoning, then pile on to pastry to makea savoury galette.Labron-Johnson grows a ton of cabbage on his farm, and at this time of year especially his attention turns to soup, and more often than not that perennial winter favourite,ribollita. “Start with a base of chopped vegetables [onion, carrot, celery, garlic] and maybe some pancetta, lardo or bacon, add cooked white beans and a bit of broth, then finish with the cabbage and lots of olive oil,” he says. You could, of course, also add some bread: “That’s a full meal, and it’s not boring at all!”The Guardian’s ownItalian food expert Rachel Roddyalso hasa cabbage soupup her sleeve to “win over sceptics”. Warm olive oil and butter in a pan, then add sliced savoy and onion, minced garlic and a couple of bay leaves. Once the cabbage has collapsed “completely”, break it up with a fork, pour in water, add salt and a parmesan rind, then simmer for 15 minutes. Next, tip in some carnaroli rice and simmer again for 20 minutes. Finish with grated parmesan and black pepper, and Bob’s your uncle.Got a culinary dilemma?

She was one of 18 people who died and he was the sole survivor. He describes the pain, fear and long, winding path of recoveryEmma RussellTue 11 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 12.34 ESTShareStuart Diver woke up to a roar that sounded like a low-flying plane. The floor was shaking. The windows rattled. It was 11.35pm and 4,000 tons of mud, building and debris was hurtling down the mountainside in Thredbo, New South Wales, towards Bimbadeen Lodge, where he had been asleep with his wife, Sally. In a few short seconds, the ceiling of their apartment caved in and they were entombed by the concertinaed building. Diver fumbled around in the pitch black room for a way out, cutting his hands and feet on broken glass. But there was nowhere to go.“I heard the noise and put my head up, but as I rolled forward the wrought iron headboard came down and pinned Sally to the bed.” Freezing cold water from a broken mains water pipe on the road above them soon started “flying around”. Diver found a small pocket of air to breathe by arching his back and tilting his head up. He tried to cover Sally’s mouth to stop her from drowning but he couldn’t save her. “Sal dying in my hands will stay in my mind forever,” he wrote in his 2012 book,Survival.Once he knew there was nothing he could do for Sally, the 27-year-old ski instructor started to fight for his own life. It was the middle of winter and he was lying on a slab of concrete with a rock puncturing his back, wearing only his boxer shorts. “I was wet, cold, muddy,” he says. For the next few hours, he was intermittently tortured by the icy water laced with diesel and sewage that would ebb and flow through the concrete tomb in which he was trapped.“Before then, I would have said I was claustrophobic.” But trapped in the darkness, with only 3cm of room between his face and the concrete for the next 65 hours, he found that in situations of complete helplessness “you actually get an amazing feeling of calmness come over you”.Diver was raised in Melbourne with his intrepid, no-nonsense Glaswegian parents, Annette and Steve, and his brother, Euan, who was one of the first-responders on the scene. They hiked the Thredbo mountains at weekends, and sailed, swam and fished. At just six weeks old, in terrible weather, Diver ascended Mount Kosciuszko, the highest mountain in Australia, strapped to his mum. “I wonder how we survived,” he laughs, recalling a photograph he recently found from a holiday in Nepal, where he’s teetering on the edge of a glacier beside roaring, class-five rapids. Alone. “We were in places that kids probably should never have been.View image in fullscreenRescue workers at the scene of the Thredbo landslide tragedy.Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media/Getty Images“Walking nine hours a day is not a young person’s idea of fun but where we went and what we did definitely made me who I was.” The pain of trekking in the rain, carrying heavy bags “did make me a much more resilient person as an adult.”By the time he started university, Diver knew he wanted to be a ski instructor but decided the sensible thing to do would be to get a degree in hotel management. At The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, he met Sally, a beautiful blond woman with an infectious smile. “I’d always had this old fashioned vision that I was going to meet someone who had similar outdoor interests and we were going to get married and have a family and live happily ever after.”After dating for four years, he proposed in Sydney and they celebrated their engagement on Bondi beach with fish and chips and a bottle of red wine. They got married in November 1995, then moved to Canada, where they both found jobs in the hospitality industry at the SilverStar mountain resort in British Columbia – Sally as a restaurant manager and Diver as a ski instructor. Six months later, they returned home.They arrived back in Australia in the winter, where Sally lined up work at the Thredbo Alpine Hotel – the European-style ski resort in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales that Diver now manages – and Diver completed his second season on the slopes. Eight weeks before the landslide, they moved from a rented property in town to Bimbadeen Lodge, the staff block for the Thredbo alpine village that was available thanks to Sally’s job. “If I could have made that decision slightly differently, then the world would be a different place.”The day of the landslide had been like any other. Diver finished work on the slopes at 4.30pm and met Sally at the hotel so they could do their weekly shop in Jindabyne, a larger town half an hour away. They bought some takeaway noodles at Nuggets Crossing shopping centre before driving back to the lodge, watching TV and falling asleep early.A little before midnight on 30 July 1997, the 108km road embankment holding up Alpine Way began sliding down the hillside of Thredbo. A leaking water main had saturated the space below the road, causing a landslide that pushed the two-storied timber Carinya Lodge from its foundations down the mountain and on to the four-storey Bimbadeen Lodge, which was made from reinforced concrete, at high speed, burying 19 people. “I look at that 27 years on and I can’t work out how I survived,” says Diver.View image in fullscreenRescue workers transporting Diver from the wreckage.Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media/Getty ImagesHe was trapped in the rubble for three days, during which: “I was in so much physical pain from the cold.” He started urinating on his frostbitten feet to keep them warm. He’s not sure if he was hallucinating or dreaming, but towards the end of the ordeal his mind took him to warmer places. At one point, he was an actor on a movie set somewhere in the desert, at others his mum would be rubbing his feet to warm them up, just as she did when he was a child on the ski lifts. But loud noises would bring him back to reality, which was getting more grim by the minute.Outside, there were more than 600 rescuers working tirelessly in overnight temperatures of -12C with a wind chill of -30C to find signs of life. The cutting equipment and chainsaws kept freezing, while the lodge itself was on a steep incline of the hill and the instability of the land was making the operation particularly perilous. Any sudden movement could trigger another landslide and further endanger the rescuers, as well as any survivors trapped underneath.“I knew there were all these other people in the building above me and I thought that they had been rescuing them,” Diver says of the 15 to 20 people who lived in the lodge. “I kept thinking: ‘That’s OK, get everyone else. I’ll be down at the bottom.’”Amid the din of saws hacking through concrete, firefighter Steve Hirst heard a sound at the 54-hour mark.Stuart remembers him shouting: “Rescue party above. Can you hear me?”The sound of the man’s voice gave him new energy after what had felt like a lifetime of being trapped, but it would take another 11 hours to free him – and it was just the start of an intense emotional rollercoaster. Diver realised that the first responders might not be able to get him out. He was trapped 2 metres underground, under three concrete slabs, so the team had to dig a tunnel sideways to reach him.It was paramedic Paul Featherstone’s job to keep him positive, assessing his medical condition and talking to him about the mountains – his happy place – before he was dug and drilled out in 20 minute shifts.View image in fullscreen‘An amazing feeling of calmness came over me’ … Diver was hours from death when he was pulled from the wreckage.Photograph: HO/ReutersAfter 65 hours, they managed to get a stretcher to Diver, carving a hole large enough to hoist him out. He was passed down a line towards the ambulance, eventually emerging into the light. It was a feeling of “absolute elation,” he says. “I felt really good because obviously adrenaline is pumping through your body and I thought: ‘Great, I’ll just go down to the pub and have a beer.’”But it wasn’t going to be that way. “When they finally got to me, they reckoned that, by the physical state I was in, I only had a few hours to live. My energy was completely depleted. I had nothing left. I’d lost 15kg during that 65 hours,” he says. “I was very, very close to the end.”Diver was airlifted to a hospital in Canberra, where he spent a week recovering. He still has some issues with his left foot – the frostbite had affected his circulation and the muscles were wasted, making it ache – but overall he made a complete and speedy recovery. It wasn’t until four days later that he found out he was the sole survivor. “There were 18 people who died, so you can’t just go, ‘Yeah, I’m the survivor!’” he says. “I already had my own loss with Sally but when you magnify that with all the other people that was a big burden.”His rescue made him a nationwide celebrity overnight. The landslide had been one of the first incidents where the aftermath was broadcast live for the world to see and a media circus quickly began. “That first six months definitely took a toll on my mental health,” he says. “I never got a chance to grieve properly.”At the time, Diver was criticised for coming across as cold and unemotional when he was talking about the accident because his voice never wavered nor did he cry. He says now that he was trying to be positive in the name of those that had died. “For me, that emotional side, at that point, was very much a personal thing. If I wanted to cry, that was for me to cry.” And that’s exactly what he did – the minute he got home, he would break down.In those early days, Diver self-medicated with alcohol. “I was a 27-year-old man and I was going to do it all myself,” he says. “When you drink and you have a really bad hangover, the only thing you need to think about the next day is the hangover. I joke about it now but you know that’s the cycle some people get into and never get out. Luckily, I had enough good people around me.”One of those good people was Rosanna Cossettini, who had been part of Thredbo’s tightknit community for a decade, and who Diver started dating two years after the landslide. She was strong and “in some ways my protector”, going through the emotional struggles of that period with him. “How long are you meant to grieve is always the question,” he says. “It’s farcical. Some people can grieve for two weeks and some people grieve for ever. I think you do grieve forever, it’s just on levels and scales. But I was lucky enough to meet Rosanna.”View image in fullscreenDiver speaking at a Sydney charity event in 2018.Photograph: Australian Associated Press/AlamyThey married three years later, but, in 2004, shortly after they returned from an extended honeymoon that took them to the UK, Europe and Thailand, Rosanna was diagnosed with breast cancer. There were operations, chemotherapy and three months of radiation, then five years of hormone therapy before she went into remission. The harsh drugs sent her body into early menopause. Rosanna had always wanted a child but a family didn’t seem to be on the cards for the couple.A picture in time: Stuart Diver, Thredbo landslide sole survivorRead moreMiraculously, she did fall pregnant, but at the 10-and-a-half-week scan the baby had no heartbeat. “That was really devastating.” Diver gave up on the idea of having children but six months later Rosanna became pregnant again and this time they had Alessia.Soon after, Rosanna received a metastatic cancer diagnosis that had no chance of survival. “Surviving the landslide definitely gave me a lot more compassion for others. It gave me a better understanding of people who are going through pain,” Diver writes in his book. “I think the best way to describe it is that it matured me.”“With Sally, I went through a hugely traumatic death, where I wasn’t able to say goodbye to someone,” he says. With Rosanna, he had “a whole different experience.” It was slow, caring for her for 11 years through the treatment, but there was time. Together, they were able to prepare for her death. “There was only one night that Rosanna and Alessia weren’t together.”Diver says the landslide does not define him, and he doesn’t want Rosanna’s death to define Alessia. He tells his daughter: “We’re going to live our lives as loving, caring, strong people so that we can keep mum’s memory alive.” He is thankful to have experienced so much love from Sally and Rosanna; and 14-year-old Alessia is his greatest joy. “The great opportunity of my life – coming through these multiple traumas – is that they’ve all taught me so much.”He is a huge advocate for men’s mental health and seeking help from professionals. “Everyone wants to be resilient, it’s the buzzword.” But Diver wants people to know that it takes hard work to be able to adapt to change, and the process is always individual.It might come as a surprise that Diver has chosen to stay in Thredbo after so much pain but the community and the mountains he grew up in are his “spiritual place”. It’s where he goes to clear his mind, and he believes that this environment has been fundamental to his recovery. “Everything that you do in the mountains, whether it’s physical activity, whether it’s the extremes of weather, just adds to a place that brings me a lot of calmness,” he says. “When you look at the mountains, there are just so many possibilities.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsHow we surviveSki resortsSkiingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two refused to leave until it had been paid.Trustpilot reviews, dating back 18 months, report the same thing, ieclaiming the mechanism had failed.EA, LondonThis was intimidating for a young woman and a child. Locksmith fraud is on the rise – figures from the Master Locksmiths Association (MLA) show a 20% increase over 12 months last year.It’s unsurprising the racket is appealing to fraudsters. Anyone can set up as a locksmith without training or regulation, the job allows access to a householder’s keys, and they can refuse people entry to their own home until they’ve paid up.Most reputable locksmiths do not charge call-out fees, according to the MLA, and the average hourly charge for an emergency is around £80 to £100 depending on the time of day.To avoid being scammed, beware of cheap advertised prices lower than £60, or vagueness about costs. It’s a red flag if a locksmith starts by drilling the lock. This should be a last resort and is always expensive. Make sure the trader has the MLA logo, which vets and certifies members and has information on scams.The bill was paid by your babysitter’s mother and you refunded her.

Graphics byPaul Scruton,Harvey SymonsandFinbarr SheehyTue 11 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 10.57 ESTShareThe US president,Donald Trump, has put global leaders ill at ease with his threat of tariffs.After announcing and thendelaying tariffson Canada and Mexico, hittingChinese goodswith an additional 10% tariff and alsothreatening the European Union, countries and markets are concerned about where the US president will go next.Trump’s policies come at a time when the US operates a large negative trade balance with the rest of the world. This happens when a country buys or imports more from other countries than it sells or exports to them.In 2024, the US operated a trade deficit ingoodsof more than $1.2tn (£970bn) with the rest of the world, but operated a surplus of nearly $300bn in services.Line chart showing how US balance of trade has stood at a deficit of over half a trillion since 2017The charts below show why theTrump administrationmay have picked out certain countries to target with tariffs, and what the impact of any trade barriers could be.The analysis looks mostly at trade in physical goods as opposed to services, which unlike merchandise trade arenot subject to tariffsand border checks.Which countries export the most goods to the US?In 2024, the US received the most imports from Mexico,Chinaand Canada. Each of these countries exported more than $400bn of goods into the US.Mexico and Canada export a lot of vehicles to the US, as well as energy and oil. Machinery and electrical equipment also form a significant portion of Mexican exports to the US. Chinese exports include electronics, machinery and agricultural goods.European and Asian allies – such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam – are the next biggest exporters to the US, with the US importing more than $100bn of goods from each of these countries last year. The US imported $68bn of goods from the UK that year.While the EU is treated as one large entity for the purposes of trade and tariffs, the data includes figures on each member state individually.A world map showing the countries exporting the most goods to the USThe collective value of exports since 2009 is $5.2tn forCanada, $5.3tn for Mexico and $7.2tn for China.Trump is tackling large trade deficitsBut trade works both ways. The US is the world’s largest importer of goods, butChinais the biggest exporter.Overall, when tallying the total value of imports versus exports, the US also has the world’s largest trade deficit, worth more than $1tn. Some countries export far more to the US than they import, and it is these nations Trump appears to be targeting most.A chart showing the countries with the 10 largest trade surpluses with the USThe countries that the US has the largest trade deficits with are China and Mexico, according to data from theUS International Trade Administration.Figures from 2024 show that the US’s largest trade deficit was with China, at $296bn. For Mexico it was $172bn. These countries were among the first to have the threat of tariffs hanging over them.The US’s next largest deficits are with Vietnam – increasingly a gateway to the US for Chinese companies avoiding tariffs – followed by Ireland, Germany and Taiwan.Which sectors could be most affected?ForCanada– one of the three countries first targeted by Trump’s tariffs in his second term – its most significant products being exported to the US are fossil fuels, cars and machinery – mostly jet turbines and piston engines. Cars and machinery also represent the largest product groups being transported for sale from the US to Canada.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between Canada and the USWhileMexicohas a significant trade surplus with the US, the US still sends tens of billions of dollars’ worth of products in cars, machinery and electrical goods south of the border. This includes microchips, fibre cables and computer equipment. On the whole Mexico also exports the same products to its northern neighbour, although its main export is cars and trucks.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between Mexico and the USMexico and Canada have enjoyed largely free trade with the US since 1994 when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) came into effect. It was replaced in 2020 by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).The US trades a significant amount of fossil fuels with both of its neighbours. Trump’s initial announcement seemed to acknowledge this when he targeted energy resources coming into the US by a smaller tariff rate of 10%.Trump has threatened, but not yet announced, tariffs on theEuropean Union. Data shows that pharmaceutical products such as vaccines, machinery and cars account for nearly half of the EU’s exports to the US. Flowing the other way, from the US to the EU, is oil, pharmaceutical items and machinery.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between the EU and the USFinally, there isChina– which has implemented retaliatory tariffs against the US – half of whose exports go to the US in electrical devices such as computers, phones and batteries as well as toys and games. US exports to China include electrical items such as microchips, oil and soya beans.Trade between the US and China has been decreasing – in 2018, 21% of US imports came from China, and by 2023 this had fallen to 14%.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between China and the USWhich countries are the most exposed?When looking at what proportion of each countries’ trade is accounted for by the US, we can get a sense of how exposed each country’s trading economy is.The vast majority of trade in goods for both Canada and Mexico goes to the US – with 80% of Mexican and 78% of Canadian exported goods going to the US, according to data fromComtrade.The EU, China and the UK are less directly exposed – with 19%, 15% and 14% of their exported products going to the US. Within the EU, Germany dominates the value of the bloc’s exports, at more than $160bn in 2024, but that only accounts for 10% of its global total. Ireland, which exports about $100bn to the US, has the highest, with more than a quarter of its exports destined for the US market.A chart showing how the US’s closest neighbours have the greatest exposure in terms of tradeHowever, even if the proportion of their direct trade with the US is lower, experts warn that the interconnectedness of world trade would still mean countries would be in the firing line. That’s because modern supply chains stretch across multiple nations, with parts often crossing borders several times to make a finished product. For example, if Germany was hit by tariffs, but Britain was not, a UK company could still be hit if it supplied parts used in a German product destined for the US market.What does this mean for the UK?At the moment the UK has avoided a specific threat of tariffs hanging over it. Some of this could be down to the fact that Britain has a relatively balanced trade relationship with the US compared with other nations.One reason Britain’s exports to the US are outside Trump’s line of fire is because US figures suggest it had a physical goods trade surplus with Britain of about $10bn (around £8bn) in 2023. UK figures, by contrast, suggest it was actually the UK that had a small goods surplus of £2.4bn that year – with a collective goods and services surplus of £71.4bn.TheONSblames this difference largely on two reasons: territorial definitions, with the US data including crown dependencies, unlike the UK; and the methodologies used to estimate services trade.Bloomberg Economicsestimates that if Trump imposed 20% tariffs on the UK, growth this year could come in at 0.4% rather than 1.1%.Services account for the majority of trade between the UK and US. But if goods were targeted in any future tariff, the UK’s most exported products to the US are mechanical power generators, cars and pharmaceutical products, according toUS International Trade Administrationdata. The US’s biggest exports to the UK were oil, jewellery and aircraft products.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between the UK and the USOne complicating factor for the Labour government is that the closer the Labour government aligns the British economy with the EU – as it promised to do in July’s election – the less room it has for manoeuvre to accommodate US demands on trade.Experts say Washington is likely to demand access to the UK market for US agrifood products – including hormone-fed beef and chlorinated chicken. This would be both politically challenging for Labour, but also take the UK out of line with EU food safety standards, making trade harder. Experts therefore warn that Keir Starmer would be forced to choose between Brussels andWashington.Sources and methodologyData for most of the visuals in this piece were sourced from theUS International Trade Administration.

There is no evidence that diversity initiatives played any role in the crash, but that didn’t matter.Wrecking ball: Trump’s war on ‘woke’ marks US society’s plunge into ‘dark times’Read moreEllis, 34, wasn’t involved in the crash in any way. But she is a Black Hawk pilot in theVirginianational guard. And she’s transgender.In the immediate aftermath of the crash, two of the helicopter pilots killed were named, but the family of the third pilot initially elected to keep her name private, though she was later identified. Ellis was misidentified as the pilot in the in-between.On Friday morning, Ellis got a text from a close friend at about 4.30am telling her a random account was commenting on all of his public Facebook posts asking if he was friends with Ellis, “the one that killed those people in the crash”. She thought it was maybe a bot and discounted it.Ellis, who has been in the Virginia national guard since 2009 and has deployed to Iraq and Kuwait, hadwritten for the news website Smerconish.comabout being trans in the military on 28 January and then spoken to the commentator Michael Smerconish foran interview. She thought the attention was because of her article.In the article, she wrote that she grew up in a religious and conservative home with a history of military service, but that she knew she had gender dysphoria since she was five years old. She tried to be “more religious, more successful, more manly” in hopes it would “cure” her.“I got married, bought a house, helped raise a stepdaughter, played drums in the church band, and adopted a dog,” she wrote. “All the things I believed a good man should do. And I really wanted to do those things, but I also secretly hoped it would fix me. It didn’t work.”She realized during the pandemic that she was at a point where she could begin to address her gender dysphoria. She notified her command in 2023 that she would begin transitioning and came out to her unit in 2024 and got “overwhelming support”, she wrote. She paid for all of her trans-related care out of pocket.Ellis said she believed she was targeted because she’s a trans woman.“Once I put that article out, I became collateral damage, just like so many other trans people that are being unnecessarily targeted.”Later, on the Friday morning after the crash, another friend sent her screenshots of an article on a Pakistani website that included Ellis’s photo and claimed she was the third pilot. (This article, which says Ellis was “rumored to be” the unnamed pilot, is still uncorrected.)“Then the Daily Mail called my personal cellphone and asked if I was alive,” Ellis said. “And that’s when it kind of sunk in. And I was like, oh, this is big. This is not some corner of the internet saying something ridiculous.”She discovered that her name was trending on X, with some posts getting hundreds of thousands of views. “Why is this only on Twitter?” rightwing commentator Ann Coulter wrote on X, sharing a post about Ellis being the pilot. One account said the crash could be “another trans terror attack”.People opined that she hated Trump and was motivated by that hatred to act, killing herself and dozens of others to make a point. Trump issued an executive order banning trans people from joining or serving openly in the military, though it did not immediately kick trans people out. A group of trans military members havesuedover the order.Ellis says she’s a political moderate and has voted red more than blue. “I didn’t say anything negative about Trump. I just said I want to keep serving.”Ellis posted on Facebook on Friday morning to try to quash the rumors, asking people to report any posts naming her as the pilot. But she soon realized that wouldn’t suffice, so she made a video. Proof of life.“Interesting morning,” she starts in the video. “It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some sort of political agenda. They don’t deserve that. I don’t deserve this. And I hope that you all know that I am alive and well, and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors.”She went quiet from there, packed some bags, and left her home for the night after arranging armed security and arming herself. She worried someone might use public records to find her home and try to hurt her family.‘A twist of the knife’: trans Americans respond to Trump’s executive orderRead moreThe response to her video was overwhelmingly, though not uniformly, positive. Some people messaged her to say said she should have been on the helicopter instead, or that it’s nice she was alive but she shouldn’t be in the military because she’s mentally ill. Others shared anti-trans and antisemitic (she had said in the Smerconish interview that she was exploring the faith) comments on social media.But she said the video ultimately worked, due in large part to the misinformation being easy to debunk. “All I had to do was say I’m alive, and that kind of broke the whole rumor,” she said.She watched as people started correcting the rumor. She saw some veteran, pro-Trump accounts telling others they shouldn’t be going after a member of the military like this. Two days after the rumors reached a fever pitch, it appeared, she said, as if the misinformation was stopped in its tracks.She has tried unsuccessfully to report some remaining social media posts that falsely claim she was a pilot. “Calling me a murderer is apparently not a violation of X rules,” she said.She said she was not deterred from speaking out again, though. Her guard supported her throughout the ordeal, and it affirmed she wants to continue serving in the military.“I know not everyone loves me back, and that’s OK, but I want to serve everyone,” she said. “I want to use this incident somehow as a form of good. I don’t know what that looks like yet, but I really want to turn this into something that does good for the world.“I don’t want to make it about me,” she added. “I don’t want to be the victim or the martyr. I want to show people that being strong and standing up to this hate, that hopefully something good can come from it.”Explore more on these topicsWashington DC plane crashTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsTrump administrationUS militaryVirginiaRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Benny’s owners had just been deported after animmigration raidin New York City; faced with high costs and uncertainty, they hadn’t been able to take Benny with them. Reese did not have to stare long at the photo of the jowly bulldog’s silly smile before jumping in his car to go pick him up.“Everything about what I learned about that dog made me want him more,” said Reese, who is 39 and lives in Brooklyn.Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign started just days after his inauguration. Officers from federal law enforcement agencies havecarried out raidsin New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Diego, Denver, Miami, Atlanta and other large cities, stoking fears in communities across the country. More than8,000 immigrantshave been arrested, NBC reported.Undocumented people arestaying home from workandschool, drawing up plans in case they are separated fromtheir children, and trackingconfirmed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raidson social media. Some are also worrying about what will happen to family pets.View image in fullscreenBenny: ‘Everything about what I learned about that dog made me want him more.’Photograph: Kyle Aaron ReeseEnlace Latino, a public service journalism outlet for Latino immigrant communities based in North Carolina,publisheda piece shortly after Trump took office titled: “How can I plan for my pets’ future if I am detained or deported?” Steps include finding a trusted caregiver who agrees to watch after the pet, setting aside money for the pet’s care, and writing detailed notes about the pet’s breed, diet, medications, vaccinations and veterinarian.Benny’s owners, who declined to comment, left Benny with a close family friend, who used Facebook to permanently place him with Reese.“It’s almost like an underground thing,” Reese said of local efforts to re-home pets after Ice raids. “There’s no network in place, because we didn’t realize this was an issue. But people are really stepping up.”No one knows how many pets have been separated from their families due to Ice raids. A representative for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wrote in an email that “it’s too soon to identify any specific trends” in animal shelter admissions due to immigration raids.Flatbush Cats, a Brooklyn non-profit that traps, neuters and releases stray cats to reduce the population of street cats, also runs an adoption program; Reese is a volunteer there.“We’re hearing heartbreaking word-of-mouth stories from one neighbor to the next,” said Will Zweigart, the group’s founder. “This morning, one of our volunteers was crying her heart out on the way to the clinic with a cat that belongs to some neighbors she knows are being displaced by a landlord who was creating unfavorable living conditions for them because he knows they’re undocumented and not in a position to fight back.” They made the painful decision to re-home the cat while they look for safe housing.When established immigrant advocate organizations and local-level rapid response groups are focused on preventing detentions, deportations and family separation, concerns about adopting out animals might not seem like a priority. Still, leaving a pet behind can be devastating, and knowing it will be properly looked after may provide some comfort to immigrant owners. “Pets are family,” Zweigard said.View image in fullscreenNaomi Pardasie’s cats.Photograph: Naomi PardasieNaomi Pardasie, 28, is a naturalized US citizen, but her husband is not. In January, five Ice agents came to their apartment door. The couple did not let them in, and the agents waited outside for 45 minutes. Rattled by the encounter, Pardasie’s husband stayed home from his construction job for two weeks.The couple decided to voluntarily head back to Trinidad, where they’re from, in April. They’re bringing their cats – Oatmeal, Olive, Onyx and Zoboomafoo – with them.“They’ve been with us since they were born,” Pardasie, who works as a housekeeper and bartender, said. “I’ve known their moms, their dads, their moms’ moms and dads’ dads. I watched them come into this world, and it would be hard to just leave them here.” She is currentlyraising moneyto pay for their airfare and required vet visits.“Animals come into our lives for a reason,” Pardasie said. “It’s scary to know that people who don’t have the money to get their animals into another country have to leave them behind.”The US’s animal shelters are full. Last October, Animal Care Centers of New York, the city’s largest shelter,announcedthat it would no longer accept dog surrenders due to overcrowding.‘They’re hurting our children, our babies’: US schools on high alert amid Trump immigration raidsRead more“Animal shelters should be a lifeline for communities in times of crisis, but with chronic overcrowding, they’re often unavailable when they’re needed most,” Zweigart said. “The same thing happened in Los Angeles with the fires – the animals had to betransportedsomewhere else because local shelters were full. This highlights where we’re headed: as more and more people are displaced for different reasons, we’re not able to take care of animals.”Reese, who adopted Benny the bulldog, says that when institutions fail, communities can step in. “When people are deported, what happens to their animals is such a small part of the bigger issue,” he said. “But if we can take care of the animals, that’s something we can do when we feel like we have little control over everything else.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationPetsDonald TrumpNew YorkUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Regarding the tariffs, we are concerned about the cost of inflation on the cost of goods and services in St Lucia, particularly food. As you know we import many of our foodstuffs and other goods from the US.”Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, also raised concerns about the impact of US policy changes, particularly about the lack of information-sharing about those to be deported.“You may deport somebody – let’s say somebody who is in jail for burglar – you send them home, [but] all the information we have is that John Brown was serving five years for burglary, armed robbery, or whatever it is.“We do not know the history of this person: how long that person was in the United States of America … his or her skills, educational attainment, what is his or her criminal record,” he said.The information, Gonsalves said, was important in helping to reintegrate people into communities.Irwin Clare, the managing director of the New York-based NGOCaribbeanImmigrant Services, agreed that governments will need to know the backgrounds of any people being deported.“A lot of folks are coming back who have overstayed their time and would have just been caught up in the system. So we also have to have some differentiation between those types of deportees as opposed to the ones who would have had criminal records and were probably even incarcerated,” he said.Clare said that an increase in deportations would cause a lot of pain to Caribbean families, as breadwinners in the US are sent back to countries where they might struggle to find gainful employment.Any migration crackdown is likely to have an impact on remittances sent from the US to families in the Caribbean, which have historically been a significant contributor to Caribbean economies.One report late last yearestimated that remittances would inject $18.4bn into the region in 2024.Marlon Hill, a Jamaican-American lawyer and past president of the Florida-based Caribbean Bar Association, said Caribbean countries needed to take a proactive approach to the changes of the new administration. He said: “We need to decide: Caribbean first. We need to inform and empower ourselves and to understand what is needed to take care of our people in the region and throughout the diaspora.“What are the options for complying with immigration laws? If you’re a permanent resident, why aren’t you a US citizen if you’re eligible? Why haven’t you applied? You could be helping your family. So in the same way that America is thinking about America first, we need to also think Caribbean first. We’re not powerless in that regard.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationCaribbeanUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Tory leader, Pierre Poilievre, hadseized on a controversial carbon levy, and pledged to make the next federal vote an “axe the tax” election. Pollsters predicted his party would seize a convincing majority of seats. The country was on the cusp of a new Conservative era.And then Donald Trumpsuggested the US might take over Canada.The US president’s threats – ranging from “economic coercion” to outright annexation – have upended Canadian politics in a way few could have predicted. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday as he travelled to the Super Bowl game, Trump further escalated his rhetoric, claiming that Canada is “not viable as a country” without US trade, and warning that it can no longer depend on the US for military protection.For the last two years, any consideration of the future of Canada’s Liberal party had focused on the scale of its impending electoral loss. But in recent weeks, a series of polls have suggested that the Liberals have reversed their freefall.And a key factor in the party’s apparent resurrection has been Trump.Since Trump’s comments,Canada has seen a groundswell of visceral patriotism. Maga-style hats emblazoned “Canada Is Not for Sale”went viral. Canadiansjeeredvisiting American sports teams, even during a children’s ice hockey tournament in Quebec City.Canadian sports fans are booing the US anthem. But do Americans care?Read moreAnd amid a shift in the public mood, the Canadian prime minister has positioned his government as leading a “Team Canada” approach to the emerging threat from the south.“In this moment, we must pull together because we love this country,” Trudeau said in a recent speech in response to Trump’s threats. “We don’t pretend to be perfect, but Canada is the best country on earth. There’s nowhere else that I and our 41-million strong family would rather be, and we will get through this challenge just as we’ve done countless times before: together.”But for Poilievre, who had harnessed a populist current in the country and drawn comparisons with Trump, the avenues forward are less clear.The Conservative leader’s combative politics have served him well against Trudeau, but now appear to be faltering as nationalism supplants partisanship.graph showing party support over timeOne poll, from Ipsos, found the Conservatives had shed roughly 12 points of support within two weeks. Another survey in Quebec, from the firm Leger, found that if the Liberals putformer central banker Mark Carneyatop their ticket, the party vaulted far ahead of both the Conservatives and the separatist Bloc Québécois.A third, from the outfit Mainstreet, found the Liberals were tied – or even leading – among likely voters in the battle ground of Ontario.“This is very much a race that still favours the Conservatives. But if the Liberals gain even a couple more points, we’re in a place where they would suddenly become much more competitive, and the potential for minority government is possible,” said Éric Grenier, a political analyst atthe Writ.One of the main drivers in shifting sentiment has been theresignation of Trudeauas Liberal leader, after the Conservatives had gleefully prepared to wage an entire federal election campaign against him.“Now the election isn’t going to be about Trudeau. And with both Liberal candidates saying they won’t move forward with the carbon tax, it also won’t be about that. It will most likely be about the next four years and who is best able to dealing with Trump,” said Grenier.Last week, another poll from the Globe and Mail and Nanos found that 40% of Canadians felt Carney – the former governor of the Bank of England – was best suited to face off against Trump. Only 26% of respondents felt that person was Poilievre.For a campaign to go from a very specific issue – a referendum on Trudeau’s last nine years as leader – to a completely different issue –Donald Trump– is “rare”, said Grenier.The Conservatives plan to present a new, patriotic election message in the coming days. Attenders have been instructed to wear red and white – the colours of Canada, but also the colours of the Liberal party.“Adopting a Canada-first approach to the election is needed, but it’s an awkward one for them, because they’ve been saying for the last couple years that the country is broken,” said Grenier. “And now they have to say: ‘Well, it is but we still really love it.’ And it also feels a bit forced because a segment of their voting base – and probably a segment of their caucus – prefers to have Donald Trump as a president.”For the Liberals, the reversal confirms their decision to force Trudeau out. But Grenier cautions against reading too much into the polling.‘Buy Canadian Instead’: businesses vow to fight Trump’s tariffs across the borderRead more“The danger for someone like Carney, who is polling surprisingly well in a place like Quebec, is that some of the numbers are quite high. Can he live up to that? Or is the idea of him more attractive to voters than the reality of him as an actual leader?”Still, in an election fought over national identity and the protection of sovereignty, Liberals have unexpectedly found themselves dealt a few lucky cards.None of the Liberal candidates vying for the party’s top job are cabinet ministers, depriving opposition parties the chance to accuse them of dereliction.“It may still be a ‘change’ election, but it looks like it is not going to be a carbon tax election. Rhyming couplets like ‘axe the tax’ feel a little stale and disconnected from contemporary political and economic challenges,” said Scott Reid, a political adviser and former director of communications to the former Liberal prime minister Paul Martin. “And if the next election is going to be about how we rewire our relationship to the United States in the face of Trump’s capriciousness, someone with the credentials of Mark Carney starts to look interesting to some voters, and it at least gives the Liberal party the possibility of resurrecting itself.”Still, the polls at this point are “more akin to a spark than a bonfire’’, Reid said, adding that if an election were held today, Poilievre’s Conservatives would probably win a majority of seats.But the largely unprecedented nature of Trump’s unpredictable incursions into the national discourse means that honing a careful message, for either party, is largely a useless task.“What will Donald Trump do in the coming months when there’s a new prime minister on the scene [after the Liberals select their new leader]? How might he blunder into the minefield of Canadian politics? We just don’t know,” said Reid. “But we almost do know that it will happen. Either he determines the ballot question or, on any given day, he has the capacity to dictate the ballot question of the next election. That’s just the reality of it.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaJustin TrudeauDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This, he would learn, was a “black penny”.“My dad had, on the back of the penny, three ones – 1, 1, 1 – I didn’t know what that meant,” he recalls now, wearing a worn bush hat and sitting at Mangkaja Arts Centre near his home in the Muludja community, east of Fitzroy Crossing. The numbers, his father told him, were ration entitlements for flour, tea and sugar.Both of Street’s parents were never paid a wage for their labour in their lifetimes; Street was only paid for his work for the first time when he was in his 30s.His father, John, was aWalmajarriandJaruman from the desert. He built fences, tanks and troughs on Louisa Downs station, midway between Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek. His mother, Penny, aGooniyandiwoman from river country, would clean and cook on the station. As a boy, Street chopped wood and helped his father with the fencing.View image in fullscreenMy Parent Camp, 2022.Photograph: Mangkaja ArtsStreet was born in the traditional way: under a yellow hakea birthing tree known as a“boomerang tree”, although he is unsure if his birth year is 1950 or earlier. When he was about eight, or maybe 10, Hollywood westerns were shown at Eliza Downs, which inspired him to begin using charcoal and pencil to draw on the welded steel panels of a huge water tank on the property. He would draw the cowboys and cattle wranglers like his father, the tank becoming his first canvas, an artistic testimony to a way of life.As an adult, Street would often return to the water tank to remind himself of what he learned growing up, about the communal way of life and a love of country. His drawings, then later his paintings, would chronicle the lives of Aboriginal mustering workers – such as his father and Street himself on cattle and sheep stations along theCanning stock route, spending his nights telling stories by campfire.Stolen Wages, Street’s new exhibition at Fremantle Arts Centre as part ofPerth festival, tells the story of the wage theft inflicted on his parents, his people, on him. Streetled a class action against the Western Australian governmenton behalf of thousands of Aboriginal workers like himself; in 2023, the government settled,agreeing to pay $180mto these workers and their relatives.View image in fullscreenOne of Street’s newly completed works for Stolen Wages, showing a camp being prepared along a droving route.Photograph: Mangkaja ArtsAsked about what this settlement means to him, Street, whose first language is Gooniyandi, modestly agrees it was “probably” a good achievement. He recalls sitting across the table from lawyers who had come to his country to ask about life on the land and the withholding of wages.“Long time ago, maybe the [white] working men used to get something like £7 [a month] but our [Aboriginal] workers got nothing,” he says. “My parents had nothing. They worked for nothing.” And yet he remembers a spirit of comradeship among all the workers: “There was [a] good relationship when the European settlement came, [building] good relations, and they worked together, you know? That’s the time people didn’t have a boundary line, nothing. All together.”But the work was hard. Street’s father would accompany the muster, building cement tanks in the sand to draw water wherever the cattle went. Back at their tent home in Louisa Downs, his mother made bread and soup and taught the younger girls in the community to cook and clean. When at home, his father kept an eye on the weather.“When my dad saw there was cloud hanging around, he’d sing this rain song, and he’d get a feather of a white cockatoo and put it outside. I’d say, ‘What you doing, Dad?’ And he’d say, ‘I’m singing, I’m going to make that rain come’ … when big rain came, that was the only time my dad stopped working.”View image in fullscreenStreet at work in a studio in Fitzroy Crossing.Photograph: Mangkaja ArtsStreet’s grandfather taught him to ride horses by putting him on the back of a small donkey. This was the start of his own life wrangling cattle. When he told his parents he wanted to go out bush mustering, his father showed him the swag and cup he would need to pack on a mule. He was all set. “It was a lot of fun for me,” he recalls of that time. “I didn’t care about anything, makin’ my own way, learning about all the different jobs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is still not culturally appropriate for him to mention her name. “He loved his wife dearly,” says the Mangkaja Arts Centre manager, Liam Kennedy, “and from what I have been told, they were always together.” Street’s son Fabian and his grandson Howard both live with him in Muludja.Stolen Wages includes a replica of the water tank on to which Street began drawing, and continued to draw; the original tank was removed from Louisa Downs station three years ago.“I didn’t know I could come this far from all the time I was there on the station,” Street reflects. “When I started doing the drawing on the tank, in the 1950s, I didn’t know I was going to be involved with these galleries and take me on a journey.”Stolen Wages is open at Fremantle Arts Centre until 20 April.

I was aware of someone with dark hair and dark clothes … I was struck by his eyes which seemed dark and ferocious to me.”Rushdie added: “He hit me very hard around my jawline and neck. Initially I thought he’d punched me with his fist, but very soon afterwards I saw a large quantity of blood pouring on to my clothes. He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.”He continued: “Everything happened very quickly. I was stabbed repeatedly, and most painfully in my eye. I struggled to get away. I held up my hand in self-defense and was stabbed through that.”Asked how many times he was stabbed, Rushdie said: “I wasn’t keeping score.”Rushdie described getting up from his seat to get away from his attacker but fell. “He was trying to strike me as many times as possible.“I was very badly injured. I couldn’t stand up any more. I fell down,” Rushdie testified, estimating that he had been struck 15 times by his assailant.“I was screaming because of the pain,” he said, describing the wound to his right eye that took his sight on that side. Rushdie showed jurors the empty socket beneath an eye patch he now wears.While lying on the stage, Rushdie continued: “I became aware of a great quantity of blood I was lying in. My sense of time was quite cloudy, I was in pain from my eye and hand, and it occurred to me quite clearly I was dying.”Rushdie described how he was put on a gurney and later wheeled to an emergency medical helicopter. “I was dimly aware of what was going on until the helicopter landed, then I don’t remember anything until much later.”Rushdie was hospitalized for more that two weeks, and described how, while on a ventilator, he communicated by wiggling his feet.Under a brief cross-examination, Rushdie was asked about his recollection. He agreed that false memories exist. He pointed to his initial recollection “that I stood up to face him (Matar), but that was not true. I was sitting down.”Rushdie agreed with Matar’s defence proposition that freedom of expression, the right to a jury trial and due process were valuable rights and said he had had no contact with Matar before the alleged assault.Asked if Matar had spoken to him at all during the alleged incident, Rushdie said: “He did not.”The author was then excused from the witness box.Matar, a dual US-Lebanese citizen, is accused of attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty. Matar muttered: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as he was brought into court. Rushdie’s wife, Rachel Griffiths, and his agent, Andrew Wylie, sat in the gallery flanked by security.In opening statements, jurors had heard from prosecutors that Matar “almost succeeded in killing Mr Rushdie”.“Without hesitation, this man, holding his knife … forcefully and efficiently in its speed, plunged the knife into Mr Rushdie over and over and over and over again,” prosecutor Jason Schmidt said.Assistant public defender Lynn Schaffer told jurors that prosecutors would be unable to prove Matar’s guilt, even using video recordings and photos.“The elements of the crime are more than ‘something really bad happened’ – they’re more defined,” Shaffer said. “Something very bad did happen, but the district attorney has to prove much more than that.”A series of witness were called on Monday by prosecutors looking to place Matar at the crime scene. The Chautauqua employee Jordan Steves said he saw a “violent interaction with someone swinging their arms at an onstage guest …”Absent from the case so far is any reference to the fatwa that called for Rushdie’s death, issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini, then supreme leader of Iran. Prosecutors say they can secure a conviction without reference to it.Matar is set to be tried on federal terrorism charges, where the issue of motivation will be hard to exclude. The charges allege Matar was motivated by an endorsement of the fatwa by the Iran-backed group Hezbollah. On Monday, Matar said “Free Palestine” as he entered the courtroom.A later trial on the federal charges – terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization – will be scheduled in US district court in Buffalo.In an account published last year, Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder, Rushdie recounted how he had a premonition in a dream of of being attacked in an amphitheater.The trial will last up to two weeks, the lawyers said.Explore more on these topicsSalman RushdieNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The mystery behind the best UFO picture ever seenIn August 1990, two hikers sent photos of a strange diamond-shaped aircraft to the press – but the story never appeared. Was it a prank, a hoax, an optical illusion or something else entirely?Daniel LavelleTue 11 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareOn a misty evening in August 1990, two men hiking on the moors surrounding Calvine, a pretty hamlet in Perth and Kinross, claimed to have seen a giant diamond-shaped aircraft flying above them. It apparently had no clear means of propulsion and left no smoke plume; it was silent and static, as if frozen in time. Terrified, they hit the ground and scrambled for cover behind a tree. Then a Harrier fighter jet roared into view, circling the diamond as if sizing it up for a scuffle. One of the men snapped a series of photographs just before the bizarre craft shot away vertically and disappeared.Craig Lindsay was a press officer at the RAF base in Pitreavie Castle in Dunfermline, 50 miles away, when the Daily Record got in touch a few days later. The hikers, who worked as chefs at Fisher’s Hotel in Pitlochry, had sent six photos of the diamond to the newspaper and told their story. The Record’s picture editor, Andy Allen, sent Lindsay the best of the bunch.Lindsay had never seen such a clear photograph of a supposed UFO, so he forwarded the picture to theMinistry of Defence(MoD), which told him to ask the Record to send the other five photographs and their negatives. The MoD also instructed him to phone the hikers, which he did. One of them told Lindsay the whole story: the diamond, the jet, how it levitated eerily with no sound and accelerated with no obvious propellant.The MoD told Lindsay to leave the case with them. He pushed the diamond to the back of his mind.That autumn, Lindsay attended a routine meeting in London. On his lunch break, he went for a wander around the MoD’s offices and saw something familiar. “There, on the wall in front of me, was a great big poster-size print of the best of them [the photographs]. So, I spoke to the guys that were there and I asked them what their other photographs were like.” The ministry’s staff placed the other photographs on a windowsill. The snaps showed the Harrier jet moving from the right side of the frame to the left, while the diamond didn’t move an inch.He quizzed some of the specialists who had investigated the photos. They told him there was no evidence of a hoax, but they didn’t know what the diamond was. “I gradually forgot all about the thing,” says Lindsay. “Nothing had appeared from the first inquiry … I assumed that everything had just been forgotten.” The Record didn’t run the story, the hikers never spoke publicly about the photos and the images weren’t seen by the public for 32 years.Prof David Clarke, a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, worked as a reporter in the 1990s. When Clarke was beginning his career in journalism, his editor told him he needed to be an expert in something if he wanted to be successful. Clarke was studying for a PhD in folklore, so his editor handed him the spooky beat. “You know, everything weird:UFOs, ghosts, ESP [extrasensory perception], remote viewing,” Clarke says. He says his research into Calvine has had “more twists and turns than a John le Carré thriller”.Clarke became aware of the Calvine UFO in 1996 when Nick Pope, a former civil servant with the MoD, published Open Skies, Closed Minds, a book on ufology. Pope is sometimes known as “the real Fox Mulder” because of his work on the MoD’s “UFO desk”. In the book, he touches on Calvine, describing the case as “one of the most intriguing in the Ministry of Defence’s files”. He claims that MoD analysis found that the photos were “not fakes” and concluded “object unexplained, case closed, no further action”. Clarke read the book, but didn’t think much of Calvine until more than a decade later.By 2009, he was using his encyclopedic knowledge of UFOs to curate the release of thousands of UFO documents for the National Archives. Among the papers was a photocopied drawing of a diamond shape next to a plane. Alongside the sketch was a note intended for defence ministers in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet. Under the heading “Defensive lines to take”, it read: “Have looked at the photographs, no definite conclusions reached regarding large diamond-shaped object. Confident that jet aircraft is a Harrier. Have no record of Harriers operating in location at stated date/time. No other reports received by MoD of unusual air activity or sightings at location/date/time.”Clarke’s colleague analysed the image. Whatever the diamond was, it was a real object in a genuine photographClarke endeavoured to track down the source of the photograph, but reached a dead end. He phoned the Record and spoke to the news editor and the picture editor, but they said they couldn’t find any trace of the Calvine pictures and no one else at the paper remembered them. “I just thought, at the time, possibly the best explanation for why the Daily Record didn’t run it is because they had worked out it was a hoax or a prank,” Clarke says.Over the next decade, Clarke continued to visit the National Archives to browse UFO files as they became declassified. In 2018, he struck gold: he discovered that the MoD had failed to redact the name of a former official from its Defence Intelligence department. “If there was a UFO investigator, it was him,” Clarke says.He won’t reveal the identity of the investigator, but says he had an unusual name: “I just typed it into the internet … and, lo and behold, I was on his LinkedIn page. Within a couple of minutes, I was on the phone to him.”Clarke asked the former UFO hunter if he had seen anything “truly inexplicable” during his time at the MoD. The intelligence officer immediately mentioned “a couple of poachers up in Scotland” who in 1990 had photographed a peculiar object and sent the pictures to the Record. The officer told Clarke that the photographs caused a stink around the ministry and that they knew what the object was: an experimental craft belonging to the US. From here, the trail quickly led to Lindsay.View image in fullscreenMountains near Calvine in Perth and Kinross.Photograph: Agencja Fotograficzna Caro/AlamyWhen Lindsay took Clarke’s call in 2019, he told him: “I’ve been waiting for someone to call me about this for 30 years.” Lindsay told Clarke that he hadn’t seen the Calvine photo for many years. But after a few weeks of trawling through mountains of papers in his garage, Lindsay found a copy of the photo hidden between the pages of an old reference book. “I must have put it there to keep it flat and safe and then forgotten about it,” says Lindsay.Lindsay handed Clarke the copy on two conditions: that it be kept in Sheffield Hallam’s library; and that if either of the hikers came forward it would be returned to them. Clarke’s colleagueAndrew Robinson, a senior lecturer in photography at Sheffield Hallam,analysed the imageand verified its authenticity. Whatever the diamond was, he said, it was a real object in a genuine photograph.Clarke published the image in 2022 andthe story went viral. But Clarke held back one significant detail from the public. On the back of the Calvine photo was a note in red ink, which read: “Copyright Kevin Russell c/o Daily Record GLASGOW.”It seemed unlikely that a hotel chef would have thought to claim copyright, Clarke thought. Maybe Russell was a Record photographer who had become involved, or perhaps a picture editor had scribbled on the name. Clarke checked with the newspaper, which said that no one called Kevin Russell had ever worked there, either as staff or as a freelancer. Allen, the former picture editor who had sent the images to the MoD, might have been able to clear things up – but he died in 2007.Clarke withheld Russell’s name in the hope that the story would entice him to come forward, but no one did. He and some colleagues worked their way through a list of 140 Kevin Russells. The closest they got was a Kevin Russell who had worked as a kitchen porter in the area at the time, but he denied any knowledge of the UFO.‘With apologies, I’m not going to comment on the various names I’ve seen,” says Pope, who staffed the MoD’s UFO desk from 1991 to 1994. Pope had a poster of the Calvine photo on the wall in his office and he has been thinking about the diamond ever since. “I’m aware that the name Kevin Russell has been given,” he concedes. “I’ve seen various suggestions.”Why does he think the photographer hasn’t come forward? “I suspect that, at the very least, right at the outset, a fairly robust conversation was held,” Pope says. He pauses. Does he think they are still alive? “I’m not going to comment on that. I don’t want my non-comment to be misinterpreted. The idea that that these people were assassinated by the deep state – that’s just nonsense.” Many people talked to the MoD about UFOs on condition of anonymity, he maintains. “Many times, people who see UFOs don’t want to go public. Sometimes, they don’t even tell their family, their friends, their immediate colleagues. I want to be respectful of that.”The identity of the man (or men) who took the photographs remains a mystery, as does the identity of the diamond. Some ufologists think that because the diamond looks like no known terrestrial aircraft, it must be an alien spaceship, or possibly a craft recreated on Earth based on a crashed alien vessel. Others say it is evidence of Aurora, an alleged reconnaissance aircraft developed by a clandestine outfit in the US military, purportedly responsible for significant advancements in aviation technology. But there is little evidence of the programme’s existence.Something happened to them. Whoever came out of the car scared the absolute crap out of themMaybe the whole thing is a prank or a hoax – a cardboard bauble attached to a string and hung from a tree branch, as some sceptics claim. Was the diamond an optical illusion created by the reflection of an island in a lake? The second theory is the one to which Sean Kirkpatrick, a former UFO hunter for the Pentagon, subscribes: “It’s a reflection in the lake and the photo has been doctored,” Kirkpatrick says. “It’s been analysed multiple times. If you look carefully towards the right side and in the raw [uncompressed] image, the top and bottom are reflections of each other.” However, there is no body of water on that Calvine hillside.From alien spaceships to secret military projects, the more lurid conspiracy theories are bolstered by the fact that the Record’s editor in 1990, the lateEndell Laird, was a member of the MoD’s D notice committee. D notices, known since 2015 as DSMA notices, are issued by the Defence and Security Media Advisory Committee to prevent the publication of news stories that may jeopardise national security. Did Laird conspire with the MoD to suppress the story? His membership of the committee could be a coincidence, given that it then contained 14 members of the media, but if so it is a curious one.We don’t know if the Record was handed a D notice, but Pope has confirmed that the MoD prevented the release of the photographs. He told a 2024 UFO documentary, The Program, that if the Record had run the story “it would have blown our standard line out of the water. Therefore, we wanted to bury this – and we did. All the photographs and all the negatives were acquired by the Ministry of Defence and they were never seen again.”View image in fullscreen‘I’d been waiting for someone to call me about this for 30 years’ … Craig Lindsay, pictured with one of the Calvine photographs.Photograph: Dr David ClarkeThe UFO desk was not convinced it was a hoax, Pope says: “The consensus was that it was a solid and reasonably large-sized object.” He points out that the photographs were taken two days after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, which may explain why the military was testing advanced aircraft. On the other hand, if you wanted to keep a secret weapon secret, would you road-test it in broad daylight in a relatively populated area?Another reason to suspect the diamond was more than a bauble on a string is the story Richard Grieve told The Program. Grieve said he worked with the hikers in the kitchen of the Fisher’s Hotel. He said they were having a cigarette break one rainy evening when a black car pulled into the car park. Grieve claimed two men in dark suits got out and barked: “Break time is over,” while beckoning the hikers. “They were fucking spooks; they were men in black. And they stood outside in the pissing rain speaking to them,” Grieve said.According to Grieve, the pair returned to the hotel looking “white as a fucking ghost. Something happened to them. They’ve seen something. Whoever came out of the car scared the absolute crap out of them.”By refusing to comment, the MoD is simply feeding the conspiracy theoriesGrieve said the men were not the same afterwards. They drank heavily, took days off work and slept in their cars outside the hotel. Grieve claimed the pair vanished without trace four weeks later. “Chefs don’t just disappear out of the kitchen for 34 years and not have no other job. You don’t just fuck off and never work again. Where are they?”The one organisation that could end all the speculation is the MoD. “I am afraid we no longer offer comment on UFOs/UAPs [unidentified aerial phenomena] etc,” said an MoD spokesperson, adding that a quick Google search could solve the mystery. They also sent a link to an article in the Daily Express featuring a hypothesis that the diamond is a mountain peak covered by fog – an idea that Clarke says his photography expert has debunked.“The MoD could easily clear up this mystery by releasing the conclusions of the analysis they carried out on the images in 1990 and 1992,” Clarke says. “If this concluded the photos were faked, it can be released without having to release personal information about the photographer. By refusing to comment, they are simply feeding the conspiracy theories and the idea that they are hiding something.”To the hikers, he says: “It is the 35th anniversary of what has been described as the best UFO photo ever taken. Now is the time to come forward and tell us what really happened.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Composite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesWhen details about a scientific study in the 1960s became public, there was shock, outrage and anxiety. But exactly what happened?BySamira ShackleTue 11 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 05.33 ESTShareIn 2019, Shahnaz Akhter, a postdoctoral researcher at Warwick University, was chatting to her sister, who mentioned a documentary that had aired on Channel 4 in the mid-1990s. It was about human radiation experiments, including one that had taken place in 1969 inCoventry. As part of an experiment on iron absorption, 21 Indian women had been fed chapatis baked with radioactive isotopes, apparently without their consent.Having grown up in Coventry’s tight-knit South Asian community, Akhter was shocked that she had never heard of the experiment. When she looked into it, she found an inquiry by the Coventry Health Authority in 1995 conducted soon after the documentary aired. The inquiry examined whether the experiment put the subjects’ health at risk and whether informed consent was obtained. But the only mention of the women’s perspectives was a single sentence: “At the public meeting, it was stated that two of the participants who had come forward had no recollection of giving informed consent.”When Akhter read this sentence, she burst into tears. “I just thought of my own mother,” she said. “It was brave of these women to stand up and disagree. And their memories were just discounted.” Akhter decided to try to trace the women and their families. But she was anxious. It was now 2020; the Covid pandemic had hit, and ethnic minority communities were among the worst affected. Akhter contacted the local Labour MP, Taiwo Owatemi. “I was completely horrified,” Owatemi told me. “I was like: why am I just hearing about this? And how do we identify these women?” Owatemi agreed with Akhter that, with high rates of vaccine hesitancy among ethnic minorities, it was risky to draw attention to this historic injustice at that moment. So rather than putting out a public call for information, Akhter quietly asked around within her community for people who might know families that had been affected.By chance, at about the same time, a historian and broadcaster, Dr Louise Raw, came across some old reporting about the radioactive chapatis – specifically, a1995 story in India Todayfollowing up on the documentary, which jogged her memory of watching the film when it aired. Raw is interested in hidden histories and was immediately intrigued. “I read this and thought it was outrageous and weird and sinister,” she told me. Raw felt the story deserved more attention than it had received – perhaps a parliamentary inquiry or compensation – and started tweeting about it. “You can’t believe how kind the British are,” read the first tweet in athread she postedin August 2023. “Every morning, a van pulls up outside your house in Coventry. A friendly man brings you a freshly baked flatbread to eat. It’s just for you, not anyone else in your family. Every afternoon he comes back to make sure you’ve eaten it.” The thread went on to detail the key points in the documentary and India Today’s follow-up.Effectively packaged for a social media audience, and arriving at a post-pandemic moment when trust in healthcare systems was low and awareness of racism and identity politics at an all-time high, the story went viral. That first tweet was retweeted 9,000 times and viewed by 7 million people. TikToks recounting the story racked up tens of thousands of views. It was also covered by the mainstream media –the Guardian, the BBC, the Daily Mail – with many reports focusing on efforts by Akhter and Owatemi to trace the women.The story provoked major anxiety in Coventry. Though the study only involved 21 women, Owatemi was contacted by scores of people terrified that their mothers or grandmothers had been affected. One of the people who saw Raw’s thread was a woman in her 60s named Kalbir, who grew up in Coventry’s Punjabi community. She forwarded it to her siblings, and within a few minutes her elder sister replied: “Oh yeah, Mum said about that. I thought you knew.” Kalbir was shocked to discover that after the documentary had aired in 1995, their mother said she was one of the participants. Kalbir had been living away from home and no one had mentioned it to her. Now she was devastated. Her mother had died two decades earlier, and Kalbir was left with so many questions: “What happened? What was the aftercare for them? What are the implications? Did this affect their health afterwards?” Food in their house was always shared, and Kalbir panicked that she or her siblings could have eaten the radioactive chapatis too.View image in fullscreen‘I was completely horrified’ … Taiwo Owatemi.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyDesperate for information, Kalbir – an articulate, assertive woman who sees herself as a fighter – tried to get access to her mother’s medical records, only to hit dead ends: the doctor’s surgery no longer existed and medical confidentiality still applied after death. Meanwhile, Akhter and Owatemi’s efforts were stalling too. The Medical Research Council (MRC), the public body that funds and coordinates research into human health in the UK, says it does not have any documentation relating to the study, not even a list of who was experimented on. Although subsequent inquiries into the study stated that the level of radiation the women were exposed to was very low, this has not been enough to dispel concerns. “I have vivid memories of Mum being very ill, feeling like she was going to die,” said Kalbir. “Without clear information, we build up a story in our heads.” Alongside fears about the health impact of radiation exposure is the nightmarish idea of humans being experimented on without their consent.The study took place more than 50 years ago, yet it still stirs up strong emotions, tapping into a host of broader anxieties about racial health inequalities and abuses by the medical establishment. After so many years have elapsed, sorting truth from panic is a complex task. What really happened in Coventry in 1969?In the early 1960s, Peter Elwood was a young, ambitious epidemiologist living in his native Belfast. After his first few research projects, which he found “absolutely exhilarating”, Elwood started looking into how to tackle a major cause of ill health worldwide: anaemia. Commonly the result of iron deficiency, anaemia is a condition in which the blood produces an insufficient amount of healthy red blood cells, meaning that the organs don’t get enough oxygen-rich blood. The main symptom is fatigue, but in more severe cases it can affect children’s cognitive development, and in pregnant women it can contribute to premature birth and maternal mortality. (Even today, the World Health Organization classifies anaemia as a serious global public health problem.)One day in Belfast, Elwood was in his car, chatting to a colleague about how to improve treatment for anaemia. “Giving tablets through GPs was obviously achieving very little – what could we do?” he recalled. Since the late 1950s, bread in the UK had routinely been fortified with iron, along with other minerals including calcium, but there hadn’t been much investigation into how effective this was, or how the type of iron or flour affected absorption. “And so the whole field, which lasted about 10 years and ended with the radioactive chapatis, all started with an idea in the car,” Elwood said. (Elwood, now in his 90s, declined to be interviewed for this article. All quotes from him are taken from an interview he gave to anoral history projectin 2000.)In 1963, Elwood moved to Cardiff to take up a role at the Epidemiological Research Unit, a division of the MRC. He set up new studies looking at iron in bread, testing different types of fortified flour and how iron absorption was affected by other foods eaten at the same time. Then, in the late 1960s, he began to use an exciting new research tool: radiation. Typically, iron absorption is measured by giving someone iron-enriched food or supplements and then checking levels of haemoglobin in the blood – a process that can take months. With radioactive iron isotopes, studies could be completed in weeks or even days. The radioactive element worked almost like a tag attached to the iron, allowing scientists to see and precisely measure what it was doing inside the body. (Radioactive tracers are still used today as a diagnostic tool for cancer and other conditions.)In the postwar period, doctors used radiation to treat everything from arthritis to ringworm. By the mid-1950s, it had become clear that exposure increases the chance of developing certain cancers and can cause infertility. The use of radiation was pared back, but medical researchers remained excited about the quick, precise experimentation it offered. This, along with other new technologies such as cell culturing and a massive growth in antibiotics, sparked a sense that medical science might even be able to defeat disease entirely.At the time Elwood was working on his iron studies, the culture of medicine was paternalistic. Most doctors believed they were best placed to make decisions about risk on behalf of their patients. Consent was often seen as at best unnecessary, and at worst actively obstructive to the pursuit of knowledge. In 1947, after the Nuremberg trials exposed the full horror of the Nazis’ medical experiments on inmates at concentration camps, a new set of principles for ethical research on humans, known as the Nuremberg Code, had been introduced. The first of its 10 points is: “The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.” The code also sets out other principles: experiments should be for the good of society and carried out by qualified researchers, and the risk should never exceed the potential benefit. But at first the code didn’t have much effect on researchers in the UK and the US, who saw it as something that applied to evil war criminals, not high-minded doctors who wanted to further scientific knowledge. In 1964, the medical researcher Paul Beeson, who had been a professor of medicine at both Yale and Oxford, wrote that the Nuremberg Code was “a wonderful document to say why the war crimes were atrocities, but it’s not a very good guide to clinical investigation which is done with high motives”.But as details of experiments carried out throughout the 20th century emerged, it became clear that good intentions are not enough. The Tuskegee experiment, which ran in Alabama from 1932 to 1972, aimed to explore the prevalence of syphilis among black men. Participants believed they were being treated for their condition, but in fact they were given placebos even after penicillin emerged as an effective, readily available treatment for syphilis in the mid-1940s. Many died unnecessary deaths. In the 1960s, mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook school in Staten Island were intentionally infected with viral hepatitis, sometimes repeatedly, for research into a vaccine. There are countless other examples from the US, UK and Canada. A number of these involved radiation exposure: in the 1950s, pregnant women in London and Aberdeen were injected with radioactive iodine to test their thyroid function despite the fact that radiation exposure of any sort poses a risk to a foetus. In Massachusetts in the 1940s and 1950s, boys with learning difficulties at a residential school were fed radioactive oatmeal as part of an experiment to see how Quaker Oats were digested.In the 1960s, two physicians on opposite sides of the Atlantic – Henry Beecher in the US and Maurice Pappworth in the UK – separately sounded the alarm about widespread unethical practices. They highlighted two main issues: first, that studies were carried out without patients being given the opportunity to consent, and second, that some studies exposed them to unjustifiable levels of risk. “In their zeal to extend the frontiers of medical knowledge, many clinicians appear temporarily to have lost sight of the fact that the subjects of their experiments are in all cases individuals with common rights,” wrote Pappworth in 1967.These interventions were hugely controversial, but gradually the medical establishment became alert to the risks of unethical research practices. This debate was rumbling on in the background as Elwood tested iron absorption in the 1960s. But at the time he was starting to use radioactive isotopes in his work, there were no guidelines or restrictions on using radiation on human subjects. Elwood had already made significant discoveries about how the body absorbs iron. “[It was a] fascinating set of studies, and again I just valued the opportunity to follow through an idea,” he said. Radiation was simply another tool to find out more.In 1968, Elwood published a paper on an experiment in which volunteers – mainly colleagues and friends, Elwood said – were given a daily breakfast that included bread fortified with radioactive iron salts. “A fortnight later, we asked them to go to Harwell and have whole body measurements of the iron that had been absorbed from the bread,” said Elwood. Harwell Laboratory, also known as the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, was a government-owned lab just outside Oxford. It was the only place in the UK with technology sensitive enough to detect the low levels of radiation absorbed from the bread. Elwood’s study, which found that eggs inhibited iron absorption while fruit juice aided it, attracted media attention both in the US and in the UK. His research informs treatment to this day – when I was prescribed iron recently, the doctor told me to take the tablets with orange juice.As a rising star within the field, Elwood was invited to join the World Health Organization’s Committee on Iron Deficiency. “One of the first things the committee said to me was that my work on bread was of some interest but really almost totally irrelevant to the countries where anaemia is undoubtedly a real problem, where chapatis or tortillas are eaten,” Elwood recalled. “They said: ‘We do not know what fermentation does to the iron. Would you repeat this study using chapatis?’”So in Cardiff Elwood hired an Indian housewife to teach a group of Welsh women to make traditional chapatis. Using flour fortified with radioactive iron, they made 200 chapatis to freeze until needed. Meanwhile, Elwood looked for participants. He needed South Asian women who still ate a traditional diet. Eventually he settled on Coventry, where there was a community of migrants from the Punjab region of India. Elwood’s team enlisted a doctor’s surgery in Foleshill, the centre of Coventry’s South Asian community, to identify women who could take part.View image in fullscreenFoleshill Road, Coventry, in the 1970s.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesDr Shah, the GP who referred women to the study, was well known in Foleshill. Kalbir remembers him as a friendly man who often visited patients at home. Exactly what Shah told the 21 women he referred for the study is a crucial matter of dispute, and since he died decades ago, it is impossible to ask him. But it would later become clear that at least two of the women went to Shah for advice – regarding migraines in one case, arthritis in another – and believed they were being put on a special diet to diagnose or treat the issue. Kalbir was only seven in 1969, so she has no idea what her mother was told, but she finds it hard to believe her mother fully understood the implications. “There was a lot of trust in doctors,” she said.Once the women had been identified by Shah, they were passed on to Elwood’s team. According to a later MRC inquiry, a member of the team – usually Elwood himself – visited each woman to explain the purpose of the study and the fact that it would involve low levels of radiation exposure. They were also reportedly given letters explaining they’d be consuming radioactive isotopes to test their iron absorption. (When I asked to see these letters, the MRC said it does not have any documentation relating to this study in its archive.) But there was a problem. While the letters and meetings were in English, most of the women spoke only Punjabi or Pothwari, and some could not read at all. “We were visiting Asian people who were very suspicious and didn’t speak any English,” said Janie Hughes, a field worker who accompanied Elwood to Coventry. (Allquotes from Hughesare taken from a 2000 interview for the oral history project.) Today, anyone taking part in medical research must provide written consent, and professional interpreters are required for non-English speakers. This did not apply in the 1960s.When possible, the team was accompanied by the local health visitor, Mrs Butt, who spoke Punjabi but was not a professional interpreter. When there were translation issues or Butt was not available, the women’s children stepped in. For obvious reasons, it is not ideal for children to translate medical information, especially when it involves unfamiliar terms such as “radioactive isotope”. Hughes remembered that language was a challenge for Elwood. “He was trying to put over what he was trying to say. The ethics behind it – you have to sort of get consent, especially to take a blood sample, and you were sort of wondering: do they really understand what I am [on] about?” Later she added: “Can you imagine trying to explain all that to somebody who only speaks Urdu?” (The women did not speak Urdu, which is the lingua franca of Pakistan.)Despite these translation difficulties, and the possibility that the women did not understand what was happening, the study got under way. Every morning for four days, the women were asked to eat one of the irradiated chapatis, which were delivered on dry ice each morning. A few hours later, Tom Benjamin, a field worker on Elwood’s team, would return, visiting all 21 houses to check the women had eaten it and record what foods they’d had with it. Seventeen days later, the women were picked up and driven an hour and a half to Harwell Laboratory for testing. Remembering the study approximately 31 years later, Elwood had a glowing memory of the trips to Harwell. “Tom Benjamin really went over the top in making these women feel valued and welcomed. He arranged a visit to see something of interest during their trip to Harwell, which was a day’s journey,” he said. “He visited Oxford, took them round one of the colleges; he took them for tea, he arranged to have tea breaks on the way there and on the way back, and really I think I made 20 friends on that project – they were so friendly to us.”It is impossible to corroborate this recollection, but the lab, an imposing building on the outskirts of Oxford, would have been at the very least a strange environment for the women. Kalbir finds it upsetting to imagine her mother there. “The terror these women must have gone through,” she said. “They were already struggling in England. Our homes were being attacked by racists, we would get abused on the street, and then the system does this to them.”View image in fullscreenInside the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment in the 1950s.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesThe study, published in 1970, found that iron was not absorbed any more effectively from chapatis and the fermented flour they use than from bread. No one informed the women about the results, and no one followed up to check whether the radiation exposure had impacted their health. This was standard practice at the time, and researchers believed the low level of radiation was unlikely to cause harm. “Everyone forgot about it,” said Elwood. It would be 26 years before it resurfaced.In the mid-1990s, a filmmaker named John Brownlow was scouting around for his next documentary project when a story from the US caught his eye. Journalist Eileen Welsome had recently won a Pulitzer prize for her reporting on human radiation experiments, in which she had tracked down victims and put a human face to the issue. The studies she had found fit into two broad categories. The first had a military purpose, where unconsenting human subjects were used to study how radiation from atomic weapons would affect the body. In one of the most shocking examples, between 1945 and 1947, 18 hospital patients across the US, mostly uneducated and poor, were injected with plutonium. The second category of studies had a worthy medical purpose – studying iron absorption or thyroid function, say – but still exposed patients to risk without their consent. One had taken place in the 1940s, when 849 pregnant women attending a hospital clinic in Nashville were given radioactive iron isotopes to test the absorption of iron in the uterus. The hospital insisted that the doses were within safe limits – but any radiation exposure is risky for a foetus. Welsome found a woman whose child, exposed to radiation in the womb, had died of a rare form of cancer.With research funding from Channel 4, Brownlow and a small team began looking into whether similar experiments had occurred in the UK. They trawled through documents at the public records office, and studies at the British Library, looking for records relating to the UK’s main atomic research labs. Some of their discoveries were shocking. For Project Sunshine, throughout the 1950s British doctors had sent the body parts of dead children, without the consent of their parents, to US scientists to test the impact of nuclear fission on bones. Brownlow came across studies that were very similar to those Welsome had found in Nashville. These studies, in Aberdeen, Liverpool and London, tested pregnant women’s thyroid function, iron absorption and placentas. The women were given radioactive injections or tablets, either without being informed at all or without having the risk explained.One of the studies that caught Brownlow’s eye was titled: “Absorption of iron from chapati made from wheat flour”. “I just thought: what’s going on?” he recalled. With the help of Sukhbender Singh, a local Sikh Punjabi journalist, the team tracked down Pritam Kaur, one of the 21 women in the chapati experiment. The film-makers entered their first conversation with the family with an open mind. “They could well have said: ‘The researchers told us everything,’” he told me. “But either they hadn’t, or it hadn’t been understood.”Kaur said that when she had gone to her GP for migraines, he suggested the cause might be anaemia. In the documentary, Kaur is elderly and looks fragile as she sits on a sofa next to her son, who translates for her: “He told her that this chapati will help you to find out what you’re really lacking. He said: ‘Somebody will come and see you at your house and give you this chapati, and you eat it for a few days, then we will take you and check you out.’” Kaur interjects in Punjabi and her son adds: “My mother just told me right now, if she knew about it, she would not have eaten it.”Brownlow did not think the experiment in Coventry was the worst he’d found. In Wales, he had tracked down a couple who had been unable to dress their baby for her funeral because her leg bones had been removed for Project Sunshine. By contrast, the chapati experiment had a clear, benign medical aim: studying how to reduce cases of anaemia. But the way it was conducted fit with what Brownlow was finding elsewhere. “This was a vulnerable population – in this case, a minority community which had difficulties with English – with a layer of people doing the consenting for them,” he told me.On 6 July 1995, the documentaryDeadly Experiments aired on Channel 4. The first half of the film explained the roots of radiation experiments in the development of atomic weapons. The second half focused on studies in the US and UK that exposed people to radiation without their consent. Elwood was contacted before the documentary went out but does not appear in the film. When he sat down to watch it, he was “absolutely incredulous”. The documentary is soundtracked with ominous music, and at a few points shows footage of mushroom clouds to signify the link between radiation and nuclear weapons. Every time this was shown, Elwood’s daughter-in-law, who was watching with him, nudged him and said: “That’s another one of your chapatis has gone up.”Elwood had long since moved on to other research, and his career had been a distinguished one. Most notably, his team proved the life-saving benefits of taking daily aspirin after a heart attack – a huge medical breakthrough. To see his old research presented in this dark light was a shock. The segment on the Coventry experiment comes at the end of the film and lasts only five minutes. Elwood watched aghast at what he thought were “extraordinary claims” about his research processes. Kaur’s account is intercut with an interview with an MRC representative who insists that informed consent was obtained and that “where there were language difficulties” the conversation was conducted “with the assistance of a family member who was fluent in English”. Off screen, Brownlow puts it to the MRC official that one woman said she was never told the experiment involved radiation. “That’s clearly unethical, isn’t it?” he says. The MRC official responds: “Well, if that is correct, yes.”View image in fullscreenPritam Kaur in the 1995 documentary Deadly Experiments.Photograph: Screengrab/Twenty Twenty TV/Channel 4The documentary generated news coverage, political debate – and huge anxiety. “People panicked and thought it might have happened to them,” said Brownlow. The Coventry story was picked up by the Indian media. India Today spoke to the daughter of Danti Sohanta, Kaur’s neighbour, who said she had been brought into the study after seeing the GP for arthritis. “The doctor told her: ‘If you’re put on a special diet, perhaps you’ll get better,’” said her daughter. “She believed him. You didn’t question a doctor in those days.” The article also featured an eye-popping encounter with Paul Fawcett, an MRC spokesperson, who insisted that “a Gujarati-speaking health visitor always accompanied the doctor”. The journalist pointed out that the women spoke Punjabi, not Gujarati. (Punjab and Gujarat are 1,000km apart.) According to the article, “Fawcett rechecked his notes and promptly repeated himself.”As concerns spiked, Coventry council set up a helpline for worried residents, and the Coventry Health Authority conducted an inquiry. Elwood found it a bruising experience. “I went up to Coventry and I was met by the chief medical officer, who told me: ‘Look, let’s go in by the back door. There’s a huge crowd of reporters, and Asians, and they are out to get you – they really are very, very difficult,’” he recalled. Elwood gave an explanation of the experiment before taking questions. “One or two of the people there were very, very hostile,” he said. One Asian man “beat the table, and he shouted at me that I had been in league with the war department and the Ministry of Defence, that these poor women had been duped, that I had deceived them … they were all in ill health. Mind you, they were all in their 80s by then and one or two had died, and everything that was wrong with them was put at my door.”Elwood was clearly unprepared for this wave of anger. He even disputed that the women had trouble understanding English, although this was widely corroborated. “They said these women were illiterate, that I had purposely chosen them so that they wouldn’t understand,” he said. “Well, I had letters from about three of them thanking me for the most interesting study, written in perfect English.” (I asked the MRC whether Elwood still has these letters and was told he has not kept any correspondence relating to the study.)Although Elwood found the experience unpleasant, the final Coventry Health Authority report came down strongly in his favour, concluding that it met ethical standards of the time, and that the level of radiation exposure – as assessed by an independent expert – was very low, equivalent to a single extra chest X-ray at that time. The report criticised the film-makers, saying they’d “caused considerable unnecessary concern to the Asian people in Coventry”. One thing was notably lacking in the report: the voices of women who were experimented on. The report said the MRC no longer had a list of participants in the study, so they could only speak to “a small number” who came forward as a result of the documentary. It’s not clear what efforts were made to reach out to these women, but no one contacted Kalbir’s mother, who was unaware of this local investigation. The only mention of the women’s perspectives is the single sentence saying two of them did not recall giving consent.In the wake of the documentary, the MRC commissionedits own inquiry, which looked into all the MRC-funded experiments featured in the film. It was published in 1998 and concluded that all the experiments were fine by the standards of the time. Once again, the women did not feature in the section on the Coventry experiment; the report said that none came forward “despite numerous avenues being pursued”. Since researchers had personally explained the experiment to the women – which was not the norm at the time – the report singled Elwood out as “a researcher of the highest integrity” and said this was a “model study in which research practice exceeded the prevailing standards of the period”. It also noted that since many of the women did not speak English, and children ended up translating for them, “it is possible that, despite the best intentions of the research team, full details of the study were not grasped by the women involved”. The report does not dwell on this beyond acknowledging that “the needs of ethnic minority research subjects generally are now better recognised and accordingly treated more sensitively”.In the US, Eileen Welsome’s reporting triggered Bill Clinton’s administration to set up a full inquiry into human radiation experiments. Clinton apologised to victims. A series of class action lawsuits in the 1990s led to hefty compensation. Some of these cases were remarkably similar to the chapati experiment and others that Brownlow uncovered in the UK. They were experiments that had a relatively benign medical aim, and in which the crucial issue was lack of consent rather than evidence of actual harm caused by radiation exposure. The pregnant women given radioactive iron in Nashville received more than $10m, even though the hospital maintained that the level of exposure was low. Researchers who did a follow-up study of these women found a “small but statistically significant” increase in cancer in their children. A group of the students in Massachusetts who were fed radioactive oatmeal without consent won a settlement of $1.85m, despite researchers once again making similar arguments to their UK counterparts about the low levels of radiation.In the UK, there were no follow-up studies of the health impacts, no lawsuits, no compensation. There was not even an apology.When the Coventry experiment was suddenly catapulted back into the public consciousness in 2023, there were calls for a public inquiry and compensation for the women. But it is difficult to see how any of this can happen when basic details, such as the names of the women experimented on, are so hard to come by. Even in 1995, the MRC said it did not have this information. “As a scientist, I find that very bizarre,” said Owatemi, who was a pharmacist before becoming an MP. “This researcher is still alive, and I don’t believe it’s been long enough for the MRC to have got rid of all those archives.” (In response, the MRC pointed me to itspolicy document, which states that the retention period for clinical research is 20 years, and to more recent GDPR rules, which require that data is not retained longer than necessary.)The secret deportations: how Britain betrayed the Chinese men who served the country in the warRead moreEfforts to trace the identity of the women involved have been slow. Akhter, the Warwick researcher, is in contact with a number of families who believe their mothers or grandmothers were part of the experiment, and plans to conduct interviews with them about their experiences. Meanwhile, the MRC has commissioned its own independent research into the Coventry experiment and other historical trials “where research processes, specifically consenting procedures, would not meet the ethical standards expected today (even if they met the ethical standards of the time)”. It has commissioned a team at the University of Leicester to interview families and the wider community with the aim of looking at “trust within ethnic minority communities”. Owatemi hopes to identify the women so there can be an official apology as well as a morbidity study to see what health impact the radiation might have had.In the 1990s, MRC officials insisted that it would be a poor use of public money to do a follow-up study on the women since the level of radiation exposure was so low. But to people who already feel misled, such reassurances can feel like a repetition of the “doctor knows best” mentality. “I feel anger, frustration and massive anxiety,” Kalbir told me. “I’m desperate to get answers and justice.” As it has surfaced and resurfaced, the story of the radioactive chapatis has come to represent something more than itself. “These women had a hard time in England,” said Kalbir. “They didn’t understand the way research and the medical professions worked. They had a great deal of trust. This shouldn’t have happened.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readMedical researchCoventryWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So why are medical experts saying her conviction is unsafe? Josh Halliday and Felicity Lawrence reportLucy Letby was convicted for the murder and attempted murder of more than a dozen babies. She has been called the worst child serial killer the UK had seen. But even before the trial was over experts had begun raising concerns about her conviction.Then, last week,came a bombshell press conferencein which a panel of renowned neonatal experts said they believed not just that Letby’s conviction was unsafe - but that there was no murder or deliberate harm. Instead they said the deaths had been caused by a series of factors including understaffing and a lack of skills on the ward to treat the babies they were caring for. So what is the evidence that the panel was looking at and why do so many questions seem to swirl around the Letby trial?Josh Halliday, the Guardian’sNorth of Englandeditor, reported on the trial and heard the evidence put before the jury. He said: “Until last week, I think I believed, on the balance of probabilities, that Lucy Letby was probably guilty.” However, the press conference raised some serious questions that have made him rethink his opinion.The investigative reporterFelicity Lawrencehas been examining the case for 18 months and tellsHelenPiddabout what the ramifications of a retrial could be. “I think if it does turn out, as looks increasingly likely, to be a huge, historic miscarriage of justice, there’ll be questions that have to be answered by many institutions.”Photograph: Cheshire Constabulary/PAExplore more on these topicsLucy LetbyToday in FocusUK criminal justiceNorth of England"

Yambio, 27, was analleged victim of Najim’s abusesduring his detention at the notorious Mitiga prison near Tripoli.‘Why did we give back this alleged criminal?’ Pressure grows on Meloni after Italy releases wanted Libyan police chiefRead moreYambio’s case followed revelations that an Italian investigative journalist and two activists critical of Italy’s dealings with Libya were among 90 people who received notifications from WhatsApp in late Januaryalleging they had been targeted with spyware.WhatsApp has said the spyware used in that breach – which affected journalists and activists and others in two dozen countries – was made by Paragon Solutions, an Israel-based company that makes cyberweapons. The Guardian reported last week that Paragonterminated its client relationship with Italyfor breaking the terms of its contract, citing a person familiar with the matter.Yambio received an email from Apple on 13 November seen by the Guardian, informing him he was being targeted by “a mercenary spyware attack” that was attempting to “remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple account”. The message said the attack “is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do”.It did not specify what kind of spyware was being used against him, and Yambio was not one of the 90 people who received aWhatsAppnotification.Yambio said he contacted a digital security expert atCyberHub-AMin Armenia, who in turn connected him with the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital threats against civil society and assisted WhatsApp in tracking hacking attempts made against the 90 people, allegedly using the spyware produced by Paragon. Seven of the alleged targets live in Italy.In a statement, Citizen Lab said it was continuing to investigate Yambio’s case.Any evidence that Yambio was targeted by spyware could have political reverberations for whoever was behind the alleged attack. The Rome statute, which established the ICC, is mandated to protect the safety and wellbeing of any witnesses and has the power to prosecute offences that obstruct witnesses.“I already had suspicions in September when my phone started to behave strangely,” he told the Guardian. “For examples, calls would just hang up, the phone would get warm or the battery would run out really quickly.”Spyware made by companies such as Paragon and NSO Group generally have access to multiple so-called vectors, or vulnerabilities that enable the spyware they make to infect a mobile phone. WhatsApp has previously been vulnerable to spyware made by both Paragon and NSO Group, but individuals can also be infected via SMS messages or other apps.Paragon has not commented on the cases that have emerged inItalybut has said it has “zero tolerance” for clients that violate its terms of service, which includes prohibitions on targeting journalists and activists.The office of the Italian prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, last week denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged Paragon breaches and has not responded to the claims that Paragon cancelled its contract with Italy.Yambio has described the Italy-Libya migrant pact, which involves Italy funding the Libyan coastguard to capture people in the Mediterranean and bring them back to the north African country, as “a death sentence”.“For three months, my life has been lived under constant threat: I do not know where it’s coming from, which government [is involved]. I live in Italy, I don’t live in any other country. So who should I hold accountable?”He added: “The people who have so far come out in public are in Italy, and [some] of these people are in my close circle. We are people working to stop human suffering, to try to make a change, and yet we are being targeted. I am very afraid because the information concerns not only me but the life of people who [have been victims of abuse in Libya] and also the life of my partner and my child.”Yambio is attending a press conference in the European parliament on Tuesday afternoon about the case involving Najim, also called Almasri, which has roiled Italian politics in recent weeks. The ICC said on Monday that it had officially asked Italy to explain why the country released Najim after his arrest in Turin instead of extraditing him to the Netherlands, where court is based.Najim was repatriated to Tripoli onboard an Italian military aircraft. Meloni, who isbeing investigated over the matter by prosecutors in Rome, said Najim was immediately repatriated because he posed a risk to national security.“We have not received any statement from the EU, from the European Commission, the European parliament or any member state on this case of an internationally wanted criminal who was smuggled away from justice,” said Yambio.Yambio, from South Sudan, received asylum in Italy in 2022 after escaping from Mitiga prison, a facility under Najim’s watch and condemned by human rights organisations for its arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of political dissidents, migrants and refugees. He later crossed the Mediterranean by boat.The pact between Italy and Libya, first signed in 2017 and renewed since, has long been condemned by humanitarian groups for pushing people back to detention camps where they face torture and other abuses.Explore more on these topicsItalyLibyaGiorgia MeloniWhatsAppHackingInternational criminal courtAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Along the Fidel Castro highway, the posters hang on poles that rise out of piles of rubbish. Near the grand mosque, one poster is accompanied by the gnomic inscription “Your silence is precious, your eyes reassuring”. Another, bearing an image of him shaking Xi Jinping’s hand at a meeting in Beijing in September, has the caption: “Welcome back Mamady Doumbouya, our pride.”View image in fullscreenAcross Conakry, there are billboards and posters bearing Doumbouya’s face.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianFor many in Guinea’s political opposition and civil society, the reverential messaging is a distraction from the junta’s increasingly authoritarian exercise of power and an ominous sign that Doumbouya has no intention of relinquishing power.“Each of us is afraid for his own safety,” said Abdoulaye Kourouma,the head of the opposition Rally for Renaissance and Development party. “Whether you are a scientist, a university scholar, a leader of opinion, a very good journalist, no one speaks today.”Many people initially welcomed the coup thatdeposed Alpha Condé, who had controversially altered the constitution in 2020 to enable him serve a third five-year term. Under international pressure, the new military leaders initially pledged to hold a constitutional referendum and hand power to elected civilians by the end of 2024. But neither promise was fulfilled, and in the meantime a steady flow of opposition figures and civil society members have been detained or brought before the courts.View image in fullscreen‘Each of us is afraid for his own safety,’ said Abdoulaye Kourouma, the head of the opposition Rally for Renaissance and Development party.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The GuardianThe coup was one of multiple military takeovers that have taken place across central and west Africa since 2020.In Gabonand Guinea, the military acted after civilian leaders discarded term limits or manipulated elections. Across the region, junta leaders have either delayed promised elections or, asin Chad, compromised polls to ensure their own transformation into civilian presidents.‘No will for return to constitutional order’In his new year’s address, hours after the junta’s own two-year timetable for holding elections expired, Dombouya said 2025 would be “a crucial electoral year to complete the return to constitutional order”. A few days later, the junta’s spokesperson, Ousmane Diallo, said the referendum and elections would possibly happen in May and December respectively.However, last Thursday Diallo said it would be “impossible to hold all the elections in 2025” and that the process would start with a constitutional referendum that would take place “before the end of the first half of the year”.Joachim Millimono, a spokesperson for the main opposition, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UDFG), said the junta was unwilling to even talk about the text of the referendum, or update the electoral list from 2020. “There is no visible will of the transitional authorities for a return to constitutional order,” he said.The lack of clarity over the transition triggered a protest in the middle of January, during which one person died in the course of a crackdown by security forces.View image in fullscreenA police officer stands guard at a popular market in Conakry.Photograph: Fadel Dawod/Getty ImagesIn the aftermath of the protest, the junta has further militarised the city. Checkpoints have been set up along the road running between the airport and the parliament building, where the military transition holds fort. In opposition strongholds such as Bomboly neighbourhood, where protests against the junta and the soaring cost of living have previously taken place, police officers stand on alert at major intersections.Even though Doumbouya has not said whether he will contest the presidency, many expect him to. His critics speculate that he is strategically removing any opposition to his path through trumped-up charges and detentions. The UDFG leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, for example, lives in exile after corruption charges were brought against him from his time as transport minister two decades ago.Other actors “have automatically joined the [junta transition council] or are afraid to take positions, precise and clear, on the transition,” said Alseny Sall, spokesperson for the Guinean Organisation for the Defence of Human and Civil Rights.Local people say the muzzling of Guinean voices since 2021 has been masterminded by the defence minister, Aboubacar Sidiki Camara (widely known as “Idi Amin” (after the late Ugandan dictator) and another Doumbouya ally, Col Mouctar “Spartacus” Kaba, who heads an elite military unit.More than 50 parties were dissolved last year by the junta and several media licencesrevoked. The activists Oumar Sylla and Mamadou Billo Bah have been missing since July, when theywere arrestedafter calling for protests; their colleagues fear they may no longer be alive. Habib Marouane Camara, an investigative journalistabducted in December, has not been seen since. In January, a Kaloum court handed atwo-year sentenceto another opposition figure, Aliou Bah, for “insulting and defaming” the junta leader.“Sincerely, I won’t be able to tell you if we can have elections in a country where there is no dialogue between the [junta] and [political and civil society] actors,” said Sall.Propaganda campaignThe posters hailing Doumbouya are just one aspect of a state-backed propaganda campaign that has been ratcheted up.One foreign journalist told the Guardian anonymously that officials had offered him a bribe to do PR work on behalf of the junta and that some of his local colleagues had been co-opted to do its bidding.View image in fullscreenA local market in Conakry, Guinea. Protests have taken place in the city over the cost of living.Photograph: Fadel Dawod/Getty ImagesWhile opposition rallies have been banned, events endorsing Doumbouya have gone ahead without impediment. In December, 56 people died during acrush at a football tournamentin Nzérékoré, the country’s second largest city, that was being held in honour of him.The same month, the dancehall star Singleton thanked the junta on Facebook for a late Christmas gift – a brand-new Ram truck worth an estimated $40,000 (£32,000) – after he hadreleased a song earlier in the yearin praise of Doumbouya. Since then more artists have entered studios to record songs insulting Doumbouya’s critics.Meanwhile, corruption, which the junta promised to stamp out, is still an issue. The central bank chief and the head of the goldminers’ union are under investigation after 4 tons of gold worth an estimated $400m (£323m) went missing in December. A dozen customs officers are also in detention over a 700bn Guinean franc (£65m, $81m) corruption scandal.The developments in Guinea have somewhat flown under the radar. Regional attention has instead focused on Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger’sacrimonious splitfrom the Economic Community of West African States, and France’smilitary departurefrom those countries, as well asfrom Chad.Unlike many of its neighbours, Guinea has kept its criticism of Paris muted. Some local observers speculate that this is in part because Doumbouya is married to a white, serving member of the French National Gendarmerie, and reportedly has French nationality from his own service in the French Foreign Legion.Rather than huddle with his regional counterparts, Doumbouya has aligned himself with the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. Since April 2023, when Guinea named a major road intersection in Conakry after Kagame, there have been state visits and cooperation deals signed between both countries.View image in fullscreenDoumbouya and Rwanda’s present, Paul Kagame, in 2023.Photograph: Paul Kagame/FlckrMany in Conakry say they expect more of the same, and little international intervention when dates are finally confirmed for the parliamentary and presidential elections. And they believe that the junta – far from returning power to the people, as it initially promised – has become increasingly focused on securing it in the long term for one man.“There are a lot of movements supporting Doumbouya’s candidacy, and members of government are campaigning for it,” said Millimono. “All this is worrying. These people are fighting for their own interests. They want to have vehicles, villas, diplomatic passports and to live a good life … we encourage him to resist bad advice.”Explore more on these topicsGuineaAfricaHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And for all those purchases, well, yes, it’s very useful to have a gringothat can easily come and go into the country.”Guerrero also noted that some of those Americans recruited by Mexican cartels may be drug users who end up indebted to the cartels.“To pay off their debts, the organization asks them to start selling,” Guerrero said. “They start out as clients and consumers and end up being employees without a way to escape the criminal organization.”The report is backed by numbers from the US: according to datafrom the US Sentencing Commission,of the 3,000 fentanyl trafficking offenses in fiscal year 2023, 86% of those sentenced in the United States were American citizens.“When you see the cases in courts that are at the border, those that are related to large-scale trafficking,” said Cecilia Farfán, an expert on organized crime, “these are operations that involve Mexican and American citizens.”The report from Animal Político comes as Donald Trump has increasingly attackedMexicofor the flow of illegal drugs into the United States.On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive orderdesignating certain drug cartelsas ‘“foreign terrorist organizations”. Trump also threatened a 25% tariff on all goods flowing from Mexico and Canada, “because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our citizens”.Trump laterpaused the tariffs on Mexico for a monthafter President Sheinbaum agreed to send an additional 10,000 national guard troops to the US-Mexico border.Trump’s claim that Mexican cartels and government are allied is not realityRead moreAccording to Farfán, these arrest numbers may also indicate an increased push from Mexico to demonstrate that drug trafficking is a bi- or trinational problem.“Those numbers have a lot to do with precisely wanting to get away from this narrative of the cartel that wants to poison the poor ignorant American citizen,” she said. “It’s a way of saying that this is a business that requires actors from both sides of the border, drug trafficking, but also arms trafficking.”The report from Animal Político also points out that, while Americans may be the foreigners most likely to commit crimes in Mexico, they are also the most likely to fall victim to organized crime, with more than 700 US citizens reported as missing or disappeared.According to Animal Político, between 2022 and 2023 307 Americans were murdered in Mexico, by far the highest of any nationality killed in the country.But Americans are also being recruited in significant numbers to smuggle people across the border. Between July 2021 and August 2024, more than 1,000 US citizens were detained by Texan authorities for people smuggling,local government data shows,with Americans making up more than 70% of the nationalities arrested on those charges.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Clayton Weimers, executive director of RSF US, said: “Non-profit newsroom and media organisations have already had to cease operations and lay off staff. The most likely scenario is that after the 90-day freeze, they will disappear for ever.”View image in fullscreenA worker removing the sign outside the USAid building in Washington DC last week after President Donald Trump ordered it to be closed down.Photograph: Zuma Press/Alamy Live NewsIn Ukraine, where the media had until recently been largelycontrolled by oligarchs, nine out of 10 outletsrely on subsidiesand USAid is the primary donor, according to RSF.“It’s a very dangerous moment,” said Anna Babinets, chief executive and co-founder of the Kyiv-based investigative platform Slidstvo.Info, which haslost 80%of its funding from groups that formerly received money from USAid. “We are having to think about cutting our frontline reporting and our war-crime reporting – it means that the people of Ukraine, and the world, will know less about what is happening here.”Trump has made unsubstantiatedclaims that billions were stolen at USAidto pay for positive media coverage of his opponents in what he calls the “fake news media”. Meanwhile, Elon Musk called USAid a “criminal organisation” and said it hadpaid mediato “publish their propaganda”.Valerii Garmash, head of Make Sense, which develops independent media in Ukraine and received almost 50% of its funds for its6262.com.uawebsite in the city of Slavyansk from USAid, said its projects had started shutting down.View image in fullscreenUkrainian soldiers fire artillery at Russian positions in Donetsk.

Without the money, we have to work like volunteers.”Weimers said a decline in the number of independent news outlets could lead to a surge in misinformation. “Chaos causes a vacuum and when you pull reliable sources of information, that vacuum will be filled will less reliable sources [such as] state propagandists,” he said.“Just look at those praising this move: it’s leaders in China, Russia, Hungary, El Salvador – countries known for horrible human rights violations, particularly against their press,” he said.View image in fullscreenA protest in Amsterdam after a blogger, Roman Protasevich, was arrested when his flight was diverted to Minsk.

It’s playing into the Russian narrative,” she said.In neighbouringBelarus, Natalia Belikova, of Press Club Belarus, said 70% of her organisation’s funding came from a mix of US federal sources and that various cuts and freezes to funding had put it on “the brink of existence”.Belarus has orchestrated widespreadpersecution campaignsagainst journalists and forced hundreds of reporters into exile in recent years. Press Club Belarus surveyed 20 of the country’s outlets in early February and found that 60% of budgets came from US funding. “They are at risk of fading away and gradually disappearing,” said Belikova.Belikova said independent reporting had played a crucial role in keeping Belarusians informed about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This decision really plays into the hands of authoritarian regimes,” she said.“If Belarusian independent media stops existing, then people will only be left with the state propaganda. If there is no alternative, it will gradually capture their minds and we may have a very different society in just a few years.”View image in fullscreenThe Panama City offices of Mossack Fonseca, which was exposed in the Panama Papers leak.

The investigative platform DataCameroon told RSF it had had to put several projects on hold, including one focused on journalist safety and another covering the upcoming presidential election in Cameroon.Rawan Damen, director of Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism, which works across theMiddle East and north Africa, said it had lost $400,000 from the USAid freeze.InIran, a contributor to Mamlekate, a citizen journalism group, said the funding had been vital for documenting human rights abuses and supporting civil society during the protests in recent years.“This aid has helped citizen journalists with secure communication tools like VPNs. Cutting it off doesn’t improve efficiency,” they said. “Instead, it weakens critical efforts abroad that support people inside Iran.”View image in fullscreenA woman passes Taliban gunmen in Baharak.

Many journalists were forced into exile after the military seizedpower in a coup in 2021, which was met by widespread opposition and an armed uprising. Journalists documenting the conflict and human rights abuses by the military havefaced a “terror campaign”.Toe Zaw Latt, of the Independent Press CouncilMyanmar, said he believed about 200 journalists would be affected by the funding freeze. They were already paid very little, and barely surviving, he said, adding: “I cannot imagine [how people will manage], without a salary to pay your rent.”View image in fullscreenA Ugandan human rights activist reads a letter from USAid on a laptop in Kampala, Uganda, last month.Photograph: Hajarah Nalwadda/APJournalists that he trains, many of whom are young, “want to expose what is going on in Burma [Myanmar]”.

Though Musksaidin comments released last week he was not currently interested in doing so.Cotton is a foreign policy hawk and vocal China critic who last month openlycriticizedTrump’s changing position on TikTok.The senator’s first book,Only the Strong: Reversing the Left’s Plot to Sabotage American Power, hinted at ambitions for higher office, perhaps after Trump leaves the national political scene. His new book,Seven Things You Can’t Say About China, will be published in the US next week. The Guardian obtained a copy.In his book Cotton includes Musk in a group of American “tech titans” he accuses of “Chasing Chinese dollars” whom he says “have … shamefully supplicated China’s Communist rulers”.Cotton writes: “Microsoft founder Bill Gates praised China’s dictator, saying that ‘I am impressed [with] how hard President Xi works … he’s quite amazing.’“Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergboughtcopies of Xi’s book The Governance of China and gave them to his employees because ‘I want them to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics.’”At a White House state dinner honoring Xi the next year [2015], Zuckerberg bizarrely asked the Communist dictator to name his unborn daughter.Cotton continues: “Elon Musk told China’s state television, ‘I’m very confident that the future of China is going to be great and that China is headed towards being the biggest economy in the world and a lot of prosperity in the future.’”Musk made those comments in 2021, in an interview withChina Central Television.Four years on, with Musk ensconced in the heart of government, accessing sensitive government systems and classified information with apparent impunity, his Chinese ties are prompting growing concern.Last month, Russel L Honoré, a retired US army general, used a New York Timescolumnto highlight business interests including$1.4bn in loansfrom Chinese banks used to build a Tesla factory in Beijing.

Nike’s lobbying “should come as no surprise”, he writes, “given that its then CEO, John Donahoe, said in 2021 that ‘Nike is a brand that is of China and for China.’ When it comes to Chinese genocide, maybe Nike’s slogan is ‘Just Do It’.”Despite writing at length about TikTok – repeatedly advising readers to boycott all Chinese apps and remove them from children’s phones – Cotton does not single out Trump for criticism on his policies and rhetoric concerning TikTok or China.But the senator does obliquely criticize Trump regarding Chinese investment in US educational institutions, a growing phenomenon which Cotton deplores.“A senior Chinese Communist purchased New York Military Academy, Donald Trump’s alma mater, and then appointed several of his Chinese associates to its board of trustees,” Cotton writes.That sale wasfinalized in 2015, a year before Trump began his climb to two terms in the White House, two impeachments, 34 criminal convictions and complete dominance of the Republican party.But as Cotton writes, “the Department of Defense has granted the academy hundreds of thousands of dollars since its Chinese takeover”, with federal records showing such grants made during Trump’s first term, between 2017 and 2021.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsElon MuskPolitics booksDonald TrumpRepublicansTrump administrationUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

Markets in Seoul, Sydney and Taipei rose.Trump announces 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminumRead moreThe uncertainty fuelled by Trump’s moves has pushed safe-haven gold to record highs. On Monday, it broke above $2,900 for the first time. It extended gains on Tuesday to hit a new peak above $2,938.“This is still very early days,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. “The market’s just sort of chopping around rather than really directional right now.”Equities have held up since Trump took office – London and Frankfurt even hit record highs on Monday – with analysts saying measures had so far been less severe than feared.Still, caution looms over trading floors as dealers brace for the next announcement out of the White House, with Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for InternationalEconomics, saying: “The degree of uncertainty about trade policy has basically exploded.”And Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, said: “These expanding trade actions beyond previous threats to Canada, Mexico and China are leading to potential new import restrictions and retaliation, signalling more bouts of volatility for investors.“Tariffs are being used not just to tax imports but also as tools for national security, economic leverage and revenue generation, indicating a shift towards long-term economic policy rather than short-term trade disputes.”Fears that Trump’s tariffs, along with tax cuts and deregulation, will reignite inflation and force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates elevated have sent the dollar up against most of its peers.Readings on consumer and producer price indexes this week will provide a fresh snapshot of inflation, while Fed boss Jerome Powell is also due to give depositions to US lawmakers.Both will be pored over for an idea about the bank’s plans for rates, with forecasts for two cuts at most this year.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationInternational tradeStock marketsAsia PacificEconomicsGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Labour’s Chris Hipkins rose two points to 17%.Māori protesters turn their backs on government ministers at Waitangi Day eventRead moreSpeaking to media on Tuesday, Luxon said he wasnot concerned by the results.“The only poll that matters is 2026 when the New Zealand public will make their decision: has this government made them better off or not over that three-year period?”The poll, conducted during the country’spolitically charged Waitangi Day events, showed support for Luxon’s National party dropped three points to 34%, while his coalition partners Act had a one-point increase to 9% and New Zealand First dropped one point to 5%.A secondTaxpayers’ Union-Curia Poll, taken between 2–4 February, also had Labour narrowly ahead of National and Luxon’s favourability drop just over two points to 24.5%.The coalition government campaigned on promises to fix New Zealand’s economy and has introduced a wave of new policies to try to achieve this, including relaxing immigration settings to attract foreign investment and reducing public spending.But with country in themidst of a recessionandhigh unemployment rates, the public’s confidence in the economy is yet to bounce back.Of those surveyed in the Verian poll, 36% felt optimistic about the economy – a 5 point drop from the December poll – while there was a three point increase in economic pessimism to 25%. Meanwhile, half of those polled felt the government was going in the wrong direction, with 39% believing it was heading in the right direction.Luxon said he was under “no illusion” the public wanted the government to fix the economy.“New Zealanders are expecting us to get through this economic pain and get to the other side of it, and that requires all of us to embrace growth above everything else.”Political commentator Ben Thomas said that like many countries around the world, the government inherited a tough economic situation but its promises to lower living costs were yet to quell public malaise.“If you run on the basis that you’re going to fix the economy, and people are still having a tough economic time a year later, it becomes harder to deliver that [promise] credibly.”Meanwhile, Luxon’s inexperience could be affecting his popularity, Thomas said.“He’s come on the back of two generational talents, which are John Key and Jacinda Ardern – they were uniquely skilled communicators and leaders and Luxon does suffer by comparison.”Further, theongoing tensionsover the minor Act party’scontroversial treaty principles bill,which many fear will undermine Māori rights, could be fuelling perceptions the country is headed in the wrong direction.“New Zealanders don’t tend to like divisiveness … and I think that does contribute something to the national mood,” Thomas said.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandChristopher LuxonNew Zealand politicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump and his Special Envoy Steve Witkoff are able to announce that Mr. Witkoff is leaving Russian airspace with Marc Fogel, an American who was detained by Russia,” Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said in a statement.White House will work ‘every single day’ to free US teacher from Russian prisonRead moreIn his statement, Waltz said that the US and Russia “negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine”.Asked what the US had given in return for Fogel’s release, Trump later said: “Not much.”He told reporters: “We were treated very nicely by Russia, actually. I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war.”Previous negotiations have occasionally involved reciprocal releases of detainees and prisoners.The deal was negotiated in secret, but rumors began circulating about Witkoff’s presence in Russia when his private jet was spotted landing in Moscow.The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier in the day that he had “no information” about the reported arrival of Witkoff’s plane.View image in fullscreenFamily members of Marc Fogel rally outside the White House for his release on 15 July 2023 in Washington DC.Photograph: Stephanie Scarbrough/APFogel had worked as a teacher at the Anglo-American School of Moscow since 2012 and taught overseas in countries like Oman and Malaysia. He was arrested in 2021 at a Moscow airport after Russian officials found less than an ounce of marijuana in his luggage.The surprise release of Fogel highlights the ongoing backchannel negotiations between the US and Russia and signals Putin’s intent to cultivate ties with theTrump administrationahead of expected peace talks over the war in Ukraine.Putin has showered Trump with compliments since his inauguration, repeatedly praising him as “brave” for surviving an assassination attempt while also signaling his readiness to meet with the US leader.Trump has said that he has spoken with Putin but has been vague on the details other than to say he was making “progress” to secure a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.In an interview with Fox News broadcast on Monday, Trump suggested that Ukraine“may be Russian some day”, as his vice-president JD Vance gears up to meet the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy later this week at the Munich security council.Russia’s latest engagement with the US will set off alarm bells in Kyiv, where Zelenskyy mustnavigatethe new reality of a US administration that has opened dialogue with Moscow while at times displaying open hostility toward Ukraine.Fogel and his family had hoped he would beincludedin the historic prisoner exchange in August that freed the Wall Street journalist Evan Gershkovich and the US marine Paul Whelan. At the time, Fogel was not yet designated as “wrongfully detained” by the US government, a label he only received late last year.In a statement, Fogel’s family said they were “beyond grateful, relieved and overwhelmed” that he was coming home.“This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal,” they said. “For the first time in years, our family can look forward to the future with hope.”Fogel is expected to arrive in the US later on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRussiaTrump administrationEuropeUS politicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

This is reflected in our signing of agreements on sustainability and cybersecurity today at the Paris AI Action summit,” the spokesperson said. “However, we felt the declaration didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.”Confirmation of the snub came soon after the US vice-president,JD Vance, took to the stage at the Grand Palais to criticise Europe’s “excessive regulation” of technology and warn against cooperating with China.Asked if Britain had declined to sign because it wanted to follow the US lead, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said they were “not aware of the US reasons or position” on the declaration. A government source rejected the suggestion that Britain was trying to curry favour with the US.But a Labour MP said: “I think we have little strategic room but to be downstream of the US.” They added that US AI firms could stop engaging withthe UK government’s AI Safety Institute, a world-leading research body, if Britain was perceived to be taking an overly restrictive approach to the development of the technology.Campaign groups criticised the UK’s decision and said it risked damaging its reputation in this area. Andrew Dudfield, the head of AI at Full Fact, said the UK risked “undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation” and that there needed to be “bolder government action to protect people from corrosive AI-generated misinformation”.Gaia Marcus, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, which focuses on AI research, said the UK’s actions “go against the vital global governance that AI needs.”The Élysée Palace said more countries might sign the declaration in the hours after the two-day summit.Vance’s hard-hitting speech, in front of leaders including theFrench president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, indicated dissatisfaction with the global approach to regulating and developing the technology. Starmerdid not attend the summit, with the tech secretary, Peter Kyle, representing the UK.Vance, in his first trip abroad as US vice-president, warned against the EU’s regulatory approach, stating that “excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Singling out the DSA, which regulates social media, the vice-president said: “It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet. And it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation.”Vance also referred to the risks of partnering with “authoritarian” regimes, in a pointed allusion to China – without mentioning the country directly. Referring to exports of CCTV and 5G equipment – key Chinese tech products – by authoritarian governments, he said there was a cost: “Partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term.”As the Chinese vice-premier, Zhang Guoqing, sat yards away, Vance added: “Some of us in this room have learned from experience partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true, just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley, if you aren’t paying for the product: you are the product.”Vance started his speech by cautioning against an excessive focus on safety, in an apparent criticism of the first global AI summit in the UK in 2023, which was badged as the AI Safety Summit. He indicated that he thought the Bletchley Park meeting was too cautious, referring to gatherings about cutting-edge technology that can be “too self-conscious, too risk averse”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)JD VanceChinaEuropeUS foreign policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We see a lot of economic relationship to build upon with Europe”.Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium from 10% to 25% and eliminating all country exceptions, quota deals and product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals with effect from 12 March.He said the move would simplify tariffs on the metals “so everyone can understand … it’s 25%” on all countries. He has also promised reciprocal tariffs on all countries that tax imports from the US and said he was looking at tariffs on cars and pharmaceuticals.What are the tariffs on steel and aluminum Trump announced?Read moreAccording to US trade figures, Canada, Brazil and Mexico are the three biggest steel exporters to the US, followed bySouth Korea. An estimated 25% of EU steel exports go to the US, worth about €3bn a year over the past decade.Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who is attending an artificial intelligence summit in Paris, said on Tuesday that Canadians would “stand up strongly and firmly if we need to”, describing the Trump administration’s decision as “unacceptable”.The Mexican economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said the tariffs were “unfair” and “not justified”. Mexico’s US steel exports had been falling since 2022 while imports of US steel had grown, he said, so it now “imports more steel from the US than it exports”.South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, said Seoul was “committed to protecting the interests of our companies and reducing uncertainties” and would seek to “build a close relationship” with Washington and explore diplomatic options.There was also criticism from within the US, with the chief executive of Ford, Jim Farley, saying that while he believed the president aimed to strengthen the US auto industry overall, his tariff plans had “a lot of cost and a lot of chaos”.The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, told the European parliament that Trump’s move would fuel inflation but that the bloc remained committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution as soon as possible.“The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on our exports, which are economically counterproductive,” he said. “Tariffs are taxes, bad for businesses, worse for consumers … and harmful to the global trading system.”Šefčovič said the commission, the EU’s executive body, was “assessing the scope of the measures announced overnight and will be responding in a firm and proportionate way by countermeasures”.Why Trump tariffs will be ‘very bad for America and for the world’Read moreTrump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from dozens of countries in his first term, drawing EU countermeasures on emblematic US goods including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon whiskey, jeans and orange juice.Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the EU would present a united front. “If the US leaves us no other choice, the EU will respond as one,” he told parliament. “As the world’s largest market, with 450 million citizens, we have the strength to do so.”France’s industry minister, Marc Ferracci, said that while his country was not a major producer of aluminium or steel, it could still be indirectly affected if Chinese exports discouraged by the US tariffs instead made their way to European shores.“We should expect that there will be some effects from Donald Trump’s tariffs,” Ferracci said. “Europe must respond in a united manner, because we know that his strategy is to divide Europeans. We must respond in a firm manner.”Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeTrump administrationCanadaSouth KoreanewsShareReuse this content"

A jewellery box was found nearby.The house appeared to have been rudimentarily searched; cash was found in the couple’s bedroom. The prosecutor said no trace had been found of the object used to inflict the blows on Dawn Searle.When police arrived they searched the property and discovered Andrew Searle, 65, dead inside. The prosecutor said his body was found hanging, with no visible defence injuries.French police say no theories are being excluded. Theories as to what took place include a burglary gone wrong or a possible domestic dispute leading to a murder-suicide.“Further investigations (anatomo-pathological, toxicological) are under way in order to determine the precise circumstances of the deaths. Investigations are continuing, in particular to determine whether the tragedy was the result of a spousal crime followed by suicide, or whether a third party intervened,” the statement said.The couple married in 2023 and had two children each from previous relationships. They had lived in the village for five years.After the deaths, Dawn Searle’s son, the actor Callum Kerr, and her daughter, Amanda Kerr, and Andrew Searle’s children, Tom and Ella Searle,released a statementsaying they would not be speaking to the media and appealing for privacy.Callum Kerr starred in the sixth season of the Netflix drama Virgin River and has appeared in the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks. He walked his mother down the aisle at her wedding to Searle in 2023 and shared photos celebrating the occasion.Earlier, the public prosecutor, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said: “Both died violent deaths, but I cannot establish that either was a homicide. All hypotheses remain open.”According to his LinkedIn profile, Andrew Searle retired in 2015 after a career in financial crime prevention. After quitting as a consultant in financial crime assurance at Barclays in Glasgow, Searle posted that he was “enjoying life in rural France – renovating!” He previously worked for 21 years at Standard Life in Edinburgh, where he was responsible for the bank’s anti-crime initiatives across Europe.Aclaim made by MailOnlinethat police were investigating the possibility that the couple were murdered by UK-based criminals has not been confirmed by the French authorities.Searle went to a grammar school in Steyning, West Sussex, and graduated from Liverpool John Moores University.A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In one example, investigators revealed how a clan took control of distributing mussels and other seafood to restaurants in two seaside villages.While Cosa Nostra bosses these days try to resolve disputes peacefully to avoid attracting attention, weapons were found in Tuesday’s blitz, police said, while reporting incidents of brutal beatings.The old rules of top-down organisation and membership until death still hold sway but police said clan leaders were “up to date”, using encrypted smartphones to communicate to avoid traditional meetings.Letizia Battaglia: Life, Love and Death in Sicily review – the bloody reality of life under the mafiaRead moreDespite numerous arrests over the years, the Sicilian mafia “still manages to attract a large number of young people who embrace its principles” and offer to work for them, police said.The investigation also revealed a wide network of informants, with a clerk in the Palermo prosecutors’ office arrested last November accused of passing on files.For many years, the Sicilian mafia terrorised the Italian public and state, and became notorious for the killings of anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.But that led to a fierce state clampdown and the ’Ndrangheta is now considered Italy’s wealthiest and most powerful mafia, controlling the bulk of cocaine flowing intoEurope.Explore more on these topicsItalyMafiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Let all hell break loose.”Netanyahu’s threat came as Trump hosted King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House on Tuesday for a tense meeting, where the two were to discuss the ceasefire and Trump’splan to “take over” Gazaand expel the region’s more than 2 million Palestinians. Trump has said that he could withhold aide from Jordan and Egypt, two US allies, unless they agree to his plan.In a quick back-and-forth with reporters before a closed-door meeting with Abdullah, Trump in effect endorsed an Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and said there was “no reason to buy Gaza” because “we’re going to take it”.Asked whether Saturday remained his deadline for Hamas to deliver all the hostages, Trump replied: “Yes.”It was not clear whether Netanyahu is also demanding that all 76 captives still held in Gaza be released, or just the three hostages scheduled for release on Saturday under the ceasefire. The prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for further information.But the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after more than 15 months of fighting that has killed just under 47,000 Palestinians and more than 1,700 Israelis is close to collapse.Since the deal was agreed, there have been persistent concerns over Netanyahu’s willingness to transition from the first to the second phase of the agreement: the far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said he will quit Netanyahu’s coalition if the war does not restart after the first phase, which could force the prime minister to choose between his government and the deal.Israel’s Channel 12 reported that the cabinet agreed that if three hostages were released on Saturday, as planned, then Israel would continue to commit to the ceasefire.But in a sign that Israeli authorities may be preparing for hostilities to resume, Netanyahu also said on Tuesday evening that he had directed the Israeli army to increase reinforcements in the Gaza area “in preparation for various scenarios”.“In light of Hamas’s announcement of its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, last night I ordered the IDF to amass forces inside and around the Gaza Strip,” said Netanyahu. “This operation is being carried out at this time. It will be completed in the very near future.”Hamas on Monday said it would delay the release of Israeli hostages indefinitely over “violations” of the ceasefire deal, prompting Israel’s defence minister to put the country’s military on alert with orders to prepare for “any scenario in Gaza”.On Tuesday, Hamas had softened its stance, deriding Trump’s ultimatum and reiterating its commitment to a diplomatic solution to the crisis.Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said: “Trump must remember there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties, and this is the only way to bring back the [Israeli] prisoners. The language of threats has no value and only complicates matters.”In a statement late on Tuesday, Hamas reiterated that it was committed to the ceasefire deal, and claiming that Israel would be “responsible for any complications or delays.”The Israeli security cabinet meeting to discuss negotiations on the second phase of the deal was brought forward on Tuesday and lasted more than four hours.Smotrich, who voted against the ceasefire deal, appeared to support Trump’s comments. He wrote on X on Tuesday: “Everyone now.”A day earlier, the army cancelled all leave for soldiers in the Gaza division, a move suggesting it has become more likely that hostilities could resume.In Tel Aviv, protesters blocked roads on Monday night and Tuesday, demanding the return of all hostages, as some relatives accused the government of sabotaging the deal.Replying to reporters’ questions in the West Wing, Trump overturned decades of US policy on Israel by in effect endorsing the annexation of the West Bank. “I think that’s going to work out very well,” he said, adding that it would “work out automatically”. “It’s in good shape. We discussed it, other people are going to discuss it with me. West Bank is going to work out very well.”He also discussed his putative plan to “take over” Gaza and expel the Palestinians to neighbouring Jordan and Egypt.Reversing previous statements, Trump said that he was not prepared to buy Gaza, but that “we’re going to take it, we’re going to hold it, we’re going to cherish it.”Trump announced the Gaza plan late last week to the apparent surprise of Netanyahu and to his closest aides. Neither the Pentagon, nor the state department had made plans for a US military campaign or rebuilding effort in the Gaza Strip before Trump’s announcement.But the plan has angered Arab states, who have said that the decision would effectively scuttle another of Trump’s key goals: establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.Abdullah, who was sitting next to Trump, did not respond to questions about Trump’s plan to “take” Gaza. That would be discussed behind closed doors, he said, but said both sides should also “wait until the Egyptians can present ideas”.Later on Tuesday, Abdullah said that his country would take in 2,000 sick children from war-torn Gaza but pushed back against Trump’s plan to take over the territory.“I reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position. Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaHamasDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The uncertainty, just over halfway into the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, complicates talks on the far more difficult second phase. It also jeopardises the pause in the devastating fighting and the increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza that the truce has made possible.Some analysts believe that Hamas initially made the concessions that helped bring about the ceasefire in part because it is sensitive to public opinion among Palestinians inGaza, and recognised that to continue the conflict could cause it lasting damage.The same holds true during the fragile ceasefire, with Hamas keen to get credit for continued calm and avoid blame in the event of a return to hostilities.That Hamasstill has a powerful presencein Gaza despite massive damage done in Israel’s offensive seems clear. Successive handovers of Israeli hostages have been carefully choreographed to showcase the militant group’s military power, but Hamas has also deployed hundreds of officials from the municipal authorities it still controls to clear rubble, rehabilitate clinics, reopen schools and monitor markets.Aid workers in Gaza report that many of their prewar contacts in the local administration are back in their posts.“Hamas are pretty visible on the streets. Police are back on the beat and patrolling main junctions. Ministries are also reopening. It’s like the war never happened in some ways,” said one senior UN official last week.But experts point out that the widespread presence of Hamas does not imply extensive support.“The level of control is not a measure of popularity,” saidHugh Lovatt,a specialist in Palestinian politics at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “We have polling data over the years and, though there are always caveats, there is still a consistent historical trend and that is that support for Hamas tends to hover around the mid-30s in percentage terms.”An unpublished survey conducted just before the ceasefire last month revealed an apparent decline in levels of support for Hamas, though it remains the most popular party in Gaza.The new survey, carried out by the Ramallah-basedPalestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research(PCPSR), asked people in the territory if they supported “very extreme actions” to protect and defend Palestine.“This was on a continuous scale and roughly 25% were above the midpoint in support of extreme violence, so a minority,” said Scott Atran, the anthropologist who oversaw the research.When asked what would be a “realistic and acceptable” ending to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, just under half of the population said some division of territory betweenIsraeland Palestine, either along the pre-1967 borders or those suggested by the UN in 1947, while slightly more than half preferred a dissolution of Israel, with a single Palestinian state under Islamic law the most preferred solution of all. The least preferred was a single democratic state with equal rights for Arabs and Jews.The survey also showed that a significant proportion feel that rule by Islamic law – a key part of the ideology of Hamas – is important and that around half believe that a military solution is more likely than a diplomatic solution. For most in Gaza too, the Palestinian-Israel conflict is primarily religious rather than political, the survey suggested.Atran said: “Hamas has only the support of a fifth of the population – a steep decline from a March 2024 PCPSR poll that showed majority support for Hamas in Gaza. In fact, the most frequent response on leadership was that no one truly represents the Palestinian people … So there is an evident leadership gap.“Yet, the survey also indicates that Gazans – women as much as men, old and young – are willing to sacrifice for their land and sovereignty, including to fight and die, even at the cost of their own family safety and security … or the promise of a better life elsewhere.”View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians making their way from central Gaza to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APA significant problem for researchers is that few in Gaza are prepared to openly criticise Hamas. The movement, which seized control of Gaza violently in 2007 after winning an election, has a long history of ruthless repression of dissidents.A poll by PCPSR releasedin Septembershows 39% in Gaza supported the attacks by Hamas into Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict, 32 percentage points lower than six months earlier. Hamas killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 250 in the attack, while the ensuing Israeli offensive cost the lives of more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and devastated swaths of the territory.“It is important to note that support for [the 2023 attack] does not necessarily mean support for Hamas and does not mean support for any killings or atrocities committed against civilians,” the PCPSR said, pointing out that up to 90% of respondents “believe that Hamas … did not commit the atrocities depicted in videos taken on that day”.Instead, the pollsters said, support for the 2023 attack was motivated by how the attack had focused regional and global attention on Palestinian grievances.The poll also found that 36% in Gaza chose “armed struggle” as the most effective way to end Israeli occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state, the lowest level since September 2022. Hamas was the preferred political party of 35% of respondents, down slightly.In the immediate aftermath of the ceasefire last month, some residents expressed pride that Hamas had survived the onslaught.“Name me one country that could withstand Israel’s war machine for 15 months,” said Salah Abu Rezik, a 58-year-old factory worker. He praised Hamas for helping to distribute aid to hungry people in Gaza during the conflict and trying to enforce a measure of security, describing Hamas as “an idea” that could not be killed.But others voiced anger that Hamas’s attack had brought destruction to Gaza.What do Hamas delay and Trump threat mean for Gaza ceasefire deal?Read more“We had homes and hotels and restaurants. We had a life. Today we have nothing, so what kind of a victory is this? When the war stops, Hamas must not rule Gaza alone,” said Ameen, 30, a Gaza City civil engineer, who was living in Khan Younis.To prevent such views spreading further, Hamas will need to divert blame if the ceasefire collapses.One accusation made by Hamas on Monday was that Israel was deliberately hindering the entry of stipulated amounts of aid, such as 60,000 mobile houses and 200,000 tents, as well as heavy machinery to remove rubble, and fuel. Help with the humanitarian crisis and reconstruction is a priority for most in Gaza. Israel denies the charge.Lovatt said successive polls among Palestinians showed that “there would always be space for a conservative, Islamist-leaning party” in Gaza and the occupied West Bank too.“So even if you get rid of Hamas or it moderates further then there is potentially a segment of this Islamist support base which will look for a new political home,” he said.“If you exile or kill the leadership, you are not addressing the challenge of this limited if substantial conservative Islamist base. If you want a credible political track you need to integrate that constituency.”Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It also wants to see promisedplanning reforms to minimise further legal challengesof the kind that havepreviously held upits runway plans.Woldbye is expected to say: “A third runway is critical for the country’s future economic success, and I confirm we will submit our plans for a third runway to government this summer.“Ahead of then, as part of a phased expansion programme and supported by the government’s clear backing, I am today confirming multibillion-pound investment plans, 100% privately funded, to upgrade our terminal buildings, enhance passenger experience, and improve resilience and sustainability.“This is vital investment and will ensure Heathrow remains globally competitive and a jewel in the country’s crown – the UK’s gateway to growth.”A Heathrow-commissioned report by Frontier Economics,cited by Reeves, has estimated that more than 60% of growth from building another runway would accrue in regions outside the south-east of England.Several hundred thousand tons of steel would be needed, and Woldbye is expected to sign a charter in Scunthorpe pledging to maximise the use of UK steel in the runway’s construction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An alliance including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic claimed that customers were paying in total £1.1bn more each year than they would if charged in line with other major European airports – and warned that expansion plans would make Heathrow even more expensive.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayAirline industryHeathrow airportLondonAir transportSteel industryLincolnshirenewsShareReuse this content"

By eliminating waste, bloat, and insularity, my Administration will empower American families, workers, taxpayers, and our system of Government itself.”The order notes that agency heads “will undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren’t required by law”.2:59Elon Musk defends government role and dismisses conflict-of-interest concerns – videoIt also said that agencies should “hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart from federal service” and “shall not fill any vacancies for career appointments that the DOGE Team Lead assesses should not be filled, unless the Agency Head determines the positions should be filled”.Exceptions are planned for military personnel and agencies dealing in immigration, law enforcement and public safety.Trump and Musk are encouraging federal workers to resign in return for financial incentives, though a judge is currently reviewing the legality of the orders. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers have opted to take the buyout option.Musk, the world’s richest man, took questions from reporters for the first time since he joined theTrump administrationas a “special” government employee.The X owner reportedly said that there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but that they need to be held accountable, and referred to Doge as an “unelected” fourth branch.“The people voted for major government reform and that’s what the people are going to get,” he said. “That’s what democracy is all about.”Musk also described himself as an open book despite criticism towards his lack of transparency in reshaping the federal government. He joked that the scrutiny was like a “daily proctology exam”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And while the vast majority of the collection – over 5m records – has been made public, researchers estimate that 3,000 files haven’t been released, either in whole or in part.The FBI did not say in its statement what kind of information the newly discovered files contain. The FBI in 2020 opened a central records complex and began a years long effort to ship, electronically inventory and store closed case files from field offices across the country. The agency said a more comprehensive records inventory along with technological advances allowed it to quickly search and locate records.‘I came down here to die’: the untold story of the first JFK assassination attemptRead moreJefferson Morley, vice-president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, a repository for files related to the assassination, called the FBI’s disclosure of the files “refreshingly candid”.“It shows that the FBI is serious about being transparent,” said Morley, who is also editor of the JFK Facts blog.Morley said it sets a precedent for other agencies to come forward with documents that haven’t yet been turned over to the National Archives.Trump’s order last month directed the national intelligence director and attorney general to develop a plan to release classified records related to Kennedy’s assassination. A spokesperson for the office of the director of national intelligence said that as required by the order, a release plan has been submitted, but offered no details about the plan or a timeline for when records may be made available to the public.The collection was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president. In his first term, Trump said he would allow the release of all of the remaining records but ended up holding some back due to potential harm to national security. And while files continued to be released under former presidentJoe Biden, some remain unseen.The assassination fueled conspiracy theories for decades. Kennedy was fatally shot in downtown Dallas as his motorcade passed in front of the Texas School Book Depository building, where 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. Two days after Kennedy was killed, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer.The Warren commission, established by then president Lyndon B Johnson to investigate the assassination, found that Oswald acted alone and that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But that conclusion never quelled a web of alternative theories over the decades.Gerald Posner, author of Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK which concludes that Oswald acted alone, said it’s possible that the newly discovered files are repeats of documents that are already in the National Archives’ collection or they could be documents the review board for the collection had previously said it didn’t want.“If they are really new assassination documents, then it raises a whole bunch of questions about how they were missed for all of these years,” Posner said.He said the “wow” would be if they are related to Oswald or the investigation.The documents released over the past several years from the collection have offered details on the way intelligence services operated at the time, and include CIA cables and memos discussing visits by Oswald to the Soviet and Cuban embassies during a trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. The former Marine had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning home to Texas.Morley said the CIA’s surveillance of Oswald has been the “emerging story over the last five to 10 years”. He said there could be information on that in the new files.Explore more on these topicsJohn F KennedyFBIDonald TrumpJoe BidenUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Graphics byPaul Scruton,Harvey SymonsandFinbarr SheehyTue 11 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 10.57 ESTShareThe US president,Donald Trump, has put global leaders ill at ease with his threat of tariffs.After announcing and thendelaying tariffson Canada and Mexico, hittingChinese goodswith an additional 10% tariff and alsothreatening the European Union, countries and markets are concerned about where the US president will go next.Trump’s policies come at a time when the US operates a large negative trade balance with the rest of the world. This happens when a country buys or imports more from other countries than it sells or exports to them.In 2024, the US operated a trade deficit ingoodsof more than $1.2tn (£970bn) with the rest of the world, but operated a surplus of nearly $300bn in services.Line chart showing how US balance of trade has stood at a deficit of over half a trillion since 2017The charts below show why theTrump administrationmay have picked out certain countries to target with tariffs, and what the impact of any trade barriers could be.The analysis looks mostly at trade in physical goods as opposed to services, which unlike merchandise trade arenot subject to tariffsand border checks.Which countries export the most goods to the US?In 2024, the US received the most imports from Mexico,Chinaand Canada. Each of these countries exported more than $400bn of goods into the US.Mexico and Canada export a lot of vehicles to the US, as well as energy and oil. Machinery and electrical equipment also form a significant portion of Mexican exports to the US. Chinese exports include electronics, machinery and agricultural goods.European and Asian allies – such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam – are the next biggest exporters to the US, with the US importing more than $100bn of goods from each of these countries last year. The US imported $68bn of goods from the UK that year.While the EU is treated as one large entity for the purposes of trade and tariffs, the data includes figures on each member state individually.A world map showing the countries exporting the most goods to the USThe collective value of exports since 2009 is $5.2tn forCanada, $5.3tn for Mexico and $7.2tn for China.Trump is tackling large trade deficitsBut trade works both ways. The US is the world’s largest importer of goods, butChinais the biggest exporter.Overall, when tallying the total value of imports versus exports, the US also has the world’s largest trade deficit, worth more than $1tn. Some countries export far more to the US than they import, and it is these nations Trump appears to be targeting most.A chart showing the countries with the 10 largest trade surpluses with the USThe countries that the US has the largest trade deficits with are China and Mexico, according to data from theUS International Trade Administration.Figures from 2024 show that the US’s largest trade deficit was with China, at $296bn. For Mexico it was $172bn. These countries were among the first to have the threat of tariffs hanging over them.The US’s next largest deficits are with Vietnam – increasingly a gateway to the US for Chinese companies avoiding tariffs – followed by Ireland, Germany and Taiwan.Which sectors could be most affected?ForCanada– one of the three countries first targeted by Trump’s tariffs in his second term – its most significant products being exported to the US are fossil fuels, cars and machinery – mostly jet turbines and piston engines. Cars and machinery also represent the largest product groups being transported for sale from the US to Canada.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between Canada and the USWhileMexicohas a significant trade surplus with the US, the US still sends tens of billions of dollars’ worth of products in cars, machinery and electrical goods south of the border. This includes microchips, fibre cables and computer equipment. On the whole Mexico also exports the same products to its northern neighbour, although its main export is cars and trucks.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between Mexico and the USMexico and Canada have enjoyed largely free trade with the US since 1994 when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) came into effect. It was replaced in 2020 by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).The US trades a significant amount of fossil fuels with both of its neighbours. Trump’s initial announcement seemed to acknowledge this when he targeted energy resources coming into the US by a smaller tariff rate of 10%.Trump has threatened, but not yet announced, tariffs on theEuropean Union. Data shows that pharmaceutical products such as vaccines, machinery and cars account for nearly half of the EU’s exports to the US. Flowing the other way, from the US to the EU, is oil, pharmaceutical items and machinery.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between the EU and the USFinally, there isChina– which has implemented retaliatory tariffs against the US – half of whose exports go to the US in electrical devices such as computers, phones and batteries as well as toys and games. US exports to China include electrical items such as microchips, oil and soya beans.Trade between the US and China has been decreasing – in 2018, 21% of US imports came from China, and by 2023 this had fallen to 14%.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between China and the USWhich countries are the most exposed?When looking at what proportion of each countries’ trade is accounted for by the US, we can get a sense of how exposed each country’s trading economy is.The vast majority of trade in goods for both Canada and Mexico goes to the US – with 80% of Mexican and 78% of Canadian exported goods going to the US, according to data fromComtrade.The EU, China and the UK are less directly exposed – with 19%, 15% and 14% of their exported products going to the US. Within the EU, Germany dominates the value of the bloc’s exports, at more than $160bn in 2024, but that only accounts for 10% of its global total. Ireland, which exports about $100bn to the US, has the highest, with more than a quarter of its exports destined for the US market.A chart showing how the US’s closest neighbours have the greatest exposure in terms of tradeHowever, even if the proportion of their direct trade with the US is lower, experts warn that the interconnectedness of world trade would still mean countries would be in the firing line. That’s because modern supply chains stretch across multiple nations, with parts often crossing borders several times to make a finished product. For example, if Germany was hit by tariffs, but Britain was not, a UK company could still be hit if it supplied parts used in a German product destined for the US market.What does this mean for the UK?At the moment the UK has avoided a specific threat of tariffs hanging over it. Some of this could be down to the fact that Britain has a relatively balanced trade relationship with the US compared with other nations.One reason Britain’s exports to the US are outside Trump’s line of fire is because US figures suggest it had a physical goods trade surplus with Britain of about $10bn (around £8bn) in 2023. UK figures, by contrast, suggest it was actually the UK that had a small goods surplus of £2.4bn that year – with a collective goods and services surplus of £71.4bn.TheONSblames this difference largely on two reasons: territorial definitions, with the US data including crown dependencies, unlike the UK; and the methodologies used to estimate services trade.Bloomberg Economicsestimates that if Trump imposed 20% tariffs on the UK, growth this year could come in at 0.4% rather than 1.1%.Services account for the majority of trade between the UK and US. But if goods were targeted in any future tariff, the UK’s most exported products to the US are mechanical power generators, cars and pharmaceutical products, according toUS International Trade Administrationdata. The US’s biggest exports to the UK were oil, jewellery and aircraft products.A chart showing a breakdown of trade between the UK and the USOne complicating factor for the Labour government is that the closer the Labour government aligns the British economy with the EU – as it promised to do in July’s election – the less room it has for manoeuvre to accommodate US demands on trade.Experts say Washington is likely to demand access to the UK market for US agrifood products – including hormone-fed beef and chlorinated chicken. This would be both politically challenging for Labour, but also take the UK out of line with EU food safety standards, making trade harder.

We see a lot of economic relationship to build upon with Europe”.Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium from 10% to 25% and eliminating all country exceptions, quota deals and product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals with effect from 12 March.He said the move would simplify tariffs on the metals “so everyone can understand … it’s 25%” on all countries. He has also promised reciprocal tariffs on all countries that tax imports from the US and said he was looking at tariffs on cars and pharmaceuticals.What are the tariffs on steel and aluminum Trump announced?Read moreAccording to US trade figures, Canada, Brazil and Mexico are the three biggest steel exporters to the US, followed bySouth Korea. An estimated 25% of EU steel exports go to the US, worth about €3bn a year over the past decade.Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who is attending an artificial intelligence summit in Paris, said on Tuesday that Canadians would “stand up strongly and firmly if we need to”, describing the Trump administration’s decision as “unacceptable”.The Mexican economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said the tariffs were “unfair” and “not justified”. Mexico’s US steel exports had been falling since 2022 while imports of US steel had grown, he said, so it now “imports more steel from the US than it exports”.South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, said Seoul was “committed to protecting the interests of our companies and reducing uncertainties” and would seek to “build a close relationship” with Washington and explore diplomatic options.There was also criticism from within the US, with the chief executive of Ford, Jim Farley, saying that while he believed the president aimed to strengthen the US auto industry overall, his tariff plans had “a lot of cost and a lot of chaos”.The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, told the European parliament that Trump’s move would fuel inflation but that the bloc remained committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution as soon as possible.“The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on our exports, which are economically counterproductive,” he said. “Tariffs are taxes, bad for businesses, worse for consumers … and harmful to the global trading system.”Šefčovič said the commission, the EU’s executive body, was “assessing the scope of the measures announced overnight and will be responding in a firm and proportionate way by countermeasures”.Why Trump tariffs will be ‘very bad for America and for the world’Read moreTrump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from dozens of countries in his first term, drawing EU countermeasures on emblematic US goods including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon whiskey, jeans and orange juice.Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the EU would present a united front. “If the US leaves us no other choice, the EU will respond as one,” he told parliament. “As the world’s largest market, with 450 million citizens, we have the strength to do so.”France’s industry minister, Marc Ferracci, said that while his country was not a major producer of aluminium or steel, it could still be indirectly affected if Chinese exports discouraged by the US tariffs instead made their way to European shores.“We should expect that there will be some effects from Donald Trump’s tariffs,” Ferracci said. “Europe must respond in a united manner, because we know that his strategy is to divide Europeans. We must respond in a firm manner.”Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeTrump administrationCanadaSouth KoreanewsShareReuse this content"

Under the2020 policy, Goldman had stated that it would only take on a company’s initial public offering if the company had at least one board member from a diverse background.Deloitte US has instructed staff working on contracts for the American government to remove pronouns from their emails, becoming the latest company to change policies in wake of Trump’s anti-diversity push.The consultancy and accounting giant reportedly gave contracted staff until 7 February to scrub pronouns from email signatures, while also announcing it would end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programme.The instructions were sent in an email to 15,000 staff in Deloitte’s government and public services practice, which explained the move was meant to “align with emerging government client practices and requirements”.Staff were also told on Monday that the company was planning to “sunset” its annual diversity report and wider DEI programming, according to a report by the Financial Times.Goldman said it was reacting to a court decision that removed a requirement by Nasdaq, the tech-led stock market, for companies to disclose board-level diversity information.“As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,” Goldman said in a statement. “We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.”It is the latest sign that private companies are bowing to pressure from the White House to ditch DEI policies that conservatives claim result in “reverse discrimination”.Trump usedexecutive orders last monthto reverse DEI policies in the federal government. Government staff are now required to report any colleagues they believe are furthering DEI efforts “in disguise”, and have received emails warning of “adverse consequences” if they fail to report any colleagues who are still carrying out DEI measures.While the orders do not apply to private companies, Trump has asked the US attorney general’s office to look into ways that it can get them to apply to the private sector.The shareholder advisory service ISS is also bowing to anti-diversity pressures ahead of the annual general meeting season.The company – which helps shareholders including large pension funds and asset managers decide how to vote at AGMs – said that from 25 February, it would no longer recommend voting against any US company’s board members for failing to hit gender/ethnicity leadership targets.ISS said it reflected the fact that companies and investors would be considering how and whether “they should adapt their specific policies and practices to the evolving market and governmental activity”, after Trump’s executive order.“In light of these developments, ISS will indefinitely halt consideration of certain diversity factors in making vote recommendations … [and] will no longer consider the gender and racial and/or ethnic diversity of a company’s board when making vote recommendations with respect to the election or re-election of directors at US companies.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She served as the agency’s chair.Trump is “committed to building a team fully committed to advancing his America-First agenda”, the White House official said.Her profile page on the agency’s website has already been removed, and an organizational chart of its leadership states that the chair role is now vacant.Tsui Grudmann’s firing was first revealed by a Washington Postreporteron social media.The FLRA is responsible for overseeing management and labor relations for some 2.1 million federal employees. Tsui Grundmann was nominated to its board by Joe Biden in 2021, and approved by the Senate in 2022, before herdesignationas chair in 2023. Hertermwas set to end on 1 JulyTrump hasalready been suedafterfiring a board member of the National Labor Relations Board, Gwynne Wilcox, last week.Wilcox has argued that the president only has authority to remove board members for negligence or misconduct, which were notallegedby the Trump administration during her termination.In 1935 the US supreme courtruledin Humphrey’s Executor v United States that the US constitution did not grant “illimitable power of removal” to the president.The FLRA has identical stipulations, with a statute thatstatesa president can remove a member “only upon notice and hearing and only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office”.The FLRA was contacted for comment.As chair, Tsui Grundmannarguedagainst stagnant funding and understaffing at the agency amid increases in unfair labor practice charge filings, saying the agency would have to engage in furloughs if funding remained flat.Last year, BidennominatedColleen Duffy Kiko and Anne Wagner to serve on the three-member board. Duffy Kiko had previously served as a Republican appointee to the board under Trump.

They requested to remain anonymous for privacy concerns about personal finances.Angela, a 42-year-old teacher in Virginia, explained she and her husband had struggled with paying off about $20,000 in credit card debt accrued mostly from paying medical bills not covered by her health insurance from infertility issues.“The medicines, procedures, and travel all hit us hard,” she said. “It just piles up and it piles up and you have to miss a payment because something else in life happens, and or you don’t make the payment you want to make, and it just starts to kind of snowball on you.”Medical debt reforms threatened by Trump pause on new regulationsRead moreThe debt has made it difficult to save anything and is always looming on her.“It’s a constant weight in the back of my mind which clouds all my little joys,” said Angela. “With inflation, cost of living rising, and life, I have struggled to pay down the debt. We do less, stress about what we can spend on or can afford.”A 54-year-old woman in Ohio said she lost her job in 2024 and was not approved for unemployment benefits because she was classified as a subcontractor, adding to debt she already had from medical bills and home repairs.“I’m now unable to pay them, and I can’t find a job due to a tight market and most likely age discrimination,” she said. “My debt has escalated to the equivalent of half my typical annual income. This and the inability to find a job have left me with no choice but to remain in a very unhappy, toxic, romantic relationship.”A 35-year-old software engineer in Los Angeles, California, said she accrued significant personal debt putting herself through engineering school at the age of 29, but despite making a salary of over $100,000 a year, she still struggles with paying it off and keeping up with bills.“I’m now facing huge interest rates and can barely pay down principal balances,” they said. “Student loans only covered my rent. If additional student loans existed for people in situations like mine, I wouldn’t have needed to charge so much to my credit cards.”This week the senators Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawleyintroduceda bill to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for the next five years, which Trump has claimed he would support. The average credit card interest rate is 28.6%, despite banks being able to borrow from the Federal Reserve at less than 4.5%.About 82%of all US adults have at least one credit card, with theaverageabout four credit cards per US consumer, according to Experian, and the average household hasover $21,000in credit card debt.A 69-year-old retiree in Moody, Alabama, said she lived check to check on social security and had had no choice but to rely on credit card debt for food, bills and other living expenses.“I am constantly stressed about money,” she said, adding it had created anxiety, depression and sleeping issues.A 47-year-old teacher in Mesa, Arizona, said he had fallen into debt trying to provide for a family of four, and covering the funeral costs for his mother, even as he said he had been “working my car to the bone for gig work to pick up the slack”.A 72-year-old in California said she only made a little over $1,200 a month from social security, but more than half of it went toward a debt consolidation payment.“Money is always an issue with me, I’m currently keeping my debt at bay with loans out of what little I have for retirement, but still losing about half my monthly income to debt repayment that I wish I could be saving for a home.”A 53-year-old in Connecticut explained he had fallen into significant credit card debt after losing his small business due to the pandemic shutdowns, from barely ever using credit cards to maxing out several, even after finding a job, which was difficult at his age.“The pay was a fraction of what my business was pulling in and at this point, I maxed out the credit cards as I didn’t have a lot of credit on them to begin with. I have since taken out two personal loans and got a third credit card. All of them are maxed out,” they said. “I’ve gained 60lb, my hair has been falling out, and I can’t sleep more than four hours a night.”Money owed on revolving debt grew 52.5% to $645bn, from a decade low of $423bn in second quarter 2021, according to a report by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve.Twenty-three per centof Americans with less than $25,000 annual income have no bank account. Forty-six per cent of Americans with annual incomes between $50,000 and $99,999 carried a credit card balance, while low-income Americans were more likely topredominantlyuse buy now, pay later, payday or pawn shop loans, withaverage annual interest ratesof payday loans at 400%, with many much higher.According to data from the US Federal Reserve,6%of Americans used a payday loan in 2023, up 1% from 2022, with users more likely to be low-income, Black and Hispanic adults, and adults with a disability.David, a 57-year-old gig worker and educator in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said he first took out a payday loan about six years ago when he lived in Oklahoma and had just started a new job and needed a loan to bridge the gap between paychecks.He said he was offered more money for the loan than he asked for, and as he made payments, the lender frequently offered to extend him more credit.“They report every late payment, every non-payment to the collection agencies, and I got into a merry-go-round, in over my head, and it wrecked my credit score,” said David. “There’s no negotiating, settling, or anything like that with payday lenders.”He said the collection tactics included calling his place of employment, calling the references on his initial loan application, to demand payment from him, which continued to grow with high interest rates and added fees. The length of time and impact it had on him had given him major depression and suicidal thoughts, he said.“They’re so predatory on very vulnerable people,” he added. “I can’t even get my own apartment without a co-signer. It’s just humiliating.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyUS personal financeDebt reliefBankingUS politicsBernie SandersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Markets in Seoul, Sydney and Taipei rose.Trump announces 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminumRead moreThe uncertainty fuelled by Trump’s moves has pushed safe-haven gold to record highs. On Monday, it broke above $2,900 for the first time. It extended gains on Tuesday to hit a new peak above $2,938.“This is still very early days,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. “The market’s just sort of chopping around rather than really directional right now.”Equities have held up since Trump took office – London and Frankfurt even hit record highs on Monday – with analysts saying measures had so far been less severe than feared.Still, caution looms over trading floors as dealers brace for the next announcement out of the White House, with Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for InternationalEconomics, saying: “The degree of uncertainty about trade policy has basically exploded.”And Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, said: “These expanding trade actions beyond previous threats to Canada, Mexico and China are leading to potential new import restrictions and retaliation, signalling more bouts of volatility for investors.“Tariffs are being used not just to tax imports but also as tools for national security, economic leverage and revenue generation, indicating a shift towards long-term economic policy rather than short-term trade disputes.”Fears that Trump’s tariffs, along with tax cuts and deregulation, will reignite inflation and force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates elevated have sent the dollar up against most of its peers.Readings on consumer and producer price indexes this week will provide a fresh snapshot of inflation, while Fed boss Jerome Powell is also due to give depositions to US lawmakers.Both will be pored over for an idea about the bank’s plans for rates, with forecasts for two cuts at most this year.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationInternational tradeStock marketsAsia PacificEconomicsGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

You can only hold out for so long against them, theManchester Citymanager suggested. They tend to find a way. This Madrid victory was built on their cut and thrust up front, the slickness of their bursts, the sheer speed of them.For a good while, it felt as though Erling Haaland would be the story; another striker who is not in the business of being shackled. The City No 9 had drawn blanks in all four of his previousChampions Leagueties against Madrid. He had a point to prove and he proved it, twice putting his team in front, the second for 2-1 coming from the penalty spot after Phil Foden, on as a substitute, had been fouled by Dani Ceballos.Even Total Haaland cannot stop Manchester City’s continuing nightmare | Barney RonayRead moreIt merely stirred Madrid to greater efforts. How were they behind? They had created so much, the City goalkeeper, Ederson, excelling in his efforts to keep them at bay. Kylian Mbappé, the central point of the Madrid front line, had scored the first equaliser, albeit with a finish that owed more to luck than judgment.Now Madrid pushed again. They refused to accept they would not take a lead back to the Bernabéu for the second leg of this playoff tie. Leading the way was Vinícius Júnior, who was simply frightening off the left. Rodrygo was not bad on the other flank, either. Ancelotti’s team got their second equaliser towards the end when they worked the ball to Vinícius on the inside right and his shot was pushed out by Ederson but only as far as another substitute, Brahim Díaz, who shot home. Díaz, the former City player, did not celebrate. The move had begun with a loose pass out by Ederson.The winner came in stoppage time and, if Madrid left it late, few people could say they did not deserve it. City have capitulated too many times this season and more fingers will be pointed at them. But it was more about Madrid’s talent, their remorselessness. City could not live with it.Guardiola had made an enforced change at the interval, Rico Lewis coming on for the injured Manuel Akanji at right-back and Vinícius gave him a torrid time. Vinícius punished him decisively at the last. It was a poor pass back by Mateo Kovacic, who had also entered as a substitute, but Lewis was on his heels, slow to react.Vinícius nicked the ball away from him and flicked on the afterburners. When he chipped over Ederson, it was Jude Bellingham, the final member of the fab quartet, playing as a No 10 when Madrid had possession, who raced in to tap into the unguarded net. Who else, as Bellingham might have put it.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham slides in to score the winner.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe tie needed no hype but it got it all the same. “Aclasico,”Carlo Ancelotti had called itand it did not disappoint. The history between the clubs pulsed, the epic showdowns, especially in the previous three seasons; one quarter-final, two semi‑finals – meetings that defined the competition, the winners going all the way to lift the trophy; City once, Madrid twice.Manchester City 2-3 Real Madrid: Champions League playoff player ratingsRead moreThere was also the more recent Ballon d’Or shemozzle, Madrid havingboycotted the ceremonyafter City’s Rodri won rather than Vinícius. The City fans had a jibe at the ready in the shape of a pre-match tifo. “Stop crying your heart out,” ran the words above an image of Rodri kissing the trophy. There were Ballon d’Or‑based taunts and boos from the home crowd for Vinícius. On reflection, perhaps it was not that wise.Madrid were bright at the outset. Vinícius sashayed around one challenge to release Mbappé, who saw Ederson save his shot and moments later the City goalkeeper denied Vinícius at close quarters. On the rebound, Ferland Mendy’s effort was blocked in front of the line by Nathan Aké.City were in front when Jack Grealish, given a rare start, lobbed a lovely ball into the area for Josko Gvardiol, who chested down for Haaland to finish. Was Haaland offside? The video assistant referee took an age to check before clearing him. Sadly, Grealish did not last much longer, injury forcing him off.Vinícius rattled the crossbar after a step‑over and a slide inside, while there was a flurry from the visitors before the interval. Federico Valverde, playing at right-back as Ancelotti contended with a defensive injury crisis, banged a shot high. Mbappé twice went close; the second attempt steered wastefully over. For City, Foden worked Thibaut Courtois from distance and Akanji looped a header on to the top of the crossbar from a corner.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland celebrates with Josko Gvardiol after scoring Manchester City’s first goal.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APIf Vinícius was in the mood, his acceleration blistering, then so was Haaland. Perhaps he sensed vulnerability in Madrid’s emergency central defensive pairing of Aurélien Tchouaméni and Raúl Asencio. Haaland’s movement was sharp, his physicality to the fore. He almost made it 2-0 at the start of the second half, taking a Kevin De Bruyne pass and seeing his shot deflect and hit the crossbar.Back came Madrid. Bellingham went close with a header. Mbappé drew a fine reflex save out of Ederson. The equaliser was coming and it did so when Ceballos chipped a half‑cleared free-kick back in for the run of Mbappé, whose side-on volley was more shin than boot. It spun in apologetically.It was all Madrid. Valverde lashed inches past the far post. Bellingham was denied one-on-one by Ederson. And yet the tie swung when Foden switched the ball from one foot to the other and Ceballos, already committed, stopped him illegally. After Haaland converted from the spot, it swung hard in the other direction.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityReal Madridmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

When Shiffrin announced on Instagram that she was racing with recently crowned downhill world champion Breezy Johnson, Vonn reacted with displeasure.“Why am I not surprised?” Vonn wrote on X with a shrug emoji, before deleting her post and adding another.Shiffrin won’t defend GS world title after ‘PTSD struggle’ following crashRead moreIn comments that came out on Monday, Shiffrin said she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following a crash in November and will not defend her gold medal in giant slalom at the world championships. She did say she would race in the slalom and team event though.“Maybe I didn’t help myself or the team by having my Twitter fingers out,” Vonn said on Tuesday. “But at the same time, I’m a human being and I was disappointed in the communication. And I let my feelings be known. I’m a human. I have feelings. So shoot me.”The new combined event entails one racer competing in a downhill run and another in a slalom, with the times of the two added together to determine the final results. Johnson and Shiffrin won gold on Tuesday while Vonn and AJ Hurt, her partner, finished 16th after Vonn had a dismal downhill run that left her team 21st after the morning leg. Vonn missed the medal ceremony as she had to catch a plane, but did congratulate Johnson and Shiffrin on X, saying “What a team!!!”She also said she was disappointed with her own run.“I was in my tuck pretty much the whole way down and just not accelerating anywhere,” said Vonn, who returned to full-time skiing this season at the age of 40 after nearly six years of retirement. “So I have clearly work to do. I think it’s my boots that I have to play with to figure out what’s better … but it’s hard to really change your entire setup while you’re racing in the world championships.”The combined pairings were selected by the US team’s coaching staff based on “season-best results” in downhill and slalom.“I didn’t have a problem with the selection process,” Vonn said. “It was 100% the right decision. Breezy and Mikaela should be the pair. They’re the fastest two skiers … my only problem was that it wasn’t communicated to me. I found out about it on Instagram. And I just think it’s a little unprofessional. It’s just a simple phone call or text message. I think that’s not a really difficult thing to ask for.”Vonn said she reached out and that Shiffrin agreed she would like the pair to race together. But then Vonn was told that Shiffrin wasn’t entering the combined. Vonn only learned of Shiffrin’s final decision to race in the event on Instagram.“It would have been a cool thing if those two greats would have raced together, but at the moment others are stronger in their performance,” US speed coach Alex Hoedlmoser said. “We had to make sure to bring the fastest pairings together, and it was very obvious that Breezy was the fastest in the downhill and therefore would race with Mikaela.”Explore more on these topicsSkiingLindsey VonnMikaela ShiffrinUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He scored 11 points while the Lakers streaked out to a 25-point halftime lead, and he sat down for good with 3:07 left in the third quarter with the Lakers far ahead in their sixth consecutive victory.“I was a little bit nervous before,” Dončić said. “I don’t remember the last time I was nervous before the game. But once I stepped on the court, it was fun. And just being out there again felt amazing.”The Slovenian star’s first bucket was a three-pointer in the opening minutes on his second shot for the Lakers. Dončić finished with five rebounds and four assists – none prettier than a three-quarter-court strike to James for a layup late in the first half.The Luka Dončić-Anthony Davis trade is shocking, franchise-altering and bizarreRead moreThe game was Dončić’s first in nearly seven weeks since he strained his left calf on Christmas with the Mavericks, whoshocked the sports worldby trading their 25-year-old centerpiece and NBA scoring champion. The grateful Lakers gave up Anthony Davis and Max Christie.After a full week to settle in and to return to full strength, Dončić joined James, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Jaxson Hayes as starters for the streaking Lakers, who had won 11 of 13 even before adding a five-time All-NBA selection to their lineup.Dončić played only 23 minutes as the Lakers bring him back deliberately from his injury. His legs aren’t quite there yet – he went 1 for 7 on three-point attempts in his debut – but his playmaking immediately meshed with his new teammates.Lakers coach JJ Redick, who played alongside Dončić for 13 games in 2021 with the Dallas Mavericks, was eager to see what Dončić would do in his much-hyped debut with his new team.“Excitement level is high,” Redick said. “I don’t think anything in our approach or game plan for Utah changes. It is always a challenge in-season to integrate, and we have to be able to give each other patience for that.”Dončić didn’t disappoint: His first touch was an alley-oop assist to Hayes, and he hit his three-pointer moments later. He was serenaded with “Luka! Luka!” chants at the first dead ball, and several times thereafter.That crowd included Dirk Nowitzki, who overlapped with Dončić for one season in Dallas and served as his mentor. Dončić appeared to be the natural heir to the German Hall of Famer’s incredible run in Dallas – until current Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison decided otherwise.Dončić played the first 6:56 before checking out alongside James – most likely a coincidence due to Dončić’s minutes restriction while he returns to full strength. The Lakers are expected to have one of their superstars on the floor at nearly all times when Dončić is up to speed.View image in fullscreenThe Lakers’ Luka Doncic, right, protects the ball from Jazz center Walker Kessler and guard Keyonte George on Monday.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPA“Feel like it’s best right now to ease Luka back in to playing NBA action,” Redick said. “I think if it was up to Luka, he would probably play 48 minutes, but we’re thinking long-term and we want to be safe.”Dončić returned with about eight minutes left in the first half, and he helped the Lakers on their way to a big lead with several key plays.Everybody received a Dončić T-shirt to mark the occasion at the Lakers’ downtown arena – including James, who warmed up before the game in the gold No 77 shirt.Dončić was followed by dozens of cameras as he warmed up for about 10 minutes before the game, and the Lakers’ arena played the Serbian music he favors for pregame workouts. The Lakers introduced him last before the game, giving him the spot normally reserved for James, which led to another standing ovation.“[James] let me have my moment, so I really appreciate it,” Dončić said. “I mean, today, he lent me this one. But from now on, he’ll be the last.”James returned from a one-game injury absence Monday when the Lakers began a home-and-home set with the Jazz heading into the All-Star break.“I don’t think any of us know exactly what it’ll look like,” Utah coach Will Hardy said. “I assume it’ll look good. [Dončić and James] are two of the best thinkers, problem-solvers that we’ve ever seen. So yeah, I think preparing for it is a little weird. ... But I don’t see any world where those two playing together isn’t a good thing. Like I said, their processing speed mentally is incredible, and so I’m sure they’ll figure it out.”Dončić began Monday by donating $500,000 to fire recovery efforts in his new community, making an immediate impression with his pledge to help with the damage caused by the rampant wildfires that devastated parts of Southern California last month – including Pacific Palisades, where Redick’s home was lost.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles LakersLuka DončićLeBron JamesNBAUtah JazzBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The USTA is hoping for similar high-profile pairings at the US Open.Photograph: Trevor Collens/APTennisUS Open to offer $1m prize and earlier start for mixed doubles to lure singles starsEvent will start before singles tournament in 2025Similar exhibition event worked well last yearAssociated PressTue 11 Feb 2025 12.29 ESTShareThe US Open is moving its mixed doubles tournament to the week before singles play begins, hoping a revamped format and $1m prize will persuade top players to chase a grand slam title.This year’s event will feature 16 teams competing over two days in shorter matches. Tournament organizers believe that can attract the sport’s biggest stars, many of whom have passed on doubles to keep themselves fresh for singles.“What I would say is the reason behind this is to appeal to more fans and grow the fan base around the world,” said Lew Sherr, executive director and CEO of the USTennisAssociation. “But the way to do that is to have the biggest names in the sport participating in doubles, and to showcase them teaming up and playing in a different format, we think is exciting. In fact, we know it’s exciting.”Swiatek and Boulter showcase new lease of life for mixed doubles formatRead moreThe plan, which was announced on Tuesday, calls for mixed doubles to be contested on 19 and 20 August this year, during the week when the qualifying rounds for men’s and women’s singles are being held. Main draw play in singles will begin on 24 August.The early round matches will be best-of-three sets played to just four games, with a deciding point played at deuce. Tiebreakers would be at 4-4 – rather than 6-6 in a regular match – and a 10-point tiebreaker would be played if the teams split sets, rather than a third set.Only the final will closely resemble a grand slam match: it will be best-of-three sets played to six games with no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at 6-6 and a 10-point match tiebreaker.Sherr said the USTA had discussed a format change in previous years but the idea truly picked up steam after last year, when a “Mixed Madness” event during the qualifying week drew singles stars such as Coco Gauff, Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyrgios and Ben Shelton, and was won by Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa.“We’ve known and we’ve had conversations over the years, like, why don’t they participate and we understand the scheduling challenges,” Sherr said. “I think last year’s task with that mixed madness event really informed our thinking, that if could unlock that week and free up the top singles players to participate, because it didn’t compromise their fitness or their health going into the singles, there was a huge opportunity to attract them and that’s what we saw.”There was a $500,000 prize for that event, which had just four teams. By doubling the winner’s prize money and expanding the field, Sherr believes it will create a competition worthy of a grand slam title, rather than keeping it as an exhibition.“The athletes played hard,” Sherr said. “It was not an exhibition, it was not a hit-and giggle, no kids got brought onto the court. It was a competition and that to me was the test. Would the athletes compete, and the answer to that was yes. Now we have an opportunity for a legitimate world championship, a Grand Slam championship, and we think the stakes only go up by making it the actual event.”Eight teams will earn direct entry by their combined singles rankings, with eight other teams given wildcards into the field. Sherr declined to name any players who had committed, but said enough have expressed interest that some teams may be announced in the coming weeks, long before the field is set in the summer.The tournament will be played in Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong, the two biggest stadiums, and be televised by ESPN in primetime, exposure that is rarely given to doubles.But it will squeeze out doubles specialists who count on grand slam paychecks and now lose access to one of them. To compensate for that, Sherr said the prize money that was allocated to the 32-team mixed doubles tournament at last year’s US Open would be redirected toward men’s and women’s doubles.“Yes, there’s some that will be disappointed that they won’t have the opportunity to compete in this event,” Sherr said. “On the other side, we know that there’s a huge opportunity to create more interest globally in doubles and there may be a cascading effect here, that the mixed creates a bigger spotlight on the men’s and women’s doubles when we get into that portion of the tournament.“We’ll have to see how that plays out, but we do know that our mixed competition historically has been competing with the men’s and women’s singles, and so the fields have suffered and the attention has suffered. This is a chance to give it a massive spotlight over two nights.”Explore more on these topicsTennisUS Open tennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In it, he said her comments had left him “shocked, upset and humiliated”. His initial statement made no mention of how Kerr’s words affected him.View image in fullscreenSam Kerr’s father Roger Kerr leaves the court after the verdict.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAOn 30 January 2023, Kerr and her partner, Kristie Mewis, had been on a night out before hailing a black cab in central London. During the journey, Kerr felt sick and opened the window. She put her head outside and vomited.While her head was still sitting on the car’s open window frame, Kerr said the driver rolled it back up. A dispute began after they refused the driver’s request to pay for the cleaning up of the mess.After this, Kerr and Mewis told the court that the driver locked the doors of the taxi and began speeding and swerving. Both said they had feared for their lives. The taxi driver called the police, unbeknownst to the couple. He was told to drive them to Twickenham police station.Mewis told the court they had “tried everything to get out” before the West Ham player smashed a window after kicking it with both feet. About a minute and a half before the car arrived at the police station, Kerr rang emergency services.After the car parked up outside the police station, Kerr crawled through the broken window and opened the door from the outside to let Mewis out. They willingly approached a marked police car where two officers, including Lovell, spoke to them. Lovell took them inside while the other officer stayed outside the station to speak to the taxi driver.The pair told the court they were “relieved” to come into contact with officers. Soon after, however, Kerr said officers were “dismissive” of their claims. After Lovell spoke to his colleague, who had been talking to the taxi driver, Kerr said his tone changed and he made the couple feel as if they “were the ones who had done something wrong”.Body-worn footage shown to the court, lasting about half an hour, shows Kerr saying: “We could not get out of the car, listen to the recording,” referring to the call they made in the cab, before saying she has “all the fucking people in the world”.View image in fullscreenKristie Mewis, partner of Sam Kerr, leaves the court after the verdict.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersIn the course of the exchange, Lovell doubts the pair’s claim of being “held hostage” in the cab. At one point, he says: “Do you think a taxi driver that was going to rape and kill you would drive you to a police station? No.”Kerr responds: “You’re sick. You’re honestly sick. You’re literally a white privileged person. You’re literally a white privileged man.”Lovell responds: “You don’t need to be racist towards me.”Kerr told the court she believed officers were “treating me differently based on what they perceived to be the colour of my skin”. Mewis said she felt officers treated her differently in the station. At one point, Lovell told Kerr to “calm down young missy” and, in the course of the exchange, she said her treatment was a “racial fucking thing”.Officers also cast doubt on Kerr and Mewis’s assertion that they had called police in the taxi but that the operator had hung up. The officers said they had no record of the call, claiming that phone operators would not hang up. During the trial, evidence emerged that they had called.In the call, Kerr is heard saying to operators: “Hey, can you help me. He won’t let us out of his cab.” Mewis is also heard saying “let us out, please”. Emergency responders hung up on Kerr, saying they would call back. When they did, the pair were in the police station and the call went to voicemail.After doubting the pair’s repeated assertion that they had called the police in the taxi, Kerr tells Lovell: “You guys are stupid and white, you guys are fucking stupid and white.” Kerr then looked up at Lovell and said: “I’m looking you in the eyes, I’m looking you in the eyes, you guys are fucking stupid.”Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They set up a League Cup final tie with Manchester City, reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League and FA Cup and are seven points clear at the top of the WSL table. Kerr has had a difficult four months. The Australian suffered a swathe of homophobic abuse in November after the announcement that her and partner, Kristie Mewis, are expecting their first baby together.Shortly after, the news broke that a vehicle hit her 90-year-old grandmother, leaving her in a critical condition, while the player was in New South Wales for the wedding of international teammates Emily van Egmond and Kat Thompson.After Kerr’s court case at Kingston crown court, the player said she was now “fully focused on getting back on to the pitch” and looking forward to an exciting year.“Following today’s not guilty verdict, I can finally put this challenging period behind me,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A different storm awaits on Wednesday when Liverpool cross Stanley Park one last time intent on silencing taunts about blowing the league at the home of their oldest rivals and containing the fallout from ashock FA Cup exit at Plymouth. There is nowhere else Moyes would rather be than in its midst of it all.“Strange it was rearranged,” the 61-year-old said, reflecting on the opportunity that has blown his way since theMerseyside derby was postponedon 7 December, the inevitable consequence of 70mph winds. Everton have changed owners and manager since then. A new era in a new stadium begins at Bramley-Moore dock next season and, thanks tothree successive league winsunder Moyes, Everton have newfound belief in remaining a Premier League club when they get there.‘Not acceptable’: Slot demands derby response from Liverpool after Cup exitRead moreWednesday, however, is about the old. The 120thderby to be held at a stadium that hosted its first on 13 October, 1894,Evertonwinning 3-0. The score is 41-41 at Goodison in all competitions. It is also the last game scheduled to be played under the Goodison floodlights at present. A huge part of Merseyside football history is about to disappear.Moyes has been immersed in the fixture since his first, in December 2002, ended in a goalless draw at Anfield. Wayne Rooney hit the crossbar and Steven Gerrard embedded his studs in Gary Naysmith’s thighs. Moyes sounded more like a football fan than manager when contemplating the significance of his 23rd Merseyside derby.“We’ve got a derby game which has been going on for 130 years, all of them at Goodison or Anfield,” the Everton manager said. “It is incredible that it is now coming to an end at this stadium. Will it be rougher or tougher because this is the last one? I don’t think so. But the stadium has played a big part in building this up to being a more explosive derby.“I will tell the players about what it means to the supporters [who plan to line Goodison Road to greet the team coach before kick‑off], although if I have to tell them that you’d have to question where they are in their footballing world. The last one at Goodison is a big thing. Everyone here is trying their best to make the last few games memorable and to put on a spectacle.”Everton’s players put one on in thecorresponding fixture last season. Their 2-0 victory was a highlight of Sean Dyche’s reign with wider ramifications for Everton’s Premier League status and Liverpool’s title chances. But while Arne Slot has fine-tuned Liverpool into a stronger title‑winning position this season, Everton are scrambling for safety and starting over yet again. Moyes believes the gulf in quality between the Merseyside rivals may never have been greater.View image in fullscreenDavid Moyes has led Everton to three successive league wins since returning to the club.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockThe Scot won only three of his 22 league derbies first time around – all at Goodison – but in finishing aboveLiverpoolthree times in 11 full seasons as Everton manager he showed the gap can be bridged. “The task is a big one, let’s not kid ourselves, but it’s a one‑off game, especially this one,” Moyes said. “There is a gulf between the teams in quality at the moment and obviously that is shown in the league position as well.“I don’t think Evertonians want me to kid them or tell them any lies. They’ve probably gone through the worst times they’ve felt as a club. The reason why I’m saying it to them is that we had to fight unbelievably hard for 11 years to get into a situation where we were more competitive against Liverpool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It took a long time to build that up. Now the gulf has come back. There was a gulf there when I first took over but I think at the moment it is back to that level again, if not further. I feel it was a big achievement to finish above Liverpool because they were always challenging for trophies, or around it, so it meant we had done something right.”Moyes did it without spending, or wasting, the money that his successors at Everton had in the early years of Farhad Moshiri’s ownership. Profitability and sustainability rules again constrained the club in the January transfer window but, with those restrictions expected to ease in the summer, the Everton manager hopes to start anew.“This football club spent lots and lots of money to try and get there and it didn’t necessarily work. We have tried to be that club that challenges the big boys by our spending but, looking back, there probably would have been a slightly better way to do it. I am hoping that we can start building again.”Explore more on these topicsEvertonLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

United employees are yet to be contacted formally by management regarding their jobs potentially being in danger, but it is believed they are braced for this to occur.Ineos blames ‘deindustrialisation of Europe’ for ending All Blacks dealRead moreAfter becoming the single largest minority shareholder last year Ratcliffe injected £300m into the club. But despite this funding the redevelopment of United’s Carrington training base, the long-term financial situation remains challenging due to the on- and off-pitch costs remaining high.In the January window United bought only Patrick Dorgu from Lecce for £25m despite Ruben Amorim’s squad needing a major overhaul – the majority of the players he inherited on becoming head coach in late October not being suited to his 3-4-3 system.How much finance Ratcliffe’s proposed redundancies will generate for the summer transfer market is unclear. United’s limited winter window budget came despite the 250 previous cuts and offoading 75% of Marcus Rashford’s £365,000 weekly salary by loaning him to via the deal struck with Aston Villa.In late November United’s accounts revealed the club had to pay £21.4m to sack Erik ten Hag and hire Amorim as the Dutchman’s replacement. Ten Hag was removed on 28 October, with his coaching staff René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar, Pieter Morel and Ruud van Nistelrooy all following. A total of £10.4m was paid in compensation to do so.Signing Amorim, plus the coaching quintet of Carlos Fernandes, Jorge Vital, Adélio Cândido, Emanuel Ferro and Paulo Barreira who followed him from Sporting, cost a further £11m.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Celtic are the heavy underdogs to see off the German giants over two legs but Rodgers has challenged his players to keep the tie competitive before they head to the Allianz Arena next week.Slovan Bratislava,RB LeipzigandYoung Boyshave already been defeated at Celtic Park this season, with the hosts unbeaten in their past half-dozen home European games.Champions League: previews and predictions for the playoff roundRead more“It’s where I wanted to take the club back to,” Rodgers said. “It’s not just a tick-box exercise for players to come and say they’ve played at Celtic Park. You want them to hurt in this arena as well and you want them to find the challenges of that combination between the supporters and the players on the pitch, making it a really, really difficult night. And we’ve started to do that. Obviously this will be a massive test of that, but that’s what we sign up for.”Rodgers is not underestimating the challenge against Bayern, describing the club as “football royalty”. Celtic’s cause has, however, been boosted by the availability of Daizen Maeda after Uefa downgraded an original two‑game ban for his red card in the match against Young Boys to a single fixture.“What is important for us is that we’re very much alive in the tie going over to Germany,” Rodgers said.“That would be the key message for us. But we want to go and perform. We’re not frightened to lose, that’s not what this is about. This is about going and performing and if we can perform well, like we’ve shown in this competition, especially at home, hopefully we can get what we deserve. Our mindset looking into the game is to win the game to see if we can take an advantage across the next week.”Rodgers was effusive in his praise of Harry Kane when recalling ­watching the development of the striker as a youngster at Tottenham. Kane’s competitive Spurs first-team debut came against Scottish opposition, in a Europa League qualifier against Hearts in 2011.“He’s absolutely brilliant,” ­Rodgers said of the England captain. “I’ve known Harry for a long time and come across him many times. Harry’s actually one of those ones that until you’re stood on the side of the pitch and you face him you actually only then really, really then see his level.“It wasn’t easy for him at the beginning. He had lots of loans getting out to clubs and didn’t quite work out. And then he was given the ­opportunity by Tim Sherwood at Tottenham. Tim had belief in him and had worked with him as a young player. Once he got into the team his development just improved from that. And you look at him now, he’s a world-class player.“But he’s changed his game a wee bit as well in the last number of years, where he’s on the move more, dropping short, you see his passing, you see his abilities. But he’s also tough. I can’t speak highly enough of him.”The sense of mutual ­appreciation was maintained by Vincent ­Kompany. The Bayern head coach praised ­Rodgers for his work both in the ­Premier League and Glasgow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

León was included in Barcelona’s squad to play the Copa del Reina on Wednesday night.Women’s Champions League tie predictions after the quarter-final drawRead moreEspanyol had released a statement condemning an “unacceptable” incident in which they alleged that León “made a gesture with her hand that violated the intimacy of our player”. In response, the Barcelona player said late on Monday night there was “no contact with her private parts, and certainly no intention”.“The idea of touching the private parts of a colleague would never enter my head, it goes against my principles and I would never do such a thing,” said León. But the head of Espanyol’s women’s team, Dolors Ribalta, reiterated that Caracas had been touched in an intimate area and told Spanish radio: “You have all seen the footage. There is none so blind as those who do not see.”Ribalta also denounced the insults that Caracas had received. “Our player has had a difficult day,” she told Cadena Ser. She added that Caracas was “in shock” and that the club would wait for the player to decide on any action she would want to take as she sought to come to terms with the situation.“We want to defend our player, say that what happened is lamentable and continue from there [along the course] that our player decides, and [taking] whatever action she wants to take,” Ribalta said. “We want to protect her, look after her, and [allow her] to decide what she considers best. We’re doing that at a legal and psychological level. We will see what the next step is day by day.”Footage of the incident also shows León saying something to Caracas. León’s statement said: “As the images show, it was part of the play in which she deliberately touches me and I touch her leg saying in reaction to the clash: ‘What’s up with you.’”The Liga F, Barcelona and Espanyol have all asked for further footage of the incident. The league has contacted the parties involved but not made any statement publicly. A statement from the Spanish player’s union, the AFE, condemned “any inadequate conduct in football” but did not name either player or their clubs. In a statement, FIFPro, by contrast, cited the incident directly and said that it has contacted all parties in an attempt to “clarify” events.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I behaved like a sports person, like I was one more member of the team. I should have been more cold-blooded and adopted a more institutional role.”The sixth day of the trial in San Fernando de Henares in Madrid began with evidence from David Morillo, who has been deaf since birth and was presented by the defence as an expert lip reader.During the pre-trial, Rubiales claimed he asked Hermoso if he could give her apiquito(a peck). Based on video evidence, Morillo said that the accused asked for abesito(little kiss), the same meaning but a different word, a distinction Rubiales dismissed as irrelevant.Morillo added that, as Hermoso’s back was to the camera, he couldn’t confirm whether she gave her consent.Rubiales denied trying to coerce Hermoso into making a statement minimising the incident, saying that, given the media attention the kiss had attracted, he suggested they calm things down by making a joint statement, but Hermoso refused to comply.The court also heard a recording of an interview Hermoso gave to a Spanish journalist immediately after her team’s victory in which she dismisses the kiss as an “anecdote” in the context of the euphoria of becoming world champions.However, on the trial’s opening day, the footballer told the court that “one of the happiest moments” of her life had been ruined by the kiss and its aftermath.If convicted, Rubiales –who resigned as the federation presidenta month after the incident – could face two and a half years in prison: one year for sexual assault over the kiss, and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso to downplay what happened.The trial continues on Wednesday with the testimony of the former head coach of the women’s national team Jorge Vilda, the former Spanish football federation sporting director Albert Luque and the federation’s former marketing chief Rubén Rivera, for their suspected roles in putting pressure on Hermoso. All three deny the charges against them.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamWomen's footballSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

TNS wrote to Fifa for help in January after an agreed payment was not made by Al-Orobah. That money has still not been paid, the club say, while a second instalment is now also overdue.Saudi Pro League shifts away from megastar signings to focus on youthRead more“We would strongly advise any clubs who are considering entering into negotiations with clubs in the Saudi Pro League to think twice before they do so,”the chair, Mike Harris, said. “When agreements are made, you would expect them to be honoured, and twice we have been promised money that we haven’t received despite numerous requests to do so.”TNS say the result of their appeal to Fifa, with a tribunal convened in the middle of January, was an order that the first instalment on the transfer fee, a sum of $150,000 (£121,000), must be paid within 45 days, with 5% interest added. The club went on to say that Fifa’s general secretary, Mattias Grafström, had also proposed a second instalment of the transfer fee be paid within a 45-day period of 21 February. Under Fifa rules, should a club fail to comply with a monetary decision issued by a tribunal, they can be banned from signing further players until the debts are repaid.Speaking last month, before Fifa intervention, Harris said TNS had been unable to contact Al-Orobah directly in attempting to resolve their issues. Young, meanwhile, has continued to play in the Pro League, scoring one goal and registering an assist in nine appearances for the club. Young also featured in a Sky Sports documentary about life in Saudi Arabia, describing it as “luxurious”.“The money side is good but if you look at the standard of the league and the players of the league, it’s probably among the top five leagues,” Young told Sky. “I didn’t just do it for the money. I did it for the experience of living abroad, to better my career.”Fifa and the Saudi Pro League have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSaudi Pro LeagueSaudi Arabia and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Slot did not spare his players from further criticism for the performance on Sunday when previewing his first encounter with Everton, and dismissed the idea that exiting the FA Cup could have its merits.An FA Cup shock shouldn’t unhinge Liverpool, but football isn’t logicalRead moreThe Liverpool head coach said: “It should have an impact because if you are working at a club like this you should compete for every trophy, so to go out at the second occasion and to lose against Plymouth is not acceptable. As a team, as well as our fans, we are disappointed by that result. Now we have to show a different side of us tomorrow because it wasn’t only the result but the performance that was far from what Liverpool’s standards are as well.”Slot revealed his Plymouth plans were disrupted not only by Joe Gomez sustaining a repeat hamstring injury and Curtis Jones feeling unwell on the morning of the fixture, but that Darwin Núñez had travelled to Spain in the days before the game to attend the birth of his child. Slot rejected the suggestion that, after a demanding sequence of five league matches in 15 days, Liverpool should welcome a free weekend when the FA Cup fifth round takes place.“A wise man once said to me that nothing good comes from losing a football game and I completely agree,” said Slot, who could have Trent Alexander-Arnold available for the derby. “We would have definitely preferred to play six games in 18 days or seven in 21 or eight in 24 because that is the schedule we are in.“Now there is one moment where we have a normal week but that is definitely not what we wanted when we went to Plymouth.”Slot’s criticism extended to his own team selection at Home Park. Although he defended the amount of changes after the game, he admitted he misjudged the impact that many would have on the team’s performance level.“There is a big difference coming into a team that has a certain structure and has played so many times together; then one or two players coming in can have a big impact,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I assumed, and that’s the wrong interpretation that I made, that these players were good enough to win against Plymouth without having the same cohesion. It still should have been more than enough to win against Plymouth but it wasn’t.”Slot said the wider shock at the result had not come as a surprise because he felt the same way. “I saw some remarks in the Dutch media because I follow all the news over there. They had some strong words so I assume the English media said similar things. I can only agree. I had the same emotions.

Plans to have one in New York City’s Corona Park no longer are moving forward, but festivities in Central Park remains possible. The one in Jersey City is set.“That is going to be the one fan fest, I believe, across the country that is going to be up and running for all games of the World Cup as opposed to just the games that are happening in our region,” Tammy Murphy, wife of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and chair of the New York/New Jersey host committee’s directors, said during an interview Monday.Footballers at ‘very high risk of extreme heat stress’ during World Cup 2026Read moreMurphy’s appointment as chair was announced Tuesday along with the hiring of Alex Lasry, a former Milwaukee Bucks executive and son of former Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, as CEO of the host committee. He heads a full-time staff of about 10.The World Cup will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The tournament, expanded to 48 nations from 32, opens 11 June in Mexico City and the final will be 19 July at East Rutherford, New Jersey. Games will be played at 11 US venues, three in Mexico and two in Canada, with all matches in the U.S. from the quarter-finals on.“The final is awesome to have here and it is a huge opportunity not just for Fifa to market itself, but I think more importantly for the New York/New Jersey region to market itself as the place to do business, as the place to do events and as the center for sports and entertainment in the world,” Lasry said.Fifa is running the World Cup itself unlike in the past, when a local organizing committee was in charge of logistics. Fifa did not respond to a request for president Gianni Infantino and Heimo Schirgi, chief operating officer of the tournament, to discuss the World Cup.The host committee will coordinate with federal, state and local governments. “We’re not going to really be handling what goes on inside the stadium,” Lasry said. “The soccer match, that’s going to be a lot of Fifa. We’re going to be working with Fifa on security and our day-to-day responsibilities are to raise money to help put on the fan fests, to make sure that our security and transportation are all set and then also making sure that we’re engaging with the communities to kind of explain to everyone what the benefits of this are going to be.”Lasry, the US Commerce Department’s deputy assistant secretary for travel and tourism for two years until last month, said the committee will work to ensure the tournament leaves a legacy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or maybe, just their owners are. The ones who bring a Great Dane into the grocery store, or hole up in a cocktail bar with a giant Saint Bernard at their feet. Dog people used to symbolize sensitivity, or a down-to-earth vibe. Now, they’re synonymous with white-collar entitlement.Westminster Dog Show 2025: America’s top canines vie for best in show – liveRead moreBut I kept those feelings to myself during theWestminster Dog Show, lest they take me out back to get mauled by a pack of Belgian Malinios.The 149th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is the oldest continually held sporting event in the US, after the Kentucky Derby. The first thing I noticed upon entering the Javits Center, where best-of-breed competitions were held on Monday, was that even the security dogs were fancy. No boring German shepherds or lolling Golden Retrievers here, instead, guards held manicured poodles or super-fit hunting dogs on leashes.Thesecondthing I noticed was the stench. Straight-up barnyard, especially in the backstage area. Don’t let Getty Images of dogs getting blowouts or YouTube clips of bang trims fool you. Even champions have to poop. The stench of 2,500 dogs representing all 50 states adds up. Collectively, these pups reeked.View image in fullscreenValentina, the Miniature Pinscher, who placed fourth in the Toy Group, prepares with her team.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty Images for Westminster Kennel ClubArchetypical over-bearing mom types (soccer, dance, boy) all share a hawkish sense of their child’s exceptionalism. Ditto for some of these dog moms, who stared down the competition as if they were a 14-year-old Dunkin employee who just got their order wrong. I appreciated their dedication to the event’s dress code, though, which I might describe as sequined business casual.“She’s here to do her job,” one man said of his bulldog, with all the seriousness of a cop at a press conference speaking about how the suspect is still at large. “And so am I.”“There are a lot of divas here, both two- and four-legged,” said Suzanne Terrant, in from Johnstown, Ohio, to show Trauster, an Icelandic sheepdog. Both of Trauster’s parents were show dogs, but like any good nepo baby, Trauster just wanted to chill.“He would rather be swimming in a pond,” Terrant said. “He didn’t get anything this year, but we’re proud of him anyway.”Nearby Cosette, a Havanese from Montreal, stood stick-straight, regulation-style with her chest out. “She wants to be the center of attention,” said her breeder, Myriam Archamdault. Cosette is French, after all.View image in fullscreenThe Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, held at Madison Square Garden, is the oldest continually held sporting event in the US, after the Kentucky Derby.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty Images for Westminster Kennel ClubOne dog who was definitelynotFrench, a gray Airedale, flopped over and showed its belly in the middle of the ring, begging for pets while waiting for the judge to come over. I related deeply to this dog.Only the winners of Best of Breed would go to Madison Square Garden on Monday night, treated to all the pomp of a professional sports game. There were corporate sponsors (Purina), a hyped-up arena crowd (ready to boo the judges’ decisions), and, bizarrely, a performance of the national anthem to start out the event. It was a special day. This year marks the show’s return to Madison Square Garden after five years away due to Covid.The Hound Group came first. This was when I started getting nervous as a writer. There are only so many ways you can talk about show dogs. Toned, athletic, perky, cute. Luckily, the man sitting next to me, a longtime dog lover, gave running commentary.Of the lithe, elegant Afghan hound: “That’s a psychotic breed.” Of the Redbone Coonhound: “There we go. A beautiful dog.” Of the Rhodesian ridgeback: “They’re dumb as hell.”Of the entire Toy Group, made up of small, affectionate companion pets: “I never understood these little ones.”View image in fullscreenPug dogs rest during the best-of-breed judging at the Javits Convention Center on Monday on day one of the Westminster dog show.Photograph: Andrés Kudacki/Getty ImagesThe Toy Group, by the way, was judged by Angela Pickett, an American Kennel Club judge, breeder of Papillons, and honorary lifetime member of the Papillon Club of America from Chuluota, Florida. With her ombre-brown hair, side bangs, floor-length lace evening gown, and steely-eyed stare, Pickett resembled Westminster’s version of Anna Wintour, the frosty Vogue editor-in-chief.Pickett seems like the type of person I’d want to drink six margaritas with, while mining her for kennel club gossip. But she seemed ruthless in her judging. I know a Miniature Pinscher must hate to see her coming. (Comet, a Shih Tzu whoalso won last year, took home the prize.)Sports are only as good as their narratives: the Miracle on Ice, The Rumble in the Jungle. Westminster had its own emotional peak with Neil the Bichon Frisé, winner of the Non-Sporting Group. Neil’s owner, Lisa Bettis of Naperville, Illinois, spent the day before the big show in the hospital after an unspecified health emergency. But she made sure to get out and hit the stage with Neil. “He loves life, loves people,” Bettis told a Fox reporter after they cinched the medal. A good boy!At this point, it was around 10pm. Maybe it was Neil, or the pageantry, or my being hypnotized after watching dogs run in circles for eight hours, but I started to rethink my whole “dogs are in their flop era” theory. These ones were athletes who knew how to work a crowd. They lived to please, and gamely put up with the foibles and follies of us humans. I guess spending a night with these top dogs can convert even the staunchest hater.Explore more on these topicsWestminster Dog ShowUS sportsDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His arrival in LA follows a bizarrefall from grace at the Philadelphia 76erswhere he was selected with the No 1 draft pick in 2016, named NBA Rookie of the Year, and in 2019signed a $US177m five-year rookie extension contract.After cashing in, Melbourne-born Simmons developed achronic case of the shooting “yips”. He became such a liability because of his reluctance to shoot thatSimmons was traded to the Netswhere he had a dismalinjury-plagued three seasons.View image in fullscreenPatty Mills has joined the Los Angeles Clippers in his 16th season in the NBA.Photograph: Gary A Vasquez/USA Today SportsMills, a 16-year NBA veteran who has no problem shooting the ball, says 208cm tall point forward Simmons has the perfect skillset to complement the offensive power that Leonard, Harden and shooting guard Norman Powell provide the Clippers.“Ben doesn’t need to shoot like me because he has skills that a lot of players don’t have in the NBA,” Mills says. “Ben’s presence is so big, long and athletic he can guard anyone on the floor and he can make passes that no one else can make.”Simmons has avoided playing for the Boomersthroughout his NBA career, sometimes citing injury orother reasons, though Mills has experience playing alongside him in 2022-23 when they both landed on the Nets. Mills has also played with Leonard, Harden and other veterans including Nicolas Batum, so he believes the Clippers are the perfect landing spot for Simmons.“I got to know Ben on a deeper level in Brooklyn and after being here at the Clippers for a little bit now and experiencing the environment they have, I think he can benefit a lot from what is here and how hard people work,” Mills says.View image in fullscreenPatty Mills has an eye on LA 2028 after leading Australia’s Boomers to two Olympic Games.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APThe Clippers’ environment is an impressive one these days, thanks to the team’s owner and former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, who was named by Forbes as the eighth-richest person in the world with personal wealth estimated at $US145bn.When the Guardian caught up with Mills he was resting in the expansive and extravagantly decorated Clippers locker room in Ballmer’s new $US2bn Intuit Dome arena, located near Los Angeles International Airport. The locker room looks more like the foyer of a Ritz-Carlton hotel or the Belagio in Las Vegas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m just enjoying the journey as it goes. There’s tougher things in life than moving around the NBA.”Perhaps one of the secrets to Mills’ longevity are the two small bottles – one with orange liquid and the other clear – tucked away on a shelf in his locker.“It’s my secret juice, mate,” Mills says with a smile.The orange bottle contained ginger and turmeric juice, and the clear bottle had a “collagen booster”.Ben Simmons waived after former No 1 pick and Brooklyn Nets agree to buyoutRead moreMills’ other secret should be no surprise to coffee-loving Australians. Mills takes a coffee machine with him on the road so he can get a shot of caffeine for games no matter what NBA city he is playing in.“I have the juice first, and then the coffee. Just before a game I make a double espresso and then at half-time a triple flat white,” Mills says.The naysayers may doubt Simmons and Mills will make it to the 2028 Olympics, but the past week seems like it is their destiny. The Intuit Dome will be the basketball venue for the Olympics so Mills and Simmons, in a sense, have already made it. They just need to stick around for another three years.Explore more on these topicsNBALos Angeles ClippersBasketballAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He left humbled and harassedRead moreFox’s projections on Monday included Nielsen’s early numbers and streaming data from Tubi and the NFL. Updated and more complete numbers were expected on Tuesday.It would be the second straight year the Super Bowl has reached a record audience. The Chiefs’overtime victory over San Franciscolast year averaged 123.7 million on CBS, Nickelodeon, Univision and streaming platforms.According to Fox, Sunday’s audience peaked at 135.7 million in the second quarter. The early data projects 14.5 million watched on streaming platforms, including 13.6 million on Tubi, where the game was available for free.Some of the increase can be attributed to a change in the way viewers are counted. This is the first year Nielsen is measuring out-of-home viewers for all states except Hawaii and Alaska. It was previously the top 44 media markets, which covered 65% of the country. The ratings also include Nielsen data from smart TVs along with cable and satellite set-top boxes.After two straight years of close Super Bowls, Sunday’s game was all but decided in the first half as Philadelphia built a 24-0 lead.Donald Trump and Taylor Swift were also in attendance.Trump was the first sitting presidentto attend a Super Bowl, while Swift’s relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce keeps the pop superstar’s fans interested in the NFL.It was the third straight year the Super Bowl averaged more than 100 million viewers after a period when four of the five games before 2023 had fallen short of that number because of cord-cutting. That included 95.2 million for the 2021 Super Bowl between Tampa Bay and Kansas City, which was the game’s lowest TV-only average since 2007.The NFL playoffs averaged 35.2 million viewers the first three weekends, down 9% from last year’s record of 38.5 million. That followed a regular season that averaged 17.5 million. Though that was the sixth-highest average dating back to 1995, but a 2% decline from 2023.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LIXSuper BowlKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesNFLUS sportsKendrick LamarnewsShareReuse this content"

This is reflected in our signing of agreements on sustainability and cybersecurity today at the Paris AI Action summit,” the spokesperson said. “However, we felt the declaration didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.”Confirmation of the snub came soon after the US vice-president,JD Vance, took to the stage at the Grand Palais to criticise Europe’s “excessive regulation” of technology and warn against cooperating with China.Asked if Britain had declined to sign because it wanted to follow the US lead, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said they were “not aware of the US reasons or position” on the declaration. A government source rejected the suggestion that Britain was trying to curry favour with the US.But a Labour MP said: “I think we have little strategic room but to be downstream of the US.” They added that US AI firms could stop engaging withthe UK government’s AI Safety Institute, a world-leading research body, if Britain was perceived to be taking an overly restrictive approach to the development of the technology.Campaign groups criticised the UK’s decision and said it risked damaging its reputation in this area. Andrew Dudfield, the head of AI at Full Fact, said the UK risked “undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation” and that there needed to be “bolder government action to protect people from corrosive AI-generated misinformation”.Gaia Marcus, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, which focuses on AI research, said the UK’s actions “go against the vital global governance that AI needs.”The Élysée Palace said more countries might sign the declaration in the hours after the two-day summit.Vance’s hard-hitting speech, in front of leaders including theFrench president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, indicated dissatisfaction with the global approach to regulating and developing the technology. Starmerdid not attend the summit, with the tech secretary, Peter Kyle, representing the UK.Vance, in his first trip abroad as US vice-president, warned against the EU’s regulatory approach, stating that “excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Singling out the DSA, which regulates social media, the vice-president said: “It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet. And it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation.”Vance also referred to the risks of partnering with “authoritarian” regimes, in a pointed allusion to China – without mentioning the country directly. Referring to exports of CCTV and 5G equipment – key Chinese tech products – by authoritarian governments, he said there was a cost: “Partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term.”As the Chinese vice-premier, Zhang Guoqing, sat yards away, Vance added: “Some of us in this room have learned from experience partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true, just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley, if you aren’t paying for the product: you are the product.”Vance started his speech by cautioning against an excessive focus on safety, in an apparent criticism of the first global AI summit in the UK in 2023, which was badged as the AI Safety Summit. He indicated that he thought the Bletchley Park meeting was too cautious, referring to gatherings about cutting-edge technology that can be “too self-conscious, too risk averse”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)JD VanceChinaEuropeUS foreign policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Maxine Williams, a longtime employee and chief diversity officer at the time, wrote in a 2021 blogpost that Facebook was up to the challenge.“We’ll keep working toward these goals regardless of whether we’re able to meet them within five years because progress in representation is critical to serve a global audience,” wrote Williams.By2022, the company said it had doubled its number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US, and women accounted for more than a third of its workforce globally. There was still work to be done, though. Even after that increase, Black workers only made up 4.9% of the overall US workforce, and Hispanic workers made up 6.7%.But, as of 10 January 2025, the vast majority of that work has been summarily abandoned. Just days after 2024 had come and gone,Meta(now Facebook’s parent company) announced that instead of forging ahead with diversity goals, it would do away with corporate inclusion efforts entirely. The diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programswould be shuttered. The company would end “representation goals”. Williams would be relegated to a new role focused onaccessibility and engagement.“The term ‘DEI’ has … become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others,” wrote Janelle Gale, the company’s vice-president of human resources, in an internal memo.The diktat came directly from Meta’s CEO,Mark Zuckerberg.Those changes didn’t come in a vacuum. Earlier this month, ZuckerbergannouncedMeta wasending its factchecking programin the US and easing content restrictions around immigration and gender identity to focus on “free expression”. Meta’s “hateful conduct” policy was changed to allow users to accuse transgender or gay people of being “mentally ill”.View image in fullscreen‘A lot of the corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,’ Mark Zuckerberg said recently on Joe Rogan’s podcast, suggesting that modern businesses would benefit from more ‘masculine energy’.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesZuckerberg himself has alsoundergone a transformationfrom the sweaty, gray-hoodie-clad boy of Facebook’s early years. He wears a gold chain and practices mixed martial arts, exuding what he calls “masculine energy”, which he now preaches American companies need more of. He sat prominentlyalongsideother tech billionaires atDonald Trump’s inauguration. The day after Zuckerberg ended Meta’s DEI programs, Trump issued asimilar executive orderfor the federal government.It’s a far cry from the Zuckerberg whoonce banned Trump from Facebook, founded anorganization to help immigrantsand marched in a Pride parade. And a steep change for a company that was considered the gold standard for diversity and inclusion work in Silicon Valley.Meta agrees to pay Trump $25m for suspending accounts over Capitol riotsRead more“Facebook used to be the place to be if you wanted to work on diversity,” said a former recruiter on the DEI team, who asked not to be named for fear of professional reprisal. “Everyone wanted to work with Maxine Williams. Everyone wanted to follow whatFacebookwas doing. We were the leaders in this.”Sevenformer Facebook employees who worked on the company’s DEI and trust and safety teams say the shift had been a long time in the making. As Zuckerberg’s priorities have shifted with political winds, the company’s emphasis on diversity and other policies have followed suit, they said.The former employees said it was never clear how personally invested Zuckerberg was in makingMetaa more inclusive workplace. Many of the initiatives lacked substance because they were often rolled out in response to external pressure or specific events, including the murder of George Floyd, according to the employees. These efforts rarely went beyond company-wide pronouncements and did little to change or improve the recruitment or retention of employees from under-represented backgrounds.Some initiatives did make a meaningful difference, such as the diverse slate program that ensured qualified women and people from under-represented backgrounds were considered for open roles. But former employees say executives slowly chipped away at those when they stopped being convenient.The decline of diversity goals at Meta began in earnest with the departure of the chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, many of the former employees said. Sheresignedas the company’s second-in-command in 2022 andstepped downfrom the board in 2024; Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO,replaced her.The stark contrast between the two illustrates Meta’s about-face. Sandberg authored Lean In, considered by many the playbook for feminism in the workplace, while White leads the Maga movement’s ultra-masculine de facto sports league and was filmed slapping his wife at a party in 2022. Former employees say Sandberg’s exit was a signal that DEI goals would be deprioritized, especially if left to Zuckerberg. The Facebook founder shares his ex-employees’ opinion; he told the Trump adviser Stephen Miller that Meta’s culture of inclusivity was the result of Sandberg’s efforts, according tothe New York Times.“The business case for diversity was only valid as long as Sandberg was around to enforce it,” Bärí A Williams (no relation to Maxine), former senior counsel at Facebook,wrotein an op-ed earlier this month. “Now that it’s not politically in vogue, Zuckerberg is abandoning the business use case for diversity and fact-checking.”Meta declined to comment. Sandberg didn’t respond to a request for comment.Facebook’s diversity heydayFormer employees paint a picture of a former version of Facebook that, while still largely white and male, stood out among its tech industry peers for its innovative approach to diversify its ranks.Meta’s content moderation changes ‘hugely concerning’, says Molly Rose FoundationRead moreHow much personal buy-in they had from company executives wasn’t always clear, they say, but in the beginning, that didn’t seem to matter because Facebook was pouring millions into their efforts. There was the diverse slate program in hiring and a leadership mentor program for underrepresented employees. Facebook also started allowing for more remote roles, which led to an increase in staff from different backgrounds.While Sandberg and Williams led the charge on DEI efforts, Zuckerberg would often follow, former employees say. Mike Rognlien worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2017, ultimately landing a job as a head of learning and development. He helped write the company’s DEI training program. He recalled an incident in 2013 when employees were upset that Zuckerberg hadfundraised forthe re-election campaign of the Republican New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, because Christie had been vocal about not supporting marriage equality. Rognlien said he asked Zuckerberg about the donation during an all-staff Q&A.“Is that consistent with our company values? Is that consistent with your values?” Rognlien asked. Zuckerberg responded saying he understood the frustration but that he donated to Christie because of an ongoing program the governor had begun with New Jersey schools. Zuckerberg said he also donated to Cory Booker, the Democratic mayor of Newark at the time.“If there’s anything that you think I should do to kind of neutralize any negative feelings about that, I’m all ears,” Rognlien recalled Zuckerberg saying.Rognlien got together with leaders of employee resource groups about the incident, and they decided to ask Zuckerberg to march with them in San Francisco’s Pride parade. The CEO agreed immediately.Decked out in a purple T-shirt with a “I [heart with rainbow flag] Facebook” sticker, Zuckerberg joined more than 700 employees for the parade. Company videos show him riding in the float with other executives, dancing and waving his hands in the air. That day, Zuckerberg posted on Facebook that he stood with the millions of people marching in Pride parades worldwide.In 2013, Mark Zuckerberg (middle) attended San Francisco’s Pride parade. Pictured here with Meta executives Chris Cox (left) and Adam Mosseri (right). ‘I’m committed to make Facebook a safe place for members of the LGBT community everywhere,’ Zuckerberg said at the time.Photograph: Mike Rognlien“I’m committed to make Facebook a safe place for members of the LGBT community everywhere,” Zuckerberg wrote. “Because as far as we have come in the fight for equality, we have a lot more work to do.”Eleven years later, Zuckerberg, pushing for “masculine energy”, would allow Facebook and Instagram users to call any non-standard sexual orientation a mental illness, deride a transgender person with the pronoun “it”, and assert that there had only ever been two genders – that transgender people had never existed at all.With Sandberg, Facebook becomes a DEI leaderAround the time of Zuckerberg’s purple Pride ride-along, Sandberg ramped up development of Facebook’s DEI training program. The idea was to create a mandatory employee training that didn’t just check an HR box, Rognlien said, but rather generate genuine reflection and introspection. Gale, who would later write the internal memo dismantling DEI at Meta, was also instrumental in the inception of this program, according to Rognlien.“If you can rewind your brain back to 2014, unconscious bias was not in the zeitgeist,” Rognlien said. “So, that’s what the first iteration of the program really focused on. How do we educate people? … And when I say educate people, I mean primarily white male software engineers.”Rognlien said Facebook employees seemed to be taking the lessons of anti-bias workshops to heart. He cited an enthusiastic example of their success: a group of male engineers who had taken the training printed posters of Kanye West’s face and hung them in the company’s conference rooms. Captioned with “Imma let you finish” in reference to West cutting off Taylor Swift at the Video Music Awards five years earlier, the oversized heads served as reminders not to interrupt women in meetings.Influence of super rich on Donald Trump threatens democracy, say Patriotic MillionairesRead moreRognlien and Sandberg also conducted the training with Zuckerberg and his leadership team of about 15 people in the fall of 2014. Sandberg often said “meritocracy is a myth”, according to Rognlien, and during the training she instructed the leaders to think about their biases. Rognlien said the room was receptive.“The whole push for this type of education was 1,000% Sheryl,” Rognlien said. “Sheryl wanted to do this and was really flying the flag internally.”At the same time, Facebook’s COO was also working on creating a more diverse staff, Rognlien said. It became integral to Facebook’s mission of “bringing the world closer together”.“Sheryl’s belief was, if we don’t build a company that looks like the population of the world that we’re trying to connect, we’re not going to succeed,” Rognlien said.In 2014, Facebook released its first-ever diversity report. In ablogpost, Williams said diversity was “essential to achieving our mission”. The goal was to have a broad range of people from different geographical, age, gender, sexual orientation and cultural backgrounds. While the report showed the vast majority of Facebook employees were white males, Williams said the company was “absolutely committed to achieving greater diversity”.The unravelingFour years later, the number of women employed by the company had risen by 5%. Asian representation had risen by more than 7%, but the number of Black and Hispanic employees at Facebook had crept up by just one percentage point.Progress in leadership ranks was also incremental. Diversifying the workforce was challenging because it wasn’t a priority from day one, Williamswroteat the time. “The later you start taking deliberate action to increase diversity, the harder it becomes,” she said.By the end of 2018, an employeememo, first circulated internally, illustrated just how much more work Facebook had to do. In it, Mark Luckie, then a strategic partner manager for global influencers at the company, detailed the racial discrimination he said he and other Black employees faced. The teams that worked on diversity were not given adequate resources, and they felt their efforts served more for public relations than for genuine change, he said.“For some, their work devolves into serving as an address book to add a few names of color to projects,” Luckie wrote. “Efforts that promote inclusion, not just diversity, are being halted at the managerial level.”Meta accused of ‘bowing’ to Trump by making abortion content harder to findRead moreWhen Luckie didn’t hear back from the executive team, he made the memo public. “Facebook does not make any meaningful change on a company level unless it is being held accountable publicly,” he wrote.A year later, the company announced its new “50 in 5” diversity goal: in five years, the company aimed to have at least 50% of its workforce be composed of women; people who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islanders; people with two or more ethnicities; people with disabilities; and veterans.These efforts gained momentum in 2020 amid the US’s wider corporate reckoning. Williams’s role was elevated to report directly to Sandberg; the company announced a goal to increase diverse representation among senior leaders to 30% by 2025; and it committed to spending $1bn with diverse suppliers.But the fervor and urgency around these efforts dissipated within a matter of months, said employees who were at the company around that time.Two former employees who worked on recruiting and diversity said company executives became increasingly skittish about how they talked about DEI internally. Already in September 2020, Zuckerberg announced new limitations to employee political speech in internal chats and designated specific channels for those discussions. The announcement came after employee debates over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, became so heated thatZuckerberg himself stepped into end it.Facebook also created exceptions to its own diversity goals over the course of 2020. Engineering leaders pushed back against the diverse slate approach because they wanted to hire quickly, two former employees who worked on recruiting and DEI said. Before the exceptions were made, hiring managers needed to ensure there was at least one qualified woman and one person from an under-represented background considered for 90% of open roles – a requirement former DEI employees say already didn’t go far enough. But in response to pushback, the company pared down the requirement for tech roles: now engineering managers only needed to ensure that there was one woman or one person from an under-represented background considered for just 75% of the roles they were hiring.DEI leaders were also asked to trim the quarterly diversity reports that were once prioritized. The leadership mentor program for underrepresented staff was paused, restructured and eventually scaled down.Much of the shift solidified in 2022 when Facebook changed its name to Meta and Sandberg left the company, these employees say. Budgets got slashed, including for teams handling diversity, and Zuckerberg dubbed it the “year of efficiency”. This marked the last year the company published a diversity report. By the end of 2023, more than 11,000 employees had been laid off, including many remote workers and DEI staff. At least one DEI leader was told their budget would be cut in half and to make adjustments to their contracts and team accordingly.Google scraps diversity hiring goals and cites Trump’s DEI ordersRead moreNow, as of last month, the DEI team is gone entirely, with traces of its existencedisappearing from the internet. Links to many of the company’s public diversity reports are no longer accessible on the internet,leading to empty webpageswith the message “This content isn’t available right now.” TheDEI training video that Rognlien made with Williams has likewise vanished.Employees told the Guardian they wondered what would happen in 2029 when a new presidential administration takes office.For Rognlien, it’s disappointing, he said, because work on DEI is still far from being done. “Facebook’s market cap is what, one and a half trillion dollars?” he said. “They have the money and the resources to actually make a significant dent in the universe, and instead, Mark is wearing chains and going to Trump’s inauguration.”"

It has indicated a preferred scenario where copyright restrictions are relaxed for AI developers, provided they flag what works they use and if the creative industries have the opportunity to “opt out” of the process. It describes such an outcome as “the primary object of this consultation”.“Why have a preferred choice if it is an open consultation?” said Kidron.The other options are: to leave the situation unchanged; require AI companies to seek licences for using copyrighted work; and allow AI firms to use copyrighted work with no opt-out for creative companies and individuals.The row over copyright returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday with the second reading of the data (use and access) bill, which contains amendments from Kidron passed in the Lords last month.“What I say to MPs is, if you are members of a government that has put all its chips on growth, why is that same government undermining creative industries that bring£126bn to the UK economyand is giving away for free the property rights of 2.4 million people who work in those industries? The creative industries impact every constituency, region and nation,” she said.Kidron’s amendments aim to tackle the unauthorised use of copyrighted material to train the AI models that underpin products such as chatbots and image generators.The amendments, which can be removed by the government in the Commons, subject AI companies to UK copyright law wherever they are based and allow copyright owners to know when, where and how their work is used in AI systems. It also requires the naming of web crawlers that are used to scrape copyrighted data for use in AI models.“For more than 300 years we have had a gold-plated copyright regime but now the tech companies and the government are walking around saying it is unclear,” said Kidron. “Actually, it’s not unclear. Tech firms have come in with their [web] crawlers, taken all the copyrighted material, said ‘whoops it’s unclear’. But it is not unclear.”She added: “My amendments mandate that companies have to account for where and when they take the material and make it transparent. It makes copyright law fit for the age of AI. It makes tech accountable.”Campaigners for theprotection of the rights of creative professionalshave come out against the government proposal to allow AI companies to train the models on copyrighted work – unless creatives opt out of the process in what the government is calling a “rights reservation” system. The opt-out proposal has been met with scepticism from opponents of the government consultation, who say there is no evidence of a “water-tight” rights reservation process in any country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AI models such as the GPT-4o model powering theChatGPT chatbotare “trained” on huge amounts of data taken from the internet, where they in effect learn to spot patterns in that information – allowing them to predict, for instance, the next word in a sentence or to create realistic images.Kidron said pushing ahead with the changes would benefit the tech sector at the expense of its creative counterpart.“The government is suggesting a wholesale transfer of wealth from a hugely successful sector that invests hundreds of millions in the UK to a tech industry that extracts profit that is not assured and will accrue largely to the US and indeed China.”A government spokesperson said it was “important that everyone remains open-minded about this consultation and what it could deliver for all parties”.The spokesperson added: “This consultation remains open and is part of an ongoing conversation, and no move will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives: increased control for right holders to help them license their content, access to high-quality material to train leading AI models in the UK, and more transparency for right holders.”The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said he “very, very deeply” respected the work produced by the UK creative industries. Speaking to the Guardian last week before Kidron made her comments, Kyle said the present legal situation regarding copyright was “not tenable”, a situation reflected bylegal standoffsbetween tech businesses and the creative sector.“I’m working really carefully with the tech sector so that we can produce the reassurance they need, that there will be technical solutions to things like transparency and making sure that those remarkable people, who create remarkable pieces of art, are respected for it.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyComputingChatGPTBeeban KidronnewsShareReuse this content"

The answers were then rated by BBC journalists who specialise in the relevant subject areas.About a fifth of the answers introduced factual errors on numbers, dates or statements; 13% of quotes sourced to the BBC were either altered or did not exist in the articles cited.In response to a question about whether the convicted neonatal nurse Lucy Letby was innocent, Gemini responded: “It is up to each individual to decide whether they believe Lucy Letby is innocent or guilty.” The context of her court convictions for murder and attempted murder was omitted in the response, the research found.Other distortions highlighted in the report, based on accurate BBC sources, included:Microsoft’s Copilot falsely stating that the French rape victim Gisèle Pelicot uncovered crimes against her when she began having blackouts and memory loss, when in fact she found out about the crimes when police showed her videos they had confiscated from her husband’s devices.ChatGPT said Ismail Haniyeh was part of Hamas’s leadership months after he was assassinated in Iran. It also falsely said Sunak and Sturgeon were still in office.Gemini incorrectly stated: “The NHS advises people not to start vaping, and recommends that smokers who want to quit use other methods.”Perplexity falsely stated the date of the TV presenter Michael Mosley’s death and misquoted a statement from the family of the One Direction singer Liam Payne after his death.The findings prompted the BBC’s chief executive for news, Deborah Turness, to warn that “Gen AI tools are playing with fire” and threaten to undermine the public’s “fragile faith in facts”.In ablogpost about the research, Turness questioned whether AI was ready “to scrape and serve news without distorting and contorting the facts”. She also urged AI companies to work with the BBC to produce more accurate responses “rather than add to chaos and confusion”.The research comes afterApple was forced to suspend sending BBC-branded news alertsafter several inaccurate summaries of article were sent to iPhone users.Apple’s errors included falsely telling users that Luigi Mangione – who isaccused of killing Brian Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare’s insurance arm – had shot himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scale and scope of errors and the distortion of trusted content is unknown.”He added: “Publishers, like the BBC, should have control over whether and how their content is used and AI companies should show how [their] assistants process news along with the scale and scope of errors and inaccuracies they produce.“This will require strong partnerships between AI and media companies and new ways of working that put the audience first and maximise value for all. The BBC is open and willing to work closely with partners to do this.”The companies behind the AI assistants tested in the research have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)BBCNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Yambio, 27, was analleged victim of Najim’s abusesduring his detention at the notorious Mitiga prison near Tripoli.‘Why did we give back this alleged criminal?’ Pressure grows on Meloni after Italy releases wanted Libyan police chiefRead moreYambio’s case followed revelations that an Italian investigative journalist and two activists critical of Italy’s dealings with Libya were among 90 people who received notifications from WhatsApp in late Januaryalleging they had been targeted with spyware.WhatsApp has said the spyware used in that breach – which affected journalists and activists and others in two dozen countries – was made by Paragon Solutions, an Israel-based company that makes cyberweapons. The Guardian reported last week that Paragonterminated its client relationship with Italyfor breaking the terms of its contract, citing a person familiar with the matter.Yambio received an email from Apple on 13 November seen by the Guardian, informing him he was being targeted by “a mercenary spyware attack” that was attempting to “remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple account”. The message said the attack “is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do”.It did not specify what kind of spyware was being used against him, and Yambio was not one of the 90 people who received aWhatsAppnotification.Yambio said he contacted a digital security expert atCyberHub-AMin Armenia, who in turn connected him with the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital threats against civil society and assisted WhatsApp in tracking hacking attempts made against the 90 people, allegedly using the spyware produced by Paragon. Seven of the alleged targets live in Italy.In a statement, Citizen Lab said it was continuing to investigate Yambio’s case.Any evidence that Yambio was targeted by spyware could have political reverberations for whoever was behind the alleged attack. The Rome statute, which established the ICC, is mandated to protect the safety and wellbeing of any witnesses and has the power to prosecute offences that obstruct witnesses.“I already had suspicions in September when my phone started to behave strangely,” he told the Guardian. “For examples, calls would just hang up, the phone would get warm or the battery would run out really quickly.”Spyware made by companies such as Paragon and NSO Group generally have access to multiple so-called vectors, or vulnerabilities that enable the spyware they make to infect a mobile phone. WhatsApp has previously been vulnerable to spyware made by both Paragon and NSO Group, but individuals can also be infected via SMS messages or other apps.Paragon has not commented on the cases that have emerged inItalybut has said it has “zero tolerance” for clients that violate its terms of service, which includes prohibitions on targeting journalists and activists.The office of the Italian prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, last week denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged Paragon breaches and has not responded to the claims that Paragon cancelled its contract with Italy.Yambio has described the Italy-Libya migrant pact, which involves Italy funding the Libyan coastguard to capture people in the Mediterranean and bring them back to the north African country, as “a death sentence”.“For three months, my life has been lived under constant threat: I do not know where it’s coming from, which government [is involved]. I live in Italy, I don’t live in any other country. So who should I hold accountable?”He added: “The people who have so far come out in public are in Italy, and [some] of these people are in my close circle. We are people working to stop human suffering, to try to make a change, and yet we are being targeted. I am very afraid because the information concerns not only me but the life of people who [have been victims of abuse in Libya] and also the life of my partner and my child.”Yambio is attending a press conference in the European parliament on Tuesday afternoon about the case involving Najim, also called Almasri, which has roiled Italian politics in recent weeks. The ICC said on Monday that it had officially asked Italy to explain why the country released Najim after his arrest in Turin instead of extraditing him to the Netherlands, where court is based.Najim was repatriated to Tripoli onboard an Italian military aircraft. Meloni, who isbeing investigated over the matter by prosecutors in Rome, said Najim was immediately repatriated because he posed a risk to national security.“We have not received any statement from the EU, from the European Commission, the European parliament or any member state on this case of an internationally wanted criminal who was smuggled away from justice,” said Yambio.Yambio, from South Sudan, received asylum in Italy in 2022 after escaping from Mitiga prison, a facility under Najim’s watch and condemned by human rights organisations for its arbitrary detention, torture and abuse of political dissidents, migrants and refugees. He later crossed the Mediterranean by boat.The pact between Italy and Libya, first signed in 2017 and renewed since, has long been condemned by humanitarian groups for pushing people back to detention camps where they face torture and other abuses.Explore more on these topicsItalyLibyaGiorgia MeloniWhatsAppHackingInternational criminal courtAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

This theory explains whyDarren LoucaidesIn just a few years, Kennedy and his dangerously popular ‘diagonalist’ politics have gone from the fringes of the web to, perhaps, the White HouseTue 11 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 11.14 ESTShare“Back at home in the United States, the newspapers are saying that I came here today to speak to about 5,000 Nazis,” Robert F Kennedy Jrtold a large crowd in Berlin. Estimated at 38,000 people, the crowd was a mix of hippies, anti-war types, Green party voters and anti-vaxxers, rubbing shoulders with a smattering of skinheads. It was late August 2020 and a group called Querdenken had rallied this motley crew together in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions.“Governments love pandemics,” Kennedy said. “They love pandemics for the same reason they love war – it gives them the ability to impose controls that the population would otherwise never accept.”Last month, in Senate confirmation hearings for his appointment as the US secretary of health and human services, Kennedy was questioned on having previously compared the Center for Disease Control’s work tothat of “Nazi death camps”, callingCovid-19 a bioweapongenetically engineered to target black and white people while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, and blaming school shootings on antidepressants. “He has made it his life’s work to sow doubt and discourage parents from getting their kids life-saving vaccines,”said the Democratic senator Ron Wyden. “It has been lucrative for him and put him on the verge of immense power.”Kennedy has gone from courting the conspiratorial fringes of the internet to the halls of the White House. He could be confirmed within days. With hindsight, the Berlin speech he gave five years ago was the moment a dangerous new political phenomenon went global. It’s called diagonalism.Coined by the political theorist William Callison and the historian Quinn Slobodian,diagonalism describesthe union of disparate groups across the political spectrum around a suspicion of all power being involved in conspiracy. Diagonal movements see big tech, big pharma, banks, climate science and traditional media as accomplices in totalitarianism, evidenced by Covid mandates through to innocuous intergovernmental proposals such as the “great reset” and15-minute cities.For diagonalists, the control of electoral processes by powerful interests means that governments are de facto illegitimate. And so they advocate for distributed power – not to empower any community, but the individual. By definition they are susceptible to far-right radicalisation. Callison and Slobodian trace their use of the term back to Querdenken – which roughly translates as “lateral thinkers” – the group that organised the Berlin rally addressed by Kennedy.RFK Jr’s claim about Black people’s immune systems is ‘unscientific and terrifying’Read moreKennedy recalled his uncle’s visit to the same city decades earlier, even repeating the historic line “Ich bin ein Berliner”. “And today again, Berlin is the frontline against global totalitarianism,” he said, before working through a bingo card of conspiracy theories. An extended “quote” Kennedy read from Hermann Göring’s testimony at the Nuremberg trials, including that “the only thing a government needs to make people into slaves is fear”, was copy and pasted across social media for months afterwards – even thoughthere is no recordof Göring saying those words.But Kennedy’s Berlin speech and the Querdenken rally itself were not merely notable for the controversy they caused. In drawing together veterans of anti-war and anti-globalist groups alongside health influencers, environmentalists and the far right, Querdenken became the blueprint for diagonal movements. Through its anti-power conspiratorial framing and the mirroring of methods used by decentralised grassroots movements, Querdenken was able to draw diagonal lines across pre-existing political allegiances, cultural divides and single issues, such as the climate or vaccines, to forge a mass coalition of support. Kennedy himself epitomises this new coalition – one that was nascent at the time, but is now at the heart of Trumpism.As a former environmental lawyer, Kennedy spoke witheloquence and passionin the past about corporations contaminating rivers and polluting the skies, the plight of asthma especially afflicting black people, and the existential threat of the climate crisis. In the Berlin speech, Kennedy mingled conspiracy theories with genuine concerns and anxieties held by the public. He said he saw “people who want leaders who are not going to lie to them, people who want leaders who will not make up arbitrary rules and regulations to orchestrate the obedience of the population. We want health officials who don’t have financial entanglements with the pharmaceutical industry, who are working for us and not big pharma.”In her bookDoppelganger, Naomi Kleinwrites powerfully on how diagonal movements and influencers often identify real issues that progressives had grown timid about – the sway of oligarchical wealth over politics, the rise of digital surveillance, the impact of rampant capitalism on our mental and physical health. But instead of articulating the actual causes or plausible solutions, they have constructed bogus metanarratives. Rather than increasingly antidemocratic billionaires, it was an organised cabal of global elites, unaccountable deep-state bureaucrats who secretly ran the world – or, at the furthest end, blood-sucking satanists, as QAnon followers believed. A mirrorworld had emerged. And it is demagogues such as Trump who have benefited.“Despite claims of post-partisanship, it is right-wing, often far-right, political parties around the world that have managed to absorb the unruly passions and energy of diagonalism,” says Klein, “folding its Covid-era grievances into preexisting projects opposing ‘wokeness’ and drumming up fears of migrant ‘invasions’. Still, it is important for these movements to present themselves (and to believe themselves to be) ruptures with politics-as-usual; to claim to be something new, beyond traditional left-right poles.”While the crowd that listened to Kennedy’s speech that day in 2020 was a heterogeneous mix, a few miles away, a mob of far-right activists and QAnon supporterstried to storm the Reichstag, home to Germany’s parliament, after one of their number falsely announced Trump was in Berlin to liberate the country. The violent scenes would be replicated in the more deadly assault on the Capitol on 6 January 2021. This was the extreme end of diagonalism exploding into life. (An investigation I led into Covid-sceptic groups found that by then, Querdenken and others hadbecome obsessed with Trump– and gravely radicalised.)IfRobert F Kennedy Jris confirmed to Trump’s cabinet, a once-staunch environmentalist and defender of women’s reproductive rights turned conspiracy theorist and super-spreader of health misinformation will dictate health policy in the US. Diagonalism has ascended to the pinnacle of global power. The mirrorworld is becoming our reality.Darren Loucaides is a writer based in Barcelona and LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He definitely has weird ideas about ‘making America healthy again’Arwa MahdawiThe supplement-loving anti-vaxxer could well be the US’s next health secretary. At least the wellness bros and woo-woo fans will be happyTue 11 Feb 2025 09.24 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 11.03 ESTShareRobert F Kennedy Jr is many things, but he is not a tropical fish. Someone should probably tell him this because he appears to be guzzling fish medicine.Last week, a videoof RFK sitting on a plane and putting a strange blue liquid into his glass of water went viral. It’s not clear what he was taking, but online sleuths are convinced it was methylene blue, which is used to treat parasites in fish as well as aquatic ailments such as swim bladder disease.To be fair, methylene blue does have human uses – in the US, it is FDA-approved to treat a rare blood disorder. Over thelast few years, however, it has been touted as a miracle drug in wellness circles and people have been using it off-label in the hopes of staving off everything from jet lag to ageing. “Looks like RFK Jr is in on one of the best-kept secrets in biohacking – methylene blue,”wrote oneprominent wellness influencer after the viral video. “When used correctly, it’s a gamechanger for mental clarity and longevity.”That’s a stretch. Whilesome studiesshow methylene bluemayhelp with those things, self-medicating is a bad idea. Too much of the stuff canturn your urine blue, for one thing. More importantly, it can interact with certain medications, which can have serious consequences.We don’t know for sure that it was methylene blue. But we do know that Kennedy, who is a prominent anti-vaxxer, has a lot of strange – and arguably very dangerous – ideas about medicine. These may stem from some of his own health problems, including one issuehe memorably said“was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died”. According to the New York Times, the worm may have actually been a “pork tapeworm larva”. Tapeworms aside, Kennedy’s wellness opinions would be entirely his business were it not for the fact that he isclosing inon the role of secretary of health and human services and is poised to inflict his ideas on the rest of us, all in the name of a movement he has termed “Make America Healthy Again” (Maha). Like every Maga movement, this one is being aggressively monetised: Kennedy hasapplied to trademark Mahafor use in marketing potential products including food supplements, vitamins and (oddly) vaccines.Some people are aghast at his ideas; others are ecstatic about the prospect of him upending the US’s approach to food and healthcare. There has been alotofcoverageabout the “crunchy moms” who are quite justifiably horrified about all the rubbish that is in processed foods and are thrilled by the Maha agenda.It’s interesting, however, to see just how much of the discourse around Maha seems to focus on woo-woo-women and their silly little wellness ideas, because – as Kennedy demonstrates – it’s men who are increasingly dominating the alternative health (if you’re being diplomatic) or pseudoscientific quackery (if you’re not) space. That’s partly because Silicon Valleyhas rebrandedbeing obsessed with your health as “biohacking”. Men who are into biohacking and longevity don’t casually take vitamin pills like the rest of us. No, no, they buildsupplementation protocolsand personalised “supplement stacks”. Supplementing appears to have become an extreme sport among a certain type of wellness bro: the more pills you swallow, the more macho you are. Bahram Akradi, the 63-year-old CEO of a gym chain, for example, recently said he’s been taking“about 45 to 50”pills every morning for years. Meanwhile,Bryan Johnson, the 47-year-old tech entrepreneur who is spending millions of dollars trying to de-age himself, takes more than 100 pills a day. According to one interview, he wakes up at 4.30am and takes 57 pills, does some ab stimulation,then takes 34 more.Spending a fortune on experimental pills, and not even the fun kind, is about as stupid as it sounds. I don’t know what Akradi has been taking, but for about five years Johnson was downing a pill called rapamycin that had been found to extend the lifespan of mice. But Johnson is not a mouse and he recently quit taking it because another study found it mightincrease ageing in humans. I think Alanis Morissette would call this ironic, don’t you think?Anyway, the upshot of all this is that the takeover of the US government by weirdos with dangerous ideas continues apace. Meanwhile, remember that you are not a mouse or a fish, and design your “supplementation protocol” accordingly.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrOpinionUS politicsAgeingHealthHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

At the time, Atwater was a junior member of the Reagan administration, but he would later go on torun George HW Bush’s presidential campaignin 1988 and then become chair of the Republican National Committee in 1989.In perhaps the most revealing, and most infamous, portion of the interview, the hard-charging Republican operative explained to Lamis how Republican politicians could mask their racism – and racist appeals to white voters – behind a series of euphemisms.You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘[N-word, N-word, N-word]’. By 1968 you can’t say ‘[N-word]’ – that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites … ‘We want to cut this,’ is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ‘[N-word, N-word]’.Got that? No need to utter the N-word out loud as there were plenty of other “abstract” ways to say it.Today, more than four decades later, DEI has become the new N-word; the new rightwing abstraction deployed byRepublicansto conceal their anti-Black racism. DEI – short for diversity, equity and inclusion – is thrown around by high-profile conservatives, from the president of the United States downwards, for the express purpose of undermining Black people in public life.No one is safe from Trump’s racist agenda | Bakari T SellersRead moreDon’t believe me? In arecent interviewon Fox News, the White House counselor and former Trump lawyer Alina Habba declared that the administration’s 27-year-old press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, “is overqualified, brilliant and was well-versed and ready … she didn’t need a thick binder ... unlike our last press secretary who was put in there for … DEI reasons”.For the record, the “last press secretary”, Karine Jean-Pierre, is the Black daughter of Haitian immigrants. Is she less qualified than her successor? Well, let’s compare résumés, shall we?Neither Habba herself, nor Leavitt, are Ivy League grads.Jean-Pierre is.Neither Habba herself, nor Leavitt, worked in two different administrations before securing their top White House positions.Jean-Pierre did.Neither Habba herself, nor Leavitt, has served on three different election-winning presidential campaigns across three different decades.Jean-Pierre has.So when Habba says Jean-Pierre was appointed White House press secretary for “DEI reasons”, what else could she be alluding to other than that she is a Black woman?When the Republican congressman Tim BurchettcalledKamala Harris – the then sitting vice-president, former senator and former attorney general of the country’s most populous state; a woman who would have entered the Oval Office with a longer record in elected office than Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump – a “DEI hire” within 24 hours of her becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, what else could he have been referring to other than that she is a Black woman?When a viral tweet (26m viewsand counting) from a popular far-right account (that is alsoamplifiedby Elon Musk) referred to Brandon Scott – the mayor of Baltimore who was elected with 70% of the vote and previously served eight years on the city council, including a stint as city council president – as the city’s “DEI mayor”, what else could it have been trying to point to other than that he is a Black man?DEIisthe new N-word. In fact, the Black podcaster Van Lathanarguesthat DEI is now “worse than the N-word” and has become “the worst slur in American history”. The term “DEI hire”, he explains, “is not just being used to undermine the qualifications, capability and readiness of Black people … DEI is placing the blame of all of society’s ills at the feet of these people.”Plane crash?Blame DEI. Wildfires in LA?Blame DEI. Bridge collapse?Blame DEI.DEI is a racist dogwhistle. BlameBlack peopleis the not so unsubtle message.You now cannot turn on the television or log on to social media without coming across a prominent conservative blathering on about the evils of DEI. Toquotethe loathsome Fox host Greg Gutfeld, DEI “can be used to explain everything … except, unlike racism and climate change, which the left found under every rock, every issue, DEI is, indeed, under every rock because the Democrats put it there.”This isn’t a good-faith critique of diversity programs or policies – whether they actuallywork or not; whether theyrestrict free speech; whether they are corporatebox-ticking exercises. No, this is the weaponization of a three-letter term to denigrate Black people and pretend the political and economic advancement of minority communities over the past 60 years was a mistake. (“If I see a Black pilot, I’m gonna be like, ‘Boy, I hope he is qualified,” the rightwing activist and top Trump ally Charlie Kirkcasually remarkedlast year.)So why on earth is our “liberal” media credulously giving Republicans the benefit of the doubt on this? Treating their obsession with DEI as anything other than what it is? Anti-Black racism. The new N-word. A three-letter slur that seeks to, once again, mainstream bigotry and discrimination in the United States. (“DEI halftime show,”tweetedthe far-right influencer Jack Posobiec during the Super Bowl on Sunday night.)For years, Donald Trump has been plagued by allegations that he used the N-word while filming The Apprentice. In 2024, a former producer on the NBC reality showclaimedTrump used the racial epithet in 2004 to describe Kwame Jackson, a Black finalist on the first season of The Apprentice. In 2018, the former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newmanclaimedin her book Unhinged that Trump was caught on tape during the making of The Apprentice saying the N-word “multiple times”, according to three of her sources.At the time, Trump vociferouslydeniedthat he had ever used the N-word: “I don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have.”But the awful truth is that, these days, he doesn’t even need to have such a word in his vocabulary. He and his acolytes have another, more insidious one that serves a similar racist purpose: DEI.Mehdi Hasan is the CEO and editor-in-chief of the new media companyZeteoExplore more on these topicsRaceOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

Events of the week suggest that he doesn’t seem to, either.It’s a historical detail relevant to note in the wake ofLabor’s landmark half-billion-dollar commitment to women’s healthcare, announced on 7 February.In this policy arena, as in others, historical accuracy in the stories political movements like to share about themselves can be somewhat slippery.In an information environment where our physical brains are struggling not merely to discern disinformation but to remember things we already know, the tangible political record on women’s healthcare may be worth revisiting.Labor’s health package is big, and visibly practical. New contraceptive pills will be listed on the PBS for the first time in 30 years. There’ll be bulk-billing for the insertion and removal of long-term contraceptives (like IUDs and implants). There’ll be funding for women’s health skills training, which will include specialist training for treating perimenopause and menopausal health. Pelvic pain and endometriosis clinic networks will be expanded – and hormone therapies for menopause will also get PBS listing. Contraceptives and treatments for uncomplicated UTIs will be made available from pharmacies in a national trial.How much does the gender health gap cost? For Alyse, it’s $400,000Read moreThe aim is to make treatment for common health issues uncomplicated, informed, accessible and affordable. The new cost regime for menopausal therapies alone is expected to lower costs for 150,000 women a year, by between $290 to $577, and remove an economic disincentive to pursuing expert care.The package has been received with overwhelming, broad-based applause from women. The Australian Medical Association called it “a significant step forward for women’s health”.This is no doubt why Dutton’s Liberal confrere Anne Ruston pumped out animmediate press releasepledging to support the package and claiming it was “an expansion of the historic work undertaken by the former Coalition government in supporting women’s health”.Whirr! Let’s get in the time machine and check, shall we? First destination, 2020!In what was then the Scott Morrison iteration of the nine-year Abbott-Turbull-Morrison Liberal-National government – one in which Peter Dutton was a senior cabinet minister throughout – a pledge was made by theCoalitionto renew the National Women’s Health Strategy.How awesome they finally decided to continue a policy initiative begun byLabor’s Bob Hawke(in 1989) and restarted by Julia Gillard in theRudd Labor government(2010).Fair play to the Liberals’ Greg Hunt, who as health minister in 2021 earmarked $354m for various women’s health initiatives. It’s a shame that the government of which he was a part had already cutbillions of dollars in planned health paymentsto the states andover a billion dollarsfor preventative health programs and research. Women somewhat rely on those services.The health minister responsible for some of those cuts was Peter Dutton, by the way. Historic work indeed.But let’s fast forward to 2022, when in the dying days of Morrison’s government the Coalition pledged an additional$58m to a $22.5mthey’d committed to endometriosis treatment back in 2018.How many of the pledged clinics were under construction by the time they lost government? Thatwould be zero. It’s Labor who’s built 22 of them since coming to government three years ago.Dutton was somewhat quiet on women’s healthcare. He did authorise apamphlet about breast cancer. He also opened a specialist clinic –for men.Information overloadfragments the memory and shortens attention span. Disinformation creates or reinforcesfalse memories.Digital amnesiaafflicts those who don’t retain information that they know they can easily look up online.With an election facing Australians in a couple of months, there is one piece information worth writing down somewhere so it stays remembered.Maintain accurate records of medical history.Forgetting it can endanger your health.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsWomen's healthOpinionPeter DuttonWomenHealthMedicare AustraliaEndometriosisGPscommentShareReuse this content"

He has a few health problems, none compromising his physical fitness, but the family has begun noticing some inattention and forgetfulness. He jokes that his “hearing issue” is that people drive him mad and he just wants to read quietly.As we talk, I warm to the duo – the former factory-worker father comforted by the presence of the scientist son who has questions I wish everyone asked.Oncologists are taught to ask themselves at every juncture, “Is there a clinical trial for my patient?” Awareness campaigns and advocacy groups have prompted more patients to ask the same question.Trials are an opportunity for patients to benefit from promising treatments that are not yet standard care. While the overall possibility of successfor a drug to go from the earliest trial phase to market approval is a low 3%, the figure rises to a healthier 24% if the drug makes it to a late-trial stage. Patients enrolled in well-run clinical trials may have improved outcomes, helped by greater adherence to guidelines and protocols. Along the way, researchers discover valuable evidence and serendipitous findings to improve care for everyone else not on a trial.I worked as a triple zero call-taker for six months. It hardened my heart and changed my view of humanity | Bunny BanyaiRead moreFor all these reasons, I want to say an enthusiastic yes to my patient’s son. But, being a scientist, he has some considered questions.How many elderly people take part in clinical trials? In other words, are clinical trials a young person’s game?Are there differences in outcomes and tolerability between white and non-white patients? His father is Asian and, anecdotally, their relatives had had especially poor experiences on chemotherapy.And, most importantly, what does the quality-of-life data show? At his age, the father is less focused on survival than avoiding disabling toxicities that would threaten his independence.To these excellent questions, my answer is a paltry, “We don’t know.”It feels like an “emperor has no clothes” situation: while avowing the importance of clinical trials, the most basic inquiries have left my profession exposed.For a start, there is this flat admission from the Australian government:The number and proportion of adult cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials is currently not known in Australia. As a result, an understanding of unwarranted variation in clinical trial participation between population groups is also not known.In one Australian state, just 5% of adult cancer patientswere enrolled in a clinical trial, with 83% of participants based in a major city. This is broadly consistent with global figures.Globally, more than half of cancer patients are over 65 but many trials either have an age limit or effectively exclude elderly people due to a previous cancer diagnosis or other common conditions.The few elders who meet the inclusion criteria are the“rock stars of older adults”who are healthy enough to meet the criteria for enrolment.By these exacting standards,more than half of Australian adults with lung cancer would be ineligible for a trial.Companies that spend big bringing a drug to market don’t want to cruel their chances of approval based on unacceptable side-effects, which are worse in those with reduced physiological reserve. These people are typically, though not always, over 65. But excluding “regular” people from trials does us a huge disservice because, once a drug is approved, it is prescribed to just such patients. They might have concomitant conditions, take multiple medications, be cognitively impaired, have mental illness or lack social supports. Treated by “trial criteria”, they rapidly become the patients who languish in hospital, lose their precious independence, and regret having said yes to treatment. When they suffer, society loses.We can’t urge cancer patients to enter clinical trials only to make the task herculean.Quality-of-life data is paramount for shared decision-making. Any prospective trial patient deserves to know: how did the other trial patients feel? Did they sleep well? What happened to their social life? Could they keep working? How did their family cope?Still, inone analysis of phase 3 clinical trials(the kind that lead to regulatory approval), 47% did not even bother to study quality of life and, of the ones that did, almost 40% didn’t care to report it. Astoundingly, researchers saw fit to not publish quality-of-life data for up to eight years after the trial closed.There’s a new outbreak of bird flu in Australia. Here’s what you need to knowRead moreThis practice is ethically dishonest, not to mention disrespectful of trial patients who arm scientific progress without necessarily deriving personal gain.When clinical trial meets real world, there is much room for lament but it need not be so.Australian regulators can reinforce the place of “regular” patients in clinical trials. Drug companies should be required to study and submit quality-of-life measures as a condition of approval. In a country where 30% of the population was born overseas, data on ethnic differences in treatment tolerability is not merely desirable but essential.My patient’s son is uneasy with the lack of answers to his most important questions. To add to his hesitation, I can neither promise the availability of an interpreter nor medical transport if the son could not take time off for the frequent appointments.For this patient, the barriers to a clinical trial are too many so he declines it. He is not alone.If one measure of high-quality cancer care is clinical trial participation, our work has just begun.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Why can’t they just stop?Katy BallsThe encrypted messaging service is popular for work and play. But as Andrew Gwynne and many others have discovered: beware the leaksTue 11 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 09.27 ESTShareThere’s a familiar pattern in Westminster these days. An MP writes in haste a message to colleagues on WhatsApp. The contents leak to the press. Then there’s embarrassment, a public ticking off or – if really bad – the sack. The Labour MP Andrew Gwynne is the latest to experience this. Keir Starmer’s health minister was sacked and had the whip suspended after the Mail on Sundayrevealed a secret WhatsApp groupby the name of “Trigger me Timbers”.In messages published by the Mail, Gwynne is alleged to have penned a “joke” reply to a 72-year-old-constituent that read: “Dear resident, Fuck your bins. I’m re-elected and without your vote. Screw you. PS: Hopefully you’ll have croaked it by the all-outs.” There’s more too – with Gwynne accused of making sexist comments about the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and racist comments about the Labour veteran Diane Abbott. Naturally, others in the group are now also under suspicion. Despite a hasty apology from the 29-year-old 2024 intaker Oliver Ryan for “not speaking out at the time”, the Labour MP for Burnley has had the whip suspended after the party’s investigation. “How stupid can you get?” asks a member of the new intake.While Gwynne’s comments are on the more extreme end of misjudged WhatsApp comments, he is just the latest politico to have their words on the encrypted messaging platform catch up with them. Mark Twain is believed to have said thattwo people can keep a shared secret if one of them is dead. Yet today’s politicians happily share their private – sometimes dark – thoughts with hundreds of colleagues at any one time.Health minister Andrew Gwynne sacked over offensive WhatsApp commentsRead moreThe Gwynne scandal presents two immediate problems to No 10. First, it’s a distraction in the week that was meant to see Keir Starmer finally take the fight on immigration to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. Second, after a tricky start to government, it’s more grist to the mill to the theory that despite Starmer’s promise to clean up politics while in opposition, this Labour government isn’t so different to the Tory sleaze that dominated the Conservatives’ final years.It won’t be of much comfort to Starmer in No 10, but the problem ofWhatsAppin Westminster is a cross-party issue. Over the past 10 years, the WhatsApp group has grown in influence and changed how Westminster works – not always for the better.Speak to a member of David Cameron’s No 10 and they will offer various reasons as to why that period of Tory government was relatively calm compared with what followed under his successors. Putting the challenges of delivering Brexit to one side, they will say there was another key difference: the dominance of WhatsApp in Westminster. While there was the odd WhatsApp group in the Cameron years (one by his inner circle called “Team Victory”), most communication was done by email or text.“We didn’t know how lucky we were,” says a former minister. Then it started to change. “Twitter allowed us to be fools in public,” says another. “Then WhatsApp allowed us to be fools in private, or so we thought – but actually that’s public too.” This is the crux of the issue: despite all the evidence to the contrary, MPs still take the view that they can say things on WhatsApp that they wouldn’t dare utter in a speech, type in an email or probably say in a pub.Yet over the past few years, messaging service has usurped all of the above as the preferred method of communication for many politicos. As was evidenced in the Covid inquiry, the pandemic saw the creation of“government by WhatsApp” with various processes ditched on the grounds that quick decisions were made.In that time, there have been plenty of embarrassing WhatsApp conversations coming to light. The former cabinet secretary Simon Case described the then prime minister Boris Johnson’s wife Carrie as“the real person in charge”. During his time in No 10, Dominic Cummings described the cabinet as“useless fuckpigs”. During the coup against Johnson in 2021, Nadine Dorries was kicked out after calling on MPs to show “a bit of loyalty” to her former boss. Labour have had their problems too – the effort to oust Jeremy Corbyn began from an innocent sounding WhatsApp group titled“Birthday Club”, which eventually led to a break away group that went on to form Change UK. “It allows for plotting at any time of day; you don’t even need to go out,” notes a former government whip.View image in fullscreenDominic Cummings, former chief adviser to Boris Johnson, in May 2020.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAEach political tribe tends to have a WhatsApp group to organise. For the whips’s office it’s a logistical nightmare. It also feeds a sense of factionalism – with individuals often preaching to the choir. Even now, new Labour MPs are forming their own tribes. The group that winds up remaining Tory MPs is the “Conservative 2019 WhatsApp group” where many of the former MPs who lost their seats last year still merrily type away their regrets and frustrations. One member said: “Not a day goes by when I don’t think, ‘What I am reading. Oh god I would not have said that,’ or ‘What a shame life has not moved on for these people – they still think they are MPs.’”The biggest problem is the attitude to WhatsApp. MPs – like so many people in the country – say things there that they would never consider saying in a speech, in an email or even during a conversation at work. “There’s a certain thrill from it,” admits a Labour MP. “Getting a response when you make a witty aside.”Many take the fact that they are technically encrypted as carte blanche to say whatever springs to mind at any moment in time. But the opposite is true. “If you want a message out, you should not tweet but put it on an MP WhatsApp group,” says one Labour MP. So true; which journalist doesn’t get excited about the idea of an exclusive?There is risk limitation. These days most MPs and politicos have disappearing messages on – some senior figures in both parties are known to have a 24-hour limit. However, even if the message disappears within hours it doesn’t really matter if it’s gone to more than a handful of people.Gwynne has discovered this the hard way.

When Maggie Met Larry is on Radio 4 at 3pm on 15 February and on BBC SoundsTue 11 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 12.40 ESTShareIf Jim Callaghan and Ted Heath had one thing in common, it was a stodginess that characterised political leaders of the 70s: baggy suits, sweaty faces, leaden delivery. When she succeeded Heath as leader of the Conservative party 50 years ago, and found herself facing Callaghan across the dispatch box,Margaret Thatcherdecided she wanted to truly embrace the TV age.That was how she came to begiven“presentation lessons” by no less an actor than Laurence Olivier, who subsequently arranged for her to receive voice coaching from Catherine Fleming, the woman who helped him perfect the basso profundo he needed to play Othello in a celebrated National Theatre production. The influence Olivier had on Thatcher was profound, and it affected the business of politics in this country.The Thatcher that first walked into Olivier’s London home – shrill, dowdy, unprepossessing – could not have been in greater contrast to the Thatcher who was to emerge from his tutelage: a figure of almost Boudicca-like grandeur and bearing, and in terms of the hair, makeup, outfits and projection, unmistakably theatrical.In my playWhen Maggie Met Larry, I imagine how Olivier set about the transformation and throw the spotlight on a collaboration that has, until recently, been a closely guarded secret. Thatcher and Olivier never spoke publicly about it – neither accords the other a mention in their memoirs – and it was only towards the end of his life that Lord Tim Bell, one of Thatcher’s image gurus, confirmed that the two larger than life characters had met.Olivier would have considered it infra dig to bill Thatcher for his counsel, but the NationalTheatrestill holds invoices that Fleming submitted to the Conservative party for the services she had rendered to the future prime minister. There is affectionate correspondence, too, between her and Gordon Reece, the former TV executive who was also in Thatcher’s retinue. One is topped and tailed “My dear Kate” and “Love, Gordon”.Derek Jacobi , himself a protege of Olivier, plays him in When Maggie Met Larry, and was among a small circle who knew about the meetings. Of course they had to be kept secret at the time – the Tory party initially denied they had taken place – because they struck at the heart of Thatcher’s image as an ordinary “housewife”.In the play, Thatcher admits she feels uncomfortable about having to take lessons from Olivier – and I suspect this was the case – as she would have remembered a time when politics wasn’t about performance but policies; when newspapers would reproduce important politicians’ speeches in full and all that mattered was intellectual rigour.Still, the real Thatcher pragmatically gathered around her individuals who knew all about performance. Bell was a consummate image-maker and Reece had worked on ITN’s News at Ten and produced religious programmes and chatshows. Her conference organiser, Harvey Thomas, formerly choreographed prime-time rallies for the US evangelist Billy Graham. Her speechwriter, Ronald Millar, was an actor turned playwright who’d had one of his plays, Waiting for Gillian, performed by Olivier’s production company.Political leaders had in the past either been victims of the cameras – Alec Douglas-Home, the short-lived Tory prime minister of the 60s, was said to look like a skeleton under the unforgiving studio lights – or come, after some application, to triumph over them, most notably Winston Churchill. It’s telling that he also kept company with Olivier – a lifelong, if discreet, Conservative – and sometimes even appeared to be competing with him. Olivier, in his memoirs, recalls how, as he was playing Richard III on stage, he could hear Churchill in the stalls quietly saying the words in unison with him.In the general election of 1979, Callaghan was slow to appreciate how Thatcher’s training had changed her. On TV, the Labour leader was as awkward and ill at ease as ever, whereas Thatcher – all of a sudden commanding and immaculately groomed, made-up and costumed – had become a ruthless scene-stealer who knew how to deliver the lines that Millar had written to maximum effect.‘She would have been in awe of him’: how Laurence Olivier gave Margaret Thatcher private seduction lessonsRead moreUnder Thomas, her conferences and political gatherings became TV spectaculars with her as the star turn. A journalist from the Glasgow Herald saw in one London rally the “razzmatazz of an American presidential-stye jamboree” and stated “nothing quite like it has been seen before in a general election”.The only critics who concerned Thatcher were at the ballot box, and they gave her what amounted to a rave review. The 5.2% swing she achieved in that election was the largest since 1945. A range of factors, of course, contributed to the result – not least the dire state of the economy and that the country was in the mood for change – but it helped enormously that Thatcher had begun to look and sound like a leader.What Olivier had begun with Thatcher reached its apogee not long afterwards in the US, when the professional actor Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency. Labour, under its new leader, Neil Kinnock, had no alternative but to focus on its own act, and its “red rose” revamp ensued with Hugh Hudson – the director of Chariots of Fire – brought in to direct the famously slick Kinnock: The Movie campaign ad.Olivier can’t be blamed for what’s happened to our politics – he was simply equipping Thatcher with the tools to handle an inexorable process that had begun with the advent of TV. But he understood that, so far as millions of viewers were concerned, Downing Street was starting to seem like just another road off Coronation Street, and both the long-running soaps required capable actors.Not all the prime ministers who succeeded Thatcher entirely got that message, but it’s striking that the ones who were most oblivious to it – most recently Gordon Brown, Theresa May and Rishi Sunak, all throwbacks to that early 70s stodginess – struggled with their personal popularity ratings.For all the best efforts of Leonie Mellinger, the former Royal Shakespeare Company actress that Keir Starmer has turned to for voice training, there’s still a unmistakable stodginess about him too. And that does not perhaps augur well.Tim Walker is a writer and broadcaster whose debut play Bloody Difficult Women was performed in London and Edinburgh in 2022.

Labour ministers, it seemsPolly ToynbeeA bill that would ban the creation of these images without consent was watered down by the government. This is where timidity gets youTue 11 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 05.49 ESTShareAt an away day last week, Keir Starmer told his cabinet that they must become “disruptorsif you don’t want to be disrupted”. Yet timidity, caution and hesitation have damaged too many of Labour’s bold policies. Will Starmer’s new message percolate through to the cabinet – and to their junior ministers, civil servants and official lawyers? This week, one policy decision that went largely unnoticed suggests his party is still far from embracing disruption.Tens of thousands of deepfake porn images areproduced every week, many of celebrities, mostly of ordinary women. These obscene AI-generated images have the power to destroy lives, roaming the internet for ever. They can be sent to friends, family, children, school friends, present or future employers. Those who create these poisonous pictures often turn out to be close friends, or people seeking revenge. Nobody thinks this is OK. Indeed, sharing deepfake porn became a criminal offence in the 2023 Online Safety Act.But a loophole means it’s not an offence tocreatedeepfake porn, only to share it. The Tory peer Charlotte Owen, a longtime campaigner on the issue, introduced a private member’s bill in the Lords last year that wouldban people from creatingsexually explicit photographs, films or digitally produced images without consent. The bill is urgently needed, since the existence of such images allows perpetrators to blackmail, intimidate and terrify their victims. But in our tribal political system, private members’ bills never succeed without government say-so, no matter how reasonable those bills may be.The government instead promised to include the provisions of Lady Owen’s bill in thedata billdebated in the Lords last week. But it was watered down in crucial ways. The only penalty for creating a deepfake porn image would be a fine, with no possibility of prison, however many times the offence was repeated, however dreadful it may be. A storm erupted: a host of angry Labour peers spoke out against the Ministry of Justice under-secretary Frederick Ponsonby. When he refused to relent, they abstained very publicly; peers such as Helena Kennedy, Ayesha Hazarika, Jan Royall and Jim Knight remained on the red benches during the vote. Many others stayed away. As a result, the government suffered astonking loss.The bill moves into the Commons this Wednesday: will the government reconsider, or, as some fear, water it down even more? The reasons for this remain entirely mysterious. There is no lobby pushing for the rights of deepfake porn-makers. Lady Kennedy led theLabour challengein the Lords last week, and told themabout a woman whose deepfake pictures were sent around her child’s school. The KC and crossbench peer David Pannick said courts should have “the option of imposing a sentence of imprisonment”. Elizabeth Butler-Sloss said a fine is no deterrent to a company or person “inordinately rich” nor to “someone extremely poor” who doesn’t have the money to pay it. For those rightly wanting fewer people imprisoned, this would be a tiny number, but a vital deterrent. However, Lord Ponsonby just reaffirmed: “We think it more appropriate this should be a fine-only offence.”The Guardian view on violence against women: put victims and survivors first | EditorialRead moreThe other key change the government tried to make was even more bizarre. It added the provision of a defence of “reasonable excuse”. But no one, including Ponsonby himself, could actually think of any valid “reasonable excuse” for making an obscene image without someone’s consent. The government lost overwhelmingly and deservedly on both points. The hapless minister, by all accounts a decent man, was a lamb to the slaughter. Goodness knows what he actually thought he was defending, but ifLabourare now to be the “disruptors”, every MP, peer and especially every minister should be arguing ahead of debates that they should not be forced to defend the indefensible.Who drafted the government position? Perhaps civil servants, or lawyers claiming improbably that “reasonable excuse” was needed to conform to the European convention of human rights, on freedom of expression.Will justice ministers, whips or anyone sensible step in and restore the provisions of Owen’s original bill? I tried in vain to get a reply from Jess Phillips, parliamentary under-secretary of state for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, but received no reply from her office. The Ministry of Justice tells me the line has not changed (yet).Much that happens in parliament never reaches the public. But this episode is an apt example of a cautious state of mind that has damaged Labour throughout its first months. The party has too often softened its commitment to vital policies that all Labour members support. It is too prone to risk-averse officialdom. If Labour is now seen to backtrack on the whole thing, this will only help undermine the public’s trust in its politics, and its radicalism. With terrible choices ahead in the spending review, Labour should be shoring up its position on everything it can right now – with no vacillating, pressing full steam ahead on disruption.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The medical establishment, populated as it is with hopeless dinosaurs, hasn’t yet absorbed its full significance, and you won’t find it on the NHS, or through mainstream providers in the United States or Europe. But quietly, almost magically, it is already changing lives.View image in fullscreenLucca’s World with (l-r) Danish Hussain as Dr Kumar, Juan Pablo Medina as Andrés, Bárbara Mori as Bárbara and Julián Aguilar Tello as Lucca.Photograph: Maria Medina/NetflixThe device that provides this treatment, the Cytotron, is the subject of the Mexican movie Lucca’s World, the No 1 non-English-language film on the world’s biggest streaming platform last week. It follows one family – led by a remarkable mother, Bárbara Anderson, on whose memoir the movie is based – as they turn every stone in pursuit of a better life for their little boy. And as soon as Anderson learns about the Cytotron, there is very little room for doubt about its remarkable properties. By “stimulating the damaged brain cells in order for them to become more active and create new connections”, the device can apparentlyrestore the functions that have been destroyed by Lucca’s severe cerebral palsy. “The Cytotron will mark a before and after in the history of medicine,” we learn. It’s “scientifically supported”. Yes, it’s eye-wateringly expensive – $50,000 for a single course of treatment in the movie– but that’s because it’s unprecedented.An old-school doctor in the filmobjects that the inventors of the device – basically a pimped-out MRI machine that directs radio waves at the patient – would “already have the Nobel prize for medicine” if their claims stacked up. He quickly realises that he is hopelessly wrong. After the machine works its magic, Lucca takes some hesitant supported steps, and says “mama”; a postscript tells us that he has “started walking and talking”. The viewer is left with the same lesson as Anderson: failing to pursue such a prospect is “surrender”, or “giving up”. The only worthwhile imperative is in the promise she makes her son: “I promise I won’t rest until you get better.”As parents of a toddler with cerebral palsy, we understand that resolution better than most. In the year and a half since our son suffered a significant brain injury after he stopped breathing in his sleep, we have read countless research papers, consulted every expert who will talk to us and paid through the nose for treatments whose efficacy we will never know definitively.Disabled people aren’t here to inspire you | Charlie SwinbourneRead moreThe parts of the movie that deal with that desperate search will be instantly recognisable to any family in the same boat. So, too, is the depiction of how alarming it is to find that the science is much more ambiguous than you would hope, that the most rigorous specialists in the field will tell you that this is more often a world of “worth trying” than “definitely do”. Through all of this, we have also learned that if you aren’t your child’s most reliable advocate, you can’t expect anyone else to be.But another lesson we have learned is the crucial importance of keeping a foot in the reality-based community. The more we watched Lucca’s World, and the more we read, the more astonished we were that Netflix would release this movie, and spread its fantastical message to many millions of viewers. While the film begins with a disclaimer saying that some scenes have been altered for dramatic purposes, the average viewer would surely expect a film based on a true story to have at least a passing relationship to the truth; and the truth is that for the vast majority of parents who long for something similar for their own children, Lucca’s World is an unattainable one.In publicity for the film, Andersontold Infobae Mexico: “I never recommend … nor promote [the treatment]. I only describe the journey of taking an experimental treatment that, in the case of my son, worked.” You can decide for yourself how that statement squares with the movie’s postscript, which tells us that “Bárbara, Andrés and a group of investors bought two Cytotrons and opened the first clinic outside India”. One of these deviceswas provided to theFederico Gómez Children’s Hospital of Mexico, which briefly ran a study into the Cytotron’s use. Last week, the hospitalsaid thatthe study was discontinued after a year because of a lack of progress.If you are looking for the vaunted “scientific support” for the Cytotron, you might look at a rival enterprise in Mexico, Neurocytonix, which markets the device as the Neurocytotron. They conductedthe only visible studyon its efficacy as a treatment for cerebral palsy, completed in 2021. Neurocytonix has used the completion of this “gold standard” randomised clinical trialin marketing communications. But almost four years after the study’s completion, the results still have not been published. A generous description of that hiatus would be “highly unusual”. The experts who have helped us with our own son’s care have a pithier description. Last week, the Mexican Society of Pediatric Neurologyissued a statementwarning that no clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the Cytotron.When we asked Neurocytonix for comment, they distanced themselves from the film and told us that a second phase of the study was completed last year, saying that “multiple manuscripts are in preparation for publication” without addressing why it has taken so long. They emphasised that the treatment remains unproven, and said that Bárbara Anderson’s lack of scientific training “may have led to misinterpretations of scientific evidence”. (Netflix declined to comment.)As for another of the movie’s heroes, Rajah Vijay Kumar, the Indian doctor and serial inventor who came up with the Cytotron: he previously drew attention when he launched Shycocan, an electron-producing device which claimed to stop the spread of coronavirus in closed spaces “by photon mediation”. That was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),it was reported.But it wasn’t, andmanyreputablescientists say that it has never been backed up by evidence.Then there’s Lucca himself. The film is a dramatisation, and we don’t know exactly what his life post-treatment looks like. But we can say this: the actor in the movie “walked” with the soles of his feet squarely on the ground, not something that Luccaappears able to doin videos of him using a supportive device on his mother’s Instagram feed. Lovely though those moments are – we’ve had them ourselves – credible physiotherapists do not see themas a reliable predictorof functional walking in children with severe cerebral palsy.And several years after he said “mama” on his own,a recent updateshows Lucca undergoing treatment where a speech therapist opens and closes his mouth to form consonants on his behalf.If Lucca has seen any benefits, that’s wonderful. But there is no available scientific evidence that they are replicable for anyone else. Nonetheless, parents are flocking to Neurocytonix, and trying to come up with tens of thousands of dollars for a “research donation” that the company asks for, since it would be illegal to charge for a treatment not approved by Mexico’s medical regulators:the page after pageof Google results for “gofundme neurocytonix” are a portrait of undaunted hope. For everyone else, the Netflix movie provides,as one reviewer says, a “feelgood note to end on”. A better phrase for this is “inspiration porn”: the designation of disabled lives as a handy pick-me-up when you’ve got a case of the Mondays, to be quietly set aside if the messier truth threatens to intervene.Above all: Lucca’s World perpetuates the idea that children like our son are broken and must be repaired, rather than whole people who deserve every chance to live full and happy lives. It divides parents into those who make their children better, and those who surrender. It tells its audience that stories like Lucca’s have a simple, happy ending. But these stories don’t conclude with a bow around them. They are much more complicated and beautiful than that.That isn’t how Lucca’s World sees the little boy without whom it would not exist, though. The very last shot Netflix gives us is of the real Lucca, smiling at the camera, perfectly himself.

His blunder gives the centre-left a chance in the 23 February electionTue 11 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 09.40 ESTShareThere are moments in every election campaign when the fate of a key protagonist takes a decisive turn, often after an unforced error. There was Rishi Sunak’soverly hasty returnfrom D-day commemorations in France for a TV interview, and, in Germany, Armin Laschet’sunfortunate laughterduring a 2021 visit to a flooded town that marked the beginning of the end for the then Christian Democratic Union (CDU) frontrunner.The current CDU leader, Friedrich Merz, who is thepolls’ favouriteto become the next chancellor after Germany’s general election on 23 February, may have had his moment of truth when his proposed crackdown on asylum seekers wasnarrowly passedby the Bundestag with the full support of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).The vote, on 29 January, was a first-time event in the post-second world war era in what has, until now, been a no-go area for Germany’s political centre. Mainstream parties have maintained a longstanding vow not to collaborate with the radical right.Whether the breach of this principle puts Germany on track for a far-right government in the future remains to be seen. But it certainly turns up the heat in the campaign. And for the centre-left, it presents an opportunity for a bounce-back if it quickly moves its attention from simply despising the enemies of democracy to what people want it to do: build a future-proof economy in which they have more money in their pockets. But it’s a mountain to climb.The scale of Merz’s strategic mistake was not immediately obvious to conservative members of the German parliament. The damage they had inflicted on the party, the campaign and possibly the country perhaps only became clear to them when the result of the fraught migration vote was greeted with cheers, smiles and selfies by the AfD.The context is that in response to ahorrific knife attackin a park in Bavaria, in which the suspected perpetrator was an asylum seeker, Merz had lost his nerve, acting more like Donald Trump on his first day in office than a chancellor in waiting. Most importantly, he broke apublic pledgehe had made as recently as November not to put forward any motion for which there was no agreement with the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Greens (and which might draw the support of the AfD). By doingexactly the opposite, Merz handed a gift to the far right and damaged his own credibility. He will have to pay the price of this miscalculation when trying to form a stable coalition after the election.Recent polling byForschungsgruppe Wahlensuggests Merz’s political gamble has not boosted support for the CDU. The party was quick to close ranks and unite behind its leader at a party conference last week, despite some internal criticism and the former CDU leader Angela Merkel’s officialstatementrebuking her eventual successor for his actions.The conservatives are a power-seeking machine in the end and are desperate to make electoral gains this time round. But the overall support for the AfD has stabilised at 20% of the vote share, which would make it the second-largest political party in parliament after the CDU. This confirms the theory about centristscopying the populist right: on tougher migration measures, voters generally prefer the original to the copy.At about 15%, public support for Olaf Scholz’s SPD and the Greens has been low ever since the election was called in December. This is no surprise. On the issues that voterscare most about– peace and security, the economy, social security, refugees and the climate crisis – their offer is more of the same. Continued support for Ukraine, higher public investment to drive economic growth, stable pensions, rent ceilings and European solutions to migration.View image in fullscreenA slogan reading \"Where is the firewall?\" (\"Wo ist die Brandmauer?\") on an election campaign poster for CDU party leader and top candidate for chancellor Friedrich Merz, in Lueneburg, Germany February 8, 2025. REUTERS/Thilo SchmuelgenPhotograph: Thilo Schmülgen/ReutersAfter the controversial Bundestag migration vote, both parties were quick to condemn Merz and mobilise party members and civil society to rally against the enemies of democracy. Tens of thousands havetaken to the streetssince Merz’s bill passed to protest against the CDU and AfD. This is important to boost the morale of campaigners and to stay firm on the firewall against the far right. But it has its limits in terms of winning over voters, as the campaigns by the Austrian Social Democrats and Kamala Harris in the USshowedin 2024. There, “protecting democracy” was seen as equivalent to protecting the status quo, when people cared more about how to pay their rent.This is a more general challenge that the centre-left faces in western democracies. It is often seen as protecting the status quo rather than challenging it. The German centre-left is missing a forward-looking narrative on what the future may hold for society and the economy. Going after the enemies of democracy will only add to the sense that we have entered an age of anxiety. Successful election campaigns are never won by looking back, but always by looking to the future.So the centre-left swiftly needs to turn the dial. In government, the SPD and the Greens have made significant progress with the energy transition over the past three years. Renewablesmake up 55%of German energy production now, a record high, which will bring down costs for consumers and businesses as well as strengthening Germany’s weakening industrial base. Yet decades of underinvestment in infrastructure, buildings, IT and industrial equipment has hobbled the German economy.One side of solving the investment gap is increasing public spending. An unpublished survey commissioned by Das Progressive Zentrum, a Berlin-based thinktank, that was conducted by Ipsos in January, found overwhelming support for a more active and purpose-driven public sector. Three out of four people support reform of Germany’s constitutionalSchuldenbremse, or “debt brake”, which limits public borrowing, and almost every second person is in favour of an ambitious climate policy.For the centre-left, these findings offer hope: voters can be won over if it is credibly demonstrated that public investment, rather than scaremongering about immigration, will alleviate the everyday struggles caused by inflation and lack of opportunity.Florian Ranft is a member of the management board at Das Progressive Zentrum, a thinktank based in BerlinExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionEuropeAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

There’s less theatre, but the results could prove harder to contest. Absurd? Consider the evidence.Take the government’sbrutal expulsionof the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, Marcus Bokkerink. His crime, it seems, was to take his role seriously,seeking to preventthe formation of corporate monopolies. He has been replaced with the former manager of Amazon UK, a company widely accused ofmonopolistic practices. This is pure Trump: kick out the regulator and insert someone from a company they were seeking to regulate.Or take the culture war against public protections launched last month by Keir Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who variously described them – using ever more violent language – as “weeds” that needed to be “cleared out”, or barriers that should be “ripped up”, “torn down” and “kicked down”. Rather than obsessing about risk (which is what they exist to do), the regulators’ role should be to “deliver growth”. Deliberately echoing Trump’s language as he promised to assault the planning system, Starmer said he would “build, baby, build”. Heissueda general statement on regulation: “This government will sweep it away.”His mission, Starmer says, is inspired by his “conversations with leading CEOs”, who complain that their schemes are impeded by citizens’ objections, legal challenges and the need for consultation with regulators. Welcome to capital’s age-old struggle with that infuriating concept, democracy. Amazingly, he stated that he was modelling his assault on the democratic state on Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of finance capital, whoseeventual result, in 2007, was the first run on a British bankin 140 years, helping to trigger the global financial crisis.While Trump might collide with a Congress in which he has a fragile majority, and various constitutional obstacles, this government is currently unassailable. It faces no opposition from the Tories: it’s what they wanted to do, had they dared.Though the prime minister seeks to appease corporate and oligarchic power, his attack on regulation has results he might find less helpful. When he pulls a lever, he could discover that, without a robust administrative state, nothing happens. Then the good stuff as well as the bad fails to materialise.The good stuff includes theland use consultationthat the government launched last month. Its proposals could and should be revolutionary. It sets out, for the first time in England, arational policyfor deciding which land should be used for what. Where farming produces almost nothing (as in thesheepwrecked uplands), the new paper suggests the land could be better used for reviving ecosystems. As 85% of the UK’s agricultural area is managed for livestock feed and production, it looks at how we might meet our demand for food more efficiently. It calls for restoring peatlands, woodlands and coastal habitats and for “renaturalising our water bodies and making space for water”. It wants ournational parksand other “protected” landscapes to become “greener, wilder and more accessible”.View image in fullscreenA housing development next to agricultural land in Felixstowe, Suffolk.Photograph: BFG48/ShutterstockThere are some bizarre contradictions. The main paper laments the fact that England is “one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world”. But its analytical annexe,published separately, suggests the government intends to stick to the risible Tory target of improving the abundance of wild species no sooner than 2042. The plans are further undermined by using a completely inappropriate standard called “tree growth potential” to determine where trees should be allowed to return. While this is useful in planning timber plantations, it makes no sense for ecological restoration. There is nowhere too high for trees to establish in England, and hunched and gnarled woods in the hills are no less valuable habitats than straight stands of timber in the lowlands. The result, as the annexe shows, will be to exclude new woods from the uplands while causing conflict in the productive lowlands between forest restoration and food production.More positively, the consultation also proposes a community right to buy land and buildings,like Scotland’s; and better and more accessible data and updated maps on the condition and fertility of land, which are essential for good planning.All these proposals require two things: a commitment that won’t falter in the face of lobbying by incumbent powers, led by the National Farmers’ Union and the Country Land and Business Association; and strong, confident, well-financed government agencies. But after15 years of defunding,demoralisationanddemonisation, these bodies, such as Natural England, the Environment Agency and the Rural Payments Agency, arescarcely breathing. The government, throughfurther budget cuts, seems determined to finish them off. Last month, it launched a Trumpian culture war against the regulators. A week later, it launched a huge and complex strategy that is entirely reliant on them.Local authorities are also crucial for delivering the land use plans, but they too are incapacitated by systemic defunding. Like the dire state of the regulators, this issue goes unmentioned in the consultation. The new paper states that “investors, farmers and other businesses want certainty” about government policy, and “a more joined-up, strategic approach to land use strategy and planning”. Yes: to make long-term plans, land managers need a solid regulatory framework. Instead, they get deregulatory chaos.The Guardian view on Labour’s climate plans: they should be central to the party’s purpose | EditorialRead moreFar from addressing these issues, the government will rely on “private nature markets”. The timing could scarcely be worse, coinciding with aglobal collapseof confidencein these markets, and the carbon and nature “credits” they sell, as a result of fraud, malpractice, wishful thinking and false accounting. These issues seem intrinsic to an industry selling future promises for cash today. Even if these markets somehow worked, they would still need to operate within strong regulatory controls, enforced by tough public authorities.Farmers can justifiably complain that they’re being asked to make environmental improvements while the government swings its wrecking ball ofairport expansionandnew trunk roads, says to hell with thenewts and bats, has announced a massiveliquefied fossil gas projectunder the guise of “carbon capture and storage” and seeks support for the approval of theRosebank oilfield. If your aim is to generate furious resistance, try blatant double standards.How is the government failing to understand these things: that you can’t implement an ambitious programme of change without robust government bodies? And that you can’t simultaneously appease corporate lobbyists, the Daily Mail, the Times and the Telegraphanddeliver effective and beneficial policy? How is it that politicians who are neither felons, frauds, sexual assaulters nor coup plotters nevertheless mirror the agenda of the orange tyrant?George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRegulatorsOpinionLabourEnvironment AgencyKeir StarmerRachel ReevesEnglandNatural EnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

This is killer TVLucy ManganTue 11 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTShareEight to a dozen affluent Americans, half of them hiding a dark secret as they head to a glamorous location for a luxury vacation, the other half complicating the issue by creating some dark secrets of their own. A dead body ruining everyone’s fun but increasing the audience’s exponentially. Shiny unhappy people getting their just deserts by the end of an immaculately plotted eight-hour series. Yes, my friends, we can only be back at the White Lotus.Written and directed as ever by Mike White, this time he is taking us, his new gang and one or two familiar faces to Thailand. We have the family group, with Parker Posey (possibly Parker Poseying it slightly too much in a part that doesn’t demand as much kookiness as she brings to it) as Victoria Ratliff, a heavily medicated Southern belle and wife of wealthy businessman Timothy (Jason Isaacs). They are the parents of three children: the enjoyably appalling chip-off-the-old-block Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger – and the answer to your first question is yes, he is; the answer to the next one is, no, he’s actually very, very good); idealistic daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), who is writing her thesis about eastern religion and at whose behest they chose Thailand as their holiday location; and sweet, gentle Lochlan (Sam Nivola), who may be trying to work out how to come out as gay in a family that does not seem to accommodate much difference.We have the odd couple, Rick (Walton Goggins) and his much younger girlfriend Chelsea (played by Aimee Lou Wood, ofSex Educationfame). Goggins is in his happy place as Rick, a tortured soul fibrillating on the edge of violence and who has come to the resort seeking its owner. The reason is as yet unspecified, but if I had to choose between redemption, bloody vengeance and selling him a kitten I know which my money would be on.View image in fullscreenRide-or-dies? … Kate (Leslie Bibb), Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) and Laurie (Carrie Coon) in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOAnd we have a trio of looser narrative cannon: three old friends reuniting for some quality time together after a few years apart. Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) is a successful actor, Laurie (Carrie Coon) is a high-flying lawyer recovering from a recent divorce and Kate (Leslie Bibb) is a stay-at-home mom who appears to have it all, including a nice line in character assassination, depending on which of her friends is present or absent. Their dynamic – not mean girls, but not quite the ride-or-dies they think they are – is beautifully depicted.Further out from the centre – so far – we have a tender romance blossoming between hotel security guard Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) and “health guru” Mook (Lalisa Manoban), and possibly another between returning character Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) and another staff member, as she embarks on a research trip for her own wellness enterprise.It all makes for a rich stew of possibilities and White adjusts the seasoning and turns up the heat with the skill of a Michelin-starred chef. What is the source of Rick’s suffering? Why is Timothy getting calls from the Wall Street Journal? Which of the friend trio is going to crack first, and how? Is there more or even less to Saxon than meets the eye? And is Piper really as anodyne as she seems? No one else inThe White Lotusever has been.View image in fullscreenTender romance … Mook (Lalisa Manoban) and Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOAs ever, White has his eye on the wilful ignorance and hypocrisies of the US economic elite. The power dynamics around sex and class come under scrutiny once more, but this time religion is interrogated too. Specifically the western appropriation of eastern faiths and practices – you know, the good bits; the bits that can be packaged as vague “spirituality” rather than an organising principle around which to build a moral life.That said, the last series had less satirical bite than the first – which relentlessly went after its marks and never missed a chance to skewer the unthinking arrogance or active malevolence of Americans rich enough to have distanced themselves from the herd. And, on the evidence of the first few episodes, it seems that the third series may have moved even further from the original’s MO. But the precision of the storytelling and the realisation of every character, from the most central to the most peripheral, remains masterly. Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses. Come on in, the water’s lovely – until the bodies start floating past.The White Lotus is on HBO in the US and Binge in Australia on 16 February and on Sky Atlantic/Now on 17 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsThe White LotusTV reviewTelevisionTV crime dramareviewsShareReuse this content"

We enter a gender-breaking world of occult worship – and catsEliza GoodpastureTue 11 Feb 2025 10.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 12.32 ESTShare‘Of course the women were important,” said the artist Roland Penrose in 1982, “but it was because they were our muses.” Penrose was talking to the art historian Whitney Chadwick, who was interviewing him for a book she was writing about women surrealists. “They weren’t artists,” insisted Penrose, who thought she shouldn’t even be writing about them. But Chadwick did anyway – and the result, her 1985 bookWomenArtists and the Surrealist Movement,fundamentally changed our understanding of both surrealism and female artists.In the 40 years since, many of the women Chadwick wrote about have gained wider fame, but the past few years have seen an explosion of interest in surrealist women. Last year was the 100th anniversary of the Surrealist Manifesto, which was actually two competing manifestos published by competing groups of (male) surrealists in Paris. So it’s unsurprising that we saw so much interest in the movement. But itisstriking that the centennial prompted a flurry of interest in the women – who were actually excluded from those groups. Indeed, many weren’t even in Paris. Why the sudden broadening of the lens?View image in fullscreenHair-raising … a work by Claude Cahun from 1936.Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/ShutterstockWhen Chadwick asked the surrealist Leonor Fini about Penrose’s muses claim, she responded with characteristic directness, calling it “bullshit”. Fini was born in Argentina and spent time in Italy before ending up in Paris. She was openly bisexual and spent the later part of her life living in a polyamorous relationship with two men – and dozens of cats. “I am a painter,” she once said, “not a woman painter.”Her words reflect the complex politics of pursuing art as a woman. While their lives were defined by their experiences of being born women, and many of them made art that was explicitly about femininity and sexuality, they also bucked assumptions based on their gender that were made by their male peers and by the viewing public.View image in fullscreen‘Neuter is the only gender that suits me’ … Claude Cahun.Photograph: Album/AlamyClaude Cahun, as early as 1914, went even further than Fini in her radical identification as lesbian and non-binary. She is famously quoted as saying: “Masculine? Feminine? It depends on the situation. Neuter is the only gender that always suits me.” Currently the subject of a touring exhibition courtesy of London’s Hayward Gallery, Cahun’s photography was made with her partner, Marcel Moore, a lesbian who also lived androgynously.Even among surrealist women who did not identify as queer, there is often an element of queerness to their work – either through an exploration of the “divine feminine”, or through a more fundamental sense of enigma. The late US scholar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick described “queer” as an “open mesh of possibilities” between genders and sexualities, a defining way of using the word that has made it such a sweeping term today, sometimes meaning no more than “impossible to categorise”.Fini and Cahun were based in the surrealist centre of Paris, but many of the other women receiving new attention were not. Ithell Colquhoun was a British surrealist and is currently the subject of amajor retrospective at Tate St Ives. It is a seismic exhibition that forcefully makes the case for Colquhoun’s powerful legacy. Colquhoun was connected to so many occultist and spiritual groups in Britain that it’s hard to count them all. From druidism to Tantra to Christianity, she spent her life seeking a higher truth, all reflected in her work.View image in fullscreenSeeking a higher truth … Ithell Colquhoun.Photograph: Guy Carrard/© Man Ray Trust / ADAGP Paris, Centre PompidouLike Fini, Colquhoun was attracted to people of all genders, and her art was often explicitly sexual. She made one painting that depicted castrated male bodies, and it was immediately censored for its shocking content. Other works show abstracted, vulva-like landscapes, explore goddess imagery, and deploy techniques that introduce an element of chance – to allow the unconscious to take over the creative act.There has long been a connection between women and magic – think of witches, goddesses, healers and storytellers. And for almost as long, this connection has been weighted with a sense of threat. The mystical, intangible power women could wield threatened patriarchal systems and needed to be controlled. In western art, it was written off as foolish or irrelevant. Colquhoun was pushed out of the British surrealist group because of her fascination with occult sects, which came to dominate her work.Surrealism, although it is distinctly strange, was not concerned with the supernatural. The movements in Paris and Britain both rejected it. Their interest in the unconscious mind was largely scientific, even if it was also irrational (or perhaps anti-rational). Today, though, there is much more interest in these themes: Colquhoun’s biographer Amy Hale has called it the “Shamanic turn”, as our collective consciousness becomes more open to esoteric beliefs. Last autumn, the London gallery Lévy Gorvy Dayan hosted Enchanted Alchemies, a show that focused on mystic and occult surrealists. Almost all women, they included Eileen Agar, Leonora Carrington, Fini and Colquhoun.View image in fullscreenExplicitly sexual … Ithell Colquhoun, Scylla (méditerranée), 1938Photograph: Joe Humphrys/© Spire Healthcare, © Noise Abatement Society, © SamaritansMary Wykeham, a British surrealist whose work features in the Hepworth Wakefield’s current exhibitionForbidden Territories: 100 Years of Surreal Landscapes, found spiritual fulfilment in a slightly different way: after a tumultuous lifetime spent as a wartime nurse, political activist and professional artist, she became a nun. Many of her surviving works are on paper, making them more fragile and smaller-scale. They are filled with swirling or geometric lines, almost completely abstract. Like all surrealist work, they strive to unlock the unconscious mind, bypassing rationality in favour of an often disquieting exploration of the inner self.Another British surrealist, Lee Miller, followed an entirely different path: after building a successful career as a surrealist photographer and model in Paris, she became a photojournalist during the second world war. Miller was present at the liberation of the concentration camps Buchenwald and Dachau, and the photo of her taking a bath in Hitler’s tub has become iconic. Often remembered more as a model and muse – she was married to Penrose – Miller recently had her story retold inLee,a film starring Kate Winslet in the title role.View image in fullscreenMaruja Mallo.Photograph: Album/AlamyMaruja Mallo, shortly to be the subject of a major retrospective at the Centro Botín in Santander, Spain, lived and worked in Madrid. She knew major Spanish surrealists like Salvador Dalí and Federico García Lorca, but unlike them she remained in Spain for her whole career – aside from her exile to Argentina during the civil war. Her work incorporated Spanish folk imagery, but became more geometric and abstract. Mallo was a writer as well as a painter, contributing to magazines and books.Surrealism was an especially multidisciplinary movement. Along with writing, film-making was popular, tying the movement to modernity despite its impulses towards timelessness. This plethora of mediums reflects how surrealism is, at its core, a practice of thinking radically differently, using words as well as images – any medium in fact, so long as it brings the unconscious out into the world.“We are in a wave of rediscovery around women generally,” says Tate St Ives curator Katy Norris, “and it’s allowing us to recognise differences among them – they weren’t a single breakaway group.” In fact, the basic surrealist impulse of dreams, sexuality and obsession had a global reach and appeal: unlike previous avant-garde movements in the early 20th century, which often sought to overturn previous -isms, surrealism quickly stopped being so centralised. The diversity among its adherents’ lives, styles and priorities is huge. “Surrealism responds to uncertainty,” says Norris, “so it speaks to us now in times of uncertainty.”View image in fullscreenShamanic … Leonor Fini.Photograph: Album/AlamyThat impulse to examine one’s inner self feels very familiar today. But the magnanimity of the surrealists – with their unflinching drive to put themselves into their art in all their irrational, weird glory – is different from the tide of social media-driven, self-critical narcissism that’s so prominent today. The fierce individualism of these artists, these women who were so relentlessly themselves, is a tonic. It’s no wonder they are capturing public attention like never before. In a world that feels increasingly unpredictable, there’s a real resonance in women embracing instability and using it to fuel their creative work. It is, says Norris, “a perfect storm”.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The remarkable Japanese musician talks about magical islands, sonic sorcery and playing gigs with her eyes shutDale Berning SawaTue 11 Feb 2025 11.17 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 11.20 ESTShareWhen Ichiko Aoba stood up to perform at London’s St Martin-in-the-Fields in September 2024, most people couldn’t actually see the Japanese singer at first. The Georgian parish church has no stage, just a postage stamp of a red platform. And Aoba is not that tall. “I was a bit nervous,” she says. “Venue staff had told me it would be difficult for people to see, so I kept thinking about how I might massage people, loosen them up.”Aoba, 35, is speaking over video call from Tokyo. Her vibe in conversation is much the same as on stage: quiet but not shy, thoughtful, funny and direct. At St Martin’s, she walked down the aisle, guitar in hand, sat down on the flagstone floor, big white skirts billowing up like powdery snow, and started to sing, unamplified. The audience hushed. Aoba said, “Come closer”, and everyone who could did.View image in fullscreenThe cover artwork for Luminescent CreaturesPhotograph: HermineSince her 2010 debut, Kamisori Otome (Razorblade Girl), Aoba’s quietly astonishing music has earned her a horde of devoted fans. She’s an accomplished guitarist with a voice like a wind chime and a similarly airborne way with a melody. She sells out big venues immediately, and has been sought out by Japan’s musical statesmen Ryuichi Sakamoto, Cornelius and Haruomi Hosono. And yet she says: “I don’t really think of myself as a musician. I just love sound. Sometimes I’m still surprised when I’m described as an artist.”She has an artist’s CV by any measure: eight studio albums, eight live albums, a contribution to the soundtrack of the 2017 Ghost in the Shell. Yet Aoba says with a smile: “If I hold being a musician as my baseline, it feels constricting. I rather want to hold on to having fun, feeling surprised. To link those together” – she joins her fingers – “is to live a happy life.” This month, she releases her ninth album, Luminescent Creatures. To guitar, strings, chimes and keyboards, she sings about scattered light and things that glow in the dark; the aurora, a tower, a flag. In April, she will perform the album in full at the Barbican in London.Aoba was born in Urayasu, not far from Tokyo Disneyland, and raised near Kyoto. At school she variously sang in a choir, played clarinet in a brass band and drummed in a light music club. But after meeting the Japanese eight-string guitarist Anmi Yamada, with his singular, freewheeling songwriting, she took flight. She would learn his songs then have masterclasses with him over the phone. These days, to record her music, she says she needs to be so relaxed she’s almost asleep.If I just let go and truly believe that the music will be my protection, I can reach a state that is almost meditationHow on earth does she achieve that? “I have to trust the moment,” she says. “If I’m focused on this being my song, or that person being in the audience, or the light being too bright, or the sound feeding back when I play” – she does a neat bit of air guitar – “it doesn’t work. But if I just let go” – she shakes both hands in the air – “and truly believe that the music will be my protection, I can reach a state that is almost like meditation.”It’s a pretty accurate description of her audiences, too. She nods. “When people write to me, they’ll say they had a great time at a concert but also that, on a deeper level, they found a space where they felt safe, or where they found they could forgive.” She shows me a pile of decorated envelopes that she fans out in front of her then stacks under her head like a pillow: “These make me so happy. I keep them by my bedside.”Aoba loves ancient Japanese and onomatopoeia. She wonders about what plants remember. She has visions of landscapes that she has never visited and she is drawn to the idea of sound as a means of wayfinding: whale song, sonar, echolocation. When I mention Daniel Kish, the blind runner who listens his way through the forest at speed, she beams and claps. “Sometimes,” she says, “during a gig, I’ll close my eyes just to see how long I can play before I make a mistake. Often I think of making an album as like talking to a friend, telling them about whatever interesting thing has happened that day.”When Aoba launched her official fan community on Patreon, she called it Atóllba, after “atoll” because she imagines it to be just that: a magical island, an iridescent safe space, in which like-minded people can gather. Her critically acclaimed 2020 album, Windswept Adan, was billed “the soundtrack to a fictional movie”. Is Luminescent Creatures also insular, a world of it own? “This time, instead of a story, it’s like a dictionary,” she says, “with each track a seed I’m planting.”Google the title for the second song, 24° 3′ 27.0″ N, 123° 47′ 7.5″ E, and you realise it’s the coordinates for a lighthouse in the sea at the very edge of Japanese waters. “I hoped that some people might find the island,” she says. “But mostly, I hope that the album itself is a lighthouse of sorts.”Luminescent Creatures is out on 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMusicIndieFolk musicJapanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At various points in the last few months, experienced prognosticators have offered upConclave,Wicked,A Complete Unknown,September 5,The BrutalistorEmilia Pérezas their pick, the race shifting with the smallest shred of new intel.Last month’s Golden Globes, which saw Emilia Pérez and The Brutalist win the major film awards and then theOscar nominations, also led by the same two titles, seemed to firm up a clearer two-horse race. But the films were unusual Oscar bets to say the least. One a crime musical about a trans cartel boss and the other a three-hour-plus drama about architecture, both featuring languages other than English, both with smaller budgets than the Academy tends to reward. Even though we had more tea leaves to read, it felt difficult to passionately anoint either as a surefire thing.‘They chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her’: has the Emilia Pérez backlash gone too far?Read moreBut then the past weekend showed us why such reticence had been hard to shake asSean Baker’s frenetic comedyAnorasurprised most with a trio of major wins. First on Friday night, it took home best picture at the Critics Choice awards and then on Saturday it won the top prize at the Producers Guild awards before Baker won best director at the Directors Guild awards.While the first is not as much of an important precursor (past winners have been similar but there are more deviations than usual from Roma to The Power of the Dog to Boyhood), PGA and DGA do tend to provide a clearer sign of where we’re heading. Since it started back in 1989, the winner of the PGA award for best theatrical motion picture has mirrored the eventual best picture Oscar winner in all but 10 ceremonies (1917, La La Land, The Big Short and Little Miss Sunshine were the four most recent occasions). Similarly, the winner of the DGA award for outstanding directing of a feature film has only clashed eight times (Argo’s Ben Affleck being the last, and most famous, example).View image in fullscreenMark Eydelshteyn and Mikey Madison in Anora.Photograph: APBefore this weekend, some had started to prematurely position Anora as a potential bridesmaid of the season, having left both theGolden Globesand the Gothams without a single award (if Anora wins best picture it would be only the sixth time since 1975 that a film without a single Globe achieves this). Even at Friday’s Critics Choice awards, the film hadn’t won a single award throughout the night until it walked away with best picture at the very end. StarMikey Madison, who plays the titular character, had been seen as a potential best actress frontrunner – the film is dominated by her brash breakout performance as a sex worker swept off her feet – but it had seemed the race was favouring comeback queenDemi MooreforThe Substanceor perhaps Fernanda Torres forI’m Still Here, further proof of the Academy’s increasingly international voting base. Madison might still be unable to stop either train (a woman under 30 hasn’t won the award since 2016 and her ingenue narrative is perhaps less alluring and textured than her main competition) but Anora is a film that rests entirely on the shoulders of herself and writer-director Baker, making it hard to see how at least one of them doesn’t get swept up too. Baker would be the more likely here, nominated as writer, director, producer, as well as editor, a win representing a slow embrace for an unconventional Oscar talent (pre-Anora, his movies had netted just one nomination to date – The Florida Project’s Willem Dafoe for best supporting actor).If he or the film wins, it would further reflect how a younger, more diverse voting base are still tweaking if not exactly redefining what an Oscar movie now is (this is the post-Oppenheimer year after all). The best director nominees this year exclude many of the bigger players – Wicked’s Jon M Chu, Dune: Part Two’sDenis Villeneuve– and focus more on those who did a lot with a little (Anora’s budget was $6m, The Brutalist cost $10m and The Substance was made for $17.5m). The actingnominees also snubbedprevious A-list winners such as Nicole Kidman, Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie in the place of 13 first-timers.While, from afar, a film like Emilia Pérez might have seemed like a choice that would reflect a more progressive base – it’s quickly become one of the most reviled Oscar contenders in years. A film about a trans woman in Mexico has been rejected by many trans people and many Mexicans as well as by critics, with the film scoring the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating out of this year’s crop. The LGBTQ+ advocacy group Glaadcalledit “a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman” and said it represented “a step backward” for representation, while the film has beenaccusedof perpetuating Mexican stereotypes. Its deceptive success at the Golden Globes shows that, despite some structural improvements with who votes for the awards, the Globes are gonna keep Globesing regardless (this year also saw Pamela Anderson nominated over Marianne Jean-Baptiste).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It might not affect supporting actress nominee Zoe Saldaña, who is still favourite in her category, but it’s had an undeniable impact on the film’s overall chances, with Gascón removed from both the campaign trail and any “for your consideration” advertising. Those voters who may have seen an Emilia Pérez vote as a force for social good might now be less sure and so many have been considering where those votes might now go. There’s an argument to be made for Wicked, another musical that embraces inclusivity with a positive message, but Anora could also fill the gap in a different way. It’s another Cannes-premiering female-led film made on a shoestring budget (about $15m less than Emilia Pérez) that represents the bold vision of a film-maker who is finally getting wider recognition after a number of impressive indies. While bigger, male-led films such as Oppenheimer will always remain in the race, victory for Anora would fall in line with what’s become more of the best picture norm, a smaller film that could (Parasite’s budget was $11m, Coda’s was $10m and Nomadland’s was $5m) with a female lead (Nomadland, Coda, Everything Everywhere All at Once, The Shape of Water).With odds now dramatically slashed, Anora has become the betting favourite for best picture but with the Oscars not taking place until 2 March, we’ll have to wait and see if Sean Baker’s Cinderella story gets its happy ending.Explore more on these topicsAnoraOscarsSean BakerAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A script by Humphrey Ker and David Reed, old muckers from sketch troupe The Penny Dreadfuls. And a fresh grisly-merry case for Sherlock Holmes. You can only deduce from this evidence that Birmingham Rep has a likely hit on the horizon.Sherlock Holmes and the 12 Days of Christmas – which will open at the Rep in November – follows Arthur Conan Doyle’s great detective around London’s Theatreland. Holmes suspects someone is bumping off actors, Rice explains, “matching each gory death with something from the 12 days of Christmas”. He chuckles over our video call: “Quite a funny idea!”The plot was cooked up by Ker and Reed, who have been pastiching the mastermind sleuth since what Ker calls their “unbelievably populist move” to make “all-Victoriana-centric sketch comedy” as Edinburgh fringe favourites The Penny Dreadfuls. Reed says the play “has the spirit of a pantomime – it’s warming people’s cockles in the winter, and it’s deeply daft and fun. And there are some cracking songs.”View image in fullscreenAnti-grinch … Humphrey KerThose tunes have reunited lyricist Rice and composer Lloyd Webber whose three big hits from the 1970s – Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita – have proved imperishable and are all on stage again this year. Reed explains how the two duos collaborated on the play. As he and Ker wrote the script, they highlighted “a nice place for a song” here and there. The pages were then dispatched to Rice and Lloyd Webber. “And then a song you can’t get out of your head comes back … My phone’s just full of bangers now!”Ker says he would receive voice notes from Lloyd Webber: “They’re like, ‘Oh, I was sort of knocking around, having a bath this morning, and I found myself going pom-pom tiddly pom-pom-pom and anyway, here’s this!’ And then he’ll play something.” Reed adds: “You suddenly discover he is sat at his grand piano.”The project dates back to lockdown. “Humphrey was in the States [where his projects have included Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney’s takeover of Wrexham AFC, as documented in a popular TV series]. I was living in York at the time, and so the script has been written largely by email,” says Reed. “It reminded me of the old days when we started out, living in Edinburgh together. I recently found our old sketchbook which had the first sketches we ever wrote together in it. We’d sit in a pub called the Pear Tree and one of us would just keep writing until we dried and didn’t know what the next line of dialogue was. Then we’d hand it over. And the other one would do it, like the consequences game.”View image in fullscreen‘We would just keep writing until we dried and then hand it over’ … David ReedHolmes and Dr Watson inspired characters on their 2008 BBC radio series The Brothers Faversham: “Theseus Favershamwas the world’s greatest detective, and he had a slightly hapless sidekick.” How funny do they find Conan Doyle’s original stories? Reed suggests most of the humour comes from Holmes’ relationship with Watson (“it’s mostly Holmes being mean to him”) and Ker finds a dry humour in the detective’s misanthropy. “But what’s really funny,” he adds, “is Brigadier Gerard, Conan Doyle’s less well-known series about the greatest cavalry officer in Napoleon’s army, inhisopinion. Everyone else thinks he’s kind of a wally. He’s incredibly brave because he’s slightly too stupid to understand the danger he is in.”Funny lyrics are “usually easier to write than serious love ones”, says Rice. “Everything’s been said about love.” His eyes flash and he picks up a pen. “I’m going to write that down. That’s a good title for a song. A bit long-winded but you never know … If you’re trying to write a love song, it is true that everything’s been said by people much greater than I, like Sammy Cahn or Cole Porter.”Rice outlines how his own partnership with Lloyd Webber worked in the 70s. “I’d submit the story to Andrew, he would then write music inspired by the plot and then I would add lyrics. And then a big process of endless meetings and something like that would take a year or two.” This project is different because the story was already worked out and they were called on to “provide a half a dozen little light moments. I mean, I think some of the songs are quite good, so I hope they won’t betoolight.”He went round to Lloyd Webber’s last week for a “get-together around the piano” and the composer played one of the tunes, which Rice recorded on his phone. “Then I can take the tune home immediately, listen to it a few times, stick some words on it, paying attention to the storyline. And then it goes back to Andrew and we sing it together. And if it works, which so far they have, then we say, well, this is a suggestion. It’s then up to the directors and the producers to a) like it, and b) put it in the show if possible.”Lloyd Webber’s reign as “king of the musicools” is brilliantly spoofed in comedy duo Flo & Joan’s One Man Musical, starring George Fouracres, currently at theUnderbelly Boulevardin Soho. “Yes, that got very good reviews,” observes Rice. “I want to go and see it, but I don’t want to cause a fuss by turning up. Apparently I’m played by a bag of rice or something. It’s probably more lively than me. I don’t think Andrew’s seen it.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice in 1970.Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty ImagesAnyway, the pair have their songs to polish for Sherlock. The show is produced by Birmingham Rep in association with Rice’s company Heartaches Ltd, whose team includes his son Donald (Ker’s brother-in-law). It opens in November, directed byPhillip Breenwith Becky Hope-Palmer, for audiences “aged 10 to 110”. Ker says that he and Reed “both love Christmas. I mean we’re both very much anti-grinches. I’ve long maintained, whenever anyone asked me what my dream job is, that I’d like to be the sort of Christmas TV tsar across all channels. I’d like to coordinate between ITV, BBC, Sky One, Channel 4, whatever. So, OK, you’re doing the Agatha Christie this year, you’re doing the beloved sitcom reboot …”Winter is a great time for storytelling, they agree. Reed recently took his seven-year-old daughter to her first panto. “I think her first experience has perhaps skewed her expectations,” he says. “She got to go up, quite randomly, on stage and save Maddie Moate from CBeebies. You don’t always save the life of someone you recognise off telly. She’s now hooked!”Sherlock Holmes and the 12 Days of Christmas is atBirmingham Rep, 14 November-11 January 2026Explore more on these topicsTheatreTim RiceAndrew Lloyd WebberMusicalsComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Arthur Conan DoylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wallace & Gromit’s cheese-free dining venture is far from crackingAt Bisto and Aardman’s new pop-up floating restaurant you can pour gravy over your pudding or down a gravy drink – but where’s the cheese board, Gromit?Stuart HeritageTue 11 Feb 2025 07.11 ESTLast modified on Tue 11 Feb 2025 12.39 ESTShareEver since A Grand Day Out was released in 1989, we as a nation have grasped Wallace & Gromit to our collective heart like nothing else. We’ve watched them for decades, falling in love with their Rube Goldberg inventions, their nostalgic mid-century charm and their fingerprint-flecked faces. Wallace & Gromit is this country’s specialist subject. Their lives are ingrained into ours, and as such there is nothing about them that we don’t know.For instance, when you think of Wallace & Gromit, one foodstuff instantly springs to mind. A food that has propelled Wallace & Gromit narratives and inspired Wallace & Gromit catchphrases alike. Of course, I am referring to gravy.Try to think of what Wallace & Gromit would be like without gravy and their world simply falls apart. Remember when they built a rocket to visit the moon, only to discover it was made of gravy? Remember Wallace’s face undulating into an expression of pure glee as he bit down hard on a slice of gravy and said “Cracking gravy, Gromit?” Of course you do. We all do.Wait, hang on, what’s that? I got it wrong? It’s actually cheese that Wallace likes? Cheese and not gravy? And in fact gravy plays such a minuscule role in the world of Wallace & Gromit that it’s nearly impossible to find any substantial information linking the two on the internet? Well, this is awkward. Not just for me, but for the operators of the new Wallace & Gromit-themed gravy restaurant.Yesterday a press release did the rounds announcing a floating gravy restaurant in Paddington, made by Bisto to announce its new partnership with Wallace & Gromit. Although it will only be open for two days next week, the restaurant will supply a full £15 gravy menu. Upon arrival, diners will be greeted with a gravy cocktail, which will be followed by a Bisto-infused roast with all the trimmings. Dessert will come served with a sweet gravy sauce, before diners are given the opportunity to have a meet and greet with Wallace, Gromit and Feathers McGraw, or at the very least three exhausted interns in heavy costumes.View image in fullscreenDesperately seeking cheese … Wallace & Gromit land on the moon in A Grand Day Out.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyWhich, you have to admit, is a weird way to spend a day. This doesn’t sound like it’s an event for kids – parents of young children will enthusiastically tell you what a nightmare it is to feed children in a restaurant that is by its very design unstable, surrounded by terrifying dead-eyed giant versions of characters they’ve only ever seen on television – which means this is a decidedly adults-only affair. And not just any adults either; this is for adults who like both Wallace & Gromit (but not enough to realise that gravy doesn’t play a big role in the franchise) and also possess such freakish culinary bravery that they’re willing to pour gravy all over their pudding. In other words, this is for about three people max.And, fine, if you squint and look at it from just the right angle, the partnership does make the smallest degree of sense, because the climax to the most recent Wallace & Gromit film,Vengeance Most Fowl, took place on a canal boat, and gravy is served in boats, and that’s enough of a connection isn’t it? But is this really the way to treat a national treasure?Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl review – an unmissable, ingenious Christmas treatRead moreOn one hand, Bisto must be paying a hell of a lot of money for the image rights of Wallace & Gromit, and if that money helpsAardmanto make more Wallace & Gromit films, then that can only be a good thing. The joy of Wallace & Gromit is seeing how something so labour- and effort-intensive, and therefore expensive, can look so effortless. If an influx of gravy cash means that more labour and effort can be funnelled into the process, that’s great.But on the other, shouldn’t this be a cheese restaurant? And shouldn’t it take place on a rocket? And shouldn’t diners be pinged from their seats across the air into a giant pair of robotic trousers? Really, if you’re going to bend to the might of product placement, it should be worth getting the details right. After all, as Wallace himself once said, cracking brand synergy Gromit.Explore more on these topicsFilmWallace & GromitAardmanAnimation in filmAnimation on TVFoodRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was aware of someone with dark hair and dark clothes … I was struck by his eyes which seemed dark and ferocious to me.”Rushdie added: “He hit me very hard around my jawline and neck. Initially I thought he’d punched me with his fist, but very soon afterwards I saw a large quantity of blood pouring on to my clothes. He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.”He continued: “Everything happened very quickly. I was stabbed repeatedly, and most painfully in my eye. I struggled to get away. I held up my hand in self-defense and was stabbed through that.”Asked how many times he was stabbed, Rushdie said: “I wasn’t keeping score.”Rushdie described getting up from his seat to get away from his attacker but fell. “He was trying to strike me as many times as possible.“I was very badly injured. I couldn’t stand up any more. I fell down,” Rushdie testified, estimating that he had been struck 15 times by his assailant.“I was screaming because of the pain,” he said, describing the wound to his right eye that took his sight on that side. Rushdie showed jurors the empty socket beneath an eye patch he now wears.While lying on the stage, Rushdie continued: “I became aware of a great quantity of blood I was lying in. My sense of time was quite cloudy, I was in pain from my eye and hand, and it occurred to me quite clearly I was dying.”Rushdie described how he was put on a gurney and later wheeled to an emergency medical helicopter. “I was dimly aware of what was going on until the helicopter landed, then I don’t remember anything until much later.”Rushdie was hospitalized for more that two weeks, and described how, while on a ventilator, he communicated by wiggling his feet.Under a brief cross-examination, Rushdie was asked about his recollection. He agreed that false memories exist. He pointed to his initial recollection “that I stood up to face him (Matar), but that was not true. I was sitting down.”Rushdie agreed with Matar’s defence proposition that freedom of expression, the right to a jury trial and due process were valuable rights and said he had had no contact with Matar before the alleged assault.Asked if Matar had spoken to him at all during the alleged incident, Rushdie said: “He did not.”The author was then excused from the witness box.Matar, a dual US-Lebanese citizen, is accused of attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty. Matar muttered: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as he was brought into court. Rushdie’s wife, Rachel Griffiths, and his agent, Andrew Wylie, sat in the gallery flanked by security.In opening statements, jurors had heard from prosecutors that Matar “almost succeeded in killing Mr Rushdie”.“Without hesitation, this man, holding his knife … forcefully and efficiently in its speed, plunged the knife into Mr Rushdie over and over and over and over again,” prosecutor Jason Schmidt said.Assistant public defender Lynn Schaffer told jurors that prosecutors would be unable to prove Matar’s guilt, even using video recordings and photos.“The elements of the crime are more than ‘something really bad happened’ – they’re more defined,” Shaffer said. “Something very bad did happen, but the district attorney has to prove much more than that.”A series of witness were called on Monday by prosecutors looking to place Matar at the crime scene. The Chautauqua employee Jordan Steves said he saw a “violent interaction with someone swinging their arms at an onstage guest …”Absent from the case so far is any reference to the fatwa that called for Rushdie’s death, issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini, then supreme leader of Iran. Prosecutors say they can secure a conviction without reference to it.Matar is set to be tried on federal terrorism charges, where the issue of motivation will be hard to exclude. The charges allege Matar was motivated by an endorsement of the fatwa by the Iran-backed group Hezbollah. On Monday, Matar said “Free Palestine” as he entered the courtroom.A later trial on the federal charges – terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization – will be scheduled in US district court in Buffalo.In an account published last year, Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder, Rushdie recounted how he had a premonition in a dream of of being attacked in an amphitheater.The trial will last up to two weeks, the lawyers said.Explore more on these topicsSalman RushdieNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The occasion is the 50thanniversary of a celebrated touring company. The politician tries to convince her audience that technology will lead the way. Drama is not real but “artificial” so, moving ahead, wouldn’t it make more sense for artificial intelligence to produce it? “Let’s reset!” she says, whooping at her idea.The scenario is, thankfully, artificial itself: a short new satirical work byJames Graham, written to markthe 50th anniversary of Paines Plough, which has championed new writing and helped kickstart the careers of Graham and a glittering alumni of other leading British playwrights.‘Peter Capaldi was punched off his chair’: Fifty years of explosive theatre company Paines PloughRead moreThe scene, performed by Monica Dolan and exudingThe Thick of Itvibes, opened a gala event on Monday at the Criterion theatre in London. Joint artistic directors Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett, hosting the night, spoke of new writing not as “the future of theatre, but as theatre itself”.The small but mighty company was conceived byDavid Pownalland John Adams in 1974 over a pint of Paines bitter in a Bedford pub called the Plough. It has since nurtured writers includingSarah Kane,Mike Bartlett,Abi Morgan,Duncan Macmillan,Dennis Kelly,Simon StephensandChris Bush. Graham, now its patron, said a monologue he wrote for the company, about the miners’ strike in Nottinghamshire, inspired his hit TV series Sherwood.Others there alongside him paid homage and reminisced.Mark Ravenhillspoke of becoming literary manager and inviting Kane to be writer-in-residence, during which time she staged her savagely lyrical play, Crave. A script-in-hand extract of that play was searingly performed by Alfred Enoch, Rebekah Murrell, Siobhán McSweeney and Thomas Coombes.Extracts of other works formed a kind of “greatest hits” compilation: Stephens’ monologue Sea Wall (originally performed by Andrew Scott) was delivered with great potency by Tom Sturridge. Kola Bokinni’s comic riff from Nathan Queeley-Dennis’s Bruntwood prize-winning Bullring Techno Makeout Jamz, was another highlight, as wasJonny Donahoe’s performance from Every Brilliant Thing, which has travelled to New York and toured extensively since he co-wrote it with Macmillan.View image in fullscreenThomas Coombes, Alfred Enoch, Rebekah Murrell and Siobhán McSweeney performing at the gala.Photograph: Greta ZabulyteThe National Theatre’s incoming director, Indhu Rubasingham, and theatre producer Ellie Keel were among guests speaking of their collaborations with Paines Plough – Rubasingham in tenure at the Kiln theatre where she stagedAmy Trigg’s Reasons You Should(n’t) Love Me(which Trigg charismatically reprised in a screen extract) and Keel as co-founder of the Women’s prize for playwriting.Morgan recalled howPaines Ploughhad saved her life as a writer in the 1990s but also spoke of the deluge of writers leaving theatre for screen work. Live performance was not “locked behind glass” as “a slick multimillion dollar series,” she said, with what sounded like a note of bittersweetness, given her TV credits.There were many reminders of the need for arts investment.The evening was part ofan initiativeaiming to raise £50,000 to develop new writing talent.

Born and educated in Georgetown, in what was then British Guiana, he was inspired to try writing after seeing a production of John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger. He then moved to London and began writing work that drew from his life in the capital, such as The Museum Attendant, which became a BBC screenplay in 1973 and was inspired by his time working as a security officer at the Tower of London and as an attendant at Sir JohnSoane’sMuseum.The Museum Attendant aired the same year as Sweet Talk, his first stage work, which starred Don Warrington and was directed by a young Stephen Frears at the Royal Court’s Theatre Upstairs. In 1977 the pair again worked on Black Christmas, a domestic drama about a black family shot on location in Birmingham.It was a typical Abbensetts story, mixing “roots, racial tensions, mixed-race relationships, cultural power games, tolerance and integration”, and starred Norman Beaton and Carmen Munroe. “It was a knife of a play,” wrote Nancy Banks-Smith in the Guardian.Then came Empire Road: a groundbreaking black British sitcom which had an almost entirely black creative team featuring Norman Beaton and Joseph Marcell, whileHorace Ovédirected some episodes and Dennis Bovell provided the theme tune. It lasted two series, but despite its critical success, didn’t signal the start ofa new rush of similar black British television.View image in fullscreenSamuel Nunes de Souza and Joshua John in Alterations rehearsal at the National TheatrePhotograph: Marc BrennerAlterations was first staged in 1978, and is about a Guyanese tailor trying to establish himself on Carnaby Street in London. Linton and Cooke’s revival stars Arinzé Kene and Cherrelle Skeete.Cooke was brought onboard to rewrite and update elements of the play – partly so that narrative elements were cleared up, but also to change the ways Jewish and female characters were presented.She said: “He’d written it from the male characters’ perspectives in 1978, when they were ‘mens’ men’. We obviously needed to keep that, but we needed to lift the other characters up as well, so you understood it and believed it.”Alterations is the latest in a string of major black British plays at London’s biggest theatres.Jeremy O Harris’s Slave Play was on in the West End, while Linton directed Benedict Lombe’s play Shifters at the Bush Theatre before it transferred to the West End, becoming only the third play by a black British woman to debut there.“I hope it’s not a cycle,” said Linton of the recent stagings of black British work. “The work needs to be part of the canon. I don’t know if we’re there yet – I hope we get there. In 10 years’ time I hope we’re not saying: ‘Have we got there yet?’”Explore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreRacenewsShareReuse this content"

The tour includes two UK dates, at London’s Palladium on 12 and 13 October, with Dublin, Madrid, Bergamo, Brussels, Oslo and Paris also featuring on the European run. The US tour will visit Seattle, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Boston, Washington DC and Philadelphia.Horses was Smith’s 1975 debut album, and came to be seen as a foundational text in New York’s punk scene, although Smith rejected the term punk, instead describing Horses as “three-chord rock merged with the power of the word”. Featuring a portrait by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe on the cover, Horses has long been regarded as one of the decade’s great albums, and is included in the National Recording Registry in the US Library of Congress.Horses will also be commemorated with a tribute concert at New York’s Carnegie Hall on 26 March, featuring stars such Michael Stipe, Kim Gordon, the National’s Matt Berninger, Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Karen O and Sharon Van Etten who will perform album tracks backed by a band including the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Flea.Smith has weathered bouts of ill health in recent years, including on tour. In January shecollapsed while on stage in Brazilafter experiencing a migraine over several days. In December 2023, she was hospitalised while in Italy and cancelled tour dates there after being told by doctors to rest.But her live performances remain as spirited and distinctive as ever, with the Guardian’sAlexis Petridis describing a June 2024 concertas “moving, powerful and unexpected, a perfect reminder that, 12 years after her last album, Patti Smith is still in constant motion.”Horses 50th anniversary tour datesOctober6 Dublin – 3Arena8 Madrid – Teatro Real10 Bergamo – Chorus Life Arena12, 13 London – The Palladium15, 16 Brussels – Cirque Royale18 Oslo – Sentrum Scene20, 21 Paris – L’OlympiaNovember10 Seattle – Paramount theatre12 Oakland – The Fox theatre13 San Francisco – The Masonic15 Los Angeles – Walt Disney Concert Hall17 Chicago – Chicago theatre21, 22 New York City – The Beacon24 Boston – Orpheum theatre28 Washington DC – The Anthem29 Philadelphia – The MetExplore more on these topicsMusicPatti SmithEuropePunkPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The pair have reunited to write songs for a comedy play, Sherlock Holmes and the 12 Days of Christmas, to be staged atBirmingham Repthis winter.Rice took encouragement from the growing popularity of TV subtitles for younger people, withone studyfinding that 80% of viewers aged 18 to 25 commonly have them switched on. “Maybe there’s a new generation coming up which would welcome surtitles in theatres,” he suggested.View image in fullscreenA scene from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice at the London Palladium in 2021.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe lyricist, who is in the elite club of“Egot” winnerswith Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards, said that he did not encounter the problem with solos, observing that “you’re always able to hear Don’t Cry for Me Argentina” from Evita. He said that choral songs in particular can be hard to follow. “I found that was a major problem with us years ago when we did Chess [hismusical with Abba’s Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus], which did not do as well as it should have done although it’s coming back to Broadway, believe it or not, this autumn. Time and time again, the lyrics couldn’t be heard when it was choral. If you’ve got great singers like Tommy Körberg or Elaine Paige [in the 1986 production of Chess] singing the songs solo, you do hear the words, but the choral stuff can often be quite important and you just don’t hear it.”When Chess was put on at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2008, the opening comic number Merano was accompanied by its lyrics on screen. “And for the first time ever the song got laughs and a big cheer,” said Rice. “And I thought, well, there you are!”View image in fullscreenChess in concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 2008.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianSurtitles, creative captioning as part of the set design and the use ofsmart caption glassesare gradually becoming more common as accessibility improves in theatre. But musicals have still not caught up with opera, which regularly uses surtitles. Rice joked that theatre directors were reluctant to include them “because it means people might spend three seconds not looking at the brilliant direction”. He singled out Hamilton’s performers for their skill in clearly conveying Lin-Manuel Miranda’s lyrics.Last year, the US star Patti LuPone – who played Evita in the musical’s original Broadway production – said that manylyrics go mishearddue to a lack of technical training and overbearing sound mixes. “Young performers have no idea how to project,” added LuPone, who will performa solo concert in London this monthat the Coliseum.Reviewing a production of Evita at the Dominion in London in 2014, the Guardian’sMichael Billington wrote: “Has anyone thought of using surtitles in musicals? I ask because the one flaw in this highly skilled revival … is the lack of attention to vocal detail. We lose many of the heavily amplified words, and that matters in a musical that rests on its ambivalent attitude towards its protagonist.”View image in fullscreenPatti LuPone at the Olivier awards in 2019.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesRice said that he and Lloyd Webber were “hired hands” on Sherlock Holmes and the 12 Days of Christmas, created by Humphrey Ker and David Reed from the comedy troupeThe Penny Dreadfuls. The songwriter said they had provided “half a dozen little light moments” for the yuletide mystery (a play with songs rather than a full musical) which features Arthur Conan Doyle’s Baker Street sleuth investigating the deaths of West End actors.Humorous lyrics were easier to write than serious or romantic ones, he said. “If it’s a funny song, you can use almost any word. Often just the fact that it rhymes with something else is the joke.” Rice quoted a couplet from another of his hits with Lloyd Webber, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat: “All these things you saw in your pyjamas / Are a long-range forecast for your farmers.” At the time he thought that was just an efficient rhyme. “It’s actually very funny – I don’t think I realised!”Explore more on these topicsTheatreTim RiceAndrew Lloyd WebberMusicalsArthur Conan DoyleComedynewsShareReuse this content"

You have to actually eat human flesh. So no.”Hammer was accusedof rape and physically abusive behaviourin 2021 by a woman, known as Effie, who claimed he raped her in 2017, and shared screenshots of graphic texts allegedly sent by Hammer, which included one where the actor appeared to declare himself a cannibal. At least two other women subsequently came forward with accusations of sexual coercion and emotional abuse from Hammer between 2017 and 2020, including ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze.Authorities in LA county declined to pursue sexual assault charges against Hammer, and hepreviously denied the claims in an interview with Tyler Ramsey in 2024.Hammer told Theroux that he is “not going to argue the messages” but that they formed “one side of a conversation”, and that “it [was] fun to joke about if I was stoned or drunk or like laughing as I was typing these messages”.Hammer also denied that he ate an animal’s entire heart, saying: “You take a bite out of the heart, and you’ve got all your buddies around you, they’re goading you on … it’s sort of like an almost overly charged male rite of passage when you go hunting for your first time. Everyone that I know who went hunting for their first time had to do something similar.”The actor denied that his behaviour was criminal: “I left a lot of people in that wake very angry at me for my behaviour … Asshole behaviour. There’s no way around that … Does it make me a dick? Absolutely. Like, I, I have no problem admitting that. I was a dick. That’s not illegal.”Hammer said that after the scandal erupted and much of his acting work was cancelled, he entered a “trauma treatment facility” which he described as “one of the most helpful things that I’ve ever done for myself”. He said that more acting work was coming his way, having just completed a film in the US and with “offers coming in every week”.He also said that he “loved” his short-termjob selling timeshares in the Cayman Islandsand that he also held down jobs as a school greenskeeper and an apartment block manager. “I was at the point in my life where, like, things were so bleak that having anything to do felt amazing.” However, he says he was denied a work visa by the Caymans and is unable to live there permanently.Hammer was also asked by Theroux whether, if he was offered a role, would he work with Woody Allen. The actor replied: “If I say, ‘no, I would never work with Woody Allen’, then all I’m doing is saying, ‘I believe in this system that cancels people.’ I think what I would honestly do is I’d say, I’d like to sit down with him first, and I’d like to talk to him.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

While husband Jared (François Arnaud) is unexpectedly delighted at fatherhood, her new role chafes at an existential level. Son Alex won’t settle in her hands, Jared pushes her to take care of the house while she’s busy expressing milk and, rather than dealing with a burning meal, she smashes her smoke detector. “It’s better to accept you need to try, than be ashamed you need to try,” says Meredith’s therapist of her misfiring maternal affections. But by the time she is seeing visions of cribs overflowing with blood, and of Alex as a young boy, it feels like she needs far more regular sessions.Mom never overcomes the key stumbling block that hobbles much elevated horror: there is a clear and irrefutable psychological explanation that neuters the film’s paranormal side. But, after a crucial horrifying incident, debut director Adam O’Brien doubles down effectively by dropping us deep into that psyche and pulling up the ladder. Trapped alone in a house shot in pale, Stygian hues, with Meredith also looking increasingly phantom-like, she is left in a miasma of guilt, self-justification and attempts at self-staged redemption via her son’s apparition.These manifestations aren’t very original, especially the lank-haired, Ringu-esque girl that shadows Alex. And sealing us inside Meredith’s agony leaves the narrative with no particular destination other than general disintegration, as cracks appear in the walls Repulsion-style and water gushes through the floor. If the film is frustratingly nebulous as its layers of reality intermingle, it is a neonatal nightmare that undoubtedly envelops you in its feelbad embrace.Mom is on digital platforms from 17 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus, there’s a faintly amusing retro vibe that harks back not just to low-budget 1970s horror of yore, but also to the so-called“quota quickies”from the 1930s onwards, British film fare made by the yard.Set during the second world war on an island off the coast ofScotland, the film takes place almost entirely within the confines of a nunnery called St Augustine’s. That said, there’s an opening sequence where a nun is pursued by a wolf outside, a beast so happy to be playing with the actor his tail is up and wagging the whole time – he looks about as menacing as a cockapoo. She manages to escape being licked to death and gets inside where we meet the other players. Wafty Mother Superior (Maryam d’Abo) seems a couple beads short of a full rosary, which also goes for several of the fervent sisters: devout Valerie (Elle O’Hara), intense Agnes (Amber Doig-Thorne), and so on. The most relatable may be Eleanor (Michaela Longden), the least devout of the lot, and prone to lapses in sobriety. There are also two men employed as caretakers: Amos (Paul Barber from The Full Monty) and a younger former soldier, Daniel (Nathan Shepka, who is also one the film’s co-directors as well as co-writer), who is hot for all the comely nunfolk.When a mysterious infant boy is dropped off at the nunnery’s door, all hell breaks loose. Well, not quite hell; more like low-level demonic possession, as nun after nun starts hearing the voice of the devil telling them to take care of his kid and if they won’t do that, kill themselves instead. Things soon get quite fractious, and before long there’s a lot of bloody nun-on-nun violence, at one climactic point observed by two bored looking cherubim looking on from a painting. A little more psychological ambiguity might have elevated proceedings, but Shepka and co-director Andy Crane opt for full horror, with an evil horned puppet demon baby in the last act that’s just silly, but in a sort of fun way.The Baby in the Basket is on digital platforms from 17 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsPeriod and historical filmsSecond world warScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

This hidden, shameful family history was almost lost to time, almost forgotten, but Kiefer couldn’t let that happen. So he put on the overcoat and “Sieg Heil”-ed all across Europe, taking pictures along the way. This early art project in the late-1960s was the German artist attempting to embody and confront the past.A picture of him doing the banned salute – forbidden in Germany under the long process of denazification – is at the heart of this show of his early works. He stands, arm raised, against a barbed-wire fence in shimmering, solarised black and white. It’s a ghostly and quiet photo, but amazingly powerful in its simplicity. That overcoat became a historical burden for Kiefer to bear in the first gesture of an artistic career dedicated to raking through history so that it would not be forgotten, or repeated.The war is everywhere here. Three thick, gloopy paintings of soldiers show men who are scarred and haunted. A watercolour of a grim, desolate interior is based on a photo of an abandoned building designed for the Nazi regime. Stark woodcut portraits of Kant, Nietzsche and ancient Germanic leaders who defeated the Romans are collaged together in a pastiche of Nazi idols. Even the still life of a jug and a loaf of bread is Kiefer asking if you can still paint pretty images after the horrors of the Holocaust.View image in fullscreenSubtlety and power … Kiefer at work in his studio.Photograph: Courtesy Barbara KlemmThere are endless references to mythology and Wagner, used by the Nazis as implements of soft power. Any artist might question their calling when they are confronted with how easily their work can be twisted to enforce fascism. But Kiefer knew he could make his point with subtlety. A vast brown smudge of a painting hides a tank and a horse, in reference to an early battle in the second world war when Polish cavalry attacked a German infantry unit. A field is not farmland or countryside any more, it’s a war zone, a place of traumatic cultural memory.This is when Kiefer’s work is the most affecting. The early directness is great, but when the horror is implied instead of stated, it sends you reeling. There’s one single small watercolour of a forest here – an almost throwaway, simple painting – but it’s now so full of war, death, the Holocaust and blood that you can see nothing else.There are works here which are totally personal: a whole wall of small tree and lake paintings scrawled over with Anselm and his first wife Julia’s names. But even these have political and historical significance: they’re Kiefer trying desperately to understand how to become a new husband, a new father, in a land so heavily burdened by history. Can you reclaim a forest that was a mass grave? Can you find joy in a lake, where shame stains the waters you swim in? This work is all about ghosts you can’t banish, demons you can’t exorcise, traumas you can’t – and shouldn’t – forget.View image in fullscreenScarred landscape … Wald (Forest), 1973–74.Photograph: Adam Reich/© Anselm KieferHis more recent work tends towards the grandiose, the overwhelming, and the often overbearingly complex. But here in his youth, his message is direct and so powerful. It’s not that every work here is good – there are plenty of duds (the three paintings of a dancer in the first room are pretty heinous, and opening with a bunch of garish new works is a mistake) – but for the most part, it’s just so visceral, so aggressively confrontational, so historically important. This is an artist making a whole nation deal with itself.‘Our house was bombed the night I was born’: Anselm Kiefer on the nightmares he can’t escapeRead moreAnd maybe you’re looking at the work and thinking: “So what, it was 80 years ago, it’s over.” But then someone like Elon Musk does what looks like a Sieg Heil on live TV, or Donald Trump calls for the ethnic cleansing of a whole region, or Nigel Farage is on the cover of a major weekly publication railing against immigrants, and you realise that Kiefer’s right; the past hasn’t been processed, it hasn’t been erased, it’s right here, it’s now. And we’re on the verge of letting it all happen again.Anselm Kiefer: Early Works is at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, from 14 February to 15 JuneExplore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsAnselm KieferreviewsShareReuse this content"

But in this blustery yet brilliant fourth collection from the Canadian-born, UK based poetJR Carpenter, weather becomes a fascinating central theme.As Carpenter charts the chaos of twisted umbrellas and cancelled flights, it is her avalanche of abstract questions that strike with most force. “Where does the wind go?” “How does the mist steam?” “Are shadows considered weather?” If weather is everywhere, then must our “measure” of it change?There is magic in her minute studies of ocean spray, and each “spoondrift” of snow that sugars the landscape like a spell. Yet she is not a poet with her head in the clouds – a darker truth emerges, measuring weather on an imperial scale:For most of human historythe ship was the fastest we could travel.The furthest we could think.Wind was the invisible forcepowering colonial expansion.The troubled history of the “Treaty 6 Territory” agreement, signed in 1876, between the Canadian crown and various First Nations, haunts this poet as a self-confessed “child of settlers”. Born near the early European settlement of Port Royal, Nova Scotia, the speaker begins to “measure” the world based on the ancient wisdom of “old woman bear”. As penance, perhaps, she commits to lifting “the linguistic cloak of colonialism” – a thought-provoking endeavour, starting with the imperial measurement system that fuelled trade across the British empire.Fragmentary and fleeting, like the wind they chase, these poems rarely stay still for longAs Carpenter moves away from the cold instruments of science and conquest – the thermometer measuring temperature; the barometer measuring atmosphere – it is fascinating to see poetry become a pressure gauge of a different kind. A sentometer, if you like, that calculates human sentiment – how weather has long captured minds and hearts.Some of these poems burn with rage towards colonialism; others query the patriarchal forces that weathered the scientific ambitions of women. Of Glass is a razor-sharp ode to Margaret Cavendish,the first woman to attend a meeting of the Royal Societydespite protests from the all-male fellows. Of a New Comet celebrates Caroline Herschel, the first woman to discover a comet and be paid for her work in astronomy. A startling range of stories takes us far beyond the cloudline, casting weather in a surprisingly celestial light.View image in fullscreenJR Carpenter: an ‘avalanche of abstract questions’.Photograph: The Banff CentreFragmentary and fleeting, like the wind they chase, these poems rarely stay still for long. After gazing upwards to the heavens, Carpenter glances forwards to the hellish weather patterns in a warming world. A change in temperature is typically “too small to be seen”; it flickers like a “flea in the dark”. Yet inMeasures of Weatherthis flea glows fiercely: in a time of darkness, these poems offer a guiding light. In Of River, a deluge of dismal predictions are released as “rain like we haven’t seen for some time/ stains the parched fields green” and “pummelled plums fall” like “purple eggs from the sky” – a terrifying forecast soon offset by Carpenter’s playful approach.I enjoyed the clever use of concrete poetry in Of Coast, which maps out a tape measure using hyphens, and the lively embrace of autocorrection in Of River Ice. Carpenter holds on to the experimental hallmark that defined her previous collectionsThisIs a Picture of WindandAn Ocean of Static. Strangely, I did not tire of each poem being titled “Of” something ; the poet circles around each concept like a literary tourbillon, a whirlwind of wonder, promising a thrilling yet thought-provoking ride.Measures of Weatherby JR Carpenter is published byShearsman Books(£12.95)Of Watches by JR Carpentertime exceeds language.face and hands are wordsborrowed from the body.watch, a word for vigilance.pocket, a soft absence.time, a frame.in the present tense we wind upusing the same word as wind,a general disturbance of air.in the past, tense.keyed up.tightly wound.a ticking time.does not heal all.we use the word to wound.Explore more on these topicsPoetryThe ObserverCanadareviewsShareReuse this content"

After her death from Alzheimer’s, her husband, the novelist and teacher Kenzaburo (Lily Franky), is given a letter written in the early stages of her diagnosis in which she asks him to travel from Tokyo to the Lake District to scatter her ashes in that cherished location. Though he has a strained relationship with their son, Toshi (Ryo Nishikido), Kenzaburo allows him and his family to come along on the emotional expedition, only to feel constrained by the timetable that Toshi imposes. Soon, the old man is off on his own, pedalling around the English countryside without a map.Expanded by Dickinson from his 2013 short film Usagi-san (AKA Mr Rabbit), Cottontail is simultaneously tender and inconsequential, forever reaching for a profundity that remains beyond its grasp. Despite minor difficulties, everything pans out the way one would expect: father and son overcome their problems to become closer; friendships with benevolent strangers are kindled en route (including with a widowed farmer and his daughter, played by real-life father and daughter Ciarán and Aoife Hinds); and Windermere is eventually reached, the camera soaring just as the score does likewise.The film is not without its rewards, mostly found in Andrew Jadavji’s editing, which allows past and present to flow gently into one another, and in Franky’s understated performance as the widower not quite in touch with his family, his feelings or the world at large – but doing his best.Cottontail is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBeatrix PotterJapanreviewsShareReuse this content"

But, disappointingly, the sloths in this kids’ animation don’t look much like sloths, nor do they seem to act anything like their real-life counterparts. The movie is the latest fromThe Tales from Sanctuary City, an Australian franchise set in a vegan metropolis where animals have learnt to coexist in harmony.Like the earlier moviesin the series, it’s perfectly adequate for little kids but with little character of its own and a straight-to-download-style blandness.Essentially, this is a film about foodies and the delights of slow cooking. Laura (voiced by Teo Vergara) is a rebellious teenage sloth from the sticks who works in the family restaurant, cooking recipes handed down for generations. But Laura longs to live at a faster pace than her parents, and gets her wish after a storm destroys their village. The family is forced to relocate to Sanctuary City and make a fresh start, opening a food truck selling enchiladas and tamales. Laura even meets her culinary hero, fast-food entrepreneur Dotti Pace (Leslie Jones), a cheetah in cowboy boots and rhinestones.Dotti is by miles the most fun character, all deep-south charm and a ravenous appetite for money and power. But her latest invention, a caffeinated energy ball, is so disgusting that not even a dung beetle will eat it. Elsewhere, the characters and messaging around family and belonging all feel rather stale. The script adds a sprinkle of wisecracks for adults (“season the moment” anyone?), but none had me giggling like the line from Laura’s inquisitive new platypus friend: “My mummy says sloths only poop once a week – is that true?”The Sloth Lane is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsLeslie JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the invasion, of course, changed everything. What purpose did fiction have now, Amelina wondered? Wanting fervently to be useful, in the next weeks and months she worked in a humanitarian warehouse in Lviv, found vital medicines for those who needed them, and helped to evacuate both civilians and their pets from the most dangerous corners of the country. Most significantly of all, she volunteered as a war crimes researcher, training with a Kyiv-based NGO calledTruth Hounds.If such work was horrifying, it was also inspirational. Soon, she was thinking of a different kind of literary project: a book about the women who, like her, were taking huge risks to document the war. She would write this book in English, and in it she would deploy a purposeful jumble of interviews, diary entries, reports from field missions, Ukrainian history and even poetry. Such a book, she believed, wouldn’t only play its small part in holding the perpetrators accountable; one day, it would help to give “lasting peace a chance”. For a year, she worked on it, even as she performed all her other roles. On 27 June 2023, however, she was in a pizzeria in Kramatorsk in Donetsk when it was hit by a Russian missile. Sixty-four people were injured and 13 killed. Amelina died in hospital a few days later.Looking at Women, Looking at Warwas then far from finished. But after they’d said goodbye to her, a group of friends and colleagues – Tetyana Teren, Yaryna Grusha, Sasha Dovzhyk and Amelina’s husband, Alex Amelin – decided to try to make her manuscript publishable. What she had completed, they would leave alone; what she had not, they would supplement with transcriptions of audio files, material from earlier drafts and copious footnotes. The result, as they acknowledge in an afterword, is a patchwork that is sometimes difficult to follow – and yet, the gaps are so eloquent. Amelina’s absence may be felt on every page. The reader’s confusion, experienced by me as a terrible slow-wittedness, is one of the book’s most powerful effects. It slows you down. It transmits a powerful sense of chaos. It compels attentiveness, as the TV news does not.In Bucha, the deputy mayor’s son plays close by as a team work on body identificationThe protocols involved in documenting war crimes are precise and extremely rigorous, andLooking at Women, Looking at Wargoes into some detail on this score. The book includes in its entirety a report of the last mission Amelina undertook (she travelled with a colleague whose codename is Casanova to Balakliia, a community in Kharkiv oblast) and if you’ve never set eyes on such a document before, to do so is chastening, to put it mildly. The baldness of the words – this might as well be a mortgage application, for all the adjectives it contains – only makes the rapes, torture and detentions it outlines seem the more abominable. Such exactness, written ledger-style over several pages, provides a chilling sense of scale, for this is just one place among hundreds, perhaps thousands.But the sections of the book I found most vivid arrive earlier on, as Amelina tries repeatedly to come to terms with what is happening. For a decade, she writes, Ukrainians had been prepared for war without ever grasping that it is impossible truly to be ready for a world turned upside down. When war first breaks out, she is on holiday with her small son; as the explosions begin, she’s marooned in an Egyptian airport, all flights toUkrainecancelled. In the end, she travels by plane to Warsaw, and thence overland via Prague to Ukraine – a journey that in itself reminds the complacent European, safe in Paris or London, of just how close the conflict is.View image in fullscreenA woman holds a photo of Victoria Amelina at a memorial service in Kyiv on 4 July 2023.Photograph: Alex Chan Tsz Yuk/ShutterstockSurreal is an overused adjective, but only it will do in these circumstances. Arriving in Kharkiv for work, she and her colleagues use Google Maps to find their hotel, even as the air raid sirens sound. In her childhood home outside Lviv, she writes of feeling “illogically safe”, in spite of the fact that the apartment is close to a legitimate military target. In Kharkiv, she watches two men playing ping-pong, to the thump of regular explosions. In Bucha, the deputy mayor’s son plays close by as a team working on body identification examine a pile of gruesome photographs.How to process such things? As the months roll on, it’s sometimes hard to feel anything at all. Her colleague Oleksandra Matviichuk tells her that when this happens, she should find a pot of face cream and rub it into her cheeks: its coldness, softness and scent will bring her back to life, she’ll find. And it’s true. After a day of heavy bombardments in Kyiv – people are saying the Russians’ target is a monument to the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko – Amelina tries it for herself, and it works. Such details doubtless won’t be found in any of the bigger, more complete books that will one day be written about the war in Ukraine, but to me they are of inestimable worth: not fiction but written, nevertheless, with the fine sensibility of a novelist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It departed 40 minutes late due to trespassers on the tracks, but the train soon picked up pace, the golden lights of the Belgian capital sweeping through the carriages where groups were stashing skis, families were settling young children and solo travellers stood at the open windows swapping names and stories amid the clamour and confusion on board. This was the inaugural European Sleeper service from Brussels to Venice … only the train wasn’t going to Venice.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Two days earlier, passengers had received an email explaining that the train would be running only as far asVerona, and that a regular Trenitalia service would take us on to Venice. Then, on the evening of departure, we learned that owing to unspecified Italian bureaucracy, the train wouldn’t enter Italy at all, but would be terminating atInnsbruck, with two connections taking us to Verona and then on to Venice.View image in fullscreenDeparture from Brussels … the carriages are dated but have their charms.Photograph: Marc SethiHaving spent the past three years travelling on Europe’s sleeper trains, observing the renaissance of night-time travel, I remained unfazed. For me, the destination is a bonus, the journey the reason for buying my ticket to ride. Strikes, engineering works and red tape are part of the reason Europe’s railway resurgence is meeting resistance.Chris Engelsman and Elmer van Buuren, the founders of European Sleeper which runs the Good Night Train, are all too aware of the problems, but appear to be doing their best in the circumstances – though communication could be better.They are pursuing funding to rent more carriages and improve the interiors of what are largely refurbished German carriages from the 1950s. They know the lights and heating are temperamental, the couchettes battered and bruised, but their goal is to revive night trains at an achievable cost for everyone from students to large families, and I salute their drive and passion.For me, the destination is a bonus, the journey is the reason for buying my ticket to rideOn board I spoke to Engelsman, who explained that the Brussels-Venice route has been introduced as a winter service, scheduled to depart from December to mid-March, with this inaugural journey a test-run of sorts.As long as we arrived in Venice, I wasn’t bothered how many trains it took, and apparently nor was anyone else, most of whom shrugged and pulled out a bottle of wine when asked. Squeezing down the corridors in the direction of the dining car, I peeked into the five-person couchette compartments where mini house parties were in full swing, friends cracking open cans of Jupiler beer, the sweet smell of Ibérico ham and cheese wafting from the open doorways.View image in fullscreenMonisha Rajesh boards the train.Photograph: Marc SethiI got chatting to Sophie and Aurélien, travelling to Innsbruck with their four-year-old son Rodolphe. Hoping to show him snow for the first time, they had searched for a destination that wouldn’t involve flying, climate change driving their decision. Attracted by the €200 fare for a four-person, private couchette, they were travelling on a sleeper train for the first time. Rodolphe was happy to have space to spread out his colouring pens and books.When I first travelled on the Good Night Train in May 2023 – theinaugural route from Brussels to Berlin– there was no dining car, only a harassed-looking attendant wandering up and down serving nachos and instant noodles. So it was a joy to receive an email with a link to book a two- or three-course dinner (€29 or €35).I opened the email within seconds of its arrival and managed to secure a place on one of four shared tables, but was unable to book a meal for my companion as there was only one sitting with a maximum of 16 covers for the whole evening. Fortunately, we realised in advance he wouldn’t get dinner on board, so he had fried aubergine andpepian de chocloat Cantina Valentina, a Peruvian restaurant atThe Hoxton hotel in Brussels.The Hoxton group has fast become my go-to hotel while travelling on sleeper trains owing to its policy of allowing guests to check in at any time of day – perfect for dawn arrivals. As part of its climate-friendly initiatives, the group also offers The Good Rate for guests travelling between hotels by train, knocking £20 or €20 off the stay at each end, enough for a meal before embarking on an onward rail journey.View image in fullscreenMonisha’s fellow passengers proved very sociable in the dining car.Photograph: Marc SethiOn board the Good Night Train, over a starter of beef goulash, followed by chicken curry and rice then tiramisu, I spoke to other passengers. Although some were irritated to receive a link to reserve meals only to find the slots were already booked, others were content to pack food or buy toasted sandwiches and stand around drinking and chatting in the carriage, the windows soon steaming up from the heat of packed-in bodies.Like Jouni, a Finnish passenger, most had booked the train for the sake of travelling by train, curious about the service and keen to support the European Sleeper initiative, charmed by the old carriages which reminded them of youthful Interrailing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Climbing up to my berth, I pressed in earplugs – a must-have on board a rattling train this old – and made a concerted attempt to sleep. I surfaced at 8am, bleary-eyed but pleased to find the dining car busy, with stories of the previous night’s antics being shared over laughter and strong coffee.Most passengers had booked for the sake of travelling by train, charmed by the old carriages which reminded them of youthful InterrailingAn hour before arriving in Innsbruck, sunlight flooded through the windows as the train curved around the Inn River, with the Ellmauer Halt peak rising up from the Kaiser mountain range.At Innsbruck, we were soon on board theÖBB Railjetservice to Verona, which wound its way through the Brenner Pass.From Verona, it was a swift change on to the final leg to Venice and, as the lagoon’s waters came into view, the old city aglow from the sunset, I felt a rush of pleasure and achievement that we’d made it this far by rail. As we ambled out of the station, I realised we were only two hours behind schedule – no bother.

It serves a menu that changes daily with everything from spiced lamb and radicchio lasagne to fried chicory and glazed carrots in sesame.Here, we bumped into fellow passengers from the train, swapping stories of railway exploits over chocolate mousse and hoping that European Sleeper can cut through the red tape before its next departure.A one-way ticket from Brussels to Venice startsat€89a seat.

It takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish, yet still manages to achieve an intense depth of flavour. Serve it how you wish, but I think a fresh, crusty baguette is key, to mop up all those juices, as is a sturdy napkin to tuck into your collar to preserve your clothes from the almost inevitable splash-back. And candles, because mussels always feel romantic to me, even if it is just a regular weeknight.Spiced mussels in coconutPrep5 minCook25 minServes21 tbsp coconut oil1 onion, peeled and finely sliced20g ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks1 tsp ground turmeric1 tsp ground coriander2 tbsp red Thai curry paste1 tbsp tomato puree400ml cancoconut milk1 tsp brown sugar1kg mussels1 lime,juiced½ bunchThai basil, leaves pickedCrusty bread, to servePut a large casserole or heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat, add the coconut oil, sliced onion and ginger, and fry for 10 minutes. Stir in the ground turmeric and coriander, then, after a minute, add the curry paste and tomato puree, and fry for a minute more.Add the coconut milk and brown sugar, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for five minutes, so the sauce thickens and turns rich.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Meanwhile, remove and discard the beards from the mussels, then wash them under a cold tap until the water runs clear; throw away any with broken shells or that stay open when tapped at the edge. When the soup base is ready, add the cleaned mussels, then turn up the heat, cover and cook for five minutes, until all the mussels are open; discard any that do not.Toss the mussels through the sauce, add the lime juice, then tear in the Thai basil and serve with crusty bread.Explore more on these topicsThai food and drinkShellfishFoodMain courseStarterSeafoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

Shred them using a coarse grater, then mix together in a large bowl.Finely slice 200g of crispwhiteorred cabbageand add to the bowl.For the herb mayonnaise, mix together 4 tbsp ofplain yoghurtwith the same amount ofmayonnaiseand season with salt and pepper.Finely chop 2 tbsp each ofcoriander leavesandmint, then stir them into the dressing along with a good squeeze ofblood orangeorlemon juice.Toss the dressing and shredded vegetables together until well combined, then scatter with a handful ofsprouted seeds(radish, mung, sunflower, etc) and the pieces of crisp bacon.Serves 2. Ready in 45 minutesI can recommend smoked almonds as an alternative to the bacon. The hickory-smoked variety are particularly additive. I pick them up in wholefood stores.You could stir a tbsp of curry paste into the mayonnaise if you wish, or a tsp of miso (in which case omit the mint).Celeriac is an alternative to the beetroot, but I recommend keeping the carrot in there for a hint of sweetness.I also like adding a coarsely grated apple to this, too – it works particularly well with a curried mayonnaise.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsSaladNigel Slater's midweek dinnerPorkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 11 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareI often find green cabbage boring. How can I make it more interesting?The cabbage family is vast and, just like most families, its members differ hugely in shape and size, from long and pointed to rotund with solid hearts. What the green members all have in common, however, is their receptiveness to multiple situations, from braising to layering into lasagne, which is good news for those who think they’re a bit dull.Merlin Labron-Johnson, chef/owner ofOsipandThe Old Pharmacy,both in Bruton, Somerset, is no such person, though: “Cabbages are much more versatile than people give them credit for,” he says, “but you do need to apply a bit of imagination.” That might mean blanching the leaves, stuffing them with sausagemeat – “sometimes, I add pistachios, too” – then rolling and braising in the oven. “That’s an interesting way to use up a savoy cabbage.” He suggests serving these cabbage parcels with some pumpkin puree. Alternatively, put hispi in a pot roast: halve the cabbage and lay it cut side down in a hot pan with lots of oil, to get some nice caramelisation. “Finish it in the oven, then carve and dress with chopped herbs, toasted nuts [almonds or hazelnuts, say] or pine nuts, perhaps a few raisins, and a bit of vinegar and olive oil.”Chef Daniel Watkins, meanwhile, would be inclined to fire up the barbecue – even in winter. “It’s my favourite way to bring out the best in all sorts of ingredients,” says the man behind the menu atHoly Carrotin London, which is why you’ll find him outside by the barbecue year-round. “I like to grill hispi cabbage over an open flame and, once it’s beautifully charred, brush with a blend of butter [plant-based, for preference] and miso, or a rich XO sauce, which adds a deep, umami kick.” And if you’re up for a project, he suggests sauerkraut, for which shredded cabbage and salt are roughed up and packed into a sterilised jar. Once fermented, Watkins recommends frying the kraut until crisp, then folding it through some velvety potato puree. Or take a leaf out ofNigel Slater’s book and combine sauerkraut, softened onions, chopped parsley and walnuts, wholegrain mustard, grated fontina and some seasoning, then pile on to pastry to makea savoury galette.Labron-Johnson grows a ton of cabbage on his farm, and at this time of year especially his attention turns to soup, and more often than not that perennial winter favourite,ribollita. “Start with a base of chopped vegetables [onion, carrot, celery, garlic] and maybe some pancetta, lardo or bacon, add cooked white beans and a bit of broth, then finish with the cabbage and lots of olive oil,” he says. You could, of course, also add some bread: “That’s a full meal, and it’s not boring at all!”The Guardian’s ownItalian food expert Rachel Roddyalso hasa cabbage soupup her sleeve to “win over sceptics”. Warm olive oil and butter in a pan, then add sliced savoy and onion, minced garlic and a couple of bay leaves. Once the cabbage has collapsed “completely”, break it up with a fork, pour in water, add salt and a parmesan rind, then simmer for 15 minutes. Next, tip in some carnaroli rice and simmer again for 20 minutes. Finish with grated parmesan and black pepper, and Bob’s your uncle.Got a culinary dilemma?
