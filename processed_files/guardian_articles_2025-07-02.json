A new study has concluded that37% of us can work out whether we’re going to have a good day or a bad day, based on what happens during the first 10 minutes after we wake up.Really? Butisn’t everyone too busy journalling, meditating and sipping room temperature lemon water?God, you’re annoying sometimes.Still, you can’t determine anything in10 minutes.I disagree. This morning I slept through my alarm, realised too late that I’d run out of toilet roll and then pulled the handle off my kitchen drawer.On purpose?No, of course not, but it does explain why I’m having such a terrible day.How so?It takes us about 25 minutes to properly wake up, which is why we usually have a set sequence of events we like to follow. The disruption of that sequence – maybe forgetting to brush your teeth or make coffee or exercise – can have a knock-on effect that reverberates throughout the rest of the day.Wait, everyone has a routine?Almost everyone, yes. Yours might be pretty simple – go to the toilet, make a drink, do some stretching – but other people have slightly more elaborate ones.Such as?Well, Anna Wintour famously likes to playan hour of tennis before her 6am blow-dry.Mark Wahlberg wakes up at 3.30amand then spends time praying. More recently, the influencerAshton Hall shared that he wakes up at 3.52amand immediately starts plunging his face into various ice baths.Yes, me too.Oh really? Either way, these people use their routines to set the foundation of their day. I’m sure that if you sneaked into Hall’s house and stole his ice baths, he’d have a terrible day.I’m not getting up that early.Fine then, do what Cindy Crawford does instead.Which is what?Shelikes to watch the sunrise from the hot tub of her Malibu mansion every morning.Relatable.Even so, an easily repeatable morning routine is the best way to ensure a good day. It helps to streamline it, too. If your first 10 minutes involve making a cup of coffee, you’ll have a better day if you make sure that all your mugs are clean before you go to bed. If they involve going to the toilet, make sure you’ve got plenty of toilet paper, so you won’t end up stuck there until someone kindly brings you some.Was that one just for you?No, let’s pretend it happens to everyone.Do say:“For a better life, start your day with a routine.”Don’t say:“Can that routine involve waking up, panicking for half an hour, then doomscrolling until you’re running late for work?”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingPass notesSleepPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the world needs to see itThe film the BBC refused to air shows the targeting, detainment and torture of medics in Gaza. Its relentless timeline of horrors will never leave youStuart HeritageWed 2 Jul 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 19.03 EDTShareThe biggest, and possibly only, failure of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack is that the circumstances of its broadcast threaten to overshadow its content.A brief recap: this film was first commissioned by the BBC, only to be dropped when another documentary – Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone –sparked a furoreover impartiality.The abandonment drew uproar from within the corporation, scorn from the wider media and the inescapable sense that what started as a vital piece of film-making had devolved into yet another navel-gazing referendum on the purpose of the BBC.Thanks to Channel 4 picking it up late in the day, Gaza: Doctors Under Attack now exists in the world, and it has never been more evident that this is a work that demands to be seen.Doctors Under Attack bills itself as a “forensic investigation” into claims that the IDF has been systematically targeting Palestinian medics in all 36 of Gaza’s hospitals. The attacks, according to the United Nations, follow a set pattern. First, a hospital comes under bombardment, then it is besieged. After that, it is raided by tanks and bulldozers and its medical workers are detained. And then, once the hospital has essentially been rendered non-functional, the forces move on and repeat.It’s a strategy designed to cripple Gaza for years to come, says one talking head. After all, when a building is destroyed, you can throw up another in its place. But medics require years of training. Rob Gaza of their expertise and you deny its chances of ever rebuilding. This is despite, as the film repeats time and time again, healthcare workers being protected under international law.The power of Doctors Under Attack comes in the unhurried way it chooses to unfurl its thesis. There is no clear manipulation, no central villain. What there is, however, is an unceasing timeline of horrors.We are shown doctors doing their best in overwhelmed hospitals with no water or electricity, racing to treat wounds that have already begun to rot. We are shown them coming under what seem like targeted attacks, being detained in black sites where they will be tortured and interrogated. There is footage of a gang rape by soldiers. We are shown children, injured and dead, in vast numbers.The central part of the film, however, is stories of individual doctors. There is Dr Khaled Hamouda, discussing the direct attack on his home that killed 10 members of his family, and the drone strike that moments later hit the house the survivors escaped to. His wife and young daughter dead, he then took refuge in the grounds of his hospital, which was bombarded and raided. He was detained along with 70 other doctors, and beaten.View image in fullscreen‘No water, no electricity’ … surgeons at work in Gaza: Doctors Under Attack.Photograph: Basement FilmsAnd then there is Dr Adnan al-Bursh, who was detained, stripped, interrogated, disappeared and tortured. Unlike Hamouda, we do not get to hear his testimonial, because he died in prison. But we do get to hear the calls he made to his family before then, telling his children to look after their mother. To hear their stories is to be filled with utter hopelessness.There have been several muscular documentaries about the Palestinian territories this year, either setting the table of the conflict or – as with the case ofLouis Theroux’s film The Settlers– trying to understand the psychology behind those who choose to exacerbate it.But Doctors Under Attack is by far the most unsparing. The discussion of what has happened to the detained doctors, verified by an anonymous Israeli whistleblower, is the stuff of nightmares. There are beatings. There is torture. Most unsettlingly of all, there are descriptions of mistreatment by Israeli doctors, who would perform procedures without anaesthetic and inform the prisoners that “You are a criminal and you have to die.”The BBC dropped Doctors Under Attack due to the risk that it created “a perception of partiality”. However, it is hard to square that claim with the film that has aired on Channel 4. Clarification has been sought from the IDF at every turn. The events of 7 October 2023 are shown here just as graphically as the footage of injured Palestinian children. The film-makers understand that the slightest sign of bias would collapse the argument.In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would “make people angry, whichever side they take.” She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you. It will provoke an international reaction, and for extremely good cause. Forget what got it stopped at the BBC. It is here now and, regardless of how that happened, we owe it to the subjects to not look away.Gaza: Doctors Under Attackis on Channel 4nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGazareviewsShareReuse this content"

They called 34 witnesses – from former girlfriends and employees to hotel staff and federal agents – to the stand.Central to the case were two of Combs’s former girlfriends and alleged sex-trafficking victims, singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, who dated Combs from 2007 to 2018, and “Jane”, a former girlfriend from 2021 to 2024.Both of the women described being pressured, coerced and at times threatened into participating in the “freak-offs” which they said Combs orchestrated, watched, masturbated to and sometimes filmed.Twomale escortswould later corroborate that and testify that Combs directed the “freak-offs”.Ventura, who testified while eight months pregnant, describeda relationship marked by physical and emotional abuseandcontrol. She alleged that Combs was frequentlyviolent with her,that he raped her after their breakup in 2018, and that he used threats to exert control over her.Ventura alleged that Combs threatened to release explicit videos of her and cut off financial support or stifle her music career (as she was signed to his label) if she didn’t meet his demands. She said she often used drugs provided by Combs to “dissociate” during the sexual encounters.Janetestifiedthat she initially agreed to the “freak-offs” to please Combs, but that she later felt trapped and “obligated” to perform – particularly after he began paying her rent. Combs used the rent payments as leverage and also threatened to leak explicit videos of her, dismissing her when sheno longer wanted to participatein the “freak-offs”, she said.She also described a 2024 altercation between her and Combs that left her with a black eye.Combs has denied all of the allegations against him. His lawyers have insisted that all sexual activity was consensual andacknowledged his past incidents of domestic violence.His attorneys claim both women were willing participants and cited affectionate, sometimes explicit, text messages between them and Combs. Some texts showed the women expressing enthusiasm for the encounters and others showed that the women helped to organize the events.Jane testified that she occasionally arranged the encounters herself in an effort to maintain some control over who was involved.For Ventura’s part, there were multiple witnesses who took the stand and supported her claims.Several of her friends, along withsinger Dawn Richardand some of Combs’s former employees, testified to seeing Combsphysically assaultVentura. Acelebrity stylistrecalled Ventura expressing reluctance about the “freak-offs” to him and said he heard Combs threaten to shelve her music and leak sex tapes.Ventura’s mother testified that she took out a home equity loan to pay Combs after he allegedly demanded $20,000 “to recoup money he had spent on her because he was unhappy she was in a relationship with Kid Cudi”. She said Combs later sent the money back.Jurorswere shownthe 2016 hotelfootageof Combs kicking and dragging Ventura in a hotel hallway. A security guard testified thatCombs paid him $100,000for the video, in order to suppress it.Prosecutors also introduced broader allegations against Combs.A former personal assistant testifyingunder the pseudonym “Mia” accused Combs of physically and sexually assaulting her multiple times during her employment, and said that she felt“trapped”.Defense attorneyssuggested she fabricated the allegations, citing social media postsand textsafter the alleged assaults in which she is seen praising Combs.Rapper Scott Mescudi, known as Kid Cudi, who briefly dated Ventura during a break in her and Combs’s relationship,claimedthat after Combs learned of their relationship, Combs broke into his home.Weeks later, Mescudi’s car was firebombed. Mescudi believes that Combs was responsible for that act, but Combs has denied any involvement.Former employeeCapricorn Clarktestifiedthat on the morning of the alleged break-in, Combs “kidnapped” her at gunpoint and forced her to accompany him to Mescudi’s home.She accused Combs of threatening her, subjecting her to lie detector tests, and once pushing her.The defense disputed Clark’s kidnapping claim, and noted that over the years, Clark had returned to work for Combs multiple times.Six of Combs’s former personal assistants testified, some under immunity. Several described how they were expected tostock Combs’s hotel roomswith condoms, baby oil, lubricant and illicit drugs, and clean upthe rooms afterward.One said that“protecting” Combs’s image was “very important”. AnotherrecalledCombs once bringing three guns to a potential confrontation with a rival rap executive.Federal agents who testified recalled discovering unregistered guns, drugs and large amounts of baby oil during raids at Combs’s homes. Additional witnesses included varioushotel staff,local law enforcement officers,friends of Ventura,homeland security agents, apsychologist, amakeup artistand other former employees.Combs’s attorneys repeatedly sought to challenge the credibility of many of the witnesses, often questioning their recollection and the extent of Combs’s control over their decisions.Midway through the trial a jurorwas dismissedafter claiming that he lived in the Bronx, but later telling a court staff member he lived in New Jersey – rendering him ineligible for the panel.Combs’s team objected to his removal, noting that he was one of only two Black men on the panel. He was replaced with a white man from Westchester.Both sides rested on 24 June, with the defense opting not to call any witnesses of its own. Instead, they submitted evidence to the court, and relied on their extensive cross-examinations throughout the trial.Combs did not testify, but was a constant, active presence in court, often seen whispering to his lawyers and reacting visibly to testimony. At one point, the judgewarnedthat he could be removed for “nodding vigorously” at the jury.During closing arguments,the government outlined their case againstCombs, describing him as “the leader of a criminal enterprise” who refused to “take no for an answer” and as someone who wielded “power, violence and fear to get what he wanted”.Combs’s attorneys urged the jury to acquit Combs,dismissing thegovernment’s case against Combs as “false” and “exaggerated”. They attempted to frame Ventura and Jane not as victims but as consenting adults.As the trial has been a global spectacle, some celebrities have entered the discourse surrounding it.Rapper 50 Cent blasted Combs on social media, while the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye Westbriefly visited the courthouseto support Combs during the fifth week of trial.During closing arguments, Yereleased a songwith one of Combs’s sons titled Diddy Free.Even Donald Trump was asked about the Combs case, and whether he would consider pardoning Combs if convicted. Trump said that he would have to“look at the facts”as he had not been following the case closely.Beyond this trial, Combs facesover 30 civil lawsuits, accusing him of sexual assault. He denies all allegations.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An intrusion into something deeply private. A grief observed.Rachel Reeves breaking down in tears.Her face lined with misery as Keir Starmer failed to guarantee she would still be in her job at the next election. A reminder that politicians are humans too. If you prick us, do we not bleed?Rachel, a woman alone in the uncaring, public gaze of prime minister’s questions. A mere punchbag for the leader of the opposition. Undefended by Starmer. Keir couldn’t even bring himself to make sure she was OK. Too wrapped up in his own world. Maybe he didn’t even notice. Too busy trying to protect his own reputation.In the brutal world of Westminster, it’s now every person for themselves. Perhaps it was always that way. Politicians just like to kid themselves otherwise. Only at the end did Reeves’s sister, Ellie, get the chance to comfort her.It wasn’t meant to be this way. For the past few years,Labourhas been the Keir and Rachel show – the rest of the party there to make up the numbers. Keir to be the frontman, Rachel to be the economic brains behind the operation. The woman to reassure the country and the markets that Labour was credible.In opposition, they were the perfect couple, the antidote to Tory incompetence. Now their joint project is in chaos. On Tuesday night, the Commons was reduced to something like the farce of the Brexit years as last-minute concessions were made.The welfare bill reduced to the status of WINO. Welfare In Name Only. The legislation gutted and£5bn lost in planned government savings.Money that Rachel didn’t have and for which she was being asked to carry the can. Welcome to Labour’s first 2024 election anniversary on Friday. Just the success story they had in mind on election night. This was never going to be an easy PMQs for Starmer. Or for any of the cabinet, for that matter. Most of them looked as if they had been up for days. Several sleepless, long, dark nights of the soul. Few caught one another’s eyes.Liz Kendall never made it to the frontbench. She preferred to stay hidden behind the speaker’s chair. Presumably on the advice of her therapist. She had spent enough time getting humiliated the day before. Enough was enough.Keir himself looked pasty grey. Attempting a grin as the ironic Tory cheers outdid those from his own benches as he took his place at the dispatch box. Trying to normalise things. As if everything that had happened to his government in the past few days was par for the course.And he settled in nicely with a friendly question from Labour’s Paul Waugh. The kind of question that will get you a long way with the whips. Would he agree that Labour had done brilliantly on free school meals? Unsurprisingly, he would.Over to Kemi Badenoch. Surely even she couldn’t mess this one up. An open goal. All she needed to do was tap the ball over the line. For a while, it looked as if she might not manage even that. But somehow the ball rolled slowly into the net for her first ever win against Starmer. Though Keir could probably thank his lucky stars that he wasn’t facing someone else. Then it could have been an annihilation.The thing with Kemi is that her manner is so off-putting. That weird sense of superiority when she has so little to be superior about. The arrogance and the condescension. The perpetual sneer. The feeling she is permanently doing the rest of us a favour. All of which makes it hard to like her. Your sympathies are naturally drawn to whoever her opponent happens to be.Kemi began with a gratuitous swipe at Waugh. Everyone knew he was trying to limit the damage to his party and every MP has been used as toady fodder at some time. The gracious thing to do would have been to ignore it. But Kemi just can’t help herself. She’s never yet passed up the opportunity to kick a man when he’s down. Any backbencher is fair game to her. Then on to the main question. How much money would the welfare bill save?This prompted a bit of euphoric recall from Keir. Memories of the welfare bill he had wanted it to be. It would be the best bill ever. It was like the day before had never happened. The Tories had broken the system and Labour were mending it. There were millions of people back in work and everyone couldn’t be happier with the way things had gone during the government’s first year.Now it was Kemi’s turn to indulge her own fantasies. The Tory attacks always look better on paper than they are in reality. Because the Conservatives have got their own record of failure to defend. You can’t go around blaming someone else for not yet fixing what you broke. Except you can if you are Kemi. She must be the only person who thinks the Tories left government having improved the welfare system.Then we came to the tears. Kemi observed that the chancellor was toast. How long would she be around? This was too much for Rachel. Labour would later try to claim she had something else on her mind but it didn’t look that way at the time. Rachel does care. She has wanted to be chancellor for years. She might yet even turn out to be a good one. Just will she be asked to lay down her life to save Keir’s?Not everyone in Westminster gets to have a second chance. Not even Kemi. The chances of her still being leader of the opposition come the next election are even worse than Rachel’s.There was time for one hostile question from his own benches. This from Kim Johnson asking where his much-promisedHillsboroughlaw had got to. Starmer insisted it was on its way.Other Labour MPs chose to keep things constituency related. Desperate not to rock the boat. Wanting to forget WINO. At least for 30 minutes. Keir tried to sound appreciative. Anxious to prove he was a listening man. He could start by hearing Rachel.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesThe politics sketchLabourPMQsKeir StarmerHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

We meet the ‘social urbanists’ credited with reducing crime – and even temperaturesOliver WainwrightWed 2 Jul 2025 11.13 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 12.17 EDTShareLilac-flowering creepers engulf an abandoned house on a street corner in Medellín,Colombia, spilling from the roof and smothering most of the upstairs windows. A giant fan palm is visible through one opening, while a knotty tangle of aerial roots cascades down to the pavement from another. Step through the doorway of this overgrown ruin, and you find not a scene of desolation and decay but a sleek steel frame holding up the crumbling facade, which forms an unusual entrance to an enchanting new public park.“We behaved more like archaeologists than landscape architects,” says Edgar Mazo of Connatural, the firm behind theParque Prado, in the working-class neighbourhood of Aranjuez. He leads me through a series of planted terraces; fountain grasses and trumpet trees sprout from where a derelict car park and abandoned homes once stood. “You dig up the concrete, water gets into the ground, vegetation grows up, and the people come back,” he adds, speaking through a translator. “That’s natural regeneration.”If you dig up the concrete, water gets into the ground, vegetation grows – and people come backIn recent decades, Medellín has been widely celebrated for its astonishing urbantransformation. In the 2000s, it went from being one of the most dangerous cities on the planet, riven by murderous drug cartels, to a case study in the miraculous peace-bringing powers of architecture and landscape. Sergio Fajardo, the son of an architect who served as Medellín’s charismatic mayor from 2004 to 2008, was hailed for sprinkling the city’s poorest neighbourhoods with dazzling new libraries, stadiums and swimming pools.These determinedly “iconic” projects were enthusiastically feted on the pages of glossy design magazines, and their stories recounted in keynotes at international conferences. Impoverished hillsides were connected to a new metro system with an elegant web of cable cars and outdoor escalators, while parks dotted with expressive architect-designed canopies sprang up across the city. The dramatic fall in crime during Fajardo’s term was largely credited to this vision of “social urbanism”, and the increase in the amount of public space per citizen.View image in fullscreenNatural colonisers … kids and plants now have free rein.Photograph: Isaac RamirezBut the Medellín miracle has since lost some of its sparkle. Take theBiblioteca España, one of the flagship projects, designed by Colombian star architect Giancarlo Mazzanti. It stands as a striking cluster of chiselled concrete boulders, rising from the hillside in the formerly no-go barrio of Santo Domingo. But it has been shuttered since 2015,due tostructural defects. Or look at the outdoor escalators, which snake their way up the slopes of Comuna 13, one of the most notorious gangland neighbourhoods. Built to improve access for residents of the steep hillside, they have now become an overrun tourist attraction for Pablo Escobar-themed slum tours (which are often run in cahoots with the gangs). With more than 25,000 visitors riding the moving stairs here each week, localsbarely have spaceto use them.Temperatures have reduced by 3C. Birds and frogs that hadn’t been seen in the city for decades have returnedMazo’s work takes a markedly different approach from the 00s penchant for spectacle. When he was asked to look at the sloping half-hectare site in Aranjuez, which was home to a rundown car park and six boarded-up houses, abandoned for more than a decade, there was an existing plan to raze everything and replace it with a park traversed by a big zigzagging ramp. It looked like a hangover from the earlier lust for shape-making, something that might photograph well from a helicopter.Instead, Mazo and his team decided to keep most of what was already there. Almost 70% of the material on-site remains, albeit in a new form. Walls and floor slabs were chiselled from the two-storey parking structure, and the rubble used to fill the basements of the houses, with soil packed on top. The buildings’ roof timbers were reclaimed and used to make benches, while the landscape was shaped in such a way that rainwater is retained, meaning that no artificial irrigation is needed. The team even collected seeds from the plants that had sprung up on the plot, so they could be scattered around the new park after the project’s construction – allowing the natural colonisers back in.View image in fullscreenReclaimed … old bricks and roof tiles serve as retaining walls.Photograph: Connatural ArchiveThe project was built during the pandemic for a cost of just $1.5m (£1.1m), and the lockdowns allowed time for the plants to establish, without the threat of being trampled by visitors. Five years on, the planting has reached a level of maturity that makes this urban oasis seem like it’s always been there – a rare fruition of the Covid-era prophecies of nature reclaiming the city.The result is a beguiling place, where the sloping topography is mediated not by a great switchback ramp, but by a series of stepped terraces and slopes that form little outdoor rooms. The former car park’s concrete frame makes for an imposing armature at the centre of the park, supporting a raised steel walkway and framing a series of semi-enclosed spaces beneath it. Reclaimed bricks and stacked roof tiles serve as retaining walls, creating a rugged backdrop to lush clumps of grasses and palms. Gabion cages filled with rocks and rubble line water retention ponds, and provide platforms for seating. A sandy clearing down below makes space for ballgames and events, while park-goers can watch the action from the terraced decks above, and enjoy a grandstand view across the sprawling city and its seven hills.“When people first colonised this valley,” says Mazo, “they used to climb up to the top of the hills to communicate with each other. The park now becomes part of that system, giving people an elevated view to connect with others.”View image in fullscreenUrban oasis … an aerial view.Photograph: Connatural ArchiveCrucially, there’s a space for everyone here – from elevated walkways, to quiet shrub-lined reading areas, to seating tucked away from prying eyes. The sense of fragmentation, as well as the level changes, allow different social groups to coexist. On a Tuesday afternoon, most of these different compartments have their own distinct visitors. A student sits cross-legged on a bench by a giant monstera plant, drawing, while a couple canoodle on the deck above him. A solo pensioner takes in the view from the top, enjoying the shade of a kapok tree. Dog-walkers come and go, while a pair of middle-aged guys get stoned in one corner, not very well hidden behind fluffy fronds of purple grass.Parque Prado was one of thepilot projectsof the city’s Plan de Renaturalización, an initiative launched in 2016 to introduce 120 neighbourhood parks (20 of which Mazo was commissioned to design) and 30 green corridors, ripping up asphalt and concrete to improve groundwater infiltration, and planting urban orchards to mitigate the effects of climate crisis. In some areas, temperatures have reduced by as much as 3C, while several species of birds, lizards and frogs have returned, which hadn’t been seen in the city for decades. There have been harder-to-measure social impacts, too.“Some local residents were initially worried about the park,” says Mazo. “The area had become known for drug addicts and prostitution, and they thought it would only make things worse.” The opposite has happened. By creating space for different walks of life to mingle, “people are mixing here without any problems”, he says. “Some people assume that a completely flat, open surface with no vegetation means you can have more surveillance,” he adds. “But if you have different shapes, levels and conditions, people can identify with the space, feel more comfortable and take care.”Local residents have taken such ownership over the park that they voluntarily clean it up and have started doing some guerrilla gardening – planting seeds for the space to take on a life of its own.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureColombiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not an exact science, it’s a guesstimate. Thing is, I play so many shows, and so many of them are just like impromptu that we really don’t know. So I think it’d be a bit much to really get the bells and whistles out. We think it’s the Block9 show in the afternoon tomorrow – we think! But no candles, sadly.“I’m very, very proud of my relationship with Glastonbury and my history with it and I’m lucky, because as a DJ, you can play multiple sets. Obviously, there’s probably people who’ve been to more Glastonburys, but they’ve only played one show per festival – that’s not going to get you into big high figures.”When I take my shoes off I stop being reasonable Norman and I become irresponsible FatboyView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFire it up! Fatboy Slim at Lonely Hearts Club“My first Glasto show was on the Pyramid stage in 1986 with the Housemartins, and we didn’t know anything really about Glastonbury or festivals. We’d never played in daylight before – we only ever played in clubs – and also we thought that Glastonbury was full of bearded hippies who would probably throw mud and bottles of piss out at us. So we went on quite nervous and quite agitated, but that was quite good in the Housemartins, channelling that aggression – we had the nice tunes, but there was a lot of aggression. We made an awful lot of friends, and it changed our view about Glastonbury. The only weird thing was me and Paul [Heaton] have both had fairly successful careers, but neither of us had managed to get back on the Pyramid stage for 38 years. Last year, Paul played the Pyramid stage and he phoned me up and said, ‘Will you come on anddo a song with us, just to celebrate?’”View image in fullscreenFatboy Slim prepares before performing at Lonely Hearts Club stageView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDropping bangers at Lonely Hearts Club, with Stella McCartney backstage“My favourite Glastonbury moment was playing for [Rob da Bank’s label] Sunday Best. I was four days in at that point, my mind had been expanded, altered and distorted, as was everybody’s around me. So I decided if I played a record backwards, would people dance backwards? And it was a good theory. Obviously with CDJs, you can press reverse, but with the record, you have to physically rewind it. So I played Block Rockin’ Beats, by the Chemical Brothers, pretty much at the right speed but backwards. And it worked. Everybody got the joke. It was just after Twin Peaks too, so everybody was like, dancing backwards to the music. What I forgot was that Ed from the Chemical Brothers was in the DJ booth with me, and he went, ‘What are you doing?’ I’m like, ‘I want to see if they can dance backwards.’ He’s like, ‘Oh, great!’ That’s probably the most out there I’ve ever been.”View image in fullscreenFatboy Slim performs at Lonely Hearts Club stage at Silver HayesView image in fullscreen“I loved the Rabbit Hole. It was never the same [after it closed]. Absolutely anything could happen, and sometimes it did.

But when he started coming under his own steam, it’s weird, because we didn’t teach him anything, he just assimilated himself into the fabric of it and made all these friends the first year he went. He was built for Glastonbury: he’s just got that energy, he wants to talk to everybody, he wants to change the world.

The music business, especially when money comes in, it distorts your creative ideas and the feel of it and it becomes a money-making machine. But the Eavis family never sold out.

As a result of the U-turn, she now has to fill a £5bn gap in the public finances with tax rises or cuts elsewhere.After the chancellor was seen in tears at prime minister’s questions, Downing Street moved quickly to insist she would stay in post and had not offered her resignation. “The chancellor is going nowhere,” a spokesperson said.Welfare climbdown lets genie out of the bottle, and no one knows what happens nextRead moreBut borrowing costs rose at the sharpest rate since Donald Trump’s tariff plans unsettled financial markets in April, while the pound fell against the dollar and the euro, settling only once No 10 had said Reeves would stay.Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, said on Wednesday morning that there would be tough choices to be made as a result of the welfare bill row. “There’s definitely a cost to what was announced yesterday, and you can’t spend the same money twice, so more money spent on that means less for some other purpose,” he said.Hours later, Reeves wiped away tears while sitting on the government frontbench in the Commons after Starmer refused to say she would keep her job. In a heated exchange, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, suggestedLabourMPs had said Reeves was “toast”.Reeves had appeared upset even before entering the chamber, where she had a brief altercation with Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, over potential breaches of parliamentary convention during Treasury questions on Tuesday. One witness said the chancellor told him “I’m just under so much pressure” before taking her seat.During the 30 minutes ofPMQs, Badenoch said the chancellor looked “absolutely miserable” and described her as a “human shield” for what she said was No 10’s incompetence. Reeves’s sister, Ellie, also an MP, took her hand as they left the Commons.How No 10 went from bullish to badly damaged as rebels forced further welfare bill concessionsRead moreAfterwards, Downing Street said there would be no reshuffle. “The chancellor has the prime minister’s full backing. He has said it plenty of times. They are focused entirely on delivering for working people,” a spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Reeves said: “It’s a personal matter, which – as you would expect – we are not going to get into”.The Guardian understands that the prime minister spoke with the chancellor later on Wednesday afternoon.On Wednesday evening Starmer said Reeves’s tears in the Commons were “nothing to do with politics” and she will be chancellor for a “very long time to come”.Speaking to the BBC’s podcast Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, the prime minister denied suggestions the chancellor was upset by the fallout over the government’s welfare bill.He said: “That’s absolutely wrong, it’s got nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with what’s happened this week. It was a personal matter for her. I’m not going to intrude on her privacy by talking to you about that. It is a personal matter.”Asked if Reeves would remain in her post, Starmer said: “She will be chancellor by the time this is broadcast, she will be chancellor for a very long time to come, because this project that we’ve been working on to change the Labour party, to win the election, change the country, that is a project which the chancellor and I’ve been working on together.”An ally of the prime minister earlier suggested that MPs needed to stay calm and recognise that government would regularly throw up difficult moments. They added: “Who hasn’t cried at work? Obviously it’s not ideal but I think we all need to take a breath and calm down.”While economists have focused on the need for the chancellor to raise taxes at the budget, Treasury sources have warned there would now be implications for spending priorities, including ones popular with Labour MPs such as the £3.5bn cost of scrapping the two-child cap on benefit payments.“We’re not going to bluff this, we’re not going to hide it. We’re going to be clear there is a financial cost to this,” said one ally of Reeves. “Labour MPs need to understand that. Of course, tax is one of the levers we could have to pull. We’re not going to duck that.“Those Labour MPs and charities and others who want the two-child limit lifted – how are you going to pay for it now? Labour MPs made a choice last night and the government accepted that choice, but we are going to be honest that that choice comes at cost, because it does.”However, one cabinet minister said that while it would now be harder to meet the financial cost of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, the scale of the Labour rebellion over welfare suggested there might be a political imperative to do so.“We can’t go into the next election without child poverty coming down, and the cap is the most cost-effective and efficient way to do that,” they said.Meanwhile, Treasury insiders ruled out further changes to the fiscal rules. “That means more debt interest, taxpayers’ money going to hedge funds. Is that a progressive thing?” one said.No definitive plans are yet in motion for how to fill the hole left by the welfare U-turn. A government source said it would depend on future economic growth, as well as oil prices and receipts that the Treasury receives from its clampdown on tax evasion.The incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Helen Miller, said: “Since departmental spending plans are now effectively locked in, and the government has already had to row back on planned cuts to pensioner benefits and working-age benefits, tax rises would look increasingly likely. This will doubtless intensify the speculation over the summer about which taxes may rise and by how much.”Starmer declined to rule out tax rises this year. When pushed by Badenoch, he said: “No prime minister or chancellor ever stands at the dispatch box and writes budgets in the future.”The second reading of the government’s welfare bill passed its first Commons test only after a central element – changes to personal independence payments – was removed on Tuesday.The bill passed with 49 Labour MPs rebelling, more than three times bigger than the government’s previous biggest rebellion.Explore more on these topicsLabourRachel ReevesKeir StarmerWelfareTax and spendingPMQsHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

So does the public.“But unless the NHS changes, the argument that it is unsustainable will grow more compelling. It really is change or bust. We choose change.”Making care more convenient for patients through the new clinics is key to the government’s plan to reinvent the NHS as a service in which more is done in community settings and less in hospitals, which have become overwhelmed in recent years by the rising need for care.That will be accompanied by two other “big shifts”: enhanced use of technology and greater emphasis on the health service preventing illness rather than treating it.Public dissatisfaction with the NHS’s inability to guarantee rapid access to GPs, A&E care and surgery, and Starmer’s previous pledges to get it back on its feet, mean that delivering the changes outlined in the 143-page plan will be key to the government’s fortunes.Health thinktanks cautioned that the plans would take a long time to push through and that patients may not see real change for some time.“Most people in this country want the NHS to survive and thrive because they rely on it,” said Steve Brine, a former Conservative health minister.“Whether this plan, and the funding the health secretary has been able to secure for it, is enough for people to feel the difference remains an open question.”The complexity and political risks involved in modernising a cherished public service raise questions about whether Starmer and Streeting “have the stomach to embark on the kind of transformation they say is required”, he said.The “neighbourhood centres” will be staffed by doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health professionals, as well as specialists in debt advice and employment, ministers say.They will offer services traditionally provided in hospitals – such as diagnostic tests, post-operative care and rehabilitation. They will be open 12 hours a day, including in the evenings and at weekends, though that will happen “eventually”, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) conceded.Health thinktanks criticised the DHSC’s lack of detail about the centres, including where they would be, who would staff them, where the funding for building new facilities would come from, and when they would actually open.Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King’s Fund, welcomed the shift from hospital to community-based care and a more people-friendly NHS but said it “has been echoed by successive governments, so whilst welcome, the vision itself is not new.“The radical change would be delivering the vision. History has shown us that you can’t simply co-locate different health professionals in a building and expect a neighbourhood health service to flourish.”Thea Stein, her counterpart at the Nuffield Trust, who is a former NHS trust boss, said that transforming the health service as Starmer is pledging “is hard, complex work, requiring leadership from politicians and NHS staff alike to challenge cultures and power dynamics, and create new ways to route money through the system”.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthKeir StarmerEnglandHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

The dead included a well-known film-maker and an artist, a 35-year-old housewife and a four-year-old child. Among the injured were a 14-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl.Under international law based on the Geneva conventions, a military force is forbidden to launch attacks that cause “incidental loss of civilian life” that is “excessive or disproportionate” to the military advantage to be gained.What is considered acceptable is open to interpretation but experts said only a target whose elimination might have a very significant impact on the course of a conflict could justify the death of dozens of civilians.The cafe had two storeys – an open upper deck and a lower floor with wide windows on to the beach and sea – and approaches that were clearly visible from above.View image in fullscreenA closeup of a bomb fragment from the ruins of al-Baqa cafe.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianGerry Simpson, of Human Rights Watch, said: “The Israeli military hasn’t said exactly whom it was targeting but it said it used aerial surveillance to minimise civilian casualties, which means it knew the cafe was teeming with customers at the time.“The military would also have known that using a large guided air-dropped bomb would kill and maim many of the civilians there. The use of such a large weapon in an obviously crowded cafe risks that this was an unlawful disproportionate or indiscriminate attack and should be investigated as a war crime.”Dr Andrew Forde, an assistant professor of human rights law at Dublin City University, said the strike was shocking. “When you see a situation where there are heavy munitions being used, particularly [in a] crowded civilian space, even with the best targeting in the world … that will necessarily create an indiscriminate outcome that is not in compliance with … the Geneva conventions,” he said.The family-run al-Baqa cafe was founded almost 40 years ago and was well known as a recreation spot for young people and families inGazaCity. It served a small selection of soft drinks, tea and biscuits.Though the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million population suffer acutelywith growing malnutritionand a continuing threat of famine, some have savings or salaries that allow them to patronise the few remaining cafes.The port area where al-Baqa cafe was located was not covered by any of the evacuation orders issued by the IDF to warn of impending military operations.View image in fullscreenA crater at the scene of Monday’s airstrike.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersMarc Schack, an associate professor of international law at the University of Copenhagen, said: “It is almost impossible to see how this use of that kind of munition can be justified. If you are talking about 20, 30, 40 or more civilian casualties, usually that would have to be a target of very great importance … For coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the accepted number for a very high-level target was less than 30 civilians getting killed, and only then in exceptional circumstances.”Trevor Ball, a weapons researcher and former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician, identified a Jdam tail section and thermal battery which he said suggested either an MPR500 or an MK-82 bomb was dropped.Another expert with extensive experience of recent conflicts identified the bomb similarly. A third said they could not make a reliable assessment from the pictures presented to them.Israel has a wide range of munitions and has frequently used much smaller weapons for precision strikes against individualsin Gaza, Lebanon and in its recent air offensive in Iran.The IDF said in a lengthy statement earlier this year that even the most sophisticated measures employed to assess civilian harm were hardly ever perfect and that its choice of munitions was “a professional matter contingent on the nature of the strike’s objective”.Thestatementsaid: “While some targets are suitable for smaller payloads, others may require heavier munitions to achieve mission success – for example, when intending to destroy structures that are built with certain hard materials, large structures, or underground tunnel.”On Tuesday, an Israeli government spokesperson said the IDF “never, ever targets civilians”.Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge that the militant Islamist group denies.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

As her troublesome back injury continued to restrict her work on the practice court, she has also had to deal with undisclosed personal issues. Her expectations for the tournament were low.It is reflective of Raducanu’s personal growth and maturity that she has taken those difficulties in her stride and found a way to continue to move forward. In one of her most significant matches of the year so far, the British No 1 spectacularly rose to the occasion on Centre Court, producing a brilliant performance to outplaythe 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova6-3, 6-3 and return to the third round.With the victory, Raducanu set up a highly anticipated showdown with Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1. The Belarusian had earlier defeated Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (4), 6-4.Raducanu revels in Centre Court joy after ‘one of the best matches I’ve played’Read more“I think today I played really, really well,” Raducanu said. “There were some points that I have no idea how I turned around, one for sure that I remember in the second set. I knew playing Marketa was going to be an extremely difficult match, she’s won this tournament and it’s a huge, huge achievement. She’s also in form really well. I’m just so happy about how I competed, put my game on the court and I was just focused the whole way through.”Despite Vondrousova’s lesser ranking of No 73, this was an extremely difficult match against one of the most in-form players in the draw and Raducanu was the underdog. Even though the Czech has endured an injury-ravaged career, her talent has always been undeniable and she offered a reminder of it 10 days ago by spectacularly winning the Berlin Open, with wins over Sabalenka and Madison Keys. Her form, and the fact that she defeated Raducanu in their only meeting this year, in Abu Dhabi in February, made her the favourite.As the late afternoon shadow expanded across the court and both players settled into the familiar surroundings of Wimbledon’s showcase, the early exchanges offered few surprises. While the Briton tried to dictate from the beginning by taking the ball early and changing directions frequently, Vondrousova attempted to arrest her rhythm by constantly mixing up the trajectory, spin and speed of her shots while placing the ball in difficult positions.But Raducanu was ready. She served well early on and her comfortable early service games emboldened her to take full control of the baseline. She imposed sustained pressure on Vondrousova with her relentless aggression, eventually taking the first break of the opening set with a supreme running backhand down-the-line passing shot, establishing a 4-2 lead. Raducanu did not allow her poor subsequent service game to dent her confidence, immediately retrieving the break before closing out the set.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu comfortably outplayed her in-form opponent on Centre Court.Photograph: The GuardianWith the first set secured, Raducanu continued to put Vondrousova under constant pressure, suffocating the Czech with her return and particularly striking her forehand brilliantly. Raducanu’s relentless positivity on court has been notable recently; almost every winning shot was punctuated with a triumphant fist-pump, but her composure in the decisive moments was even more impressive. She remained calm throughout the second set, serving extremely well as the finishing line neared.Raducanu said: “I knew today, I had to be aggressive because Marketa would beat me if I was gonna push the ball around but Mark [Petchey] has helped me a lot. Everyone in that box has really been there for me, my friends, it’s amazing to have them here as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raducanu has strived to surround herself with familiar faces she trusts in order to ensure that she can be completely honest with both the people surrounding her and herself. She has come to understand that the only way she can find success in this sport is if she understands how to enjoy her work.Katie Boulter crashes out of Wimbledon with misfiring serve as Sonay Kartal advancesRead moreAlong with the improvements to her mental approach, this performance was also a reflection of three months of work with Petchey, her current coach. Despite their unusual ad-hoc setup, with Petchey often planning their work around his broadcasting schedule, Raducanu has taken positive steps forward.They have worked hard on her serve, which after being a massive liability earlier this year was excellent in the important moments, particularly as she fended off break chances deep in the second set. She has forced herself to dictate more with her forehand, and the improvements on that stroke were clear as Raducanu ensured that her forehand was the dominant stroke in the match. She will now try to bring both her growing confidence and quality to her upcoming meeting with the best player in the world.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Emma RaducanuWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

That is higher than the army and slightly lower than the proportion of women who serve across the military, which is 11.9%.A married father of three, Key joined the navy in 1984 and was appointed first sea lord in November 2021.

She said there was a problem in France if public services “are unable to function because of a lack of air conditioning, unlike dozens of countries across the world”.Éric Ciotti, a Le Pen ally, put down a bill in parliament this week calling for “obligatory air conditioning” for key public spaces.France has a low number of public spaces and private homes with air conditioning compared with neighbouring countries such as Italy. In 2020, 25% of French homes had air conditioning, compared with 14% in 2016, according to the national environment agency, Ademe.The government attacked the far right as ignorant and “incompetent” for suggesting air conditioning was a solution to the climate crisis. The environment minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, said air-conditioned spaces in care homes for elderly people had been obligatory in France for 20 years. She said that, although vulnerable people should be protected from the heat, air conditioning “must not be installed everywhere” because it generated a rise in temperatures outside and was “the wrong answer”.The Green leader,Marine Tondelier, attacked Le Pen for an environmental policy limited to “buying air conditioning units”. Tondelier said there had to be progress made on green spaces in cities and proper insulation of buildings.View image in fullscreenA man helps a child cool off with water from the Barcaccia fountain at the foot of the Spanish Steps during a heatwave in Rome, Italy.Photograph: Antonio Denti/ReutersMeanwhile,Europecontinued to grapple with a deadly heatwave that has resulted in record temperatures and several deaths.In Spain, officers from Catalonia’s regional police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, were investigating the deaths of two farm workers whose bodies were found on Tuesday by firefighters tackling a wildfire near the town of Coscó in Lleida province. The wildfire burned through 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) of land in the north-eastern Spanish region and authorities ordered 18,000 people in the area to remain at home.The regional president, Salvador Illa, urged people to take extra care, warning them not to underestimate the speed and ferocity of wildfires.“These fires aren’t like the ones we used to have,” he said on Wednesday. “When you find out how they evolve, you get goose bumps. There are really dangerous fires.”The two men died on the same day that a young boy died, apparently from heatstroke, after being left in a car in the Catalan province of Tarragona on Tuesday.France’s energy minister reported two deaths with a direct link to the heatwave, with 300 people taken to hospital this week.A 70-year-old lorry driver was found dead inside his vehicle in northern Italy. The man was discovered shortly after 6.30am on Wednesday, parked at a motorway rest area between Sirmione and Peschiera del Garda, in the province of Brescia.A 57-year-old construction worker who was carrying out renovation work at a house in Giuliano di Roma collapsed and died in front of his colleagues. Doctors said the extreme heat was probably to blame for his death. Another man, aged 85, died from dehydration shortly after arriving at the emergency room in Genoa.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both were at the beach. In Sardinia, temperatures in recent days have exceeded 40C (104F).Elsewhere in Italy, traffic lights stopped working, people got stuck in lifts, and shops closed early after power cuts in parts of the country on Tuesday afternoon, partly due to the non-stop use of air conditioning and fans putting a strain on electricity grids.The blackouts in Italy were also caused by underground electrical cables overheating, according to the energy provider Enel. In Florence, the power cut affected the city’s historic centre, with the La Rinascente department store evacuated as a precautionary measure. A sign reading: “Black out, see you tomorrow morning at 10am,” appeared on a shop window opposite Florence’s cathedral. Homes were without electricity for hours in several neighbourhoods in Rome, Milan, Genoa and Bergamo.Italy’s health ministry issued a maximum red alert for heat in 18 cities on Wednesday, meaning the heat is so intense that it poses a risk for young and healthy people too. The extreme temperatures are forecast to last at least until the weekend.The heat is also beginning to take a serious toll on the country’s agriculture, scorching fruit and vegetables, straining livestock, and deepening a growing drought crisis in the south.According to Coldiretti, Italy’s largest farmers’ association, early signs of damage are already being reported from north to south: from blistered melons in Tuscany to milk shortages in Lombardy and water rationing in Sicily.As the heatwave rolled eastwards on Wednesday, Germany was expected to record some of its hottest temperatures of the year so far. Temperatures were expected to surge close to 40C across much of the country on Wednesday, and could break the all-time record for Germany of 41.2C, set in July 2019.Drought-like conditions led more than 40 German districts to restrict water use, including for farmers and gardeners, in addition to dozens of municipalities calling on citizens to conserve water.In Brandenburg state surrounding Berlin, two forest fires broke out on Tuesday, with high temperatures and munitions in the soil complicating the work of firefighters, who by the evening had the situation under control.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherEuropeClimate crisisFranceGermanyMarine Le PennewsShareReuse this content"

He hasreportedlydiscussedmoving AstraZeneca’s stock market listing, and perhaps even its corporate base, to the US.The company declined to comment on the bombshell report, but it sent shockwaves through Britain’s scientific community. It also threatens to topple a key pillar of the government’s fledgling industrial strategy and deprive the London market of its biggest star.The FTSE 100 company’s share price rose by 2.8% on Tuesday, with most of the gains coming after the news, but dipped by 0.1% on Wednesday, giving the company a value of nearly £161bn, ahead of Shell at £154bn.Soriot,the UK’s best-paid chief executiveof a listed company, has made no secret of his growing frustration with the UK authorities in recent months. AstraZeneca’s breast cancer drug Enhertu has not been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales even thoughthe company offered a low price, he claimed. The medication is available in Scotland and most other European countries.Another flashpoint came in late January, when the pharma group ditched its planned£450m investment to turn its factory in Spekenear Liverpool into a major vaccine hub after failing to to agree with ministers on the size of state support.But Soriot’s – and other pharma bosses’ – biggest gripes are with the wider regulatory and commercial environment in the UK and the rest of Europe. They have called for more healthcare spending and a single list price for medicines across Europe, similar to the US, plus discounts for specific countries linked to their GDP and wealth.The UK’s spending on new medicines does not compare well internationally, as Soriot has noted – amounting to 7% of healthcare costs versus 10 to 11% in many other European countries and 13 to 15% in the US. It also takes much longer to run a clinical trial.“Companies will go where they feel welcome because access to our medicines is good, innovation is rewarded. And of course, tax policies also play a role in all those decisions,” he has said. Otherwise,well-paid advanced manufacturing and research jobs could move to the USin the long run, he said in April.Soriot, who grew up in the Parisian banlieues, has reiterated the company’s commitment to the UK. It has poured more than £1bn into a new global headquarters and research centre in Cambridge in recent years.This was dwarfed, however, by its recent$3.5bn (£2.5bn) investment in US research and manufacturing, including turning its Kendall Square labs in Cambridge, Massachusetts, into a state-of-the art research hub – a wise move before Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector.The suggestion that AstraZeneca could up sticks comes at difficult time for Keir Starmer’s government, which is on the back foot on many fronts. Just this week, it had to postpone publication of its long-awaited life sciences strategy because negotiations between ministers and the pharmaceutical industry about drug pricing have stalled.The 10-year plan will be coming shortly, according to the Department for Science, Innovation andTechnology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But “the mere talk of the biggest listed company leaving London will get ministers sitting up and listening”, said the Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.The chancellor’s Mansion House speech later this month, when Rachel Reeves is expected to outline ways to revitalise London as a financial hub, will be closely watched for evidence of concrete plans to increase liquidity and make it easier for firms to list.“At a time when the government and regulators are laying out plans to make the City more attractive, if this move being mulled by AstraZeneca were to become a reality, it would be another big setback for London,” said Streeter.“The more company boards are reported to be discussing such a strategy, the more likely it will be that other firms will embark on similar discussions to assess whether moving main listings could help boost valuations.”It would be the biggest blow yet to theLondon Stock Exchange, which has lost a string of big names in recent months.Streeter said losing such a big player on the London market would make it even harder to lure more firms to list on the LSE.For Labour’s creaking government, it is a headache ministers could do without.Explore more on these topicsAstraZenecaPharmaceuticals industryLondon Stock ExchangeIndustrial policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Even then, it was unfortunate timing, appearing just three days after the goalkeeper’s shock announcement that she would beretiring from international footballwith immediate effect. It comes to terrestrial television a month later, and does feel like a documentary made for an England Euros campaign with Earps in the squad. Nevertheless, it channels her ambition, drive and amazing achievements into a pleasant hour that should spark memories, or premonitions, of the tensions to come over the next few weeks.Sportspeople are not always the most absorbing of subjects. To me, this seems a fair exchange, in the great cosmic talent pool: you can either be superhumanly athletic, or you can be charismatic. To be both is borderline greedy. This balancing act does mean that great documentaries about sporting stars are few and far between.Earps has always been a bit different. When she won the BBC’sSports Personality of the Year award in 2023, the personality part shone as much as the sport. With England, she had won the Euros in 2022, and got to a World Cup final just a year later, taking small consolation from walking away with the Golden Glove if not the ultimate prize. She had also fought for an England women’s goalkeeper’s replica shirt to go on sale, after realising there was no plan to release one. Here, it sounds as if she spoke out, despite knowing it could be a risky move.This documentary hones in on the two history-making tournaments, but it does have time to whiz through what got her there in the first place. She reminisces about playing against Hucknall Town for West Bridgford Colts as a youngster and how saving a penalty became her lightbulb moment. (It’s another side of Hucknall, which is having a big 2025 on TV, as the setting for the outstanding dramaWhat It Feels Like For a Girl.) She bounced around various clubs from 2011 until she signed for Manchester United in 2019. This serves as a solid overview of women’s football over the past two decades. Like many women, she wasn’t sure that football could be a sustainable career, and she describes having to “gamble” on whether it was worth taking that chance on herself.It’s safe to say that her career gamble paid off. Earps comes across as a considered decision-maker, even when taking on Nike over the replica shirt. She describes her personal low, of finally getting her chance to start for England under Phil Neville, only to receive “brutal feedback” following a loss to Germany. She was not called up again, and remembers it being a “very lonely” time. Loneliness is a theme. From her current training ground at Paris Saint-Germain, she talks about how the keeper’s lot can be a solitary one. They train separately, are analysed separately; other goalkeepers, as she has recently learned, are competition.In fact, by 2021, Earps had, notoriously, almost given up on international football. It took a new England manager, Sarina Wiegman, to spot her talent and put her trust in her for the now infamous Euros of 2022. It is strange to look back and think that it was ever a risk, but Earps says she thinks people questioned both her experience and Wiegman’s decision-making. We all know how she responded to the pressure, though there are some nice anecdotes here, such as a revelation about what the England captain, Leah Williamson, shouted in her ear after they beat Spain in the quarter finals.During the World Cup, Earps’ parents briefly went viral when they were interviewed by a reporter who had no idea who they were and wanted to know how they got their hands on a goalkeeper’s shirt. Sadly, they don’t reference that lovely moment here, but her mother and her brother pop over to Paris to see her, and, in the case of her brother, to tease her, in a way that only siblings can.Elsewhere, there are the standard supportive tales from her teammates. The eternally good value Ella Toone turns up and jokes that she’s “talking about Mazza again”, before discussing their sisterly relationship. Alessia Russo talks about Earp’s “tunnel vision” on game day. Lucy Bronze and Jill Scott recall Earps’ early days in the squad, and Wiegman talks about the potential she saw in her.Watching replays of those thrilling moments from 2022, and from the 2023 World Cup – the goals scored, but of course, the crucial saves, too – should be more than enough to rev England fans up for the start of another Euros campaign, though this documentary is also bittersweet, given that Earps won’t be there to play her part in it.Mary Queen of Stops aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionMary EarpsreviewsShareReuse this content"

You tremble like everything might collapse,” said the 23-year-old trainee mechanic, recalling how he and his panicked neighbours raced out on to the street.This time, though, the jolt had come not from deep below, but from high above: it was the detonation of a weaponized drone of the sort being used to hunt Haitian gang members who have hijacked most of the country’s capital since the start ofa coordinated criminal insurrection early last year.“People had told me about drones … but this one caught me off guard … It felt like it exploded right where I was standing,” said Antoine of the 6am attack last month near Sico, the working-class neighbourhood where he lives.As Haiti’s beleaguered government struggles to reconquer a sprawling seaside city now almost entirely controlled by the gangs, armed drones have become a key part of their arsenal. Since the drone campaign began in March, at least 300 people have been killed by the remote-control devices and almost 400 injured, according to a local human rights group called RNDDH.Videos of those attacks have spread rapidly on social media, painting a terrifying portrait of the drone warfare unfolding on the streets of one of the Caribbean’s largest cities.One such video, which the Guardian identified as having taken place in a gang-run area called Fort National, shows four people – at least two of them armed – moving through an alley before being hit from above by an explosion. Blue and white smoke fills the backstreet as the men scatter.Four people are hit from above by drone attack in Fort National, Port-au-Prince.Four people are hit from above by drone attack in Fort National, Haiti.Another clip, posted on social media by a US missionary, shows an attack on an evangelical theological seminary about 2 miles south-west of Fort National, not far from Jimmy Antoine’s home. At least one person can be seen sprinting for cover as the drone swoops towards its second-floor target and explodes. “I have fond memories of teaching in the very classroom it struck,” Luke Perkins, the president of the missionary group Crossworld, tweeted in mid-June.Trevor Ball, a former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician, said the drones used in Port-au-Prince appeared to be first-person-view (FPV) drones.Images ofone such improvised weaponwere shared on social media in March, reputedly from the aftermath of a police raid on a gang stronghold in the Lower Delmas area. The Guardian was able to identify this model of FPV drone, and found it being sold on Chinese e-commerce sites for about $200, making them relatively cheap and expendable.Ball said it was not possible to determine from the images the exact munitions being used but it was likely the drones had either been fitted with explosives intended for commercial mining, orblack powder– a homemade mix of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur that is used in fireworks. “These tactics are used in other parts of the world, especially in the Ukraine-Russia war.Using first-person-view drones to deliver explosive devices has become extremely common there, and has been seen in other conflicts as well,” Bell added.One other video that surfaced earlier this year showed a targeted drone strike on a moving car less than 500 metres (547 yards) away from the compound believed to belong to Johnson André, a notorious gang boss known by the nickname “Izo” whose gang is called 5 Segonn (“Five Seconds”). The car was driving near waterways reportedly used for drug and gun trafficking by the gangs.View image in fullscreenAn soldier in Port-au-Prince on 30 November 2024.Photograph: Patrice Noel/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe provenance of the online drone videos remains unclear but many suspect at least some of them are being produced and released by a shadowy government-recruited armed group which has been enlisted to bolster the counterattack against the gangs. The aerial videos generally depict “action shots” or the moment the drone strikes on a target, often edited and set to energetic music.Last month the New York Times, citing senior Haitian and US government officials,reportedthat the controversial Blackwater founder Erik Prince had been working with the Haitian government “to carry out deadly operations against gangs that are terrorizing the nation and threatening to take over its capital”.The newspaper claimed American contractors, including Prince, had been hired “to work on a secret taskforce to deploy drones meant to kill gang members”. Two experts said Prince had recently shipped “a large cache of weapons” to Haiti and was seeking to recruit Haitian American military veterans to send to Port-au-Prince as part of a 150-strong mercenary force over the coming months.Earlier this month, Fritz Alphonse Jean, the head of the transitional council that has attempted to govern Haiti since its prime minister, Ariel Henry, was toppled early in the gang rebellion, confirmed that a private security firm had been engaged by the government. But he declined to name it or say how it was being paid. Jean argued it was impossible for Haiti’s underequipped and underfunded police to “face these challenges alone”.A drone strikes an evangelical theological seminary in Haiti.A drone strikes an evangelical theological seminary in Haiti.Perhaps surprisingly, Haitian human rights activists have backed the use of drone warfare to target criminal groups who haveforced more than 1 million people to flee their homes and killed thousands. A UN-backed international security force, led by Kenyan police officers, has so far failed to repel the criminal advance.“For us … drones are entirely proportionate to the level of weaponry the gangs possess,” said Rosy Auguste Ducéna, a respected human rights advocate who works for RNDDH in Port-au-Prince.Ducéna said her group supported such strikes against gang strongholds. “Why? Because we consider the sophistication of the weapons in the gangs’ hands, how those weapons are used to inflict suffering on the rest of the population – the crimes we know about: killings, thefts, rape, gang-rape, the burning of people’s entire belongings,” she said.Ducéna thought drones were “instilling fear” in heavily armed gang members and appeared to have such criminals on the back foot.“We cannot dismiss the fact that these operations are having an impact on them. The element of uncertainty is also very important. The gangs don’t necessarily know when or where a strike will happen, and we believe that’s one reason for the drop in gang activity we’re currently seeing,” she said, describing how the fear that has gripped her city’s streets was gradually subsiding.View image in fullscreenAn armed police officer walks near protesters making their way to the Villa d’Accueil to demand increased security from the government, in Port-au-Prince on 2 April.Photograph: Clarens Siffroy/AFP/Getty Images“Many banks have reopened, and many schools are open again. There is no longer the same tension as during the height of the insecurity … There is a glimmer of hope,” said Ducéna, although she voiced concern that the taskforce coordinating the drone attacks was being led by the office of the prime minister, Alix Fils-Aimé, rather than security officials.“We believe [this is] extremely dangerous for democracy. A political authority should not be leading a team conducting this type of operation,” Ducéna said.Foreign human rights activists and specialists question the efficacy – not to mention legality – of using weaponized drones in a country which, despite all the bloodshed, is not officially considered to be in a state of conflict.“I don’t think it works. They haven’t killed a single gang leader after three, going on four months of doing this, and we don’t know how many civilians have been harmed,” said one expert, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. “It just shows how absolutely desperate the government and the police [are].”“I think it’s a sign of desperation … It shows how desperate people are to have some sign that … something can be done to stop [the gangs]. That’s really what it is all about,” they added, fretting that gang leaders might adopt the same tactics, exacerbating an already dire situation. “What if they [the gangs] start shooting off drones? The escalation factor is also very worrying.”Earlier this month there were signs that gangs were already seeking to build their ownarsenal of drones whenthree alleged “terrorists” were arrestedin the neighbouring Dominican Republic trying to buy the devices. In recent years both Mexican cartels and drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro have started using armed drones to launch attacks on authorities or rivals.A drone strikes a car in the compound believed to belong to gang boss Johnson André.A drone strikes a car in the compound believed to belong to gang boss Johnson André.On the ground in Port-au-Prince, many offer a more positive assessment of the aerial offensive.Last month, Belony Jassé, an 18-year-old high school student who said he heard drone explosions “all the time”, finally managed to return to the home that gangs once forced her to flee after security improved.The sound of drone attacks terrified the algebra-loving teenager. “It makes you jump. It’s scary. You don’t expect the noise. You might drop whatever you’re holding. The sound is very loud. It breaks your heart, it takes time to recover. It’s heavy,” he said.But Jassé credited those attacks – coupled with an intensification of ground operations by police andvigilante groups– with the recent progress in his neighbourhood. “I don’t hear much gunfire any more. Last night I hardly heard any shots … This week I haven’t heard any gunfire at all,” he said.The situation remained critical, Jassé admitted. “But compared to how it was, I’m not scared any more.”Explore more on these topicsHaitiDrones (military)GangsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the numbers don’t back that up.“That is not what we’ve found in our studies,” says Dr Cynthia Graham, senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute and distinguished professor in gender studies at the University of Indiana.Numbers vary widely, Graham says, because different studies define sex differently; some define it exclusively as sexual intercourse, while others define it more broadly. According toresearchby Graham and her team, the percentage of men aged 65 to 75 who are sexually active is anywhere from 40% to 91%. For women, it’s from 25% to 78%.The numbers also fluctuate based on culture, religion, education, romantic status, health and the country in which one lives. Graham’s research has shown that older adults in Norway have more sex than those in Portugal, for example.Not only are older adults having sex – they’re having good sex. According to theNational Institute on Aging(NIA), “many older couples find greater satisfaction in their sex lives than they did when they were younger”.Ageing comes with physical changes, but that doesn’t mean the end of pleasure. Graham says that in her group’s research, older adults said changes in physical function “didn’t really impact their satisfaction”. They reported doing things differently from before, with less focus on penetrative sex.Below, Guardian readers over 60 share how their sex lives have changed as they’ve aged.Two old farts having sexI’m 70, and my wife is 72. We have sex three times a week, more if we feel like it. We laugh when young people realize – and are appalled by – two old farts still having sex. Or, as we describe it: “Shar-pei sex.”When we were younger, sex was plentiful, frantic and more shallow, but good fun. Now that we’re older, it’s more measured, more valued. We both appreciate the subtle and aesthetic aspects more than when we were younger.Lee, 70, and Patricia, 72, MaineTen orgasms in an afternoonI always enjoyed sex, but as a full-time high school teacher and single mother of one, I was overwhelmed and very busy.Fast-forward to living alone: I have had several lovers, and at the age of 71, I am having the best sex of my life. I joke with friends about my three fully charged vibrators that I use in conjunction with a chocolate edible. I watch porn – girl-on-girl and hetero sex. I can orgasm 10 times in an afternoon. I also regularly have sex with a man my age. We usually have sex three times per encounter. I call it my 9pm, 3am and 9am. It’s fabulous.View image in fullscreen‘I think of sex as part of my self-care.

I still enjoy sex very much, and so does she. I prefer older women who know what they want.Anonymous, 64Use it or lose itI’ve been very happily married to my wife for 35 years. We have sex anywhere from once to three times a week. Sometimes a week or two go by [without sex] and that’s not a big deal. Intimacy is more than sex. We have lots of laughs, we chase each other around, we cuddle and have a blast.Our sex has become even less inhibited, more exploratory. Not that we were inhibited in the past – we’ve had sex pretty much every place you can imagine. But now there’s somehow more freedom and abandon. We use toys, we don’t worry if one of us doesn’t climax every time and we can, with a few creaks, bound around into different positions.“Use it or lose it” is something we tell people who are struggling sexually with their partners. When someone says they haven’t had sex with their partner in a long time, we say: “Put on your mining helmet and get to work.”JB, 64, New YorkMy shortest post-marriage relationship lasted 10 minutesMy marriage of 30 years ended three years ago. Since the split, I have had multiple partners. Usually younger men. I have the best sex of my life. I’m post-menopausal and cannot get pregnant, both of which are great for sex. My longest post-marriage sexual relationship lasted six months, and the quickest, 10 minutes. I like to be free and single, but I do like a secret lover.I’m more body-confident than when I was 30. I’m able to express my desires and needs as men always have. I no longer use alcohol to drum up courage. It’s so much better. I really see sex as a hobby.Anonymous, 60Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Twice a night, sometimesI’m 77, and my husband is eight years younger. I met him in 2019, a year after my husband of 50 years died. Previously, I had been celibate for 25 years because my first husband’s health wasn’t good, but I missed sex. It is wonderful to be with an affectionate, uninhibited, patient and sensuous man now. We have sex every two to three days, sometimes even twice a night.Time is the difference. Now we can spend as long as we want in bed. In my first marriage, we tended to be efficient at sex. Straight for the goal. When I met my second husband, I knew I wanted a healthy sexual relationship. I love his moves and his fascination with my body. I love the texture of his skin and his smell.Sexis a form of communication for us.Anonymous, 77No worries about pregnancyI have one longstanding partner. We’ve been in a casual relationship for decades. Sex has always been great between us, but now it’s even better. Fewer inhibitions, more time, no worries about pregnancy or how I look. With age comes more confidence.Anonymous, 65Quality over quantityI am married and have just one partner. Our frequency of sex is highly variable. Sometimes it’s five times a week, and sometimes there’s a month without.Sex changed significantly after age 55-60. In that time, stress lessened in a number of areas of my life. The biggest change was realizing I didn’t need to worry about how people perceived me. I’m confident in who I am, and that has been a big boost in my sexuality.Do not let your sex life stagnate. As my stamina has decreased, I have learned to compensate with expertise in pleasing a woman. It has become more of a sensual journey.

Five years ago, after 40 years of committed monogamous relationships, I stopped looking for partners. My relationships with friends and family are deeper now, and my solitary time is profoundly rewarding. It has been the best, most fulfilling and expansive period of my life. I can’t see where a man’s needs and desires would fit into my life. This may change, but it is simply not part of my routine or schedule right now.Anonymous, 68Playing the fieldIn a 27-year relationship, sex had faded to nothing. He didn’t make an effort, and wouldn’t discuss it either. I left him seven years ago, and had a few years of playing the field, mostly with swingers. One was 50 years younger than me. Great fun.View image in fullscreen‘The pleasure and transcendence between lovers is what matters – the exchange of energy.’Composite: The Guardian/Getty ImagesThe 27 years of suburban monogamy were not my true nature. Now, I’m with a guy who loves sex and variety as much as I do. We have sex every day, sometimes with other couples or at swinger events. I’ve returned to the libertine spirit that I had.Anonymous, 77The effects of ageismUntil 65, my sex life was very good. I had several lovers, and rarely a day went by without sex. Then I had several bouts of Covid and some long-term after-effects, and I’ve not been as sexually active since.Now, I seem to have a block. I miss intimacy but also shrink away from it. The men that are interested in me tend to be 15-20 years younger, and this is a little unsettling. This wouldn’t have bothered me in the past, but now I feel strange about it. In theory, I feel good about myself and the ageing process, but in reality, the ageism in the US has a negative effect on my psyche. In the US, intimacy in later years is treated like a bad joke by many or at best an opportunity for capitalism to exploit with pills and creams.

I’ve tried all the pills and even injections, but nothing works. So we enjoy naked time together.My relationship to sex used to have a transactional element – you do this and I’ll do that. Then, it was appreciation of another man’s body and my own. Now, it’s more about having a laugh, making out and hand stuff.Pete, retired, CaliforniaUnbridled enthusiasmAfter two kids, four divorces, two malignancies and a life-threatening illness between us, we find ourselves happier than we ever dared dream. We have stumbled upon the key: the most important erogenous zone is between our ears. Constant unbridled enthusiasm for every type of intimacy makes us feel completely satisfied. We decided to put our lust for each other front and center. Every outing is a date. Every drive is an opportunity to kiss before attaching the seatbelt. We’re in our third decade as lovers, and every day is better than the last.Our best advice: showing unlimited enthusiasm for your partner will keep them coming back, no matter what life throws at you.Bob, 75, and Candy, 70, OhioED? No problemI met my now husband 10 years ago, courtesy of this newspaper. I had been married twice before, and he three times. After we first made love, he said I had given him his sex life back. He has a long-term medical condition that means he cannot get an erection. We have a deep and loving sex life with no penetration, and I have never felt as loved and fulfilled as I do now. We don’t need sex toys, just tongues and fingers. It’s wonderful!Anonymous, 73Enjoy the journeyI couldn’t be happier. I am 83 and I am enjoying a wonderful retirement with a girlfriend who is also sexually active. My first wife passed away in 2006, after 41 years together. My second marriage lasted for seven years until I bailed out. I was an unhappy bachelor until I met my current girlfriend. She is 84 and I consider myself blessed. She is a wonderfully communicative partner. We have sex one to two times a week.There is no reason to be ashamed of your body and whether you are “hung” or not. Be happy with what you’ve got, and never underestimate the importance of foreplay. Relax and enjoy the journey.

As a tribute album is released, starry admirers and family members remember one of history’s great live performersGarth CartwrightWed 2 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTShare‘Clifton Chenier was one of the most influential musicians to come out of Louisiana,”Mick Jaggertells me. “He turned so many people on to the wonderful, free spirited dance music of zydeco. He was a true original, a trailblazer.” Jagger acknowledges that while no music style can be attributed to one artist, “there is not a zydeco band who has not followed the template Chenier created”.Jagger is not engaging in hyperbole here: Clifton Chenier’s swaggering, accordion-driven sound introduced the Creole music of ruralLouisianato the world – now known as zydeco, the name derived either from the Creole pronunciation ofharicots, or possibly a west African word for music-making. Created by the US’s poorest communities, zydeco is very much dance music, and concerts were once held outside to “make the dust fly”, says Chenier’s grandniece, Sherelle Chenier Mouton. At its most elemental, it’s made with an accordion, a rubboard – a steel washboard played with beer bottle caps attached to the player’s fingers to scrape percussive rhythms – and the human voice, and shares characteristics with music made in Haiti, Brazil and other African diaspora nations.Chenier adapted zydeco into an offshoot of R&B – “French blues”, according to blues legend Jimmie Vaughan – and this funky, swampy music is now beloved across the American south and internationally. Even Beyoncé nodded to zydeco and her “Creole mama” with her song Formation. “Uncle Clifton’s music brings every kind of people from every background together to dance the two-step,” Mouton says.Chenier was born 100 years ago this month, and died from kidney disease aged 62 in 1987. To celebrate the centenary there’s a biography, a forthcoming Smithsonian Folkways box set and a truly starry tribute album: Tribute to the King of Zydeco has the likes of Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Jimmie Vaughan and the Rolling Stones joining zydeco and Cajun musicians to play Chenier songs.“I first discovered his music by buying Chenier LPs in New York jazz and blues record stores in the late 1960s,” says Jagger. “The Stones always really enjoyed listening to his special blend of Cajun dance music. And still do.”Indeed, the Stones open Tribute to the King with their version of Zydeco Sont Pas Salés, which has Jagger singing in “Louisiana French” (a Creolised French patois) while Richards and Wood rock with abandon. This might just be the loosest, rawest Stones recording since Exile on Main St.“Instantly they made the track, and zydeco, their very own style,” says CC Adcock, a Lafayette-based guitarist-producer who oversaw the Stones session. “Keith used bendy licks to navigate and emphasise the idiosyncratic traditional accordion chord changes. Ronnie instinctively held down a funky boogie rhythm part in a way that a modern zydeco guitarist might.”Adcock called on Robert St Julien, Chenier’s drummer, and Cajun accordionist Steve Riley, to serve as “honorary Stones” and ensure a strong Louisiana flavour. “It’s a profound honour to collaborate with the Rolling Stones,” says Riley. “The fact that they are a part of this is testament to the impact of Clifton’s music.”View image in fullscreenCleveland Chenier with rubboard and Clifton with accordion.Photograph: Chris StrachwitzBorn to impoverished sharecroppers outside Opelousas, Louisiana, Chenier was Creole: the Black people of the US south-west who speak French, or whose ancestors did. His father Joseph played accordion at dances (“French music” or “la-la” as zydeco was then called). Chenier cut sugar cane on plantations before working for the petrochemical industry, playing accordion and singing for his fellow workers.Bluesand Caribbean influences spiced his sound and he released his first hit in 1955, Ay Tete-Fee, a success that enabled Clifton and band to tour nationally with Etta James and Little Richard.“I came out a hole, man,” Chenier told Louisiana writer Ben Sandmel in 1983. “I mean out themud; they had to dig me out the mud to bring me into town. All my people speak French and I learned it from them. A lot of people ‘shamed of speakin’ French, but not me. The old generation had [zydeco] but it died out. I brought zydeco back.”But he also made an attempt at straight R&B, which failed, and by the early 1960s, Chenier was reduced to working alongside a drummer playing rowdy bars in Houston’s Frenchtown. It was here in 1964 that bluesman Lightnin’ Hopkins brought Chris Strachwitz, the founder of Arhoolie Records. Strachwitz began recording him, initially releasing 45s for the local market, before his 1966 debut album Louisiana Blues and Zydeco launched him from Houston bars to Newport folk festival, Montreux jazz festival and the Royal Albert Hall. “People ask me how I can get up on the bandstand and play four hours without stopping,” he told Sandmel. “It’s because I’ve always been a hard worker,always. When I get up there, I’mup there, no half-steppin’.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve always been a hard worker’ … A Chenier performance.Photograph: Reed & Susan Erskine/Courtesy Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections, Smithsonian Institution“I saw him in New Orleans in the 70s, then at a high school dance in the Watts neighbourhood outside LA,” Jagger says. “A night to remember. He was quite magnificent.” Jagger notes how the Watts concert was packed with transplanted Louisiana Creoles all dancing the two-step and, when post-concert he was introduced to Chenier as “from the Rolling Stones” Clifton thanked him for “writing nice things about my music” – he was aware of Rolling Stone magazine but completely unaware of the band.Ann Savoy, a musician and chronicler of Cajun and Creole culture, saw him around the same era, in early 1970s Cankton, Louisiana at a place called Jay’s Lounge. “There were rooster fights going on out the back, gumbo was cooking, people were dancing, it was a hot, sultry night, and the music was smoking.”Jon Cleary, raised in Kent and long resident in Louisiana, transforms I’m On the Wonder into a deep soul ballad on the tribute album – and remembers that by the early 1980s, Chenier’s playing was still just as hot.“I moved to New Orleans after leaving school,” says Cleary, “and I saw Clifton every chance I got. He’d be up there sweating in a suit and tie, a giant crown on his head – the king of zydeco! – and the groove was relentless. He’d be wailing a slow blues, a waltz, and then bust out into straight zydeco. And zydeco was a different beast: two beats, two chords – just him on accordion and his brother Cleveland churning out wild funky grooves on a metal washboard.”Chenier would release a dozen albums on Arhoolie and establish an international platform for zydeco. Esteemed documentary film-maker Les Blank directed 1973’s Hot Pepper, which documents Clifton playing Creole clubs; Paul Simon sang of Chenier on Graceland; Rory Gallagher honoured him with the song The King of Zydeco. In 1984 Chenier won a Grammy, a huge honour for the often downtrodden Creole people.Chenier’s success encouraged others to follow and consequently zydeco thrives today, with rappers and dance beats adding to its musical gumboIn the early 20th century, parts of the US and Canada introduced legislation banning children from speaking French in public schools, but while “French music” had endured underground in Creole communities, it was Chenier’s success that encouraged others to follow his lead and consequently zydeco thrives today, with rappers and dance beats adding to zydeco’s musical gumbo. The video to Beyoncé’s Formation references zydeco trail rides: a popular weekend community gathering involving horse riding, barbecues and dancing to zydeco. What Chenier helped shape is now an emblem of the Black south, alongside Cajun culture, created by the white descendants of French ancestors.“Historically we’d say, down here, if you’re white and you play the accordion, then you play Cajun. And if you’re Black and you play the accordion, then you play zydeco,” says Joel Savoy of Valcour Records. Cultures that were once drawn along racial lines “are very blurred now, the two scenes overlap a lot, both musician-wise and audience-wise. Cajun and zydeco music coexist very happily.”View image in fullscreenA Tribute to the King of Zydeco, album artwork.Photograph: Valcour RecordsIndeed, on Tribute to the King the cream of Louisiana’s zydeco and Cajun musicians accompany the famous guests. There’s also Chenier’s son CJ, who inherited his father’s accordions and band, and Mouton, granddaughter of Chenier’s brother Cleveland, who plays rubboard, the ribbed steel washboard Cleveland and Clifton invented for performing.“Picking up my grandfather’s washboard after he passed I wondered if I could play that thing,” Mouton says. “Well, I strapped it around my neck, turned on some of Uncle Clifton’s music and started playing along. Now my three-year-old son, Levi, has his own washboard and joins me on stage every chance he gets. Guess it’s safe to say the legacy will live on for generations to come.”A Tribute to the King of Zydeco is on Valcour Records. Celebrating the Centenary of Clifton Chenier (with Ruben Moreno) takes place at Maverick festival, Easton Farm Park, Suffolk, 4-6 July.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockBluesLouisianaMick JaggerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Suicide Squad veteransIdris Elbaand John Cena are redeployed in this gun show from Nobody director Ilya Naishuller, respectively, as the UK prime minister and US president at loggerheads. President Derringer, barely six months in office, resents the PM for not doing more to help him get elected. Prime Minister Clarke, a six-year incumbent mired in an approval ratings slump, has already dismissed the president – a swaggering former action hero – as a Schwarzenegger knockoff. After a joint press conference goes sideways and spoils the announcement of a Nato-supported energy initiative, the pair are forced on an Air Force One ride to help repair the PR damage – but it gets worse when the plane is shot down.Jurassic World Rebirth review – Scarlett Johansson runs show as near-extinct franchise roars back to lifeRead moreAs it turns out, the Nato energy thingy was cribbed from a nuclear scientist that alliance forces neutralized to head off the threat of another Hiroshima – and his father, a psycho arms dealer named Viktor Gradov (a rueful Paddy Considine), is bent on revenge. In fact, the two-hour film opens with Noel – a skull-cracking MI6 agent played byPriyanka Chopra– leading a covert strike on Gradov in the middle of the world famous Tomatina festival in Buñol, Spain, that turns upside down when she and her team are felled in the food fight. That botched operation – part of a wider sabotage, as we’ll learn later – is top of mind when the president and prime minister bail out of Air Force One (under attack from without and within) into a Belarusian wood. From there, they must find their way back to safe harbor – not knowing whom they can trust when they get there, of course. All the while they’re being chased by Gradov’s hell-raising henchmen Sasha and Olga “the Killers”, whom Aleksandr Kuznetsov and Katrina Durden play like Boris and Natasha, but eviler.It’s the kind of paint-by-numbers summer tentpole that would have drawn a crowd in 2013 – when Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down were doing serious box office numbers. The fact that Amazon MGM went straight to streaming with it, instead of doing an exclusive theatrical release first, speaks volumes about the state of play in the film industry – and, perhaps, the mixed reception forG20, their straight-to-streaming shoot-em-up about the female president who has to fight her way out of a global summit.But where a Bezos studio head could make the case that Viola Davis isn’t a solo draw (even as her body of work suggests otherwise), the lack of faith in Heads’ theatrical potential is beyond comprehension. John Cena remains one of, if notthebiggest draw in professional wrestling, while popping up in everything from the Fast and Furious franchise to the Simpsons. Idris, star of big (Hobbs & Shaw) and small screen (Luther, The Wire), has been touted as a possible James Bond successor for a solid decade. Chopra is a Bollywood superstar who successfully pivoted to network TV and married a Jonas brother. Why did Amazon think this film wouldn’t do well at the cineplex?They should’ve had more confidence in their leads, all three of whom meet the broad performance profile for a popcorn thriller. Elba in particular does a deft job of toggling from his Odd Couple chemistry with Cena (the exceptional actor-wrestler besides Dave Bautista who canreallyplay the margins between tough and tender) to the romantic chemistry with Chopra (who gets to kick ass and take punches just like in her Quantico days). The rest of the cast delivers, too. Richard Coyle plays against his Coupling type as the PM’s dour right hand, while Sarah Niles – with her resting “bitch, please” face – is a study in quiet strength again as the president’s top aide and best bud. Stephen Root, a hacker double agent, is always a treat. And Jack Quaid, fresh off playing lead inNovocaine, hams it up so hard in his handful of appearances as a CIA safe house watchman that he earns his very own end-credits scene.Throughout, Naishuller cooks up action sequences that leave plenty of room for pratfalls and one-liners. (The PM, a Royal Army vet, detonating a smoke bomb in his own face; puns are Noel’s love language; etc) And the writing – a team effort between Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec (Ghost Protocol) and Harrison Query (who also gets story credit) – has command. When two major characters went missing for chunks of the film (Chopra’s was gone for nearly an hour), they would smartly bring them back with a snappy, Edgar Wright-style montage explaining where they had been. Bleeding hearts will keep watching for the sermon on Nato’s value as a peace-keeping force, and maybe look away when it ends in a massive shootout.Fun, fiery and totally frivolous, Heads of State is a perfect summer movie with great potential for future sequels. (The end scene certainly sets that up.) But getting it to launch first in theaters next time might take a global coalition.

In 1948, Clement Attlee’s government made a choice founded on fairness: that everyone in our country deserves to receive the care they need, not the care they can afford.That the NationalHealthService was created amid the rubble and ruin of the aftermath of war makes that choice all the more remarkable. It enshrined in law and in the service itself our collective conviction that healthcare is not a privilege to be bought and sold, but a right to be cherished and protected. Now it falls to our generation to make the same choice.There have always been those who have whispered that theNHSis a burden, too expensive, inferior to the market. Today, those voices grow louder, determined to use the crisis in the NHS as an opportunity to dismantle it. This government rejects the pessimistic view that universal healthcare could be afforded in the 20th century but not in the 21st. So does the public. But unless the NHS changes, the argument that it is unsustainable will grow more compelling. It really is change or bust. We choose change.Today, the prime minister will launch our 10-year plan for health, to radically reimagine healthcare. More care will be available on your doorstep and from your own home, with thousands more GPs. Services and resources will be moved out of hospitals and into the community. New neighbourhood health centres[?]will house doctors, nurses, physios, therapists, tests, scans and urgent care under one roof, built around patients’ convenience.AI technology will liberate frontline staff from the drudgery of admin, giving them time to care. Saving just 90 seconds of data entry and note-taking per appointment would be the equivalent of hiring an extra 2,000 GPs. For patients, tech will make booking appointments and managing your care as easy as doing your shopping online.By treating and caring for patients closer to home, we will reach patients earlier, to catch illness before it worsens, and prevent it in the first place. Our plan brings together a coalition of the willing on public health,working with supermarketsto make the healthy choice the easy choice and pharmaceutical companies to secure obesity jabs for NHS patients.The plan is backed by an extra£29bn investment to fund the reforms, better services and new technology.I am sometimes told that NHS staff are resistant to change. In my experience, they’re crying out for it. They have suffered the moral injury of turning up to work, slogging their guts out, only to leave at the end of the day feeling exhausted and demoralised by the conditions that patients are being treated in because of circumstances beyond their control.I spoke to a nurse in a community clinic who told me she spends more time filling out forms than seeing patients. That’s not why she joined the NHS. We need to free up our staff to do what they do best – care. They’re the ones driving innovation on the frontline, and their fingerprints are all over this plan.To succeed, we need to defeat the cynicism that says that “nothing ever changes”. We know the change in our plan is possible because it is already happening. We have toured the country and scouted the world for the best examples of innovation and reform. If Australia can effectively serve communities living in the remote outback, we can meet the needs of people living in rural and coastal England. If community health teams can go door to door toprevent ill health in Brazil, we can do the same in Bradford. We know we can build the “neighbourhood health service”, because teams inCornwall,CamdenandNorthumberlandare already showing us how.Since July, we’ve already begun to turn the tide. We promised to deliver 2m extra elective appointments in our first year – we’ve delivered4m and counting. Through our plan for change, we’ve takenalmost a quarter of a million casesoff the waiting list.The science is on our side. The revolution in genomics, AI, machine learning and big data offers a golden opportunity to deliver better care for all patients and better value for taxpayers. We will take it, marrying the ingenuity of our country’s leading scientists with the care and compassion of the health service.Above all else, we will give power to the patient. In an age of next-day deliveries, an NHS that forces you to wait on the phone at 8am to book an appointment feels ridiculously outdated. Patients don’t just want a service from the NHS, we want a say. We don’t want the same as everyone else; we want care that meets our individual needs. Equality does not mean uniformity, it means that every person receives the right care for them.This plan will give people real choices, faster responses and a say in how their care is delivered and where. It will fulfil Nye Bevan’s commitment in 1948 that the NHS would put a “megaphone in the mouth” of every patient, and make sure that the advantages enjoyed by the privileged few were available to all.We know the British people are counting on us to make sure that the NHS not only survives, but thrives. We are determined not to let them down.That’s the plan – now it falls to us and the 1.5 million people working in the NHS to deliver it. It won’t be easy, but nothing could be more worthwhile. If we succeed, we will be able to say with pride, echoed through the remaining decades of this century, that we were the generation that built an NHS fit for the future and a fairer Britain, where everyone lives well for longer.Wes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This timely film was originally produced for the BBC by award-winning production company Basement Films. The BBC has been delaying it since February, arguing it couldn’t go out before a review into an entirely different film, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone,had culminated. That was a poor editorial decision with no precedent. But poorer still: after months of leaving the film in limbo, last week theBBC announced it wouldn’t air it– leaving it for Channel 4 to pick up.Why? TheBBCsaid it might create “the perception of partiality”. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was lifted from a dystopian novel. Perception, after all, has nothing to do with impartiality – at least in an ideal world. The BBC seems to have said the quiet part out loud. Impartiality, as far as it’s concerned, is about PR, optics and managing the anger of certain groups, rather than following the evidence and championing robust journalism – no matter who’s angered, no matter how it looks.More than 100 BBC journalistshave now anonymously signed a letter, calling the choice not to broadcast Gaza: Doctors Under Attack a “political decision” that doesn’t reflect the quality of journalism in the film. The BBC, they say, is “an organisation crippled by the fear of being perceived as critical of the Israeli government”. The letter says the decision not to air this film came straight from the top, and many BBC staff – junior and senior – are unhappy with it. They feel it doesn’t reflect the organisation’s values, and that there was no acceptable editorial justification for delaying and then canning it. Some have been brave enough to voice this internally, but their concerns haven’t been heard.It’s no surprise to me that the BBC isn’t listening to its own journalists over this film. It’s also no surprise to me that more than 100 BBC journalists felt they needed anonymity to criticise the board’s decision. Because this isn’t the first anonymous letter. Twenty months ago, while I was working as a journalist in a BBC newsroom, coveringGazaday in and day out, I realised that my news organisation wasn’t accurately telling this story. But I didn’t feel I could openly criticise editorial policy without being taken off the story or coded as biased, and I wasn’t alone.View image in fullscreenA scene from the Gaza: Doctors Under Attack film to be shown on Channel 4.Photograph: Basement FilmsIn November 2023, I wrote the first letter out of the BBC, expressing concerns about the Gaza coverage. It was signed by just seven other BBC journalists, andreported on by Al Jazeera. By the time I wrote my last letter,published inthe Independenta year later, more than 100 BBC journalists had signed anonymously, alongside hundreds of industry professionals and respected media lecturers. This was around the time I left the organisation, unable to continue in good conscience. Dissent was clearly growing. But people were still afraid to speak openly.Last week in parliament, the BBC’s director of news, Richard Burgess, claimed the organisation listens to its journalists. But my letters weren’t heard, and nor were my efforts to raise the alarm internally. In the year from October 2023, I organised staff, attended multiple “listening sessions” with executives, helped put together dossiers of poor coverage, wrote to executives and relevant teams, and did my best to cover Gaza while hamstrung by obstructive editorial policy and an unwillingness to cover the story.I was a BBC-trained journalist horrified at the contradiction between the ideals of our public broadcaster – accuracy, transparency, public trust – and its actions. Editorial caution had become editorial cowardice. Decisions were being shaped by fear – of complaint campaigns and lobby groups, of being told off by higher-ups. This had left us with coverage that was overall inaccurate, failing to communicate the disproportionality, scale, gravity and illegality of Israel’s actions in Gaza – actions now deemed a genocide by various experts and humanitarian organisations.Inaccuracy is more than telling an overt lie. Inaccuracy comes in many forms: omitting key stories, omitting key context, speaking to one group far more than another. Good journalism is about following the evidence. And if the BBC’s approach has been shaped by evidence, why did it speak to more than double the number of Israelis, compared with Palestinians, in the year after 7 October 2023? Why did it omit key legal context – such as the January 2024 international court of justice ruling – from its coverage? These choices skew reality. Both are findings from a recent damningCentre for Media Monitoring reporton the BBC’s Gaza coverage, with data-backed insights into how it has failed to tell the full story.‘Heads will roll’: BBC reckons with bias accusations over Israel and Palestine coverageRead moreAnd it hasn’t learned its lesson. Perhaps if the BBC had listened to these journalists over the past year and a half, Gaza: Doctors Under Attack would have aired in February when it was ready, instead of becoming another gaping omission in BBC coverage.BBC impartiality is dead. The fiction that our public broadcaster can stay perfectly neutral, without being influenced, is fracturing around us. Every so-called “controversial” story has exposed a new fault line, showing how unwilling the BBC is to wade through influence and disinformation to get to the truth – in certain cases. Gaza, climate breakdown, migration: these are stories where public opinion has been polarised, powerful lobby groups are at play, or where the government or major corporations have come down on one side. This is where the BBC is most needed but fails most catastrophically.Those at the top of the BBC now have a choice. They can once again ignore the alarm raised by their own journalists, and continue to chip away at the trust of audiences and staff. Or they can finally – after 20 months – listen.Karishma Patel is a former BBC journalist and newsreader turned media criticDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let me tell you about vaginal dryness ...Polly HudsonI’m not sure there is anything more terrifying than chatting to parents at the school gates – then lying awake at night reliving my most embarrassing momentsWed 2 Jul 2025 11.43 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 13.25 EDTShareThe importance of 31 December is well documented, but no one ever talks about the angst of 22 July. Or 23, or 25, depending on where you live. But while the date may vary, the bittersweet feelings are surely universal. The end of the school year is an oddly profound moment.This one’s hitting different in our house too, as our son is about to finish primary school. It’s poignant and nostalgic – wasn’t he just a baby yesterday? There is, however, one part of his cosy little school that I won’t miss.Kids tend to walk home on their own from secondary school, so my pickup days will come to an end, and – hallelujah! – so will my experiences of spectacularly failing to make small talk with fellow parents while we wait, my cheeks burning with shame. The school should put up a plaque in memory of all the occasions when I have died inside.Over the seven years my kid has been there, I have made some really good friends. But let’s be honest, mostly I’ve made nodding acquaintances with people with whom the only common ground is that our children are in the same year. Were it not for the fact that we all had sex at a similar time 11 years ago, our paths would never have crossed. Although I’m delighted that has only just occurred to me, because if I had realised earlier there is an excellent chance I would have announced it in the first conversational lull at the school gates.Pickup is the same every day. Even if you desperately try not to catch anyone’s eye, you will be unable to avoid doing so, because there are so many of you congregating.You greet each other with “Hello” and “How are you?”. Now and then, the gods smile on you and it will be pouring with rain, or snowing, or a bit warmer or colder than usual for the time of year, so you might get 30 seconds out of that. But then there will be a pause. And I guarantee I will fill it. Apparently, ittakes four secondsfor a silence to become uncomfortable, which doesn’t sound long, but if you count it out loud, it’s an age for two people to be standing together not saying anything. I freak out after less than two seconds.It is as though all the information I have ever consumed is filed in my brain in a towering pile, with the most recent on the top and easiest to reach. There’s a gap in the chat, so I panic, and blurt out whatever is closest. I congratulated someone on her pregnancy who turned out to just be wearing dungarees as a fashion choice. Another time, I backed myself so tightly into a serial killer “joke” corner – “I’m not one of course … although that is what a serial killer would say” – that the other party appears to be actively afraid of me now. And once, because I had watched a Davina McCall documentary on menopause the night before, I talked about severe vaginal dryness, in an effort to end a silence with a virtual stranger and make thingslessawkward. Saying “vaginal” to someone you barely know in broad daylight, stone cold sober, is a big move. Maybe there are other words that would be worse to follow it up with than “dryness”, but I can’t think of many.Don’t confuse my modus operandi with having no filter, which seems bold and intentional. This is accidental and anxious, a horrific kneejerk reaction. It feels uncontrollable.Sometimes when I replay these embarrassing moments over and over again in my head during that sleepless night’s existential crisis, I realise I am undoubtedly remembering it as worse than it was. Not so here. The woman I said vaginal dryness to looked as if she wanted the playground to open up and swallow her. She probably avoids me to this day, but it’s hard to tell because I’m too busy avoiding her. Imagine how excruciating it will be if we ever speak again. Imagine what I might say next.Well, when one door closes, another opens – watch out secondary school parents, I’m coming for you!

How can a business be worth twice as much in private hands than on the public markets?The company is Spectris, a low-profile but high-qualityFTSE250 maker of precision instruments and testing equipment used in everything from food manufacturing to automotives. The buyer is KKR with an agreed offer of £4.1bn that beats fellow US private equity house Advent’s £3.8bn offer last week.Private equity’s dominance has gone too far | Nils PratleyRead moreThe detail of the bidding, as revealed in Wednesday’s documents, is a tale in itself. The board of Spectris had turned down two previous approaches from KKR, starting at £30.25 a share, and five from Advent, before accepting the latter’s £37.63. Now KKR has come over the top at £40 a share. The impression is of private equity firms salivating over the target while the public markets sleep. The caricature of the London market as a risk-averse place of capital drift is roughly accurate.The perceived problem at Spectris – the reason for its falling share price from early 2024 – was weak trading during the year, then the possible effect of Donald Trump’s tariffs on an international business that makes a third of its sales in Asia, plus an increase in debt to fund a couple of acquisitions in the US. The worries were legitimate up to a point but, as a few City analysts had argued before the bidders showed up, none suddenly made Spectris a bad business.Its chief executive, Andrew Heath, had still transformed the portfolio since 2019, selling peripheral units and bringing in better fits. Return on capital employed was a handsome 18.5% in 2023 with a good chance of getting back to that level.Two details should sting. One was KKR’s comment about how private ownership will allow management to focus on the day job “without the ongoing shorter-term requirements of being a publicly listed company”. Unfortunately, that assessment is probably correct. One can’t trust everything private equity says, but KKR’s plan for Spectris is to “significantly accelerate inorganic growth”. In other words, do deals that were off-limits to the company while its acquisition currency, its share price, was weak.The second painful aspect is that the buyer will probably make fat returns even after paying what, in other circumstances, would be regarded as a silly premium. UBS’s analyst thinks a private equity owner could still make a 20% internal rate of return under its “bear case” operating environment. Under its “medium-term normalised scenario”, the rate could be 35%.This is the crisis in the UK stock market in a nutshell. The broker Peel Hunt, in research titled “UK for sale”, last month counted 30 bids of £100m-plus for UK listed companies so far this year – all outside the FTSE 100 index and adding up to £25bn. There has been only one new listing of £100m-plus in the same period. While a certain level of takeover action is normal, average premiums of 43% says there are huge pockets of undervaluation at the mid-cap and small-cap end of the market. The position is dangerous if one takes the view, as one should, that a dynamic economy needs a vibrant stock market.None of this is new news, of course, but the sight of two 96% takeover premiums in a month (the other was chip designer Alphawave) should hammer home the size of the problem. Peel Hunt’s remedies to address the outflow of capital are reform of pension funds, ISAs and stamp duty. All have beenadvocatedheretoo.

Here’s why it could be a good thingLarry ElliottThe education secretary speaks of ‘worrying repercussions’ – but as far as wellbeing goes, the UK might be a lot better offWed 2 Jul 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 11.55 EDTShareBack in the early 1970s when he was lead singer with the Faces, few of his fans would have expected Rod Stewart to be still belting out Maggie May at Glastonbury more than half a century later. Long gone are the days when rock stars hoped to die before they got old. Instead, 80-year-old rock stars symbolise the fact that Britain and other developed economies have ageing populations. Women are having children later in life and having fewer of them.Politicians are starting to fret about the prospect of a decreasing number of people of working age supporting an ever-increasing number of pensioners. Just this week, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the falling birthrate had “worrying repercussions” and thatshe hoped tobe able to make it easier for women to have children.This might seem a curious concern given that the UK’s population has risen from fewer than 60 million at the turn of the millennium to 67.2 million by 2022 and is expected to rise by another 5 million by 2032. Yet the fertility rate in England and Wales – the number of live births per woman – is currently 1.44, the lowest since records began in 1938 and well below the 2.1 level consistent with a stable population. If that trend continues and net migration is reduced, the number of people in the UK will eventually start to decline.So much is obvious. Less clear is what, if anything, policymakers should do to raise fertility rates. The answer may well be nothing. A falling population is not a disaster. It might even be a good thing.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, would certainly disagree with that conclusion. So would France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. Italy has a tax-free allowance – a “baby bonus” – for women having children. Macron has a plan for France’sdemographic rearmament. In 2019, Hungary offered women a€30,000 (£26,000) interest-free loanthat would be non-repayable in the event that they had three or more children. The chances of the UK matching that level of generosity given the strains on the public finances are infinitesimally small.Yet the evidence from countries that have already hit the panic button over declining populations is not encouraging. Fertility rates in Italy, France and Hungary remain well below 2.1 despite the fiscal inducements. And that’s because the factors that are persuading women to delay having children – or not have children at all – are stronger than government tax breaks or interest-free loans.Make no mistake, these are welcome changes. Women are better educated than they have ever been. More of them go to university, so have the possibility of securing interesting and well-paid jobs. It is not surprising that for many of them career progression takes precedence over childbirth in their 20s. The days when households were financially dependent on one male breadwinner are over – and a good thing too.It is also tough for women who do want to start a family at a younger age. Rising house prices have resulted in home ownership rates among 25- to 34-year-oldsdeclining from 59% to 39%since 2000. Rents have also increased sharply.Given all this, it is hard to see much future for pronatalist policies in the UK. The reality is that the demographic makeup of Britain will change over the coming decades as people live longer and fertility rates remain well below 2.1. If net migration is below the levels of recent years, the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks thepopulation could be 1.2 million lowerin 2072 than it was in 2022.Is this really so much of a problem? The economist David Miles – one of those responsible for putting together the OBR’s economic and fiscal forecasts – says not. In a recent paper, he argues that the catastrophising about shrinking populations is “largely bunkum”.In part, that’s because the global population is expected to continue growing for some decades to come, putting added pressure on the environment and speeding up climate breakdown. It makes little sense to adopt policies designed to increase fertility rates when the UK is an overcrowded island in an overpopulated world.But it is also the case that the combination of an ageing and gently falling population could result in living standards rising. Older people tend to save more and that means the ratio of capital to worker will increase. There will, in other words, be fewer workers but they could well be more productive.Bridget Phillipson says she wants more young people in UK to have childrenRead moreMeasured by gross domestic product, the economy would be getting smaller, but GDP per head – a much better measure of wellbeing – would be increasing. There would be less congestion on the roads, less pressure on public services and less competition for housing. Japan already has an ageing and shrinking population and seems to be coping just fine.To be sure, there will still need to be policy changes in Britain. If there are going to be fewer young people, it is bad for the economy as well as a waste of individual potential for them not to be working. To that extent, the motivation behind the government’s botched welfare reforms makes sense. Childcare needs to be more affordable and changes to the pension age might also be required to extend the working lives of those able to do so.But it is not inevitable that a falling population would be bad for the economy. It would certainly be good for the planet.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPopulationOpinionMigrationBridget PhillipsonLabourChildbirthcommentShareReuse this content"

A party this dysfunctional and divided cannot escape the wrath of voters at the next electionWed 2 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 05.15 EDTShareThe welfare billhas gone through, but what is on the minds of most Labour MPs and supporters is how did we get into this appalling mess over disability benefits? A key factor has been the immense lack of judgment of the party’s real decision-makers, the team in the leader’s office, fuelled by their overweening arrogance. The egos of the young men cloistering Keir Starmer have clearly been inflated by the multitude of articles written by sycophantic commentators desperate to secure access to the new regime.However, the seeds of this debacle were sown by the Treasury’s capture of the incoming government, enabling officials to bring back the same old austerity agenda of benefit cuts that they developed for George Osborne.They misguidedly thought disabled people would again be an easy target, but this time they totally miscalculated the deep-seated adherence ofLabourmembers to the principle and tradition of standing up for the poorest in our society.2:03MPs vote to pass Keir Starmer's welfare bill after last-minute concessions – videoIn the past when senior party apparatchiks were getting too big for their boots or a cabinet minister was pursuing an obvious policy disaster, the leader would have had sufficient political nous to put his foot down before things got out of control. The failure to demonstrate this essence of leadership and exert control over his officials and the chancellor has left Starmer in the worst of all worlds.He’s got his bill to pass, but he’s done so with asignificant numberof Labour MPs angrily refusing to support it. Many of those dragooned through the voting lobby to back the bill did so full of resentment, and aware they may face a scale of opposition in their constituencies that could cost them their seats.With his authority damaged by poor judgment, absence of leadership and a sheer lack of understanding of what the Labour party exists for, Starmer will stumble on weakened and directionless, convincing himself that sitting next to Trump andattending NatoandG7 meetingsmeans he has a historic role to play.Succession planners have clearly been at work, though. Many Labour MPs would not have signed the reasoned amendment to the benefit cuts bill and expressed their criticisms had they not been encouraged to do so by their sponsoring cabinet ministers.Those who believe they have a chance of succeeding Starmer were willing to see their backbench proteges undermining the leader because they know their chance could come sooner than anyone thought possible only a few months ago.If the polls and next year’s local elections are as bad as some predict, the men in grey suits will inevitably be dispatched by Peter Mandelson to make Starmer an offer he can’t refuse. Some would rather this happened sooner and it could be triggered by a policy nightmare miscalculation on the autumn scheduled issues of child poverty, reform of theSend system, or the handling of the budget in November. Discussion of leadership failure and policy blunders masks the fundamental reason why Labour got itself into the mess over this attack on disabled people.It is the absolute hollowing out of democracy in the Labour party, which enables a centralisation of power under a self-serving bureaucracy that is effectively out of control, operating with impunity. Poor decisions are made on strategy and policy from top to bottom because democracy has been stripped out of the party. Constituency Labour parties are not permitted to even debate some of the most significant political issues of the day, such as Gaza. Views questioning the leadership line, whether expressed in meetings or on social media, lead easily to disciplinary action.The selection of candidates for council or parliamentary elections is so tightly controlled that anyone with a hint of independence of thought stands virtually no chance of being allowed on candidate lists. The selection process for candidates for forthcoming council selections has become more akin to the Spanish Inquisition or McCarthyite hearings. Dominated by party staffers and careerists, the selection panels draw on comments made in private group meetings supplied by informers.Similarly, parliamentary selections in many cases have been ruthlessly fixed to parachute allies of the elite into safe seats that often they rely upon a satnav to find. Members of the PLP are looked upon simply as bothersome lobby fodder, whose views are ignored unless they seem equipped to cause turbulence in the face of threats, such as losing the whip or the chance of promotion.The change of procedure for the election of the party leader that bounced through the party conference soon after the election of Starmer means that there is a negligible chance of any future leadership candidate getting on to the ballot paper if they’re not the chosen one for the current controlling tendency.In the past, trade unions might have exerted some democratic influence in the party. But they are either bogged down by internal problems or being divided and are largely ruled by the offer of small scraps from the government table.The saving grace people are hopefully clinging to is that the next general election is four years away, and that maybe the resistance shown over the welfare bill will prompt lessons to be learned. However, unless the fundamental issue of re-establishing democracy in the party is grasped, I fear nothing will change. It’s a very real fear that the cycle of inept policy imposition, disciplinary threats, embarrassing climbdowns and disillusionment will continue until Labour leaves office, having wasted its large majority and the early goodwill of its members and the electorate.John McDonnell is the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington.

But society has hard calls to make: sometimes perfect is not worth havingWed 2 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 12.46 EDTShareIt’s the perfect Wimbledon. The sun is out, the Brits are firing and as for the scoring, that too will be somewhat perfect, this being the first Wimbledon since the tournament told the line judges, long the arbiters of accuracy, that after 148 years, their services willno longer be required.Arguments, unpredictability and, as the cameras zoom in to the line judge whose eyesight judgment prompts a participant explosion, buttock-clenching awkwardness in close-up: goodbye to all that. Hello, AI and sharp-eyed robots, analysing in real time 18 lots of footage.It’s perfect now, but is it progress? After the first day, players complained that while the calls were perfect in their accuracy, they were imperfect in that the gizmo’s volume was set too low and they could not hear the verdicts.To some extent, Wimbledon is falling into line – both the Australian and US Opens, and very many of the lesser professional tournaments, have waved goodbye to the humans and embracedelectronic line calling. The players wanted it. They strive truly, madly and deeply for perfection; their short, explosive careers cannot hinge on the human fallibility of others.But look at Centre Court without the sentries posted around the border, and without the quiet ceremony that has always marked the departure of one set of line judges and the arrival of another. One day their absence will feel natural and maybe we’ll forget they were ever there, barking their assessments. But for now, their absence feels like a loss. Game, set and match to the gizmos.Of the grand slams, the premier tournaments of world tennis, only the French Open has resisted the temptation to shoo away the line judges and embrace electronica, and you may think therein lies a morality tale of sorts. When the Wimbledon plan was mooted, one experienced line judge there spoke not just of the hurt of being abruptly discarded but also of her worry that line judges, drawn from clubs around the country, were a crucial link between the elite game, with its Wimbledon showpiece, and the grassroots, which has perennially felt neglected. They saw being asked to participate at Wimbledon as a reason to stay connected, a kind of lodestar. “I worry that smaller tournaments willstruggle to find line judgessoon,” she said.At the French Open this year, FrenchTennisFederation president Gilles Moretton was asked why it remains loth to regulate battle on the red clay with technology and cleaves to its line judges.He thought the gizmos were not quite perfect, citing a 10% error rate. He said never say never, but primarily he said: “We need those people working all year long in our tournaments, promoting tennis in small clubs, being there for club matches. If we stop having those linesmen, those referees, we feel that is not too good for tennis in France maybe, and I think it may be the same in other countries.”PerhapsWimbledonis right – in lockstep with inevitability and history’s sweep – but it’s worth taking a moment to think about the value and cost of perfection.Farewell tradition, hello robots: Wimbledon adjusts to life without line judgesRead moreTalk to a football fan about VAR. Thevideo assistant referee systemwas designed to help match officials make perfect decisions but has instead robbed too many games of flow, joy and spontaneity. Do I want glaring mistakes to stand? No. Do I want a brilliant goal disallowed because the gizmo picked up an attacker’s elbow tip rendering them offside? No, I don’t want that either. Do I want to wait five minutes to celebrate a goal while the gizmo and its handlers, pursuing their perfection, deliberate? No, I really don’t. Do I want my team to lose because the referee made an error? No, of course not, but I also think that human fallibility is what makes it a flesh-and-blood endeavour.As the technological possibilities increase, with an AI model for everything now, we are going to have to face and answer some hard questions about whether we want perfect (or just good enough) and/or whether we prize humans. Of course there will be a need for both, but if we leave big tech and commerce to make those decisions, the society of the future may not be calibrated the way we’d like.I’m no luddite. Machines and tech do some things better. But humans are human. They smile at you at the supermarket checkout, can out-banter any bot at the bank or the hardware store and they added to the spectacle that is Wimbledon. They’re not perfect, but I will always miss them when they’ve gone.Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025OpinionWimbledonTenniscommentShareReuse this content"

That doesn’t mean a crisis was inevitable. Compromise might have been reached before the 11th-hour climbdown thataverted a defeatin parliament.The conflagration that burned a lot of Sir Keir Starmer’s authority was all the greater because trust had broken down. The twin causes were failure of political judgment in Downing Street and bad policy. The prime minister underestimated the potency of MPs’ objections to the withdrawal of personal independence payment (Pip) from disabled people, and overestimated the capacity of his whips to bully and cajole his party into accepting the changes.Those errors flowed from a more fundamental flaw – the conflation of public sector reform with fiscal consolidation in ways that raised justified suspicion about the underlying motive for the policy. Most of the rebels recognise that there are problems with the existing benefits system. The dramatic increase in Pip claims over recent years testifies to a deeper social malaise. This is an issue that needs to be addressed and in ways that, over time, cost less.But that argument was obscured by the requirement to find £5bn in savings at short notice so that the Treasury might stay on track to honour fiscal rules. It was not credible to say the Pip cuts were devised with compassionate intent to“fix” the systemwhen the announcement was made days before the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, under pressure to find extra budget headroom in her forecasts, delivered thespring statement.Nobody was fooled and Sir Keir was foolish to think they might be. The prime minister’s defenders note that he has many competing demands on his attention. His crass and inflammatory dismissal of backbench complaints as “noises off” was made at aNato summitwhere the prime minister was focused on persuading Donald Trump not to abandon the alliance.But the offending remark was not a slip of the tongue. It expressed impatience with any criticism that is presumed to originate from a recalcitrant left faction of theLabourparty. This habit was learned in opposition when Sir Keir’s strategy for winning power involved ruthless enforcement of message discipline and suppression of dissent. That reflex prevents the prime minister from recognising that his critics might hail from a wide cross-section of Labour and society, and might have valid points.As a result, a dispute over benefit changes escalated into a crisis of confidence in the leadership. The result is a messy compromise that defers the question of how Pip should be properly reformed, while the Treasury’s fiscal conundrum has become evenmore acute. The issue of disability benefits was always going to be uniquely sensitive for Labour MPs, who see the protection of vulnerable citizens and reinforcement of the social safety net as primary functions of their party. But the rebellion over Pip is unlikely to be the last such confrontation, especially if Downing Street doesn’t learn the right lessons.Using the language of public sector reform as camouflage on ill-judged budget cuts was a grave mistake, compounded by arrogant rejection of MPs’ objections. The prime minister now has a difficult task repairing his authority and rebuilding relations with his party. If he does not understand the origins of the crisis, he condemns himself to repeat it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Businesses and government must not sacrifice the next generation on the altar of techWed 2 Jul 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 14.14 EDTShareAs annual degree ceremonies take place on campuses across the country this month, new graduates will doubtless be turning their thoughts to enjoying some stress-free time off. Given the current state of the labour market, some may be forced to make that break a long one.For university leavers, these are worrying times. A mounting pile of data suggests that accessing the kind of entry-level jobs that traditionally put degree holders on a path to professional success is becoming ever harder. Onereportpublished last month by the job-search site Indeed found that the market for young people fresh out of university is tougher than at any time since 2018. Compared with last year, the number of jobs advertised for recent graduates is down 33%.Some of the squeeze can be put down to a general slowdown in hiring, as employers opt for caution in an unpredictable, growth-starved economic climate. Anotheranalysis, published this week, found that the number of entry-level jobs on offer throughout the labour market has fallen. But the steepest drop-off appears to be in professional occupations, where the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) may be beginning to affect the bottom rungs of the white-collar career ladder.According to some analysts, a growing number of companies are using AI to perform many of the collative, summarising or research-heavy kind of tasks that young graduates might previously have done. IBM’s human resources department nowdeploysAI to perform 94% of routine tasks, including performance reviews and development plans. Other employers may be hiring fewer graduates than in the past on the assumption that the use of AI will transform their productivity.For a graduate cohort whose education was blighted by the pandemic, and which is burdened by anaveragestudent debt of about £45,000, such developments risk stunting careers before they have begun. Recruitment systems are steadily being transformed through the introduction of AI-driven siftingprocesses, in which applications are rejected without a human judgment being made. A sustained contraction of the graduate job market, as pathways into professional careers are shortsightedly shut down in the name of cost savings, would further undermine trust between the generations at a time when it is already in short supply.The technology minister, Peter Kyle, hasurgedbusinesses and employees to “act now” in gaining AI skills or risk being left behind, and the government hopes to collaborate with tech companies to deliver training to 7.5 million workers. But a focus on those hoping to enter the digitised workplace is also clearly needed. The evidence that entry-level jobs in areas such as law, finance and consulting are becoming scarcer should set alarm bells ringing both in Westminster and in boardrooms.Politically and economically, the country cannot afford to waste the acquired skills, creativity and dynamism of those who have actually come of age in the digitised world. That may mean companies eventually reimagining the spectrum of early career opportunities that can be offered to recent graduates. But business and government should make it a priority to ensure that they are given the openings and encouragement they need in a rapidly transforming environment. Innovations such asChatGPThave become embedded in everyday life at vertiginous speed. But their benefits must not come at the expense of the young talent that will be crucial to shaping our future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You want a perfect world where you perform and win but sometimes you perform and you don’t win. We will definitely look back at this game but Switzerland are a top team, playing at home, the opening game, I thought they were fabulous.”There were doubts over the capabilities of theNaticoming into their home Euros. Ramona Bachmann’s anterior cruciate ligament injury denied the host nation a figurehead, Lia Wälti, who was brilliant in Basel, has had her fitness questioned after a stop-start season for Arsenal and only Finland and Wales sat below the Swiss in the Fifa world rankings of the sides here.There was no dampened optimism from the sea of red that marched towards the stadium for an hour in the searing heat, ready to spend an evening peeling sweaty backs off plastic seats as the temperature remained at 32C at kick-off.“We didn’t win the game, there’s such a small difference between being successful and unsuccessful,” said Pia Sundhage, the Switzerland manager. “I’m very disappointed but tomorrow it’s important we look at the performance and take confidence from that.”View image in fullscreenHegerberg heads in Norway’s equaliser.Photograph: Kristian Skeie/Uefa/Getty ImagesThe mood was electric inside St Jakob-Park, the home of FC Basel, in Basel and although the 37,500-capacity stadium was no match for the2022 opener at Old Traffordin scale, it made up for it in volume. “Wäl-ti, Wäl-ti, Wäl- ti” the fans chanted towards their talismanic captain, whose visage adorns Adidas billboards across the city facing off with Germany’s Jule Brand. If a crowd could compensate for the small pool of players available, the league in Switzerland not yet being fully professional and only five of the 23-player squad playing their domestic football on home soil, then it did its best to do so.The energy from the crowd was matched by the energy on the pitch. TheNatihad come to compete, not just host. Expectations around their opponents were cautiously high. Norway possess individual attacking talent that would be the envy of any team and yet they have struggled in tournaments, a team ofgalácticosthat at times look like they don’t know each other. At the World Cup in 2023 they scrapped through the group stage by the skin of their teeth, and they have failed to escape the group in the previous two editions of the European Championship, including suffering a humiliating 8-0 defeat by England in 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, it was the home team that impressed. There was an energy to the Swiss and their wingers in particular had great joy in behind Norway’s wing-backs. Wälti and Géraldine Reuteler both tested the goalkeeper Cecilie Fiskerstrand from distance and their four corners inside 15 minutes were a reflection of their fighting spirit.Reuteler stung the bar, and the opening goal arrived to reward the patient and encouraging crowd four minutes later. Riesen, given an acre of space on the left, swung herself towards the box before sending in a low cross for Smilla Vallotto. She failed to control the ball or get a shot away but Riesen was on hand to collect, creeping it past Fiskerstrand and in.The Swiss began the second half as they had the first, but Norway pulled themselves back into the match out of nowhere nine minutes after the restart, Hegerberg powering in a header from close range after the Swiss goalkeeper Livia Peng had flapped at a rare Norway corner. It was a flattering scoreline for the pre-match favourites and they punished the hosts for not capitalising on their dominance four minutes later, a quiet Graham Hansen bursting to life and escaping 18-year-old Iman Beney on the left before hooking the ball into the middle toward Hegerberg. Julia Stierli got in ahead of the Champions League record goalscorer but deflected the ball into her own net. For the first time the Norwegian fans could be heard over the Swiss, having previously been drowned out and camouflaged, red shirts among red shirts.Ada HegerbergIt was almost disaster for the hosts in the 67th minute when Reuteler handled from a corner and the referee pointed to the spot, but Hegerberg put her penalty wide.After that reprieve, Riesen went down under pressure from Mathilde Harviken at the other end, contact looked minimal, but the video assistant referee overturned the initial penalty decision for a marginal offside in the buildup.Frustrated by Norwegian time wasting – “I don’t want to comment on that,” said Sundhage, when asked about her remarks on TV on the matter – Switzerland fought to the end but they could not find the final ball that would have given them a point. Defeat will hurt, but this was a performance full of promise, one that will act as a warning to Finland and Iceland of what is to come but that also took the fans watching on a journey full of passion that will likely reap rewards.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Switzerland women's football teamNorway women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I think I was just doing the basics very, very well. I executed really well today. I’m just so happy to have that level.”Although Vondrousova has struggled with numerous injuries over the last two years, falling as low as No 164 in the WTA rankings last month, she arrived atWimbledonas one of the most in- form players after winning the Berlin Open on grass, a run that included a win over Sabalenka. With her superior form, her history at Wimbledon and her victory over Raducanu earlier this year in Abu Dhabi, Vondrousova entered Centre Court the favourite.“There’s no better feeling than winning here at Wimbledon, winning on Centre Court, it honestly makes everything worth it,” said Raducanu. “You forget about everything, all the ups and downs – and many downs – when you’re out there and you win. It’s so fleeting. It lasts a few minutes after the match and now. Quickly you need to kind of get back in gear for the next day and the next round. For the rest of the evening I’m going to enjoy that one because I think it was really special.”Raducanu’s victory ensures that she will return to Centre Court for one of the toughest challenges in her sport as she faces Sabalenka, the No 1 seed and a three-time grand slam champion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shall we focus on the negatives? Shall we dwell on the frailties a little? The uncharacteristic errors, the double faults, an occasional scruffiness at the net, the frequent slumps in intensity? Shall we marvel at the fact that the lowest-ranked player in the tournament earned more break points (11) than one of the greatest players of his generation (10)? Shall we warn, in a tone of affected sternness, that the defending championwill have to raise his game on this evidence?Of course we shall, because this isCarlos Alcaraz, and because there is an entire cottage industry built around maintaining the idea that Alcaraz is in a state of crisis at all times, a state of crisis so acute that it is necessary to feign round-the-clock concern for him. We just want to see all that rich talent fulfilled. That’s all it is. Sincerely and genuinely. And definitely not a weirdly prurient interest in his holidays to Ibiza, or whether him and Emma Raducanu are, you know. Just the talent. Thinking of the talent here.‘Most special day of my life’: world No 733 Tarvet enjoys limelight in Alcaraz defeatRead moreAnd of course the illicit pleasure and enduring appeal of Alcaraz is that he so readily indulges these desires. He emotes. He misses a lot. He pulls off spectacular acrobatic winners immediately after missing a lot. He lives without inhibitions or regrets.Alcaraz is essentially a magic-eye puzzle you can read in whatever way you want, and after thesweat-drenched psychodrama of Fabio Fogninion Monday night there were more danger signs in his 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win over Britain’s Oliver Tarvet; if you really, really wanted to see them.The more prosaic truth is that Alcaraz was playing himself as much as he was playing the world No 733 from St Albans. Tarvet is one of those classic British folk heroes the early rounds ofWimbledonalways seem to throw up, complete with shaggy-dog backstory and tabloid headline-friendly name. And if Alcaraz was expecting an easy afternoon of Tarvet practice, he quickly discovered that it would be anything but easy shaking off this particular Tarvet from his back.Certainly Tarvet seemed to get an early read on the Alcaraz serve, used his speed and coverage to trade happily from the baseline, rode the early waves of noise from the home crowd. Some of his passes were sublime. Above all he looked untroubled, unfazed, hyper- confident, like a crypto-billionaire who had won a game against Carlos Alcaraz in a charity auction. “Good serve,” he called out at one point as his opponent pinned him with a vicious delivery to the body. Alcaraz shot him a look as if to say: yeah. Obviously it’s a good serve. I’m Carlos Alcaraz. Who are you again?View image in fullscreenOliver Tarvet probably played the best tennis of his life but it was still no match for Carlos Alcaraz.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut of course no read on Alcaraz’s serve is ever going to rival the read he has on yours. And though both men kept swinging, while Tarvet created break points and saved others, the only real jeopardy here was of the confected variety. Tarvet probably played the best match of his life, and in the end it was like bringing a sword to a sword fight when your opponent has about six far superior swords. There was a sadistic relish to the way Alcaraz kept teasing him with the drop shot, occasionally missing, mostly succeeding.But of course the drop shot, such a staple of the Alcaraz game, is also a stick to beat him with. Missing it costs one point, exactly the same as putting a forehand an inch long. And yet some misses are clearly more moral than others. For his detractors Alcaraz’s missed drop shots will always be taken in evidence against him, proof of his essential flimsiness.So, once again, we must deal with the principal charge. Alcaraz is inconsistent. It’s true, because everyone says so, to the point where it has basically passed into objective fact. Like the objective fact that Alcaraz has a win percentage of 90% so far this year, has won five of his six finals, is slowly putting together one of the greatest seasons in the modern era. His grass-court record stands comparison with the all-timers. This is the sort of inconsistency all but one of his rivals would dream of.But of course this is a stylistic as much as it is an empirical judgment. It is true that there is a big gulf between his highest and lowest levels. That he occasionally loses to peoplelike Botic van de Zandschulp. That towards the end of last season and for a small portion of this he has looked a little unmoored, a little rattled. And yet how much of this reaction stems from a desire toseecrisis, to armchair-analyse, to draw a straight line from his personal choices to his tennis as a way of justifying our interest in his personal choices?In a way, Alcaraz’s entire game serves as a kind of rejoinder to all this. This is, remember, still a player with just 34 tour games on grass, still adding levels and tones to his game, still learning how to master the mental side, still trying to work out exactly how famous he wants to be. In the meantime he’s going to keep going for the lines, keep going to Ibiza, keep trying the drop shot, keep embracing the chaos, because that’s the only way he knows. What if he misses, you scream. Fine. But what if he doesn’t?Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Carlos AlcarazWimbledonTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mercedes andRed Bullhave not commented on the reports and there has still been no indication from Verstappen that he wants to leave Red Bull.Last year, Wolff had made it clear he would consider Verstappen a prime asset to bring to Mercedes but with Verstappen then publicly committing to Red Bull, Mercedes announced they had selected Kimi Antonelli to join George Russell for 2025. Neither driver has a contract confirmed for next year and in Austria Wolff acknowledged he was interested in Verstappen. “As a team principal responsible for the best car brand in the world it is clear you’re exploring what a four-time world champion is going to do in the future,” he said.Russell said at that point he knew negotiations were taking place. “It’s only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing.”The Dutchman remains under contract to Red Bull until 2028 and their team principal, Christian Horner, has dismissed the speculation about his driver’s future as “a lot of noise”.Still, exit clauses within Verstappen’s contract would allow him to leave, although the details remain unconfirmed. It is understood that one clause would give him the option to do so if he were below a specific place – considered likely to be below second or third – by the summer break, which is after the Hungarian GP on 3 August.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen (left) was knocked out of the Austrian Grand Prix in the opening lap and has only a nine-point lead over fourth place in the standings.Photograph: Otto Moretti/IPA Sport/ShutterstockThe Red Bull motorsport adviser, Helmut Marko, said Verstappen was still well within the parameters of his opt-out clause. “Like all top drivers, there are performance-based exit clauses but as things currently stand there is absolutely no reason that this contract won’t be fulfilled,” he said.Verstappen stands third but after hisfirst-lap crash at the Austrian GPis only nine points in front of Russell, whose place is most likely to be sacrificed should Verstappen make the switch.Central to any decision is thought to be the major regulation changes set for next season, when new power units will be introduced. It is believed Mercedes are the frontrunners in this respect, while Red Bull will be manufacturing their own power units for the first time. Without track time, joining Mercedes would remain something of a leap of faith.Mercedes tempted Lewis Hamilton away from McLaren in 2012, with the team’s confidence at the rule change of the forthcoming new engine regulations of 2014 considered to be key in persuading him to make the move. Hamilton went on to take six world championships with Mercedes, who won eight consecutive drivers’ titles.Explore more on these topicsMax VerstappenMercedes GPRed BullFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

At Edgbaston heshowed off his new one, of the batter his coaches would like him to be. Pant was, by the standards of his own scatterbrained batting, a model of self-control, and restricted himself to just one glorious four and a single crisp, delicious six in the 60 minutes or so he was at the crease. They were good ones, a roly-poly sweep off Shoaib Bashir and a skip down the pitch to punch another of his deliveries over long-on, but otherwise Pant restrained himself to showing off his range of ascetic leaves, blocks and defensive shots.There was, it’s true, the odd moment or two when he nearly broke character. He couldn’t help himself but come running out to try to belt one of the first balls bowled by Chris Woakes after tea over the road into the botanical gardens. He seemed to change his mind midway through his swing, and ended up scuffing it away for a single, like a kid reaching his hand out to grab a cookie and then yanking it back again as they remember the promise they’d made to their parents.Shubman Gill digs in to steady India and hold off England’s battling bowlersRead moreThe crowd in the Hollies Stand actually started booing every time he blocked one, as if they wanted to goad him into playing the hits. Eventually Pant snapped and tried to hit Bashir for another six. But Bashir took a little pace off the ball so Pant didn’t catch it cleanly, and ended up being caught by Zak Crawley five yards in from the boundary. The problem is that Bashir’s bowling is just too damn tempting. He has taken four wickets in this series now, and every one of them has been caught in the deep. His Test career is turning into an advanced course on how to bowl when you’re being battered to all corners.It all felt very different to the last Test on this ground, back in 2022. Back then,Pant smacked 146 off 111 ballsin the first innings, then 57 off 86 in the second, and, even though England were on the wrong end, Ben Stokes enjoyed it all so much that he said afterwards how well he felt Pant would fit into his England team. And in the idle hours of a slow second session, it was easy to wonder exactly what it would be like to watch Pant bat if he was on England’s side rather than his own. Whatever else is hypothetical about it, you can be sure that one thing Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum wouldn’t be telling him to do is to try to play more defensively.India, though, have retrenched ahead of this game. They have taken on the character of their coach, Gautam Gambhir, a fighting batter who once battledseven hours for 137 runsto save a draw against New Zealand. Their captain, Shubman Gill, scored a fine century off 199 balls, batting like a prefect who had just been on the wrong end of the headmaster’s lecture about leadership. They have left out their two scariest bowlers, Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav, and packed the side with three all-rounders, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja, in an attempt to bolster their batting without compromising on their bowling options.View image in fullscreenRishabh Pant’s innings was dominated by an unusual range of ascetic leaves, blocks and defensive shots.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockReddy turned out to be Unready. He was cleaned up for one trying to leave a ball which hit the top of his off stump. The decision to pick him alongside Sundar was such a strikingly odd decision that Gambhir ought to be under heavy pressure, his team having won only three Tests out of 11 since he took over. But given that he used to be an MP for the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the BCCI are utterly intertwined with the political party, India’s board has given him their full support.The safety-first style doesn’t especially suit India, and more importantly, it doesn’t especially suit the situation they’re in either. There isn’t a batter in the game who wants to face Bumrah or an English one ever born who enjoys facing the sort of left-arm wrist spin Yadav deals in. If the genie gave England three wishes this week, the first would have been for India to rest Bumrah, the world’s best bowler, the second would have been to leave out Yadav, who has taken 43 wickets at an average of 24 each against them across formats, and the third would have been to encourage India’s top order that they ought to amble along at three runs an over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Gambhir’s day, a team who have made 310 for five in a day would have felt themselves well placed. In Stokes’ one, it was hard to avoid the sense that the score left them sitting just where England want them.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025India cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Katariina Kosola’s superb second-half strike proved enough after Hildur Antonsdóttir had seen red.After all the buildup, the tournament finally got under way in the picturesque town of Thun. Sweltering under the heat of the Swiss summer, Iceland and Finland took to the field in the opening day’s early kick-off.Iceland v Finland: Women’s Euro 2025 opener – liveRead moreThorsteinn Halldórsson’s Iceland came in as favourites due to their recent form but this group is considered by many as too close to call and this encounter was predicted to be a tight and compact affair.Ranked 12 places higher than Finland, Halldórsson named an unchanged lineup from the one that had beaten Serbia 3-1 in a friendly last week. They received a boost pre-tournament with the return of the captain, Glódís Viggósdóttir, who had missed the final few months of the Bundesliga season with a knee injury. Inter’s goalkeeper Cecilía Rúnarsdóttir made her Euros bow while Sveindis Jónsdóttir, widely considered to be their best attacking outlet, took up her place on the wing.Katariina KosolaIt had been a week of mixed fortunes for Finland when Adelina Engman was ruled out of the tournament on Tuesday. The 21-year-old Anni Hartikainen was called up in her place but was unable to join up with the team until after their opener. The positive, however, was the return to fitness of the integral Natalia Kuikka who made it through a friendly with the Netherlands unscathed. The captain and all-time top scorer Linda Sällström led the line, becoming the oldest Finnish player to appear at the Euros at 36 years and 354 days.View image in fullscreenKatariina Kosola puts Finland ahead in style.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty ImagesWith storm clouds looming and the weather threatening to break, the game got under way in front of a jubilant crowd. Over 2,000 Iceland fans were expected to have travelled and were making themselves heard in their customary fashion.Despite the difference in rankings and a bright start from Halldórsson’s side, Finland settled into the game and dominated much of the first half. Sällström had a close-range shot blocked and her team gathered momentum as they were afforded space in central areas. Rúnarsdóttir was named the Serie A goalkeeper of the year this season and had to be at her impressive best to keep out the lively Kosola.Iceland started to create opportunities of their own. Jónsdóttir’s dangerous long throw is notorious and she caused problems at the near post with her trademark move.The Angel City winger had been pinned back by the impressive Emma Koivisto but was at the heart of the best move of the first half. Breaking on to Karólína Vilhjálmsdóttir’s cutting ball, she delivered the perfect pass across the face of goal for Sandra Jessen, only for Koivisto to make a stunning block.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wiegman’s appointment followed a tumultuous time, with the pandemic forcing a one-year delay to the 2020 Olympics and 2021 Euros. Phil Neville’s contract ran until July 2021 and poor form led tothe announcement, on 22 April 2020, that he would not stay longer. Four months later, the Football Associationannounced Wiegmanwould take over. However, with the Dutchwoman committed to taking the Netherlands, the European champions, to the Tokyo Olympics, England would have to wait. Questions about whether Neville would be handed a short-term deal to lead Team GB at the Olympics were unanswered. In January 2021, shortly before it is believed the FA was about to announce who would travel with Team GB,Neville departed for the Inter Miamihead coach role.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman arrives for her first day at the office on 9 September 2021.Photograph: PA /AlamyThe FA turned to the recently appointed assistant manager Hege Riise tofill the England roleon an interim basis and later asked her tolead Team GB. After a limp end to Neville’s tenure, with five defeats, three unconvincing wins and a draw, there was despondency and a sense that the small cracks evident in England’s 2019 World Cup run had opened wide. The team were defensively fragile, creatively weak and overreliant on Ellen White’s goals digging them out of holes. Riise got off to a good start with a6-0 England winover Northern Ireland but defeats by France and Canada followed andTeam GB crashed outin the Olympic quarter-finals with an agonising 4-3 extra-time defeat by Australia. Wiegman’s job was big: to turn around a team that had lost their way, but she came in with solid credentials, having led the Netherlands to the European title in 2017 and a World Cup final in 2019.SWUnbeaten charge to Euro 2022Sep 2021-Jun 2022The buildup to Wiegman’s first match, a World Cup qualifier against North Macedonia in Southampton, was rocked by an ankle injury to Steph Houghton. Wiegman had named Houghton as the captain and it proved something of a sliding doors moment for the centre-back; one of England’s best performers for the previous decade never wore the armband again. To say Wiegman’s team made a strong start would be a major understatement. In her first six games England scored a remarkable 53 times without conceding and, in what felt like no time at all, the Lionesses had an air of invincibility. Yes, the standard of the opposition was flattering them, but this free-flowing, confident England suddenly looked incomparable with the side that had limped to defeats a few months previously. Her desire for perfection was evidenced on a torrential night in Riga.England had beaten Latvia 10-0in some of the soggiest conditions you could imagine, in an eerily flat atmosphere with no fans permitted in the Daugava stadium because of a pandemic-related curfew, and yet Wiegman felt her players had been “a little bit sloppy”. The Lionesses dulywon the reverse fixture 20-0.View image in fullscreenEllen White became England’s all-time leading goalscorer in the 20-0 demolition of Latvia.Photograph: Molly Darlington/Action Images/ReutersDraws with Canada and Spain in 2022’s Arnold Clark Cup gave England the tougher tests they needed and they lifted that trophy thanks to amemorable win over Germany. The feelgood mood strengthened during their warm-up friendlies for that summer’s Euros, as 3-0, 5-1 and 4-0 wins over Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland respectively gave the Lionesses a new aura going into a home tournament.TGHistory makersJul 2022Wiegman became the first manager to deliver back-to-back European titles for different nations when Englandlifted the 2022 European Championshiptrophy. Everything came together at the right time and everyone – players, coaches, staff, media and fans – seemed to be singing from the same hymn sheet. The unbeaten run to the final helped and again created an air of invincibility, and the manager’s blunt honesty on her expectations that endeared her to the players. “Everybody knows where they stand so there’s no guessing games behind closed doors and I think that does take the pressure off,” said Keira Walsh before the tournament. “The mentality now is just all about doing the best for the team and the team winning, rather than individuals. I think you can see that in the way we play.” Critical to their success was also the building of a pressureless environment. “I don’t know how she does it, to be honest with you,” said Walsh. “It’s easy for me to sit here and say it feels less tense, because it just does.” During the tournament the manager was unshakeable. Sticking with the same starting XI throughout was a masterstroke, with Alessia Russo and Ella Toone providing impetus and an element of the unknown from the bench.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman and Beth Mead with their medals after England beat Germany to win the Euro 2022 final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe team also had luck on their side, in that they sustained no significant injuries and that when Wiegman and the back-up keeper Hannah Hampton contracted Covid-19, it was around the time of the final group game with England already through. An injury to Germany’s Alexandra Popp in the warm-up before the final was a huge literal and psychological boost.SWFirst Europe, next the worldAug 2022-Jul 2023Wiegman’s European champions took on the then world champions, the United States, at Wembley in October 2022 and recordeda memorable victory, and the manager’s unbeaten streak would continue to April 2023, taking in two further trophies: a safelyretained Arnold Clark Cupand a new piece of silverware,the Finalissima, secured via a penalty shootout against Brazil, the champions of South America. England winning on penalties? This was a team breaking history in so many ways.View image in fullscreenMary Earps celebrates after her heroics in the penalty shootout helped England win the Women’s Finalissima against Brazil at Wembley in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe honeymoon had to end eventually, though, andWiegman’s first defeatarrived at Brentford against Australia. Worse was to come that month, when Leah Williamson sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury, joining Beth Mead on the knee injury absentee list for the World Cup. Then Millie Bright was a doubt for the tournament and Wiegman’s first streak of misfortune had arrived. The players, meanwhile, were embroiled in arow with the FA over bonusesand commercial deals, which spilled into the public domain on the eve of the World Cup. Bright was passed fit just in time to fly to Australia but England were seemingly stumbling, for the first time under Wiegman. Or were they?TGA sickener in SydneyJul 2023-Aug 2023Wiegman produced her first tactical surprise and it worked to good effect, a 3-5-2 formation, utilising Lauren Hemp as a more central forward, helping England progress from what had been an uninspiring pair of opening 1-0 victories over Haiti and Denmark to putting six goals past China. The Lionesses had to show their dogged defensive side in this campaign but displayed their nous in big games to find a way to Wiegman’s fourth consecutive major tournament final. There were rumours of rivals trying to poach her but before the final in Sydney but Mark Bullingham said the FA would“100% reject” any approaches. “We think Sarina is doing a great job and hope she continues doing it for a long time,” the FA’s chief executive said. “Sarina could do anything she wants in football.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman comforts Lauren James after defeat in the World Cup final.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PAThe Lionesses left Australia immensely disappointed, afterlosing 1-0 to Spain, an agonising second World Cup final defeat in a row for Wiegman, but months laterWiegman extended her contractuntil after the 2027 World Cup to have another crack with England at that ultimate prize.TGSigns of trouble?Sep 2023-Apr 2025England have played 24 games since the World Cup, winning 14, drawing four and losing six. Placed alongside the unbeaten run before the 2022 Euros, this doesn’t look great but the introduction of the Nations League has significantly increased the calibre of teams England face on a regular basis. “The levels of the game are improving so much,” Wiegman said in February. “You can’t just take for granted that you’ll win … Before the Nations League we would play different countries from different levels – we’re never going to win 20-0 again. I don’t think that’s competitive anyway.” England have twice failed to qualify for the Nations League finals, which includedmissing out on Olympic qualificationfor Team GB.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman takes a training session at St George’s Park.Photograph: Jacob King/PAIt hasn’t been smooth sailing. The Lionesses have looked unconvincing at times, particularly defensively, and a little too predictable. But nothing can progress upwards all the time and injuries have also had an impact, with Williamson taking time to return to her best, Hemp, Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway also sustaining knee injuries and Lauren James among others unavailable at various points.SWA storm before some calmMay 2025-The May-June 2025 international camp was the most turbulent of Wiegman’s tenure, by far, amid three high-profile withdrawals, for three different reasons.Mary Earps retired from England duty, and the sadness of Wiegman’s face was unmistakable as she discussed the matter, in possibly the most cagey of her press conferences to date, the head coach saying: “I don’t give any information about these private conversations.” Soon after,Fran Kirby alsoended her England career, after Wiegman – typically direct and honest – had explained she would not pick her for the Euros. WhenBright withdrewfrom Euros selection the next day to look after her mental health and an exhausted knee, suddenly there were suggestions of a crisis, but Wiegman produced a defiant performance at her squad-announcement press conference and switched the mood.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman leads a team huddle after the Nations League match against Portugal in May.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty Images“I don’t go around the bush,” she said, of the way she handles conversations with players.

Daly was taken to a Brisbane hospital on Wednesday for scans on a suspected broken arm, but the head coach said the British & Irish Lions do not have a full-back crisis with the first Test against Australia just over a fortnight away.If, as expected, the 32-year-old Daly is ruled out of the tour it will leave the Lions reliant on two specialist full-backs, Blair Kinghorn and Hugo Keenan, who have yet to play on this tour.Kinghorn has only just arrivedin Australia having helped Toulouse win the Top 14 title while Keenan was ruled out of the 52-12 win over the Reds through illness.Daly injury blow takes shine off dominant Lions display against Queensland RedsRead moreIt is hoped both players will feature against the NSW Waratahs on Saturday, by which time Daly’s prognosis will be clearer. “He’s got a bang on the forearm and he’s going for an X-ray,” said Farrell. “We’ve all got our fingers crossed for him.”When asked if he will call up another full-back, Farrell replied: “No, we’ve loads of full-backs. Hugo will be OK tomorrow or the next day and Blair’s ready to go.”While the Lions have Marcus Smith, Mack Hansen and Tommy Freeman who can all fill in at full-back, Daly’s all-round versatility made him a perfect bench candidate for the Test series. It could be, therefore, that Farrell will consider calling up a similar type of player such as Scotland’s Tom Jordan or Ireland’s Jamie Osborne.Daly’s teammates, however, are also hoping for a miracle for a popular player on his third Lions tour who has featured in the past 11 Lions matchday squads. “Elliot is a class teammate and a class player. He’s one of those effortlessly talented people,” saidMaro Itoje, a colleague of Daly’s for club and country.“I’m pretty sure he could have been a cricketer. I’m pretty sure he could have been a golfer if he wanted to. I don’t know about football, but he’s a world-class rugby player and he’s shown it time and time again, in Lions shirts, England shirts and even Wasps shirts. He’s an extremely experienced player, but he’s also a great guy.”Match statsFarrell was happy with the way his side raised their game after an error-strewn start and is encouraged by the increasing competition for places in certain positions. “I was pretty impressed with most of those players who had a second chance today.

Since retiring from playing aged 26 after fracturing his skull – a horror injury that required 14 metal plates to be inserted into his skull, held together by 28 screws – he has built a library of coaching experience, working under José Mourinho, Antonio Conte and Ange Postecoglou. This season, after accepting his first full-time managerial roleat West Brom, he has an opportunity to show his workings. “My last game was as a 25-year-old and I have had a seven-, eight-year apprenticeship, which in normal circumstances is quite a long time,” he says.Nothing was normal about the end of Mason’s playing career. For a while there were 45 staples and he had a six-inch scar across his head. For about 10 days he had to be spoon-fed and being able to pick up a glass of orange juice was a major milestone. At the time he felt his career was in its infancy but stepping into coaching, initially in the Spurs academy, he discovered a new passion. “I definitely have a fire inside of me to be successful and fulfil the sort of dreams and ambitions that I had as a player,” he says.Morecambe owner sacks board of directors in attempt to avoid administrationRead moreHe will always be eternally grateful for Mauricio Pochettino handing him his top-flight debut at the club he joined aged eight, in a north London derby at Arsenal no less. Mason’s final season with Tottenham culminated inwinning the Europa League, the club’s first trophy in 17 years and their first European triumph since 1984. That night hardened Mason’s belief it was time to move on. Across seven years on the Spurs staff, including two spells in interim charge after the sackings of Mourinho and Conte, he estimates he has prepared for hundreds of matches, in the Premier League and Europe.But nothing hit quite like that night in Spain. “For me, it just felt like the perfect ending to a great chapter of my life,” the 34-year-old says. “Bilbao was a confirmation. I’d been there as a player when we’d lost a cup final and it hurt. I’d managed in a cup final [the Carabao Cup defeat by Chelsea in 2021] and lost and it hurt. To close that chapter with what we achieved was great; it felt good to end the season that way. I knew after that that my time had come to an end. The opportunity to work with Ange – I’d only signed a two-year contract and it was an incredible two years. But as soon as we achieved that, it confirmed it was the right time. It didn’t feel right to continue. The possibility might not have even been there. The season finished three days later, I spoke to the [West Brom] chair [Shilen Patel] and Andrew [Nestor, the sporting director] at Albion.”He was intent on becoming a No 1 after that first spell in interim charge after Mourinho was sacked, when at 29 Mason became the youngest coach in Premier League history. Mason thinks he felt ready to manage when targeted by clubs a couple of years ago but, enthused by working as an assistant to Postecoglou, he stayed at Spurs. “Fast-forward two years, to be part of history was amazing. Now, I want to write my own script and the timing of being here at this club feels right.”View image in fullscreenRyan Mason is not setting any bold predictions for his first season in charge at West Brom.Photograph: Adam Fradgley/West Bromwich Albion FC/Getty ImagesIt is a month to the day since Mason, almost half the age of his predecessor, Tony Mowbray, was announced as Albion’s head coach. Mason, who was on Albion’s shortlist when Carlos Corberán departed for Valencia last December, will be one of several new faces in the Championship technical areas this season, with nine second-tier clubs having replaced their manager since the end of last season and another, Leicester, seeking asuccessor to Ruud van Nistelrooy. The managerial churn in the Championship is startling: aside from Kieran McKenna and Phil Parkinson, who return to the second tier after relegation and promotion respectively, Portsmouth’s 39-year-old head coach, John Mousinho, comfortably represents the longest-serving manager in the division at almost two and a half years.Over the course of an hour in the Richardson Suite at the Hawthorns on Wednesday, Mason delivered a polished performance at his media unveiling. No sweeping statements or grand messages. But Mason, who took charge of his first Albion training session last Thursday and will take his squad to Austria on Saturday for a training camp in Burgenland, where they will play Dynamo Kyiv, allowed himself a chuckle as he fielded a question with a nod to his old boss.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 23-year-old has been Everton’s young player of the year for the past two seasons.Everton had previously resisted interest from Manchester United in the Carlisle-born defender, who would have been in England’s European Under-21 Championship squad but for a hamstring injury.Chelsea have also been linked with Branthwaite, but he said it was “an easy decision” to commit his future to Everton. He cited Moyes and the club’s new direction under the ownership of The Friedkin Group as key influences. “I’ve been at Everton for five-and-a-half years now and I’ve seen the change the club’s had over the past six months. It’s very exciting for us as a team, as players, to have that going on in the background and to be starting the new season at the new stadium. The ambition was a huge thing.“The way the manager wants us to go as a team and what he wants us to do for next season and where he wants us to challenge for has had a big impact on the decision. I think you saw towards the end of last season as a team what we can do. The manager has been really good, not only for me but for the group. You saw the change in results, the change in mood since he came in. He drives the demands every day to be better.”Moyes said: “He is still only 23 and his best years are hopefully still ahead of him. We believe he can have a huge role to play in an exciting new era at the football club.”View image in fullscreenJarrad Branthwaite attracted interest from Manchester United and Chelsea but has decided to commit his future to Everton.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersMeanwhile, Jarell Quansah has completed his move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen in a deal worth up to £35m. The 22-year-old enjoyed an impressive European Under-21 Championship campaign as part ofa triumphant England side, but found opportunities limited at club level last season. The homegrown central defender started four league games, 13 in all competitions, as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté established a title-winning partnership.Liverpool will receive a guaranteed £30m for Quansah plus £5m in add-ons. The deal is the third between the clubs this summer, following the Premier League champions’ acquisition of Jeremie Frimpong andrecord-signing Florian Wirtz.Despite selling the young defender, who made his debut in 2023 and signed a new long-term contract at Anfield in October,Liverpoolconsider Quansah a player of rich potential and have negotiated a pre-agreed buy-back clause. “Everybody at LFC would like to thank Jarell for his contributions and wish him the very best for the future,” the club said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a great role and challenge for me to be part of the current Leverkusen rebuild.”Liverpool could strengthen their central defensive options with a move for the Crystal Palace captain, Marc Guéhi, but Palace will need to reduce their £65m asking price for a defender who has a year remaining on his contract.View image in fullscreenJarell Quansah has left Anfield for a fresh start in Germany.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockQuansah’s departure from Liverpool comes on the same day it was confirmed that the former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst has joined the club as an assistant coach, subject to receiving a visa.Van Bronckhorst, who has coached Feyenoord, Guangzhou, Rangers and most recently Besiktas, replaces Arne Slot’s former assistant and the now Ajax head coach John Heitinga. Liverpool have also confirmed the return of Xavi Valero as their new head of first-team goalkeeper coaching. Valero worked for the club during Rafael Benítez’s reign and has spent the past seven years at West Ham. He replaces Fabian Otte, who is leaving after one season, while the Brazilian World Cup winner Cláudio Taffarel is also stepping down as a Liverpool goalkeeping coach after four years.Explore more on these topicsEvertonTransfer windowLiverpoolBayer LeverkusenBundesligaEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s great to have him back.”Brailsford’s last-minute intervention in rider selection is rumoured to have delayed the team announcement until 48 hours before the Tour’s Grand Départ in Lille. “Dave’s got stuck straight in, there’s no doubt about that.” Allert said. “And he loves it. But was that a reason for us being late? Not really. We had a couple of illness and injury issues. It’s later than we wanted, but it’s the right team at the right moment.”Allert said that it was unknown how many stages of the Tour Brailsford would attend. “[It’s] unclear to be honest. I think he’ll be there whenever we need him, when he feels he can be adding the most value. His travel plans are basically to be available for the whole thing, and I think he’ll be there for a lot of it.”Brailsford’s return will be welcome news for Thomas, who last Julycompared the team’s management to a “coalition government,”, while also bemoaning Brailsford’s absence”. “It was a lot more straightforward with Dave at the top,” Thomas said during the 2024 Tour. “There was clarity with everything.

A visual guideRead moreParnell’s description of the strikes marked a more measured estimate than Trump’s assertions about the level of destruction. A low-confidence Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report based on early assessments said Iran’s program was set back several months.The evolving picture of the severity of the damage to Iran’s nuclear program comes as US intelligence agencies have continued to push out new assessments, using materials that suggested the centrifuges at the key Fordow enrichment site were destroyed even if it was unclear whether the facility itself had caved in.Trump advisers have used that material, which include the use of video taken from B-2 bombers to confirm simulation models of shock waves destroying centrifuges and other Israeli intel from outside Fordow, to defend Trump’s assertions, two people familiar with the matter said.The extent of the damage to Iran’s nuclear program and the fate of the country’s stockpile of enriched uranium – which could quickly be turned into a crude nuclear weapon – is important because it could dictate how long the program has been set back.The head of the UN nuclear watchdog said on Sunday that Iran could be producing enriched uranium in a few months.“They can have in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium,” Rafael Grossi the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said, adding “Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology … You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have.”The Pentagon’s preliminary DIA assessment, which was based on information from little more than 24 hours after the strikes,the Guardian previously reported, found the damage could range from Iran being able to restart the facility with new centrifuges to having to abandon it for future use.The DIA report assessed the program had been pushed back by several months, although that finding was made at the so-called “low-confidence” level, reflecting the early nature of the assessment and the uncertainty intelligence agencies have with initial conclusions.Trump advisers have pushed back on the DIA report and said privately the destruction of the centrifuges alone meant they had taken out a key component of Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons and meant it delayed the nuclear program by years.Battles over the conclusions of intelligence agencies have been at the center of American foreign policy determinations for decades, from warnings about Iraq’s weapons programs that the Bush administration used to justify the 2003 invasion that were later found to be false, to claims that a Chinese lab leak was responsible for Covid.Still, much of the controversy about the US strikes has been generated by Trump’s claiming that they “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites, which no intelligence agency has directly repeated because it is not a characterization used in intelligence assessments.Verifying the extent of the damage was made more difficult on Wednesday, after Iran put into effect a new law to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. Iran has accused the nuclear watchdog of siding with western countries and providing a justification for Israel’s airstrikes.A state department spokesperson called the move “unacceptable” and said Iran must fully comply with its nuclear non-proliferation treaty obligations, including by providing the IAEA with information on undeclared nuclear material and providing unrestricted access to any newly announced enrichment facility.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryIranUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The contours of Wise’s role are not clear.The move is a further embrace by theTrump administrationof those who stormed the US Capitol in 2021 seeking to overturn Trump’s electoral loss and shows how fundamentally the justice department has shifted on January 6 since Trump won last November, tailoring itself to his retribution agenda.US Capitol rioter ordered to pay damages for assaulting cop who later died by suicideRead moreThe justice department’s prosecution of Wise was under way when Trump took office in January, so it was one of many cases that were dismissed before a verdict. He had beencharged withtwo felonies and four misdemeanors, and he had pleaded not guilty.On his first day in office, Trump granted clemency to all who were convicted or charged for their roles in the January 6 riot, including those charged with violent acts.The justice department, under the Biden administration, had identified Wise in footage inside the US Capitol and engaging with police among a group of protesters outside. Video footage from a Metropolitan police department body camera showed Wise saying to police officers: “You guys are disgusting. I’m former – I’m former law enforcement. You’re disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can’t see it … Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!”Thedepartment’s press releaseon Wise notes that once violence broke out against law enforcement officers in front of him, Wise said, “Yeah, fuck them! Yeah, kill ’em!” and then, in the direction of people who were attacking the police line: “Kill ’em! Kill ’em! Kill ’em!”Before attending the January 6 riot, he was an FBI special agent and supervisory special agent from 2004 to 2017,according to the justice department. He was also an operative for the rightwing media outlet Project Veritas, where he was “assigned to infiltrate teacher unions in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Kentucky”, according to the New York Times.The justice department’s weaponization working group was set up in February to analyze instances in the previous four years in which “a department’s or agency’s conduct appears to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice or legitimate governmental objectives”, according to amemo announcing it. This includes the investigations into Trump, prosecutions of January 6 defendants, anti-abortion protests and supposed anti-Catholic bias.Martin, whose nomination to become the US attorney for DC waswithdrawnafter it became unclear how he could secure confirmation, is a vocal and frequent advocate for January 6 defendants.

Davie was at the festival in the hours after the set and ordered the content not to feature in any further BBC coverage, but technical issues meant it remained on the iPlayer for several hours.In an email to the BBC’s Jewish staff network, he said he appreciated “how deeply upset and concerned you must feel about the actions of Bob Vylan on Saturday”.“I was, and remain, appalled by Bob Vylan’s deeply offensive and totally unacceptable behaviour during his Glastonbury set,” he said. “It has no place on the BBC. Also, I understand the strength of feeling in relation to the events of this weekend and other concerns from colleagues.“Let me be clear, there is absolutely no place for antisemitism at the BBC. We are all utterly committed to creating an environment where everyone is supported and can do their very best work.”Davie has come under pressure over the BBC’s coverage of the Middle East from several angles. He is also facing criticism forfailing to show a documentary about medics in Gaza, with more than 100 BBC staff anonymously signing a letter criticising the decision. Channel 4 will broadcast the documentary on Wednesday night.The government has applied significant pressure on Davie over the Bob Vylan set. The BBC has been handed a series of questions by ministers and the culture select committee about what due diligence was done on the band before Glastonbury.It has since emerged that a month before the festival, vocalistRobinson-Fosterallegedly made similar comments at Alexandra Palace, where the band were supporting Iggy Pop. He reportedly said on stage: “Death to every single IDF soldier out there, as an agent of terror for Israel. Death to the IDF.”On Wednesday evening the Metropolitan police said that officers were investigating comments allegedly made at a concert on 28 May. It was not clear when the investigation was launched.Since Glastonbury, the band have said they have been “targeted for speaking up” over Gaza. “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people,” they said. “[We] are not the story. We are a distraction from the story. And whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction.“The government doesn’t want us to ask why they remain silent in the face of this atrocity? To ask why they aren’t doing more to stop the killing? To feed the starving?”Explore more on these topicsTim DavieBBCAntisemitismGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

They have all been released on police bail.The CPS said on Wednesday it had “received a full file of evidence from Cheshire constabulary asking us to consider further allegations in relation to deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the Countess of Chester hospital and Liverpool Women’s hospital”.A spokesperson said it would “carefully consider the evidence to determine whether any further criminal charges should be brought”, adding: “As always, we will make that decision independently, based on the evidence and in line with our legal test.”Any further charges against Letby are likely to be highly controversial given the concerns about her convictions.A further prosecution of the former nurse would have to be approved by Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions.As the criminal investigations continue, the CCRC is at the early stages of reviewing two large dossiers of expert medical evidence casting doubt on her convictions, which followed two trials at Manchester crown court.Mark McDonald, Letby’s new barrister, has described the new material as “overwhelming evidence” that she should be released from prison, where she has been held since November 2020.McDonald, a barrister at Furnival Chambers, said: “We will cross every bridge when we get to it but if Lucy is charged I know we have a whole army of internationally renowned medical experts who will totally undermine the prosecution’s unfounded allegations.”The senior Conservative MP Sir David Davis said earlier this year the nurse was the victim of “one of the major injustices of modern times”.However, lawyers for the babies who died and were harmed in Letby’s care have dismissed the expert evidence as “old and full of analytical flaws”.Peter Skelton KC, for the families of seven of the babies, told the Thirlwall inquiry in March that the doubts were based on “fragile towers of speculation”.Richard Baker KC, representing the families of 12 of the babies, said there was “nothing remarkable or new” about the material passed to the CCRC, adding that the bereaved parents had become a “sideshow within a ghoulish media circus”.Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyCrown Prosecution ServiceCheshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In Somalia, a quarter of the population is nowedging towards starvation, and at least a million people have been displaced.The situation has been years in the making. One-sixth of the population of southern Africa needed food aid last August. In Zimbabwe, last year’s corn crop was down 70% year on year, and9,000 cattle died.These examples are just the beginning of a worldwide catastrophe that is gathering pace, according to a report on drought published on Wednesday. In regions across the world, drought and water mismanagement are leading to shortages that are hitting food supplies, energy and public health.Mark Svoboda, the founding director of the US National Drought Mitigation Center (NMDC), and co-author ofthe report, said: “This is not a dry spell. This is a slow-moving global catastrophe, the worst I’ve ever seen.”The report, published by the NMDC, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, and the International Drought Resilience Alliance, examined in detail more than a dozen countries in four main regions: Africa, south-east Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean. Taking information from governments, scientific institutions and local sources, the authors were able to build a picture of human suffering and economic devastation.View image in fullscreenParched land at Cueva de las Niñas reservoir in Gran Canaria, Spain.Photograph: Borja Suárez/ReutersIn Latin America, drought led to a severe drop in water levels in the Panama canal,grounding shipping and drastically reducing trade, and increasing costs. Traffic dropped by more than a third between October 2023 and January 2024.By early 2024, Morocco had experienced six consecutive years of drought, leading to a 57% water deficit. In Spain, a 50% fall in olive production, driven by a lack of rainfall, has caused olive oil prices to double, while in Turkey land degradation has left 88% of the country at risk of desertification, and demands from agriculture have emptied aquifers. Dangerous sinkholes have opened up as a result of overextraction.Svoboda said: “The Mediterranean countries represent canaries in the coalmine for all modern economies. The struggles experienced by Spain, Morocco and Turkey to secure water, food and energy under persistent drought offer a preview of water futures under unchecked global warming. No country, regardless of wealth or capacity, can afford to be complacent.”El Niño weather conditions in the past two years exacerbated the underlying warming trend of the climate, the authors found. “High temperatures and a lack of precipitation had widespread ramifications in 2023 and 2024, such as water supply shortages, low food supplies and power rationing,” they wrote.The impacts of drought stretch far beyond the borders of stricken countries. The report warned that drought had disrupted the production and supply chains of key crops such as rice, coffee and sugar. In 2023-2024, dry conditions in Thailand and India led to shortages that increased the price of sugar by 9% in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Fresh water is in sharper demand than ever, but a combination of global heating, which is changing rainfall patterns to make dry areas drier and in others replacing steady rain with more extreme cloudbursts, and the widespread mismanagement and pollution of water resources have left the world on the brink.Demand for fresh water will outstrip supply by 40% by the end of this decade, and more than half of the world’s food production will be at risk of failure in the next 25 years, according to thebiggest report yet on the state of the world’s water resources, published last autumn.Separately, a report in Marchhighlighted the “unprecedented” loss of glacier ice, which is threatening the food and water supply of 2 billion people around the world. Last month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the global land area affected by drought had doubled in the last 120 years, and thecost of droughts was also rising sharply. An average drought in 2035 is projected to cost at least 35% more than it would today.Ibrahim Thiaw, the executive secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, theglobal treaty signed in 1992 meant to avoid the worst impacts of drought, said the problem had received too little attention. “Drought is asilent killer. It creeps in, drains resources and devastates lives in slow motion,” he said. “Its scars run deep.”He added: “Drought is no longer a distant threat. It is here, escalating, and demands urgent global cooperation. When energy, food and water all go at once, societies start to unravel. That’s the new normal we need to be ready for.”Explore more on these topicsDroughtClimate crisisWaterUnited NationsFood securitynewsShareReuse this content"

They found that the higher the levels of air pollution in a region, the more cancer-driving and cancer-promoting mutations were present in residents’ tumours.Fine-particulate air pollution was in particular linked to mutations in the TP53 gene. These have previously been associated with tobacco smoking.People exposed to greater air pollution also had shorter telomeres, protective strands of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes, which are often compared with the caps on shoelaces. Premature shortening of telomeres is a sign of more rapid cell division, a hallmark of cancer.“This is an urgent and growing global problem that we are working to understand,” said Dr Maria Teresa Landi, an epidemiologist on the study at the US NationalCancerInstitute in Maryland.With smoking in decline in many parts of the world, including the UK and the US, people who have never smoked are making up a larger proportion of lung cancer patients. Current estimates suggest that 10-25% of lung cancers are now diagnosed in this group. Almost all such cancers are a form known as adenocarcinoma.Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 2.5m new cases are diagnosed globally each year. More than a million of the deaths occur in China, where smoking, air pollution and other environmental contaminants are factors.Recentresearchfound that the highest rates of adenocarcinoma attributable to air pollution were in east Asia. While cases in the UK were much lower, they still amounted to more than 1,100 new diagnoses a year, scientists found.The latest work,published in Nature, identified only a slight rise in cancer-causing mutations in people exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke.But the study highlighted a significant risk from certain Chinese herbal medicines that contain aristolochic acid. Signature mutations linked to the herbal medicines were seen almost exclusively in never-smokers from Taiwan.Another mysterious mutational signature was seen in people who had never smoked but not those who did, and was now the focus of “intense investigation”, Landi said.Explore more on these topicsCancer researchLung cancerCancerAir pollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s 36C in Brussels and 38C in the east. They are absolutely terrible temperatures that have a very serious impact on ecosystems, on the economy and on health. And I think that there hasn’t yet been a real shift from the headlines about extreme meteorological phenomena to preparing people and understanding what needs to be done in the case of certain events.”Speaking alongside Jessika Roswall, the EU commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy, Ribera said there was still a long way to go when it came to readying infrastructures and urban environments for the realities of the emergency.A major part of the problem, she added, was that some political parties “continue to insist, quite vehemently, that climate change does not exist”, or else say that taking decisions to adapt to environmental realities is too expensive.View image in fullscreenTeresa Ribera: ‘You can’t tell people that climate change is the great existential problem of our generation, and then say, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to do anything”’.Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA“Sorry, but it’ll be much more expensive if we don’t act,” said Ribera, the executive vice-president of the European Commission for clean, just and competitive transition and a former Spanish environment minister. “We all know that. You can’t tell people that climate change is the great existential problem of our generation, and then say, ‘I’m sorry, we’re not going to do anything’. That is what they are doing. And I think people see that, when it’s 46C in Huelva [in June]. That is not normal.”Equally abnormal, she added, were last October’s torrential rains that causedthe deadly floods that killed 229 peoplein the eastern Spanish region of Valencia.“These are not isolated episodes,” she said. “But we are still in an ‘anecdotal’ phase – and that is very worrying. So I believe that yes, there still needs to be a coherent response.”Ribera said many politicians were reluctant to stick their necks out or demand action for fear of alienating voters – something that was unhealthy and potentially dangerous for democracy.“I think it’s a mistake to think that we have to hide the difficulties or that the problems will be solved by the market,” she said. “We don’t have to hide the difficulties, we have to understand them and manage them so that they are not so difficult. Often, political courage is needed to understand that there is a difficulty, and that instead of being small, you have to be big and find the solution shared by everyone. You need to face it with honesty.”She added that denial – or a failure to deal with the difficult issues implicit in the climate emergency – would only contribute to the existing lack of trust in the political classes.Many far-right parties in Europe and beyond treat the climate crisis aspart of the culture wars. Spain’s Vox party is seeking to repeal the socialist-led government’s climate change and energy transition law and is pushing for greater reliance on nuclear power, while the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has described EU plans to tackle climate breakdown as a“utopian fantasy”that would only push up energy prices.View image in fullscreenA woman holds an umbrella to shade herself from the sun in Seville, Spain.Photograph: Jon Nazca/ReutersBut Ribera said political consensus could be reached, pointing tothe landmark €1.4bn deal struck last yearbetween the Spanish government and the Andalucían regional authorities to protect the Doñana wetlands, which are one of Europe’s most important, and most threatened, carbon sinks.Roswall, who was in Spain to visit the Doñana with Ribera, said one of the key challenges in preparing for the new climate reality was changing the way people consider, and use, water. Given the rising temperatures and droughts, she added, water needed to be seen, more than ever, as a vital and strategic resource. The commissionrecently published a strategydesigned to restore and protect the water cycle and create “a sustainable, resilient, smart and competitive water economy” across Europe.“When we talk about security – me and all of us – of course it’s not only guns and tanks and things, it’s also the nature that is protecting us,” she said. “It can be water, it can be borders … Investing in nature is also a security issue.”The commissioner stressed the importance of water when it came to food production, energy generation and even the digital industries, which rely on big datacentres that use significant amounts of water. She also said areas such as the Doñana played a vital role in preventing fires and mitigating the effects of the climate emergency.“[Water] is important for all of us,” she said. “It’s not only security, but it’s also our economy, which is also security, so everything is linked. But … I will say that we have taken water for granted too long. We have just counted that it will be here. We have not thought about it as a resource that is finite.”As one of the most southerly countries on the fastest-warming continent,Spainis already feeling the effects of the climate emergency amid creeping desertification and record temperatures. The 46C recorded in Huelva last weekend was not far off Spain’s all-time record of 47.4C, recorded in another Andalucían town, Montoro, in August 2021.Spain’s state meteorological agency, Aemet, said on Tuesday that June 2025 had “smashed records”, with an average temperature of 23.6C, 0.8C above the previous hottest June in 2017.The monthly average was also 3.5C higher than the average over the period from 1991 to 2020, it said.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherClimate crisisEuropean UnionGreen politicsClimate science scepticism and denialSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They could also be applied to cars, trains, electrical equipment and other objects that will require more cooling in a world that is heating up.Using machine learning, researchers at universities in the US, China, Singapore and Sweden designed new paint formulas tuned to best reflect the sun’s rays and emit heat, according to a peer-reviewed studypublishedin the science journal Nature.It is the latest example of AI being used to leapfrog traditional trial-and-error approaches to scientific advances. Last year the British company MatNex used AI to create a new kind of permanent magnet used in electric vehicle motors to avoid the use of rare earth metals, whose mining is carbon-intensive.Microsoft hasreleasedAI tools to help researchers rapidly design new inorganic materials – often crystalline structures used in solar panels and medical implants. And there are hopes for new materials to better capture carbon in the atmosphere and to make more efficient batteries.The paint research was carried out by academics at the University of Texas in Austin, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the National University of Singapore and Umeå University in Sweden. It found that applying one of several new AI-enabled paints to the roof of a four-storey apartment block could save electricity equivalent to 15,800 kilowatt hours a year in a hot climate such as Rio de Janeiro’s or Bangkok’s. If the paint were applied to 1,000 blocks, that could save enough electricity to power more than 10,000 air conditioning units for a year.Yuebing Zheng, a professor at the University of Texas and co-leader of the study, said: “Our machine learning framework represents a significant leap forward in the design of thermal meta-emitters. By automating the process and expanding the design space, we can create materials with superior performance that were previously unimaginable.”He said a month’s work designing a new material was being done in a few days using AI and that new materials that may never have been discovered through trial and error were being created.“Now, we follow the machine learning output, [its instructions for] the structure and what kind of materials we should use, and we can get it right without going through many, many design and fabrication testing cycles.”Dr Alex Ganose, a chemistry lecturer at Imperial College London who also uses machine learning to design new materials, said: “Things are moving very fast in this space. In the last year or so there have been so many startups trying to use generative AI for materials.”He said the process of designing a new material could require the calculation of millions of potential combinations. AI allows material scientists to push through previous restrictions in computational power. It also means the traditional process of creating a material and then testing its properties can be reversed, with scientists able to tell the AI what properties they want upfront.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Materials sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

At one point he attacked his girlfriend, Beth (not her real name), with a machete – an episode she filmed on her mobile phone.Kate Ellis, of the Centre for Women’s Justice, who represents Beth, said the court judgment amounted to a “clear rejection” of the explanations that had been provided by MI5 reports and a “very serious warning” to the agency to cooperate with any further investigations.She said it was important vindication for Beth “to see that the courts have not accepted MI5’s unsatisfactory explanations at face value and are taking these matters so seriously”.Although one MI5 officer, its communications director, had told the BBC that X was a confidential source in 2020, another senior officer, Witness A, had given evidence that was relied on in three separate cases that declined to confirm the fact, casting a degree of doubt on the BBC reporting.Three years ago, Suella Braverman, then attorney general, had applied to the courts for an injunction to prevent the BBC from identifying X. Witness A gave evidence in that case neither confirming or denying whether X was an informer for MI5 – the standard policy adopted by the British state.Afterwards, Beth’s account of events was made public but X’s identity was and remained secret. According to previous reports, he has left the UK.On Wednesday, the court described Witness A’s statement as “false evidence” and complained that it had been relied on in the injunction proceedings and in two subsequent cases relating to a human rights complaint brought by Beth against MI5.MI5 is deciding whether to take disciplinary action against some of its own staff after an internal investigation. The spy agency also commissioned an external review by Jonathan Jones KC into the affair, which was seen by the judges in the case.According to their judgment, Jones concluded that “false evidence was given because of a series of mistakes, some systemic and some personal, but that there was no deliberate attempt by any MI5 staff member to mislead the court”.Richard Hermer, the attorney general, admitted Witness A’s evidence was false in January and finally confirmed that X was an agent a few weeks ago, because of “the exceptional circumstances of this case”.However, the high court had been invited to consider by Beth’s legal team “how did the attorney general and MI5 come to deploy false evidence before the court” and what action should be taken next.The three judges, Sue Carr, the lady chief justice of England and Wales, Dame Victoria Sharp, president of the king’s bench division, and Mr Justice Chamberlain, said there should be a review of the government’s use of its neither confirm nor deny policy (NCND) regarding the identity of informers or agents.“The use of NCND in these proceedings, and its maintenance until the very last minute, raises wider concerns,” the judges said, and they invited parties to the case “to file submissions” as to the appropriateness of the policy.Explore more on these topicsMI5newsShareReuse this content"

He pleaded guilty to causing her death by dangerous driving, after a murder charge was dropped.On Tuesday, the South Yorkshire coroner Marilyn Whittle recorded a narrative conclusion after an inquest into Grant’s death.She said the circumstances that led to the fatal incident “were contributed to by the failings of the Rotherham metropolitan borough council to have appropriate systems and processes in place when placing foster children, including but not limited to the lack of accurate and complete documentation, failure to communicate risks and concerns appropriately, failure to conduct appropriate risk assessments and failing to safeguard those in their care”.The coroner said she would be writing a prevention of future deaths report, addressing issues including the council’s lack of documentation and failure to complete forms as well as a shortage of placements, although she said this was a national issue and not limited to Rotherham.The inquest heard Grant had been fostering for seven years and she and her husband, Delroy, were highly regarded by the council’s fostering team. They were caring for another child, referred to as Child Y, when the council put out a call for an emergency placement for Child X. The inquest heard the couple volunteered to take him despite them being categorised as only able to take in one child at a time because of Child Y’s complexities.The inquest heard that Child X had a youth caution for possessing a knife and had at times talked about wanting to be part of gang culture, but this information was not included on the “deficient” initial placement referral form, and that Grant’s decision to take him “was made without her full knowledge of Child X’s risks”.After the inquest, Grant’s son Shaun Grant said his mother deserved better and would not have taken Child X if she had known his full history. He said the family “wholly welcome the coroner’s findings that our mum was failed on numerous fronts and that these failures directly contributed to her death”.“We have been on an agonising journey to uncover the truth behind the events and systemic failings that led to the death of our beloved mum, Marcia Grant,” he said, reading a statement alongside his sister Gemma Grant. “What has become evident over the last few weeks leaves us with no doubt that our mum was failed, our family was failed, and so too the foster child that was in our long-term care.”He added: “Whilst this leaves us with a sense of vindication, it also serves to reinforce to us how badly she was failed,. If not for these failures, our mum would still be with us here today.”Explore more on these topicsFosteringLocal governmentChildrenSheffieldEnglandSouth YorkshireYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

These assets had originally been Clive’s non-matrimonial property, the court was told.The couple married in 2005 – this was the second marriage for both – and have two children together. However, the marriage broke down in 2020.In 2022, a high court judge split the family’s total wealth of £132m by awarding Clive £87m and Anna £45m. The former challenged this decision at the court of appeal, arguing that the majority of the money, including the transferred assets, was earned before they began living together.Last year, court of appeal judges assessed that 75% of the near-£80m had been earned prior to the marriage and cut Anna’s share to £25m.View image in fullscreenAnna Standish (front left) with divorce lawyer Fiona Shackleton (front right) outside the court in London.Photograph: Champion NewsThe supreme court has now upheld the £25m figure after five justices unanimously agreed that because most of the sum of money had been earned prior to the marriage, Clive was entitled to keep the largest share.The landmark judgment might involve the super-wealthy but is “relevant to everyone”, said family lawyer Caroline Holley, partner at law firm Farrer & Co.The law firm Stewarts, which represented retired banker Clive in the case, said: “Divorcing couples across England and Wales now have clearer guidance on how their assets will be categorised upon divorce.”Legal experts suggested the judgment could increase demand among couples for prenuptial and postnuptial agreements as a way of protecting people’s interests if it all goes wrong later.Clive Standish, being domiciled in the UK, was worried about paying millions in inheritance tax if he died with the assets in his name, Lords Burrows and Stephens explained in their ruling on Wednesday.They said: “In short, there was no matrimonialisation of the 2017 assets because, first, the transfer was to save tax, and, secondly, it was for the benefit of the children, not the wife.“The 2017 assets were not, therefore, being treated by the husband and wife for any period of time as an asset that was shared between them.”Clive Standish expected his wife to use the money to set up two offshore trusts, but she did not do that and remained the sole owner of the assets when legal action began, the court heard.Chris Lloyd-Smith, a partner in the matrimonial team at law firm Anthony Collins, said: “With the judgment being in favour of Mr Standish, the court has set a precedent of firmer boundaries between personal and shared wealth.”He said “the most important takeaway” was that transparent financial planning in relationships was crucial. “When it comes to managing expectations and reducing legal uncertainty, pre- and postnuptial agreements that are reviewed regularly are important tools to divide and protect assets with clarity. This way, you protect yourself and set your own terms, instead of relying on a court decision.”Explore more on these topicsLawUK supreme courtMarriageDivorce (Life and style)Divorce (Money)PrenupsCourt of appealnewsShareReuse this content"

She is one of several ex-Tories who have defected to Nigel Farage’s party.Morris had used the phrase “[N-word] in the woodpile” in an event at the East India Club, and apologised after the remarks came to light. She had the whip returned to her six months later – one day before a crucial Brexit vote for the then-government.At the time, Morris said: “I would like to take this opportunity to apologise again for using such inappropriate and offensive language. It was a mistake and I regret it unreservedly.”She served for 14 years as an MP for Newton Abbot, and lost the Tory whip again in 2022 after rebelling to back a Labour move in parliament to cut VAT on energy bills.Other former Conservative MPs to have joined Reform include Lee Anderson, Ross Thomson, Andrea Jenkyns, Marco Longhi and Ann Widdecombe.There remains speculation that Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, could join the party, after her husband, Rael Braverman, became a member.After her defection, Morris said: “The country is in a desperate position. I believe now it is Reform UK that offers the vision and leadership Britain so badly needs. I want to play my part in delivering that vision.”David Bull, the new chair of Reform, said he was delighted to welcome Morris.“She brings a wealth of experience with her and will be a crucial part in developing the party’s social care policy as we look to build our policy platform ahead of the next general election,” he said.“Anne Marie is just one of many who realise that Reform UK is the only party that can stop this damaging Labour government in its tracks.”Reform’s manifesto at the last election had a policy on social care of a royal commission and said a national plan was critical for a sustainable social care system.It said: “The sector needs flexibility, tax incentives, VAT breaks and less waste. Simplify social care through a single funding stream, instead of the split between NHS and local authorities. More funding will be needed when a national plan is agreed.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

This weird science has worked well before.“It’s an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. “It’s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.”‘Explosive increase’ of ticks that cause meat allergy in US due to climate crisisRead moreThe targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva ofthe new world screwworm fly.The US Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies – sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren’t fertilized and don’t hatch. There are fewer larvae, and, over time, the fly population dies out.It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the US and other countries north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southernMexicolate last year.The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southernTexasby the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the new world screwworm fly and its old world counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers – and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.“A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.Veterinarians have effective treatments for animals suffering from an infestation, but it can still be unpleasant – and also cripple an animal with pain.Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infested cattle as a youngster on his family’s farm.“It smelled nasty,” he said. “Like rotting meat.”The new world screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive midwestern or great plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the US and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can’t help but hook up with sterile males for mating.One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: females mate only once in their weeks-long adult lives.Alarmed about the fly’s migration north, the US temporarilyclosed its southern borderin May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won’t be fully open again at least until mid-September.But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.Decades ago, the US had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million flies a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5m on the Texas site and $21m to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.But, she added, “You’ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.”Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly’s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and on to the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing resembling a dark brown Tic Tac candy. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University’s extension service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile fliescrashed near Mexico’s borderwith Guatemala, killing three people.In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a “whiz packer”.The method is still much the same: light planes drop crates containing flies.Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA’s “crowning achievements”.Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn’t be shuttered after another successful fight.“Something we think we have complete control over – and we have declared a triumph and victory over – can always rear its ugly head again,” Burgess said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsInsectsFarm animalsAnimalsWildlifeHealthTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

The group hopes to uncover and recover remains of the aircraft.“We believe we owe it to Amelia and her legacy at Purdue to fulfill her wishes, if possible, to bring the Electra back to Purdue,” Steve Schultz, the university’s general counsel, toldNBC News.Pettigrew believes the object spotted in the satellite photo aligns in size and material with Earhart’s aircraft. He also noted its position is near her intended route and close to where four of her emergency radio transmissions are thought to have originated. The image was taken in 2015, a year after a powerful cyclone may have exposed the site by shifting sand, Pettigrew said. He later presented the findings to Purdue.Additional signs suggesting Earhart’s presence on the island include American-made tools and a small medicine bottle, Pettigrew added.Back in 2017, four specially trained dogs and archaeologists from the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (Tighar) also explored Nikumaroro.Still, not everyone is convinced. Ric Gillespie, Tighar’s executive director, has led 12 previous expeditions to the island and believes Earhart probably landed and died there. However, he doubts the satellite image shows a plane. Instead, he told NBC he thinks the object could be a coconut palm tree and root ball pushed ashore during a storm.Schultz said Earhart had intended to return the plane to Purdue after the journey so it could be studied by future aviation students. The Purdue Research Foundation has approved $500,000 in funding for the first phase of the trip.The team will take six days to reach Nikumaroro by boat and will have five days on the island to search for the object and attempt to identify it as the missing plane.Explore more on these topicsAmelia EarhartUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The film covers its inception, testing and deployment in Japan in 1945, when the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to the deaths of as many as a quarter of a million people by the end of that year – as well as hastening the end of the conflict.View image in fullscreenCillian Murphy in Oppenheimer.Photograph: Universal Pictures/APThe film depicts Oppenheimer after the war as increasingly wracked by the legacy of his invention, and haunted by images of suffering. However, Cameron said he was among those viewers who felt the film did not go far enough in depicting the immediate aftermath of the attacks.“It’s not like Oppenheimer didn’t know the effects,” he said. “I don’t like to criticise another film-maker’s film, but there’s only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience, and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him.“But I felt that it dodged the subject. I don’t know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn’t want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail. I’m just stupid that way.”Oppenheimer was released in 2023 and won Oscars for best picture, director, leading actor (for Murphy), supporting actor (for Robert Downey Jr), and three others. It also made $975m (£720m) at the box office.At the time of its release, Nolan responded to criticism similar to that put forward by Cameron by explaining he wanted to represent Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. “It was always my intention to rigidly stick to that,” he toldVariety. “Oppenheimer heard about the bombing at the same time that the rest of the world did.View image in fullscreenChristopher Nolan, centre, and Cillian Murphy, right, during the making of Oppenheimer.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures“I wanted to show somebody who is starting to gain a clearer picture of the unintended consequences of his actions.

You come to my premiere and say nice things.”Cameron’s film, which has not yet begun formal production, will be an adaptation of Charles Pellegrino’s forthcoming nonfiction bookGhosts of Hiroshima, which brings together testimonies from victims and survivors of the attacks.Before then he will release the latest Avatar film, Fire and Ash.

Scientists suspect the unusual nature of the burial may have helped the DNA survive the past four millennia.“It’s exciting that we can get genomes from this place and time,” said Pontus Skoglund, who leads the ancient genomics laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London. “It’s only one individual, but it provides a valuable first glimpse into the ancestry of an early Egyptian in the old kingdom.”The skeleton was donated to the Liverpool Institute ofArchaeologyand later transferred to the city’s World Museum. There it survived bombings during the blitz that destroyed almost all of the other human remains in the collection.View image in fullscreenMarks on the skeleton suggest the man spent long periods sitting on hard ground with his legs and arms extended and head down.Photograph: University of LiverpoolAccording to radiocarbon dating, the man lived a few centuries after the unification of upper and lower Egypt, a critical time of transition between the early dynastic period and the Old Kingdom, which spanned the third to the sixth dynasties. The Old Kingdom, also known as the Age of the Pyramids, was marked by significant progress including the construction of the first step pyramid atSaqqara.DNA from one of the man’s teeth found he had dark skin, brown eyes and hair, and north African Neolithic ancestry mixed with a 20% genetic contribution from theFertile Crescentregion in the Middle East. The finding supports archaeological evidence of ancient trade between the two regions.View image in fullscreenThe pottery coffin.Photograph: University of LiverpoolThe man’s bones cast further light on his story. Middle-aged, perhaps in his 60s, he was old for the time and riddled with arthritis. Marks on the skeleton suggest he spent long periods sitting on hard ground with his legs and arms extended and head down. His right foot revealed unusual signs of wear.After studying tomb paintings of ancient Egyptian workers, the researchers suspect he may have been a potter or similar craftsman. The potter’s wheel was introduced to Egypt from the Fertile Crescent in about 2,500BC and was often stabilised with one foot. But the high-class burial, which took place before Egypt embraced artificial mummification, would have been unusual for such a worker.Joel Irish, a professor of anthropology and archaeology at Liverpool John Moores University, said of all the occupations the team reviewed, the bone markings were most consistent with the man being a potter, but he might have been weaving baskets or doing other work on the ground.Irish said: “It’s interesting that the man was found in a pot. That in itself is odd. He was put in a relatively high-class tomb and not any old person ends up in a rock-cut tomb. Maybe he was a super-good potter and ended up in someone’s favour.”Skoglund said the work,published in Nature, sheds light on which tombs might harbour remains that are well-enough preserved to yield large amounts of DNA.The team now plans to examine more skeletons in British collections to paint a fuller picture of the genetic history of the Egyptians. “There will be more individuals that we can get DNA from and we can use that to build an ancient, public genetic record of ancient Egypt,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGeneticsEgyptBiologyAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaArchaeologynewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to read yourself happy this summerDaisy BuchananWed 2 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 06.16 EDTShareLeo Tolstoy’s novel Anna Kareninais a masterpiece. It has never been out of print. Luminaries from William Faulknerto Jilly Cooperhave remarked on its brilliance. It is usually within the top 10 of any list of the “100 books you simply must read before you die”. However, I would argue that it’s a singularly poor choice of a book to bring with you for 10 days on the beach in Tenerife. Especially in hardback.I really tried. Every day, I’d read two or three pages before realising I’d read the same pages the day before, and it simply hadn’t stuck. I kept drifting off during the more complex descriptions of 19th-century property law. I simply couldn’t see what Anna saw in Vronsky; he seemed dreadful, just a slightly different kind of dreadful from her husband, Karenin. My arms ached, the sand seemed unusually gritty, and on day four, as children shrieked and splashed around me, their parents read Jack Reacher books while I failed to understand the significance of Levin scything his fields, I thought, ‘No more!’ My luggage allowance was about 20kg. Tolstoy had taken up more than a tenth of it, and 100% of my headspace. I couldn’t relax. I wasn’t enjoying myself. When I found a Sophie Kinsella novel in the hotel gift shop, I almost wept with relief. It didn’t matter that I’d already read The Undomestic Goddess – my aching brain craved comfort and joy, and it simply wasn’t finding it on Russian railway lines.As an author and a reader, it makes me sad that “beach read” has become a pejorative term. In my book Read Yourself Happy,I investigate the enormous positive impact that reading has on our wellbeing – and I discover that we can only experience the benefits of books if we’re enjoying what we’re reading. I believe that any reading we do is good for us, if it captures our attention and stimulates our imagination. The results of a 2016 Yale University study demonstrated thatreaders of books tend to live longer; another, published by the National Library of Medicine in 2020, showed thatreading wards off cognitive decline.But studies also show that fewer children and adults are reading for pleasure. A 2024 survey from the Reading Agency found that 35% of us used to read for fun, but we’velet the habit lapse. It’s understandable, because it’s incredibly difficult to cultivate a reading habit in the 21st century. We all think we “should” read, in the way we think we “should” do more exercise. We put it off. We pick up our phones and wish we could put them down again. It’s very hard for books to compete with our phones, because books don’t tend to light up, or vibrate, or flash with notifications. Books haven’t been designed to be addictive.We plan to read when we have some free time. Eventually we go on holiday and promise ourselves that we’ll tackle some serious Russian literature, or we bring the Booker winner with us. And we struggle to concentrate and connect with the story because we’re not used to using our reading muscles. We long to pick up our phones and scroll instead. We feel angry with ourselves, and we resent the books. Reading feels like a chore, and we don’t feel as though we’re having the relaxing, reviving, nourishing holiday that we need.After my failed attempt to read Anna Karenina,I vowed to prioritise pleasure when choosing my holiday reading, jettisoning anything that felt too much like holiday homework. And I started to notice some surprising changes. First, I started to relax much more quickly. I didn’t waste the first two days in a state of anxious agitation, struggling to switch off. In the past, I’d felt fidgety and restless when I was lying by the pool. However, when I found a book I loved, I lay with purpose.View image in fullscreenDaisy Buchanan on the beach.Photograph: Courtesy of Daisy BuchananMy sleep seemed to improve. I felt calmer and more grounded. It changed my focus, too. When I wasn’t reading, I felt more present – I was better at listening to conversations and paying attention. During day trips, I didn’t have the urge to scroll through my phone seeking out recommendations for better restaurant options or nicer beaches. I didn’t have the same irritable holiday squabbles with my husband. This was partly because I felt happy and relaxed, and partly because most of those squabbles are about missing phone chargers and power adaptors. Reading was reducing my screen time, and I wasn’t draining my phone battery.Most importantly, reading for pleasure made me feel that I’d benefited from the holiday. We go away because we need to relax and recharge. A holiday is supposed to have health benefits. And reading might be the magical secret that ensures we feel those benefits. It’s one way to truly get away from it all. It’s easy to dismiss “fun” summer books: because they are so easy to read, critics (wrongly) assume that they must be easy to write. But in a world where everything can feel very difficult, easy books are more valid and valuable than ever. They bring us lasting, nourishing pleasure.Sarah Maxwell, the founder of England’s first romance-only bookstore, Saucy Books, says that this summer the shop will be celebrating and focusing on beach reads. She says: “A so-called ‘beach read’ can often reach places a serious book can’t – especially when we’re craving ease, escape or a dose of delight. Summer is a time to recharge, and reading for pleasure is one of the simplest, most nourishing ways to reconnect with yourself.”So when you’re packing for your holiday, and fretting about reading the books that will impress your friends and intimidate your enemies, why not try to give yourself “a dose of delight”? If you’d like to get the most from your time away, and read yourself happy, here are some suggestions.It sounds counterintuitive, but it might be worth bringing a book that you’ve already read. When I’m especially stressed, or struggling with anxiety, I bring one that I know I love. I find rereading very comforting, and sometimes I need to warm up with something familiar and remind myself that sitting down with a book feels good. It takes the pressure off the reading experience – and it feels like being reunited with old, beloved friends. If the idea of rereading an old book doesn’t appeal, look for a book by a writer you’ve enjoyed before, or something from a series of books. (You can’t go wrong with Poirot or Miss Marple.)Sometimes I start my holiday reading before I go on holiday. In the run-up to a trip, it feels as though there’s never enough time to pack, clear my desk and do my laundry – but if I try to read a few pages every day, I feel the benefits as soon as I arrive. It can take a couple of chapters to get into a book, and it’s difficult to focus in a new environment, even if it’s supposed to be a relaxing space. But if I’m already invested in the narrative, I’m excited about picking it up as soon as I arrive. (And if I have been reading on the plane or train, I find the arrival process – waiting for luggage and going through passport control – a lot less stressful.)View image in fullscreenA Quiet Moment by Rowland WheelwrightPhotograph: Mary Evans Picture LibraryIf I’m going on holiday with friends or family, I’ll suggest we share and swap our books. That way, we can maximise our luggage allowance, and avoid a situation in which we have eight copies ofWe Solve MurdersandAll Foursbetween us. One of my favourite holidays was a trip to France with my sisters, where we all took it in turns to readThe Disaster Artist– Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell’s wild account of working with Tommy Wiseau on The Room (“the greatest bad movie ever made”). Of course, remember not to bring a prized first edition. Take a book that can be replaced if the worst happens. When books are being read and thoroughly enjoyed on holiday, they risk being dropped in the pool or covered in sun cream.Perhaps the most important piece of holiday advice is this: if you don’t like the book you’re reading, you don’t have to finish it. Be fair to yourself, and fair to the book. Holidays are supposed to be relaxing and enjoyable. For example, if you work for Nasa and you’re taking a break from a stressful workplace, you might feel tense and triggered after three chapters of Atmosphere, Taylor Jenkins Reid’s new astronaut novel. Reading is a subjective experience. I will rarely give up on a book – but I often pick up a book and put it down again, realising I need to be in a better mood to get the best from it. And sometimes, changing to a more fun book is all it takes to put me in that better mood.I returned to Anna Karenina eventually.It took me a few years to do so – and I spent that time building up my reading muscles. I read it for pleasure, and by the time I was ready, my appetite for pleasure had become much broader. I didn’t need to learn how to read; I needed to learn to love to read again. It was that Sophie Kinsella book that reminded me of the power of brilliant storytelling. The experience of losing myself in the novel was delicious, and it made me greedy for more. Reading for the sheer fun of it fills up my emotional tank and gives me the strength to attempt “challenging” books. Maybe even more importantly, they also give me the strength to deal with challenging real-life situations. When I’m cheerfully immersing myself in a series of happily-ever-afters, I feel more optimistic and positive. I see the best in people, and I’m kinder and more patient. Life starts to imitate art.Reading always leaves me feeling better and calmer. I never regret picking up a book, and I’m so grateful to have discovered a hobby that makes me happy, as well as making me feel as though I’m on holiday. It’s good to keep the holiday vibes alive and kicking on a dark, rainy Saturday afternoon in November. And I’m confident that reading for pleasure this summer will ensure you have a better time on the beach. But I suspect the benefits will outlast the trip, too. My holiday reading romance has been going on for years, and rediscovering my passion for romcoms made me realise that books had been my true love all along.Books for reading yourself happy on holidayView image in fullscreenBook Boyfriend by Lucy VineSimon& SchusterJenna is a reader, and a dreamer.

We’ve gone decades – centuries, really – in this country with barely any exhibitions dedicated to the work of Indigenous artists, but recently, everything’s changed. Galleries, museums and institutions across the UK are hosting shows by artists from communities in South America, Australia, the US and Europe at an unprecedented rate.Tate Modern in London is putting on its first-ever major solo show by a First Nation Australian artist in July, with a Sámi artist from Norway taking over the Turbine Hall in October. There are shows by Native American artists at Camden Art Centre in London and Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery, while painters and weavers from the Amazon and Argentina are coming to Manchester’s Whitworth and Bexhill-on-Sea’sDe La Warr Pavilion.View image in fullscreenSpeculative apparatus 2 for the work of nohkompan by Duane Linklater.Photograph: Courtesy Catriona Jeffries, Vancouver. Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid.This explosion in attention is at least partly thanks to the2024 Venice Biennale. The most recent edition of the art world’s ultimate taste-making event was a big, bold celebration of Indigenous art on a scale most western audiences had never encountered before. It was, quite appropriately and relatively humorously, called Foreigners Everywhere.The usual Jeff Koons-ian glitz, hazy figuration, hyper-academic conceptualism and postmodern abstraction of the contemporary art world was swapped for tapestries from South America, mythological drawings from northern Canada and swirling, mesmerising paintings from rural Australia.One Golden Lion, the Biennale’s top prize, was awarded to Kamilaroi/Bigambul Australian artistArchie Moore, who created a dizzyingly celestial family tree, detailing 65,000 years of ancestry in chalk on black walls – a near endless journey through familial time and space.The other Golden Lion went toMataaho Collective, a group of Māori women from New Zealand, for an installation of crisscrossing strands of fabric straps that cast interlocking shadows as you entered the main exhibition. Arguably the greatest accolades in art, both awarded to Indigenous artists.Which isn’t to say that all of this attention and praise is a totally new phenomenon. “Australian First Nations’ art has been receiving international attention for decades and is no longer considered just a niche market or as specialised art,” says Kelli Cole, a Warumungu and Luritja curator who’s organisingTate Modern’s big summer celebrationof the art of the late Emily Kam Kngwarray.Aboriginal art and its distinctive dot painting-style first started making waves in the wider art world in the 1970s, and has steadily grown in popularity – and acceptance – ever since. Kngwarray’s huge, seemingly abstract paintings and textiles (also currently on display in a smaller exhibitionat Pace Galleryin London) have all the hallmarks of what audiences associate with Aboriginal art: dots and lines in bright whites, earthy ochres and sun-drenched yellows, intersecting and weaving together to create dreamy, hallucinatory visions of wide open terrain and ancestral lands, or what Aboriginal people call “Country”.View image in fullscreenGorgeous, chaotic … Sin título (Untitled) by Santiago Yahuarcani.Photograph: Crisis Gallery/© Santiago YahuarcaniFor a lot of viewers, part of the appeal of Aboriginal art is the superficial similarities to western abstraction, but the work has deeper meaning. “The dot painting style is a sophisticated visual language derived from Country. It’s a practice informed by generations of deep knowledge, designed to communicate vital information,” says Cole. “For First Nations people, Country is not just land; it’s a living entity, encompassing spiritual, social and geographical origins, inextricably linked to identity and responsibility. Artists like Kngwarray visually articulate this profound connection, inviting global audiences to understand art not as detached objects, but as expressions of custodianship, belonging and a continuous reciprocal relationship with ancestral lands.”Younger Indigenous Australian artists, however, have moved away from the more traditional approach of painters such as Kngwarray. “I have a lot of respect for the old people – their strong culture, their knowledge and their art – but a young fella like me doesn’t want to make traditional paintings,” says Vincent Namatjira, a Western Aranda artist whose satirical, political approach to portraiture has seen him receive both praise (he was the first Indigenous winner of the Archibald prize for Australian portraiture) and a hefty amount of controversy.Namatjira, whoseshow at Ames Yavuz in Londonopens in September, comes from a long line of artists – his great-grandfather was the hugely influential watercolourist Albert Namatjira – and uses his joyful, colourful portraits to lampoon the wealthy and powerful, taking aim at British royalty, Captain Cook and Australian billionaires (one of whom, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, tried to have his “unflattering” portrait of her removed from an exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia last year and “permanently disposed of”).Namatjira also uses his work to celebrate important figures in his community. “For me, portraying these Indigenous heroes is about equal recognition. I want to make sure that Indigenous leaders are properly recognised and acknowledged. My three daughters are all growing up now and I want them, and other Aboriginal kids, to be able to see these strong examples of Indigenous leadership, to feel proud and empowered.”View image in fullscreen‘Unflattering’ …. a portrait of Gina Rinehart donated to NGA and a portrait of Gina Rinehart by Australian artist Vincent NamatjiraComposite: National Gallery of Australia / EPAHis political approach is one that resonates with a lot of Indigenous North American artists. Jaune Quick-to-See-Smith – a citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana who died earlier this year – currently has a showat Stephen Friedman Galleryin London, and an exhibition due to open at Fruitmarket in Edinburghin November. Her work combined pop appropriation, mixed-media modernism and Indigenous culture “to remind viewers that Native Americans are still alive”.Duane Linklater, an Omaskêko Ininiwak artist from Ontario, Canada, with a show openingat Camden Art Centrethis month, makes minimal installations intended to “create space for Indigenous presence in every moment”. Art, for many Indigenous people, is a tool of resistance, and a way of affirming their existence.Claudia Alarcón is an Indigenous artist from the La Puntana community of Wichí people in northern Argentina, where she leads a collective called Silät, bringing together 100 female weavers to create colourful tapestries filled with references to animals and nature. There are footprints, eyes, trees, all arranged into stunning, abstract geometric compositions. Their work is on showat Cecilia Brunson Projectsin London and theDe La Warr Pavilionin Bexhill.View image in fullscreenClaudia Alarcón and Silät Tayhin at De La Warr Pavilion.Photograph: Claudia Alarcón & Silät: Tayhin, 2025, Installation View, De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-On-Sea. Photography: Rob Harris“We chose the name Silät because it is a word in our language which can be translated as ‘message’ or ‘announcement’,” she says. “For us, it is a message of presence. It is a manifestation, like a whisper, of the strength of our knowledge. Our weavings are a proclamation that we continue to defend our memory, our territory, united. Indigenous existence is constantly under threat. We are walking a new path, telling new stories, but all of this is part of the long-standing defence of our culture, which is always present. Always.”Defence is important, because Indigenous lands are under critical threat from exploitative commercial parties, and also more widely from climate change. Santiago Yahuarcani – a leader of the Aimeni clan of the Uitoto in Peru whose exhibitionat the Whitworth Art Galleryin Manchester opens this month – addresses that threat head-on in his work, with gorgeous, chaotic canvases that paint nature in a constant, violent battle with man, lamenting the brutal destruction of the Amazon, and calling desperately for change.‘They came for our land, our wood, our gold’: Santiago Yahuarcani, Peruvian painter of dancing dolphins – and genocideRead moreIt’s an approach shared by Norwegian Sámi artist Máret Ánne Sara, whose previous work has seen her place a pile of bloodstained, bullet-pierced reindeer skulls outside the Norwegian parliament. She will be taking on theTurbine Hallcommission at Tate Modern in October. “I fear the path we’re currently walking globally, as a human species, is failing,” she says. “The understanding that nature sustains life is fading from human consciousness. I’m trying to puncture the reality that we’ve been sold. I believe that Indigenous philosophy can offer collective strategies to protect life for the future; to rethink and re-understand our place within a larger system.”Lumping such an incredibly diverse array of artists into one big, sweeping “Indigenous art” bracket is obviously problematic. But there are themes that connect these communities, and to an extent their art, around the world. “I see myself as part of something larger. I know there are other groups, with other languages, who are my brothers and sisters, with whom we share a history of struggle, and also of pain,” says Alarcón. “What matters most is to keep fighting for our rights and our memories, which are also the rights of our territory.”Whether in Norway, Peru, Canada or Australia, Indigenous artists are united not just by a shared connection to the land and its custodianship, but by having survived centuries of colonial subjugation, capitalist exploitation and ongoing climate annihilation. Proof of their endurance will be written across the walls of galleries across the UK this year, in powerful, political and often incredibly beautiful art.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous artArtIndigenous AustraliansTurbine HallTate ModernDe La Warr PavilionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Zellweger appears in a behind-the-scenes role, with the world premiere of her directorial debut, an animated short film called They. And in what appears something of a coup, the festival will screen 4K restorations of Connery’s six “official” James Bond films: Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.Connery’s name is now firmly imprinted on the festival, with its main feature-film prize named after him and screenings of short films developed through theSean ConneryTalent Lab, an offshoot of the actor’s foundation and the National Film and Television School Scotland. Festival director and CEO Paul Ridd said: “The legacy of Scotland’s biggest global star is central to what we’re trying to do, connecting it with the future generation of film talent and all the philanthropic work the Connery Foundation do across film and various other causes is of vital importance to us. To have access to those six wonderful James Bond films and showing them on the big screen is very special.”The 2025 edition marks the third event sincethe dramatic collapse of the Centre of the Moving Image, the festival’s then parent organisation, in October 2022, which also resulted in the closure of Edinburgh’s celebrated Filmhouse cinema and its sister cinema in Aberdeen. Helped by the wider international festival that takes over the city every August, ashort-notice scratch eventwas put together for the summer of 2023, while Ridd was installed as the head of a new organisation for 2024, which returned the festival to something comparable to its former status. And in a piece of good news for both the festival and the city itself,the Filmhouse in Edinburgh reopened in Juneafter a high-profile campaign.Ridd says the festival is looking to consolidate its revival. “We are thinking about this as year one with last year being year zero. We were really pleased with what we brought together last year, so for 2025 we are looking at what worked previously and not deviating really away from that. What’s different, I guess, this year is that we’ve had a significantly higher volume of submissions sent to us, which is fantastic.”This year the festival’s competition (for the “Sean Connery prize for feature film-making excellence”) comprises 10 world premieres, including Campbell X’s “queer road movie” Low Rider, Swedish documentary Once You Shall Be One of Those Who Lived Long Ago about a physically collapsing mining town, and In Transit, a drama about an artist and her model starring Jennifer Ehle. An Out of Competition section includes high-profile films such as theDardenne brothers’ Young Mothers, a study of a centre for pregnant teenagers,Jan-Ole Gerster’s Islands, with Sam Riley as a washed-up tennis coach, and The Memory Blocks, a new film from experimental documentary-maker Andrew Kötting.The festival is also leaning intoa resurgence of interest in archive and back catalogue films; alongside a retrospective of westerns by famed genre director Budd Boetticher (including 1957 classic The Tall T), Edinburgh is staging a series of screenings of films nominated by their in-person guests, all of whom will introduce their picks as well as taking part in an In Conversation event. The Last King of Scotland director Kevin Macdonald, who will appear alongside his brother, Trainspotting producer Andrew Macdonald, has chosen Soviet war classic The Cranes Are Flying; Candyman’s Nia DaCosta will talk about Doug Liman’s 90s drug deal comedy thriller Go; and Ben Wheatley, whose new film Bulk is leading the festival’s Midnight Madness strand, has gone for Ealing comedy classic The Man in the White Suit.Equally as important as the programme was the decision to move the festival back to its August time slot, having been shifted to June in 2008 as a strategic decision by the UK Film Council, then in charge of industry policy, as a way of giving space between the Edinburgh and London film festivals (with the latter taking place in early October). This has reunited the film festival with the energy of the international and fringe festivals, as well as potentially adding some purchase in the autumn awards season. Ridd says: “I’m very conscious that August is a strategic position for a lot of film distributors to launch their films going into that awards period. So I think August is a pure positive for us.”He adds: “This is a beautiful city, and you’ve got all of this other art going on all around you. It’s a unique feeling and I know what a big opportunity that represents to us, to emulate that spirit of discovery.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Released in the hell of July 2020, it came with the requisite boxes ticked (big star, international locations, franchisable setup) but felt closer to the real thing than most, proving to be a hit for those eager for escapism, scoring one of the streamer’s biggest launches to date.Heads of State review – John Cena and Idris Elba sell fun throwback Amazon comedyRead moreBut like many Netflix films, its cultural impact was negligible, popular for a weekend or three but failing to live on in any notable way after, consumed with speed and forgotten at a similar pace. A sequel was inevitable yet unnecessary, and while one was given a green light at the start of 2021 and started production in 2022, it’s taken another three years to see the light of day. Not only does The Old Guard 2 bear the bruises of such a cursed post-production process but it’s also weakened by such a distance from the first, forcing us to remember something most of us had resigned to the ether (it’s telling that to promote the sequel, Netflix hasrecruitedits stars to recap the first film).It’s not as if we’re dealing with a straightforward action flick either, the mythology of The Old Guard, based on Greg Rucka’s comic book series, requires enough convoluted exposition for us to pull up the original’s Wikipedia plot description to understand just what the hell is going on in the follow-up. Should something intended to be a summer lark really feel like such hard work?It’s made mostly tolerable byCharlize Theron, an actor and a movie star we just don’t see enough of and when we do, it’s quite often not what we want to see her in. Theron, who gave us one of the greatest character studies of the 2010s in Jason Reitman’s vastly underrated Young Adult, has decided to remain boringly unchallenged as of late, slumming it in flimsy franchise fodder (her last non-genre role was playing Megyn Kelly in 2019’s dubious #MeToo dud Bombshell, although that could be conceivably classed as horror). She returns to play Andy, a once immortal warrior who (and I had to remind myself of this) was made mortal in the first film, a danger that should technically add suspenseful stakes to her extravagant fight sequences (but alas). This time around, an old comrade returns from centuries of punishment (Ngô Thanh Vân) and partners with a humanity-hating immortal (Uma Thurman) causing Andy and her team to take action.While it should, in an era of increasingly bloated runtimes, be a boon to have it all wrapped up in under 97 minutes (sans end credits, far shorter than the 125-minute original), The Old Guard 2 is a panicked rush to wrap things up, poorly developed and confusingly plotted, a swift and savage franchise-killer. Along with last week’sM3gan 2.0, whichbombed at the box officeafter a 2.5 year gap, it serves as a reminder to studios why speed and simplicity are both essential for sequels in an attention economy where films just don’t have the same media footprint they once had. In the time it took to beat this one into shape, it seems like those involved have also forgotten what made the first one work, the replacement of director Gina Prince-Bythewood with Victoria Mahoney leading to a considerable drop in action sequence effectiveness while the original’srather groundbreaking queernesshas now been almost entirely excised. The first film had a surprising, swooning kiss from immortal lovers played byMarwan KenzariandLuca Marinelli, but this time around, their foreheads briefly touch instead. There’s also a coy confusion over just what the relationship is between Andy and her one-time partner, who are gay in the comics, but are presented as, ahem, longtime companions here, the film acting as an amusingly abrupt end to Pride month.Theron is an actor who’s tirelessly working even when the script isn’t asking her to, but this is a waste of not only her but also a returning Chiwetel Ejiofor, as well as Thurman who has moments of slithering fun as the villain but she’s used so sparingly, it’s akin to a cameo role. The last act sets her up to be a bigger part in the third film but, slight snag here, there hasn’t been any official confirmation of The Old Guard 3, something that might shock viewers given the baffling cliffhanger ending. It’s not as if some b-plot threads are left dangling but instead, the entire film is left shoddily unfinished, a truly heinous decision that threatens to turn the series into the new Divergent (a cancelled fourth film leaves that franchise forever incomplete). Perhaps that might be for the best.The Old Guard 2 is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsCharlize TheronUma ThurmanAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The time has come to acknowledge Eleanor Coppola’s magnificent achievement here as first among equals of the credited directors in shooting the original location footage (later interspersed with interviews by Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper), getting the stunningly intimate audio tapes of her husband Francis’s meltdown moments and, of course, in unassumingly keeping the family together while it was all going on.With his personal and financial capital very high after The Conversation and the Godfather films, Coppola put up his own money and mortgaged property to make this stunningly audacious and toweringly mad version of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness from a script by John Milius; it is transplanted from 19th-century Belgian Congo where a rogue ivory trader has gone native in the dark interior, to south-east Asia during the Vietnam war where a brilliant US army officer is now reportedly being worshipped as a god among the Indigenous peoples and must have his command terminated “with extreme prejudice”.Marlon Brandohad a whispery voiced cameo as the reclusive demi-deity, Martin Sheen was the troubled Captain Willard tasked with taking Kurtz down and Robert Duvall is the psychotically gung-ho Lt Col Kilgore, who leads a helicopter assault.Haemorrhaging money and going insanely over-schedule, Coppola shot his film in thePhilippinesduring burning heat, humidity and monsoons and borrowed army helicopters and pilots from President Ferdinand Marcos, only to find that on many occasions – especially during the legendary Ride of the Valkyries attack scene – filming had to halt as the Filipino military would ask for their helicopters back so they could suppress a communist insurgency. In fact, Coppola found himself reproducing reality on a 1:1 scale. As he said in his Cannes press conference, which opens the documentary: “The film is not about Vietnam; it is Vietnam, it’s what it was really like.” Well, bravura auteur rhetoric is an accepted Cannes press conference tradition. The film was arguably just what Vietnam was like for the Americans – though nobody actually died and perhaps it is time to re-state something about Vietnam that gets lost for later generations: a considerable proportion of US soldiers were drafted.The agony was there from the beginning. Coppola originally cast Harvey Keitel as Willard but didn’t like what he was doing and fired him on pretty much the first day – a traumatic and legally fraught event that can’t be talked about too clearly in the documentary. Sheen, the replacement, was a heavy drinker and smoker whose “breakdown” scene in his seedy Saigon hotel room was a dangerous, booze-fuelled improvisation. It was a personal primal scream, which contributed so much to his stress that he had a near-fatal heart attack, almost scuppering the entire production. The documentary’s most gripping moment is Coppola yelling at someone on the phone not to talk about Sheen’s heart attack in case the resulting gossip causes his financial backers to lose their nerve. Sam Bottoms, playing one of Willard’s crew, talks cheerfully about doing speed and LSD during filming; he can’t have been the only one.And all the time Coppola was suppressing intense anxiety that he was making a mediocre, pretentious movie. Like Conrad, he wanted to satirise the hubris and grotesque vanity of the west’s imperial ambitions – and there is something else as well. Willard comes to understand that in killing Kurtz, he is not interrupting or thwarting his occult ritual; he is in fact participating in it, and completing it. Perhaps Coppola came to believe something similar, that he was having his own epiphany-slash-nervous-breakdown in the jungle. It wasn’t quite an apocalypse for him, although he arguably never made anything as good again. As it is, it might have been good to have had Coppola and Milius discuss that title: it sounds like a demand, coming from someone who won’t wait for apocalypse a moment longer. It might be prescriptive and absurd, but as with the film itself, you wind up believing in it.Hearts of Darkness: A Film-Maker’s Apocalypse is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 July, and on UHD and Blu-ray from 28 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsApocalypse NowFrancis Ford  CoppolaMarlon BrandoMartin SheenPhilippinesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first time a Garifuna song was recognised in the prestigious awards, and was considered a milestone in the fight to preserve and popularise the culture.Having his Garifuna song,Hun Hara, which celebrated the values of kindness and gratitude, recognised by the Grammys was important in telling the story of his ancestors, said Castillo, 31. The Garifuna, descendants of enslaved Africans and Indigenous Kalinagos, are indigenous to the Caribbean island of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), but their diaspora has spread across the Americas.“It was only the first round of the Grammies, but it meant a lot to me, because I’m the first Garifuna artist to achieve this; it was like a dream coming true,” he said.He added: “I remember when I sent the request to the Latin Grammy. I was a little nervous about it because I was the first one to cross that line … I was not expecting anything to come from it. So when they answered me and they told me to send my biography, it was like, wow.”Once a site of horror, a tiny Caribbean island could become a Garifuna shrineRead moreThe Garifunacame into the spotlight in Marchwhen SVG’s prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, purchased Baliceaux, a private, uninhabited island in the country’s archipelagowhere thousands of Garifuna perishedafter they were stranded there by the British in 1796 in miserable conditions.Regarded as sacred by the Garifuna, the SVG government announced plans to designate Baliceaux a heritage site for Garifuna who still live in Honduras, Belize and the other regions to which their ancestors were exiled by the British, centuries ago.Castillo’s recent releaseÍtarala–“Amen” – isrooted in a traditional Garifuna hymn that explores humanity’s spiritual connection to its supreme creator. He wants his music to revive Garifuna music and language, which have beenrecognised by Unescoon its register of intangible cultural heritage.Castillo said he remembers his grandmother singing the hymn to him. “My mum used to work, so I used to spend more time with my grandmother. She was 100% Garifuna, and she taught me about respect and about the culture.”He added that since the age of 13, he had felt compelled by his ancestors to be a voice for the Garifuna people. “They need someone to talk about the history of the things that are happening in the community today; to remind us that we are warriors, survivors, and that to deal with today’s challenges, we need to act together like our ancestors did.”Castillo said he persevered with his music, even when his parents disapproved, concerned that it was not a lucrative career option. “I’m the first in my family to start doing music and making art. So it was a little bit complicated for me. For them, they saw my dreams as something to do just for a couple of years, not for my whole life. They didn’t realise I could get something, or make a living from this.”Castillo credits his manager, Miguel Álvarez, who is also Garifuna, for keeping him focused and avoiding trouble on the streets of Honduras.Princess Eulogia Gordon, a Californian publicist who strongly identifies with her Garifuna heritage, compared Tavo Man to other greats of Caribbean music.“I remember growing up in the US and hearing Bob Marley on the radio, and then people coming out with Carib Beats and Afro Beats. We had Beenie Man and Sean Paul, and Rihanna, and I was saying, ‘Oh my gosh, we are getting more and more of our flavours coming to the mainstream.’“But, none of the Garifuna late greats like Paul Nabor, Andy Palacio and Aurelio Martínez were on the radio, and here we are in 2025 and they are still not getting that respect and that access to the mainstream,” she said.Gordon said she felt an instant connection to Man’s rendition of Ítarala. “I feel like it was divinely and spiritually brought to me so I could work with it, and ensure that it gets pushed out into the community and beyond. The ancient story of the Garifuna is woven into this music, but there is also a contemporary rhythm that engages children and young people who have lost the desire to be Garifuna. This song gives us permission to be Garifuna.”Explore more on these topicsMusicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thank you, gentlemen.”Freese said in May that he was “not angry – just a bit shocked and disappointed” when he was told that Foo Fighters wanted “to go in a different direction with their drummer”. Foo Fighters did not comment on Freese’s departure.Freese was the replacement for Taylor Hawkins, who died in 2022 aged 50. Grohl paid tribute to Hawkins in his letter, saying: “Your name is spoken every day, sometimes with tears, sometimes with a smile, but you are still in everything we do, everywhere we go, forever.”A new drummer has not been announced; a statement alongside Today’s Song says: “Foo Fighters areDave Grohl, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett and Rami Jaffee.”Grohl is married to Jordyn Blum, the mother of three of his daughters. In September 2024 he said in a statement: “I’ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage. I plan to be a loving and supportive parent to her. I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.”In his announcement of Today’s Song, Grohl perhaps made an oblique reference to these widely publicised struggles, using the metaphor of a lobster shedding its shell. “The point being that life’s challenges have a way of signalling the need for change and growth, so when that time comes, you retreat, rebuild, and resurface stronger than before.”The admission of infidelity somewhat tarnished the image of a man who was often described as “the nicest man in rock”. Foo Fighters cancelled a headline festival performance and retreated from the public eye for a time, though Grohl reunited with Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic in January for a benefit concert after the LA wildfires.Foo Fighters will return to live music in October, playing four concerts across east Asia and another in Mexico City in November. Their most recent album is 2023’sBut Here We Are.Earlier this week they released I Don’t Wanna Hear It, a cover of a song by punk band Minor Threat, with instrumentals recorded in 1995 but vocals recorded earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsFoo FightersDave GrohlPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Then again, French opéra-ballet has always presented challenges, from the substantial forces required to do it justice to the need for specialist vocal techniques rarely encouraged this side of the Channel: a gifted practitioner of the French baroque must be across a dizzying nine different types of trill.Premiered in Paris in 1735, Rameau’sballet héroïquetapped into Enlightenment tropes of the noble savage and the export of European ideals to the New World, whether the inhabitants wanted it or not. Its exotic locations – Turkey, Peru, Persia and the North American wilderness – present a modern-day director with a veritable minefield of cultural sensitivities. Happily,Bintou Dembélé, whose roots are in French hip-hop, navigates these perilous waters with ease, conjuring up an irresistible blend of pop culture and inclusive storytelling.Presented on a bare stage, with musicians on rostra at the back, there are times when this discreetly truncated interpretation comes across as more choreographed concert than opera, but with musicians and dancers ranging freely throughout the auditorium it also feels thoroughly immersive. Lighting designer Benjamin Nesme’s illuminated floating circle does duty as a rose-tinted Persian fountain, the torrid Peruvian sun and a North American forest. The disc’s detachable light sticks are often all that’s required to illuminate a singer’s face. Charlotte Coffinet’s gender-fluid, street-savvy costumes bring a chilled vibe to musicians and dancers alike.View image in fullscreenCrushing it … Les Indes Galantes at The Grange festival, 2025.Photograph: Richard Hubert SmithThe production simmers before it sizzles. The abstract choreography of the prologue occasionally treads water, ditto in the Turkish act. By the time we make landfall in Peru, however, the supple dancers – drawn from Dembélé’s company Structure Rualité – are crushing it with spellbinding outbursts of breaking, popping andwaacking. The Inca temple, volcanic eruption and all, is vividly conveyed, while Rameau’s Dance of the Peace Pipe crackles with leaps, whoops and stamps. The subsequent slow-motion slaughter of one half of the company by the other is a powerful reminder of colonialism’s brutal legacy.Musical standards are exemplary.Cappella Mediterranea, playing under founder and conductor Leonardo García-Alarcón, produce a dynamic, spicily textured and disciplined blend, complemented by the specialist baroque voices of the BelgianChoeur de chambre de Namur. Four busy singers cover the various vocal roles, all thoroughly idiomatic and blessed with immaculate diction.Ana Quintansis a standout as the goddess Hébé;Laurène Paternòa feisty North American maiden;Alasdair Kent– a proper French high tenor – makes a charmingly fickle Spaniard; and sonorous bassAndreas Wolfis enormously persuasive as the fanatical Inca high priest. The Grange festival deserves the Legion of Honour for bringing this imaginative production to our shores.Final performance on 2 July.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The caves are like a kind of political rhetoric in themselves, a message convoluted and endless. Their vanished inhabitants obsess him. Since the Neanderthal extinction, “the wedge between human beings and nature” has become “far deeper than the wedge between factory owners and factory workers that created the conditions of twentieth century life”. The left, he believes, needs to properly understand this.Meanwhile, shadowy French authorities have decided that Lacombe and the “Moulinards” – the post-Debordian eco-commune he mentors by email – need to be steered out of their less than utopian rural domesticity and towards some act of serious terrorism, so they can be dealt with. So they hire Sadie Smith, a freelance American spy-cop, to infiltrate and provoke an outrage. The situation Sadie finds on the ground is confused and intersectional, centred on a real-life green issue: the diversion of local water supplies into vast “mega-basins” to support corporate agribusiness projects at the expense of the local farmers and the environment. Actors within and without the Moulinard commune, less in bad or good faith than in something shifting constantly between the two, all have their motives for protest or intervention.Sadie is a triumph of character – not quite fully self-deceived, not even entirely corrupted by the barely controlled confusions, emotional complications and near-disasters of the deep-cover agent’s life. She’s a satire, but she’s also being straight with us. She’s not quite a sensationist, although the world pours in on her senses, and through hers into ours. How, Rachel Kushner asks in this Booker-shortlisted novel, does the individual’s embrace of experience interface with the ideological? In what circumstances can ideology even permit an interface? Sadie Smith is perhaps both question and answer.M John Harrison£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePsychologyThe truth about teenagersComing of AgeLucy FoulkesComing of AgeLucy FoulkesThe truth about teenagersWhat does your reminiscence bump look like? If this sounds like a blow to the head with a touch of amnesia, it isn’t – but it might be just as painful. No, as Lucy Foulkes explains in her eye-opening guide to the psychology of adolescence, it’s the period of life during which people report the greatest number of important autobiographical memories. For most of us it starts around 10 and peaks at 20, taking in a plethora of firsts: first kiss, first love, first time drinking alcohol or taking drugs, first time away from home. Not to mention exams, bullying, breakups and bereavement. Thinking about it, maybe a concussion would be preferable. But then, as this book shows, it’s these enduringly vivid years that define the adults we become.Foulkes, a research fellow in psychology at the University of Oxford, conducted 23 in-depth interviews for Coming of Age and they are by turns funny, hair-raising and desperately sad. Occasionally, like Naomi’s account of her first love, Peter, they have a sort of novelistic potency. In any case, the majority of readers will find someone they can identify with among her diverse cast of teenagers. Most are now in their 30s or older and are looking back wistfully, with regret, or with something like equanimity. Their accounts allow Foulkes to bring out her central point: that we narrate our lives into being, and that adolescence is so important partly because it is where this narration begins in earnest. The stories we tell ourselves shape who we are, and we can get stuck in these stories, or change them to our advantage.Coming of Age ends movingly. Foulkes showed each of her subjects what she’d written to make sure they were happy with how they’d been portrayed. These were stories of joy, pain and loss that had reverberated through their lives. For many, seeing them presented as part of the broader story of adolescence prompted a re-evaluation. One said their “shoulders had finally dropped” after 20 years, another that they now felt ready to talk to others about what they had been through. Adolescence may be the first draft of personhood, but it doesn’t have to be the last, as this wise and revelatory book shows.David Shariatmadari£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseGeopoliticsMinute by minute accountNuclear WarAnnie JacobsenNuclear WarAnnie JacobsenMinute by minute accountThere is, as Jacobsen says, “no such thing as a small nuclear war”: it would mean the end of civilisation. In this powerful book, she describes in horrifying detail how it could happen today. The US has been preparing plans for a nuclear third world war since at least the 1950s, when the H-bomb was created. This was many times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, which killed at least 80,000 people instantly.By 1960, the US war plan for a pre-emptive strike on the Soviet Union predicted 275 million people would die in the first hour, followed by 325 million more from radioactive fallout. A Soviet counterstrike would have killed 100 million Americans and a similar number from fallout. Someone who was privy to these top-secret plans likened them to the Nazis’ preparations for genocide.Jacobsen’s deeply researched book consists of a minute-by-minute account of a frighteningly realistic scenario in which North Korea launches a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at the Pentagon in Washington. It is what the US and Russia feared most during the cold war. Each country devised meticulous protocols to ensure their massive arsenals could still be launched, even when their leaders had been killed. Jacobsen shows in chilling detail how these plans would be implemented, from the moment the launch of “the all-powerful, unstoppable, civilisation-threatening ICBM” is detected, to the president’s decision to hit North Korea with 82 nuclear warheads 20 minutes later. But as the US ICBMs have to overfly Russia to hit North Korea, the Russians mistakenly believe they are the target and launch their own missiles at America – a fatal miscalculation for the entire world.A mere 32 minutes after launch, the North Korean missile hits Washington: “Never in the history of mankind have so many human beings been killed so fast.” Forty minutes later the Russian missiles begin hitting America in a barrage of “nuclear hellfire” that would lead to the deaths of more than 5 billion people. It would also cause a “nuclear little ice age”, destroying agriculture around the world for a decade.Jacobsen rightly says that “the whole premise of using nuclear weapons is madness”. As gripping as any thriller, her book brilliantly portrays the horrific reality of nuclear war and the threat it continues to pose to the very survival of human life on our planet.PD Smith£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA well-mapped romanceYou Are HereDavid NichollsYou Are HereDavid NichollsA well-mapped romanceMichael, 42, a bearded geography teacher from York, is walking 200 miles across Britain in order not to think about his recent divorce. His concerned friend Cleo gathers a small party to accompany him for the first few days, including her old friend Marnie, 38, a copy editor, also divorced, living in Herne Hill.Backstories are gently woven: unremarkable childhoods, how their marriages fell apart, the arc of their careers. Then everyone else goes home, and we are left with Marnie, Michael, their growing sexual chemistry and Britain’s spectacular landscapes.Nicholls’s novels often confound narrative expectations – most notably with the shock ending of One Day – but there are few surprises here. Short, pacy chapters are energised by a trail mix of jolly headings: in one section, playlist songs that Marnie and Michael share – “Don’t Speak by No Doubt (1996)”, “No Limit by 2 Unlimited (1992)”. Droll signposting aside, we are following the Jane Austen map of romantic plotting: two wounded but complementary souls, initial indifference, misdirected affections, growing attraction, misunderstandings, obstacles, hope and resolution.There is satisfaction to be taken from this midlife redemption tale, not least because it fills a gap: Nicholls’s novels now cover love and marriage across every age bracket from teens to mid-50s. It may not be challenging – unlike Austen’s Persuasion, quoted in the epigraph, it offers neither visceral desperation nor pent-up agonies – but for many it will be a comforting antidote to the grimness of our grim world, a crowd-pleaser and, surely, a TV hit-to-be.Lucy Atkins£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseLettersLet me be your fantasyWantGillian AndersonWantGillian AndersonLet me be your fantasyPart of the pleasure of reading Want – a collection of 174 anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world – is that the scenarios are often strikingly odd. One contributor dreams of being fed chocolate by the Hogwarts potion master. Another longs to have sex with her office door knob. Women are still seen as less sexual than men, but this book attests to a vivid imaginative hinterland, where the desires are far more inventive than the “Milf” and “cheerleader” tropes that dominate man-made porn. In one particularly detailed submission, a woman daydreams about breastfeeding an attractive cashier at the supermarket.The fantasies in this book are sometimes shocking, but hard limits were imposed during the selection process to remove anything that, if acted out in real life, would be illegal. Want is edited by Gillian Anderson, who has restyled herself as a sort of sexual agony aunt after playing a charismatic therapist in Netflix’s Sex Education. In her introduction, Anderson explains how she struggled with the less straightforwardly empowering submissions. Some did make the final cut, but they are punctuated by anxious self-justification. One woman interrupts her fantasy about being held captive by a group of robbers to insist that she is “a feminist”, and that the imaginary robbers have her “consent”.Some of the stories in this book feel too self-censored to be truly erotic. Even so, Want makes for addictive reading. More compelling than the fantasies themselves are the frequent glimpses into the women’s real worlds. One contributor confesses that she fantasises about her partner’s death – she longs to be free, because she has never explored her true feelings for women. Another writes that she brings herself to orgasm by thinking about her husband cheating on her. He has been unfaithful in reality, so every time she does this, she cries. The real-life loneliness conveyed here is much rawer than the wish-fulfilment. At its best, Want gives you privileged access into the most painful, truthful corners of these women’s lives.Kitty Drake£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA transcendent late giftRosaritaAnita DesaiRosaritaAnita DesaiA transcendent late giftAnita Desai’s riddling and haunted new novel is set in motion when Bonita, a young Indian woman, meets a tricksy figure in a park in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. A student of Spanish, Bonita is leafing through local newspapers when she is approached. “The Stranger” – elderly, overfriendly and peculiarly dressed “in the flamboyant Mexican style that few Mexican women assume at any other than festive occasions” – claims to know Bonita’s dead mother, whom she calls “Rosarita”. She says they met and became friends when the latter came to pursue art under the tutelage of Mexican maestros. Bonita has no recollections of her mother painting or travelling to Mexico. She remembers, however, “a sketch in wishy-washy pale pastels that had hung on the wall above your bed at home, of a woman seated on a park bench – and yes, it could have been one here in San Miguel – with a child playing in the sand at her feet”. The woman “is not looking at the child and the child is not looking at her, as if they had no relation to each other, each absorbed in a separate world, and silent”.Written in the second person, the novel interrogates the gulf that can exist between a parent and her child, and the sketch – forgotten and recalled – is a sly mise en abyme that also speaks to the fickleness of memory, and the ever-porous boundaries between the past and the present.Desai has been writing for more than six decades now. Thrice shortlisted for the Booker prize, she is known for the effortless lyricism of her sentences, the deceptive simplicity of her stories, and her canny eye for detail. This is a novel of profound philosophical inquiry, pondering the enigmas of the mind and the self, the frontiers of fantasy and reality, and ultimately, whether one person can ever fully imagine and understand the life of another.Yagnishsing Dawoor£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryAn insider’s takeAn African History of AfricaZeinab BadawiAn African History of AfricaZeinab BadawiAn insider’s takeThere is no shortage of big tomes about Africa written by old Africa hands – those white journalists, memoirists, travel writers or novelists who know Africa better than Africans. This genre, lampooned by Binyavanga Wainaina’s satirical essay How to Write About Africa, weaves together stories that exalt the continent’s landscape but decry its politics, that revere its wildlife but patronise its people, that use words such as “timeless”, “primordial” and “tribal” when explaining Africa’s historical trajectories.Zeinab Badawi’s An African History of Africa is a corrective to these narratives. Ambitious in scope and refreshing in perspective, the book stretches from the origins of Homo sapiens in east Africa through to the end of apartheid in South Africa. It is informed by interviews Badawi conducted with African scholars and cultural custodians, whose expertise, observations and wisdom are threaded through the book.The very act of telling African history from an African perspective and making this history accessible to a wide audience is an assertion of dignity and an invitation to learn more. As Badawi puts it: “I hope I have demonstrated that Africa has a history, that it is a fundamental part of our global story, and one that is worthy of greater attention and respect than it has so far received.” She most certainly has.Simukai Chigudu£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseBiographyFriendship and rivalry in LADidion & BabitzLili AnolikDidion & BabitzLili AnolikFriendship and rivalry in LAJournalist Lili Anolik’s latest book is a “provocation”, a dual biography of the two friends who carved their initials on to the counterculture of 1960s and 1970s California. Joan Didion used her reporting skills to fashion herself into a serious-minded literary titan, while Eve Babitz’s novels and essay collections, compiled from the same social scenes but shaped more loosely and with greater spirit, fell into relative obscurity. That is, until Anolik tracked Babitz down in 2012, by then seriously ill and living in squalor. Anolik became obsessed, helping to restore Babitz’s reputation as a writer and chronicler of Los Angeles life, eventually writing the 2019 biography Hollywood’s Eve. “My preoccupation was unbalanced, fetishistic,” she admits here.This time, Anolik uses Didion as the headliner, though seemingly through gritted teeth. When Babitz died, aged 78, in 2021 – just days before Didion, who was 87 – her sister Mirandi discovered boxes of papers in the back of a wardrobe. Anolik was reeled in by an excoriating but unsent letter from Babitz to Didion, which she chooses to interpret as a platonic “lovers’ quarrel”. Babitz assails her friend and occasional collaborator (Didion briefly edited Babitz’s first collection, before Babitz “fired” her) for what she perceives as Didion’s dislike of women, her contempt for art, and her deference to her husband. Anolik takes this wounded screed and runs with it, replaying Babitz’s story through its entanglements with Didion’s. This is vivid, entertaining stuff and often gallops along as if it’s been up all night at one of Didion and Dunne’s notorious Franklin Avenue gatherings, but it is, perhaps, more provocative than entirely convincing.Rebecca Nicholson£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseEssaysPortrait of the artistsThe Position of SpoonsDeborah LevyThe Position of SpoonsDeborah LevyPortrait of the artists\"It is a writing adventure to go in deep, then deeper, and then to play with surface so that we become experts at surface and depth,” writes Deborah Levy, and it’s as good a statement of intent as any in this collection, which delves into topics both trivial and profound: brothel creepers, car crashes, lemon curd, trauma.The theme, insofar as there is one, is the artists who have inspired her. Many of these are women, and Levy writes skilfully on the complex interplay of self-presentation and effacement that’s often demanded of female creativity. Lee Miller “both hides from and gives herself to the camera”; Francesca Woodman makes “herself present by making herself absent”. Artists and writers invent things, but they invent themselves too.Levy is good on the prices we find ourselves paying: for art, for love, for fitting in. Of Ann Quin, the avant garde, working-class writer who drowned herself in the sea off Brighton, she says: “I want to know more about what it took to want to swim home and I know Quin could have told me.” In another short piece called Values and Standards, she writes about an acquaintance she sometimes meets at the school gates. This woman’s husband takes pleasure in humiliating her; to survive, “she had removed her own eyes and saw the world and herself through his eyes”. Levy wonders if she ever “puts her own eyes back in”, and considers her own narrowing of vision at times when “other things had become bigger. Perhaps overwhelming.”Here is Levy on the French writer and film-maker Marguerite Duras: “She thinks as deeply as it is possible to think without dying of pain … She puts everything in to language. The more she puts in, the fewer words she uses.” At her best, Levy pulls off a similar feat, plunging into the depths, taking us with her.Freya Berry£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePoetryA dazzling voiceBad Diaspora PoemsMomtaza MehriBad Diaspora PoemsMomtaza MehriA dazzling voiceThe long-awaited debut collection from the former Young People’s Poet Laureate for London invites readers to consider the concept of diaspora. Mehri brings unflinching discursive skills to verse that melds criticism, autobiography and essay while still achieving a crisp sonic momentum characteristic of lyric poetry.The meanings of diaspora in this collection are as varied as the forms Mehri deploys: prose poems, found poems, poems using emojis and erasures. “Diaspora is witnessing a murder without getting blood on your shirt.” “I don’t want to guard something I don’t own.” Mehri finds a new tone somewhere between Gwendolyn Brooks’s effortless musicality and Carolyn Forché’s noun-laced haunting intensity. Hers is a dazzling voice that refuses to speak from a podium, preferring to examine guilt, culture and personhood from within the “nightly decision” of community.Oluwaseun Olayiwola£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionLife after the apocalypseJuiceTim WintonJuiceTim WintonLife after the apocalypseTim Winton and speculative fiction may seem an odd combination. His novels excel at the here and now, depicting lives at the margins, young love and young parenthood, violence at the hands of fathers. But the harsh beauty of the western Australian landscape has long been a presence in his work, and Winton has also long highlighted his country’s fragility in the face of climate chaos, and been fiercely critical of the exploitation of Australia’s mineral wealth. So the cli-fi premise of Juice, his latest novel, could be a perfect Winton fit.Set in an unspecified future, some centuries from now, the book opens on a man and a girl driving across a landscape blackened by ashes. The hellscape is worthy of the Mad Max franchise, with slave colonies springing up from the parched earth like termite mounds. There are echoes of Cormac McCarthy’s The Road here, too, in the black dust thrown up by the vehicle’s tyres, and in the child passenger, observing everything with a mute wariness. And Winton’s ending is a masterstroke, the heart-in-your-mouth final chapter one of the best things I’ve read in a long time.Rachel Seiffert£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA historic heroYorùbá Boy RunningBiyi BándéléYorùbá Boy RunningBiyi BándéléA historic heroLike the protagonist of Yorùbá Boy Running, Biyi Bándélé had been running from a young age. At 14, he won a writing competition at school; another award in his 20s, for his radio play script Rain, took him to London in 1990. He hit the ground running there, publishing his first novel, The Man Who Came in from the Back of Beyond, in 1991. This was the beginning of a prolific and multifaceted career that, sadly, came to an end when Bándélé died suddenly in 2022 at the age of 54.At the time he was putting the finishing touches to his film adaptation of Wole Soyinka’s play Death and the King’s Horseman – a play very much centred on death and redemption and now available on Netflix as Elesin Oba: The King’s Horseman. He was also working on this posthumous novel, Yorùbá Boy Running, partly inspired by the history of Bándélé’s great-grandfather, who, like his protagonist, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, was formerly enslaved.One doesn’t come to a posthumous novel for its perfect finish; not all the sections of the book are as polished or as inventive as the opening part. The editors have done a great job of ordering and signposting the different sections with dates and thematic headings, making it easier to follow the sometimes intricate chronology of the narrative. We are lucky and grateful that the author was able to leave us with this bookend to his glorious if truncated career that began long ago in Kafanchan, Nigeria, when he started running towards a distinguished future in faraway London.Helon Habila£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseEnvironmentA message of hopeInto the Clear Blue SkyRob JacksonInto the Clear Blue SkyRob JacksonA message of hopeRob Jackson has a dream: to restore the Earth’s atmosphere to pre-industrial levels of greenhouse gases. For more than a decade, the professor of environmental sciences and chair of the Global Carbon Project has focused his research on reducing levels of methane, the greenhouse gas responsible for about a third of recent atmospheric heating. Methane concentrations are accelerating faster today than at any time. The cause is unclear but, as the climate heats up, it may may be due to emissions from tropical wetlands or thawing Arctic permafrost.There is so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from fossil fuels that restoring its level to what it was before the industrial revolution is impossible. You would have to remove a trillion tons of pollution: “No one reading this book will live long enough to see that happen.” But that is not the case for methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas. Methane’s concentration could be restored to pre-industrial levels by removing “only” two to three billion tons: “My dream is to see this happen in my lifetime.” Jackson believes this is now the only way of slowing global warming in the next decade or two, in order to delay crossing critical temperature thresholds, such as 1.5 and 2C increases.Jackson explains here the possible methods of “drawdown”, or cleansing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Extracting 400bn tons of carbon dioxide would cost $40tn, “larger than the combined annual GDPs of China and the US”. He frankly admits that removing methane from the air is more difficult than carbon dioxide. But the advantage is that, unlike carbon dioxide, it doesn’t need to be captured and stored underground.Jackson points out the sobering fact that “no fossil fuel shows a sustained decline in global use”. Ultimately, this pollution will need to be removed if the Earth is to remain habitable. In this important book, Jackson makes a compelling case for methane removal, together with emissions reductions. He lucidly explains the threats facing the planet, as well as the science of drawdown. Through conversations with innovators, conservationists, business leaders and activists, he offers a powerful message of hope, showing how change can and must happen, if we are to restore the climate and reduce global temperatures.PD Smith£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

If an experience is an article of clothing, then memory is the garment after it’s been washed, not according to the instructions, over and over again: the colours fade, the size shrinks, the original, nostalgic scent has long since become the artificial orchid smell of fabric softener. Giyora Shiro, may he rest in peace, was thinking all this while standing in line to get into the next world …”That’s quite the opener for a story, isn’t it? The apt but just slightly ridiculous metaphor, which is then revealed as not an authorial pronouncement but a character’s ruminations. And then we meet the character – excellently specific name – and we find out he’s dead, and, in that drolly formulaic aside “may he rest in peace”, we meet the author too.The novelist David Mitchell once said that a common element in great writing, as opposed to merely “really, really good writing”, is a sense of humour. The Israeli writer Etgar Keret’s short stories certainly qualify on that count. He’s not always or even often trying to make you laugh, but everything he writes is suffused with a wan metaphysical wit: you come to expect the rug-pull, the sad trombone. He’s an absurdist, a surrealist, and a writer who revels in the way that in a few paragraphs you can take the reader anywhere.Where some authors will set vast cycles of fiction in a shared universe, Keret does the opposite. Every story is its own universe, and the 200-odd pages of each of his collections are a multiverse. The stories in Autocorrect, his seventh, are gleaming splinters:multum in parvo. He offers yelp-making casual swerves of perspective. “People, by the way, became extinct a short time later,” we’re told halfway through the last paragraph of one story – that flamboyantly casual “by the way” being very Keretian.In that sense, he resembles the science fiction writer Ted Chiang, with story after story serving as a thought experiment, a parable or a koan, seeded with a big idea. But what he’s interested in is how ordinary people, horny or hungry or a little petty, will react in their ordinary ways to the extraordinary. Hence the opening of one story, for instance: “The world is about to end and I’m eating olives. The original plan was pizza, but …” Or another: “The aliens’ spaceship arrived every Thursday.” In still another, For the Woman Who Has Everything, someone trying to find his wife an original present for her birthday names an asteroid after her – a few hours before that same asteroid is due to obliterate the Earth: “The birthday card Schliefer bought had a picture of a shooting star, and the caption said ‘Make A Wish’ in gold letters.”The opening story, A World Without Selfie Sticks, opens with the narrator describing self-reproachingly how he started yelling at a woman he thought was his girlfriend Deborah when he bumped into her in a coffee shop. Only a week previously, he explains, she had supposedly flown to Australia to do her doctorate – and here she was back in town without telling him. Of course he was angry and hurt. It turns out the woman he’s yelling at (Not-Deborah, he comes to call her) is a doppelganger from a near-identical alternative universe. She has been sent to our world as part of a top-rated TV gameshow: to win the show (and be zapped home) each of the five contestants must identify “the one thing that exists in their world but not the one they’ve been sent to” (the winner of the last series had been sent to a universe without selfie sticks). I shan’t spoil the twist, but it’s a love story and a philosophical what-if all at the same time.The story that will get most scrutiny, A Dog for a Dog, describes the narrator and his brother heading into the Arabic quarter of an Israeli city for revenge after their dog is killed in a hit-and-run. Transposing Israeli-Palestinian hatred from a policy position to street level, it’s a delicately anticlimactic, perfectly balanced vignette, shadowed by violence as well as uneasy complicity in violence and collective punishment. Meanwhile, Strong Opinions on Burning Issues winks at the psychic temper of the times, and Outside refracts the experience of the Covid lockdowns into a surreal little parable. But these are literary responses rather than position statements. (And all but a couple of the stories were written before 7 October.) Politics is mostly absent, in a low-key rebuke to the philistine school of thought that says an Israeli artist should be obliged to make political art.Other stories take us to different versions of the afterlife, or into a simulated reality where the introduction of an “undo” feature – spill your coffee, you can set the universe back 30 seconds – poses an existential threat. Director’s Cut is a real-time biopic of an ordinary man with a 73-year running time; the press screening at once winks at Plato’s cave (the only person who doesn’t die of old age emerges thinking the film was reality) and Borges’s 1-1 scale map. There’s a world not that far from our own, where AI companions are proposed to cure loneliness; and one where time travel only takes off when it’s rebranded as a weight-loss treatment.Yet for all its vast reach, Keret’s prose, translated from Hebrew by Jessica Cohen and Sondra Silverston, is downbeat and matter-of-fact. It’s full of people negotiating the bewildering and alienating and bathetic furniture of modernity: Tinder dates, Zoom calls, Skype meetings, virtual reality, small ads, tedious queues, spoiler alerts, unexpected deaths. Autocorrect isn’t so much a book as a library of tiny books, from an author who conveys as well as any I can think of just how much fun you can have with a short story.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The islands and littorals of the Mediterranean gave Durrell his subject, remade by him into a theatre in which men and women, displaced by the political and social violence of the mid-20th century, stumbled towards each other amid the ruins of ancient civilisations.It feels right, then, that this biography of Lawrence Durrell, only the second major one since his death in 1990, is by Michael Haag, who spent his career writing about the eastern Mediterranean. Haag’s best book was Alexandria: City of Memory (2004), which drew on the writings ofCavafy, EM Forster and Durrell to reconstruct the polyglot culture of the Greek, Italian, Jewish and Arabic population that flourished for centuries on the shores of north Africa. By the time of his own death in 2020, Haag had completed this biography of Durrell up to the year 1945, and the decision was made to publish posthumously. The result reads like an abbreviated account of Durrell’s life rather than an amputation: despite not becoming a significant literary figure until 1957, most of Durrell’s formative experiences had taken place by the time he left the city at the end of the war.Haag’s insistence on treating place not just as a matter of landscape but also as social nexus provides new insights into Durrell’s earliest years. The standard version has always been that his family was Anglo-Indian, with parents who were ethnic Britons living and working during the Raj while longing continually for “home”. Lawrence Durrell Sr was even that quintessential figure, a civil engineer, at work on the railways that were joining up the subcontinent. Yet Haag’s forensic analysis reveals that the Durrell family was located very far down colonial India’s pecking order. Both Lawrence Sr and his wife, Louisa Dixie, were “country born” in the Punjab, with only tenuous connections to Britain. On Louisa’s side there may have been Indian blood. The decision not to automatically send the four surviving Durrell children back to “Blighty” (a corrupted Urdu word) for their education likewise marked the family out as being perilously close to the Eurasians who made up colonial India’s subaltern class.Haag is also able to put to rest some of Durrell’s more outrageous fibs. It is not true that his family was Irish – he probably just liked the way it made him seem not-English. Nor, in his boarding school in Darjeeling, could young Larry see Everest from the foot of his bed: the windows of his dormitory looked out on to dreary playing fields. Such misdirections were perhaps an attempt to disguise a childhood that was distinctly troubled. Louisa – “Mother” in My Family and Other Animals (1956), by younger brother Gerry – had already started her descent into full-blown alcoholism, an addiction she passed on to all three of her sons.Haag has dealt before with the Corfu idyll in The Durrells of Corfu (2017), but in this retelling he reminds us that even in Eden things were not always as they seemed. On the island, the Durrells were socially suspect: the gentry class found them rough and boorish, while the priests and peasants were deeply offended by their insistence on swimming in the nude without worrying who saw them.This biography inevitably comes into its own once Larry touches down in Alexandria in 1942 as the newly appointed press attache to the British embassy. Haag’s descriptions of the city’s melting-pot culture and its steamy eroticism are wonderfully done. It was here that Larry met Eve Cohen, the model for Justine in the first volume of The Alexandria Quartet, who became his second wife.Durrell’s previous biographer Ian MacNiven was in the tricky position of having been invited by his subject to write the book, for which he would be given access to private papers. The result was both overlong and overawed. Haag doesn’t set out to do a hatchet job, but he is clearer on Durrell’s dark side. The puckish author, no more than 5ft 4in tall, was free with his fists, snobbish and racist (Eve’s Jewishness seemed both to intrigue and repel him). The book’s cut-off point of 1945 means that later accusations by Durrell’s daughter Sappho that he compelled her into an incestuous relationship are not explored. She killed herself at the age of 33.Missing, too, is any assessment of where Lawrence Durrell’s literary reputation currently stands. In truth, he is not much read or liked now, his books coming over as bloated and cod-metaphysical in a way no amount of gorgeous phrase-making can quite redeem. Durrell’s time may come again, but at this point we will have to be satisfied with Haag’s account of him as a supreme writer of place, rather than as an astute investigator of the human condition or, even less persuasively, an overlooked modernist master.Larry: A New Biography of Lawrence Durrell 1912-1945 by Michael Haag is published by Profile Books (£25).

It was a simple bat-and-ball game, created in 1958 by scientistWilliam Higinbothamat the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, that is widely the considered the first ever video game created purely for entertainment. Tennis for Two ran on an oscilloscope and was designed as a minor diversion for visitors attending the lab’s annual open day, but when people started playing, a queue developed that eventually extended out of the front door and around the side of the building. It was the first indication that computer games might turn out to be popular.I’ve been unable to find out if Ralph Baer, the inventor of the first mass-produced games console, theMagnavox Odyssey, ever played Tennis for Two. However, when he was developing the idea of a TV that could play games, while working at the defence contractor Sanders Associates in the late 1960s, the rudimentary elements of what his prototype consoles could display on screen were vertical lines and square dots. When Magnavox released the product in 1972, its key games were Table Tennis and Tennis (the same as Table Tennis, except you could place a plastic overlay of a tennis court on your TV screen). These allowed two players to bat a ball to each other, adding a little “spin” by flicking the dial on the side of the primitive joypad. This was an extension of the knob on the Tennis for Two controller that let you alter the height of your return shot, but neither game really allowed much in the way of player skill.From here, of course, we get to Pong, widely considered the first smash hit video arcade game. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell played tennis on the Odyssey and thought he could do better; with programmer Al Alcorn, he divided the onscreen bat into eight areas, each deflecting the ball at a different angle. Here we had the true beginnings of input finesse, a crucial element of all future video games, giving the player room to add skill and timing to their shots. Pong was such asuccess, Bushnell realised Atari needed a single-player version – hence the 1976 coin-opBreakout, where you hit the ball not at another human participant but at a wall of disappearing bricks. Breakout was effectively a one-player tennis game, and its brilliance had two major ramifications for the video game industry in Japan: it was the first successful release for legendary manufacturer Namco after its purchase of Atari’s Japanese arm in 1974, effectively propelling the company into the video arcade business; Breakout also inspired a game designer named Tomohiro Nishikado, who would use it as the basis of a certain 1978 arcade game,Space Invaders. So you see, tennis is responsible for the entire shoot-em-up genre.View image in fullscreenAhead of his time … Ralph Baer, pictured in 2009, holding his ‘Brown Box’ prototype of the first consoles.Photograph: Jens Wolf/APTennis sims were also vitally important in the early home computer gaming boom of the 1980s. Titles such as Match Point on the ZX Spectrum and International Tennis on the Commodore 64 provided compelling and intuitive two-player experiences that didn’t require a whole team of animated players like footie sims. The accessibility of tennis as a game concept also appealed to Nintendo, with its Tennis, Mario Tennis andWii Tennis(from Wii Sports) games becoming its most popular sporting titles.Since then, every generation of consoles has had its staple tennis titles, usually not as big and showy as the football or basketball sims, but always there in the background, perfect for when non-gamers wanted to join in the fun. Namco’s Smash Court, Codemasters’ Pete SamprasTennis, 2K’s TopSpin and Sega’s Virtua Tennis have added interesting assets to the central concept of hitting a ball over a net, and while they have all sought to simulate a range of surfaces and competitions, it’s the idyllic vision of the Wimbledon grass court that has sold them. In tennis, you have an almost unique set of properties: wide consumer knowledge, an easy-to-understand rule-set married to deep skill mechanics and a highly constrained play space providing concentrated single-screen action.Would people have queued for hours outside a science research base in Upton, New York, in the autumn of 1958 to play a space blaster or kung fu fighting game? I don’t think so – it would have been unworldly and mystifying to many attenders. Look at Computer Space, the first commercially available space shooter arcade game, released in 1971 (designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney) – it did modestly well, but it was far from the global success that Pong achieved. The controls were too complicated, the concept too abstract. Tennis was the Trojan horse of the video game industry – it snuck video games into our homes and our amusement arcades, and by the time we realised what had happened, it was too late ever to go back.What to playView image in fullscreenRetro treat … Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition.Photograph: Team 17I was going to be predictable and recommend a tennis game here – probably a classic such asVirtua TennisorTop Spin 4– but instead I’m going for a different sort of retro treat.Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Editionis a modern update of what many consider to be the pinnacle of the Worms series, 1999’s Worms Armageddon, a daft multiplayer turn-based battle game where you set out to destroy your enemy’s army of annelids with sheep launchers, banana bombs and … a concrete donkey.It’s such a ridiculous and funny game, but also requires deep tactical thinking and such a mastery of angles and trajectory it may as well be considered educational software. An update to the game also gives access to previous titles in the series for the Mega Drive and Game Boy.

What’s the latest thinking?”As referenced in the What to Read section above, Laura Fryer, an early Xbox employee, has stated that Microsoft is preparing to kill games hardware development in favour of getting its Xbox app on to different platforms. We’ve seen this approach taking shape with the recentROG Xbox AllyandMeta Quest 3S Xbox Editionannouncements; Samsung is also making Xbox game streaming a part of its Smart TVs. However, Microsoft has alsojust announceda multi-year partnership with chip manufacturer AMD, which it stated would include “Future Xbox consoles”. Meanwhile, Sony, which lacks the sort of ecosystems open to Microsoft thanks to Windows, has recentlyreiterated its commitment to dedicated games consoles, which is unsurprising considering that PS5 has sold around 78m units, and rumours of a third Switchare already swirling. Earlier this month, Switch 2 sold over 3.5m units in its first four days on sale – a record for console hardware.So no, I don’t think dedicated games consoles are going anywhere soon. They’re convenient, cheaper than buying and maintaining a gaming PC and offer a more stable and reliable experience than streaming games via a set-top box. Also, after five years of increased virtualisation, where we generally don’t own the music we listen to or the movies we watch, there is a growing kickback against digital apps and streaming services – the games console is a desirable object, specifically designed for fun and rife with sentimental memories. It’s illogical really to want a big chunk of plastic and circuit boards to play games on, but when that chunk looks as cool as aMega Drive, aNeo Geoor aPlayStation 5, it becomes more than just a platform. While we still enjoy visible artefacts that express our likes and tastes, there will be consoles to put next to the TV and gaze at adoringly.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.In last week’s Pushing Buttons, we incorrectly said that the film Walkabout was directed by Peter Weir.

It’s big, brash and impossibly enjoyableTom ReganWed 2 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 05.01 EDTShareWhile searching for gold in the dingy mines of Ingot Isle, a severe storm sweeps dungaree-donning hero Donkey Kong into a vast underground world. You think he’d be distraught, yet with the subterranean depths apparently rich in banana-shaped gemstones, DK gleefully uses his furry fists to pummel and burrow his way towards treasure. From here, the first Donkey Kong platformer since 2014 is a dirt-filled journey to the centre of the Earth.Much like the Battlefield games of old, Bananza is built to let you pulverise its destructible environments as you see fit. That seemingly enclosed starting area? You can burrow your way through the floor. Bored with jumping through a cave? Batter your way through the wall instead. There’s a cathartic mindlessness to smashing seven shades of stone out of every inch of the ground beneath you, pushing the physics tech to its limits and seeing what hidden collectibles and passageways you unearth.In order to add an element of humanity to all the destruction, a young girl named Pauline (whom players may recognise from classic DK games) joins Donkers for the ride, perching on his simian shoulders while singing, like a Brit School-trained parrot.View image in fullscreenLike a Brit School-trained parrot … Pauline joins DK for the ride in Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoIn a welcome nod to the jazz-filled refrains of Super Mario Odyssey, Pauline sends DK into a frenzy by warbling like Mariah Carey. As DK locks into a gorilla groove by thumping on his chest, Pauline steps up to the mic and sings her heart out, powering him up to new hulking heights – his Bananza form – allowing him to smash through concrete as he glows red and embarks on a rhythmic rampage. As DK’s journey progresses, you unlock additional animal-themed transformations, with one later level seeing DK flutter through the air as a pretty bizarre-looking Ostrich.As it’s 2025, there’s now a skill tree, enabling players to upgrade DK’s moves, raise his health and even teach him new attacks and tricks. Continuing the RPG-lite approach, collectible hidden fossils are also carefully scattered across each new level, a currency used to buy new stat-boosting outfits. More importantly, these outfits are a huge amount of fun, allowing you to swap DK’s default crimson fur for a more gothic black-furred Kong – along with a pair of blue denim dungarees and a yellow tie of course.Thanks to its 3D hub worlds, ranged projectiles and wacky transformations, there’s more than a whiff of Rare’s seminal N64 Donkey Kong platformer to Bananza. Part Banjo-Kazooie, part Incredible Hulk simulator, the destruction-led chaos is a world away from the pristine Super Mario Odyssey. If you get tired of punching, you can opt to chuck objects at your surroundings instead. Donkey Kong can hurl slabs of stone and granite at foes, walls and ... well, anything really, even launching a special glowing material to destroy cursed structures and unlock one-off challenge areas. Some NPCs are even made out of gems, allowing you to pulverise them mid-conversation before they slowly reassemble, feigning nonchalance with a dead-eyed look in their shimmering crystallised irises.View image in fullscreenAn eyeball-straining degree of carnage … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoThe development team seems to have had fun coming up with new fearsome foes for DK to face off against. From being bombarded by hordes of tiny angry blobs, to battering a golden skeletal pterodactyl or fleeing a hopping stone alligator head, the slightly nightmarish threats that you pulverise match Bananza’s off-kilter tone, looking pleasingly distinct from the usual Mario fare.Bosses promise to be a big part of Bananza too, with DK clashing with the nefarious VoidCo, a brooding gang of villainous apes who steal DK’s much-coveted Banandium Gems. Grumpy Kong, for example, pilots a towering concrete mech which you have to chip into layers, eventually lowering him to ground level and doing what DK now apparently does best – delivering a brutal beating.Mine kart sections make a welcome return, seeing you leap between rails to dodge obstacles and take out enemies and structures alike by chucking glowing rocks into them until they explode. In a bid to keep the frame-rate solid while you chisel the landscapes around you in real time, the visuals take a slight hit. While character models look great, certain environments and areas look a little bland – but most of the time, you’re moving too swiftly to truly care. While we start off in a dingy mine, we travel through a luscious lagoon and find our way leaping out of deadly rivers of toxins in a poison-filled swamp.Like Odyssey, there’s a half-hearted co-op mode in Bananza. Put in the sulky boots of Pauline, a second player can click and chip away at the environment via the Joy-Con mouse. Each click chucks or destroys bits of the environment, with both players reaching a screen-filling, eyeball-straining degree of carnage. Give this to a young’un and furious-click induced chaos will no doubt ensue. You have been warned.Donkey Kong Bananza is weird, a little janky at the moment and more chaotic thanNintendoplatformers of old. It’s the playable equivalent of Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit, big, brash and impossibly enjoyable. While the Switch 2 has been accused of being iterative rather than innovative, for his first Switch 2 appearance, it seems that the iconic ape is burrowing his way towards a new type of fun.Donkey Kong Bananza is released on 17 July on Nintendo Switch 2Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsNintendo Switch 2NintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he has turned his attention to Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande, an opera on which he assisted Pierre Boulez at the Welsh NationalOperamore than 30 years ago. The results are no less unmissable and authoritative as his Wagner.From the dark chords of the opening bars, Negus conjures a fluently idiomatic reading of the translucent score. The pacing is beautifully controlled and Negus is always attentive to Debussy’s many tone colour changes and subtle dynamic contrasts. He draws some ravishing woodwind playing from the Longborough orchestra.The opening ofJenny Ogilvie’s production is instantly gripping too, as the barely discernible figures of the lost Prince Golaud and the mysterious Mélisande encounter one another in the tenebrous depths of a murky wood. It sets the bar high for a darkly mysterious staging of an enigmatic work, in which Max Johns’s cubist suggestions of a castle supply a menacing background to the opera’s elusive events. The stage is often almost bare, with the characters facing outwards without direct interaction. Amid such discipline, Mélisande’s scene at the tower window, imaginatively translated on to a giant garden swing, has all the more impact for its impulsive movement.View image in fullscreenCubist suggestions of a castle … Nia Coleman and Brett Polegato in Pelléas et Mélisande at Longborough festival opera.Photograph: Matthew Williams-EllisPeter Small’s lighting plays a crucial stage role, occasionally bright and trained, blindingly so at the death of Pelléas, but more often suggestive and fleeting amid the weight of the shadows. A tiny, bright bulb flickers like a will-o’-the wisp, deepening the darkness behind. When the dark occasionally lifts, and Debussy’s orchestration opens radiantly with it, the illumination of the stage is like a breath of fresh air, but it is only momentary. It all adds up to one of the most accomplished, atmospheric and well-integrated Pelléas productions in years, and possibly the most completely successful show Longborough has mounted.There are reservations, however. Three silent servants, whose entrance in the final scene is indeed signalled in the text, are given more extended roles as extras and scene shifters, including a memorably posed moment as the sleeping beggars in a cave. Though they never speak, surtitles twice give them inner thoughts, elevating them into an unspeaking chorus. This feels an otiose moment in a production where music, staging, lights and performances otherwise all support one another so sympathetically.Among a strongly cast group of principals, Kateryna Kasper brings an ideal combination of soprano richness and soubrette brightness to Mélisande. Karim Sulayman’s light-voiced Pelléas sounds almost improvised in its conversational fluency, but his tenor flowers in moments of passion. Brett Polegato is an intense and intelligent Golaud. Julian Close brings sombre authority to King Arkel, Catherine Carby is a richly projected Geneviève and Nia Coleman, on stage almost throughout, is a brightly convincing Yniold.Until 10 July.

Internationallythere was a 13%increase in US audiobook sales between 2023 and 2024; in the UK audiobook revenue shot up to a new high of £268m, a 31% increase on 2023, thePublishers Association said.As demand for audio content grows, companies are looking for faster – and cheaper – ways to make it. In January 2023Apple launched a new audiobook catalogue of audiobooks narrated by AI. Later that yearAmazon announcedthat self-published, US-based authors with works on Kindle couldturn their ebooks into audiobooks using AI “virtual voice” technology– and there are now tens of thousands of these computer-generated audiobooks available through Audible.And in February this year, as part of a more general shift towards audiobooks,Spotify saidit would be accepting AI audiobooks to “lower the barrier to entry” for authors hoping to find more readers.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAudible says its aims are similar: to complement, not replace, human narration, allowing more authors and more titles to reach bigger audiences. In the USAudible is also testing a voice replica for audiobook narrators, to create dupes of their own voices that will “empower participants to expand their production capabilities for high-quality audiobooks”.“In 2023 and 2024, Audible Studios hired more [human] narrators than ever before,” an Audible spokesperson told the Guardian. “We continue to hear from creators who want to make their work available in audio, reaching new audiences across languages.”But robot narrators will always be cheaper than humans – and people in the voice acting and book industries fear a move to AI could pose a threat to workers.Volume or quality?Dorje Swallow’s career as a narrator took off after he began voicing novels by the Australian bestselling crime author Chris Hammer – and the actor has now narrated about 70 audiobooks. Swallow believes AI narration is a tool created by people who “don’t understand the value, technique and skills” required to produce quality audiobooks.“We’ve done the hard yards and then some to get where we are, and to think you can just press a button and you’re going to get something of similar, or good enough quality, is kind of laughable,” he says.Simon Kennedy, the president of the Australian Association of Voice Actors, says there has always been a battle over how much a narrator deserves to be paid in Australia. For every finished hour of an audiobook, a narrator might spend double or triple that time recording it – and that doesn’t include an initial read to understand the book and its characters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In a submission to a parliamentary committee last year the organisation said5,000 Australian voice acting jobswere at risk.He was hardly surprised about Audible’s announcement but says he thinks it’s a “pretty dumb move”.“An audiobook narrator has such a special and intimate relationship with the listener that to try and do anything that is less connective is a foolish move,” he says.As for the opportunity to clone their own voices, he says voice actors should have the right to engage – but they shouldn’t expect “any near the same pay rate, and they risk turning their unique timbre – their vocal brand – into a mass-produced robot voice that listeners get sick of listening to pretty quickly.”.“If an emotionless narration at a consistent volume is all you need for ‘high-quality’, then sure,” he says. “But if engaging, gripping, edge-of-your-seat storytelling is your version of high-quality, then don’t hold your breath for AI to give you that.”Another major concern is Australia’s lack of AI regulation. While the EU has its ownAI Act, andChinaandSpainhave labelling laws for AI-generated content, Australia is falling behind.“There are no laws to prevent data scraping or non-consenting cloning of voices, or of creating deepfakes of people,” Kennedy says. “There are also no labelling laws or laws to mandate watermarking of AI-generated content and its origins; no laws to mandate transparency of training data; and no laws to dictate the appropriate use of AI-generated deepfakes, voice clones or text.”View image in fullscreenAuthor Hannah Kent fears the use of AI will ‘cheapen things in a creative sense’.Photograph: Carrie Jones/The Guardian‘The foot is on the pedal to drive straight into dystopia’This year the Burial Rites and Devotionauthor, Hannah Kent,was one of many acclaimed Australian writersshocked to discover their pirated work had been used to train Meta’s AI systems. She says while her initial reaction to the introduction of AI into creative spaces tends to be “refusal and outrage”, she’s curious about Audible’s AI announcement – specifically its plans to roll out beta testing for AI to translate text into different languages.“I think it’s fairly obvious that the main reason to use AI would be for costs, and I think that’s going to cheapen things in a literal sense and cheapen things in a creative sense – in that sense of us honouring the storytelling, artistic and creative impulse,” Kent says.Tudor and Swallow believe big companies will struggle to replace human narration completely, partly because many Australian authors will oppose it.But whether or not listeners will be able to tell the difference remains to be seen.“The foot is on the pedal to drive straight into dystopia,” Tudor says. “Can we just listen to people instead of robots?”Explore more on these topicsAudiobooksArtificial intelligence (AI)AmazonSpotifyAppleActingAustralian booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Michael Rababy’s best photograph‘I use a hit and run approach when photographing inside casinos. On one occasion, the sound of my camera woke a guy up and he wanted a fight’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 2 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 12.17 EDTShareAs a kid, I would see a new casino every time I visited Vegas with my family. They were huge, multimillion dollar investments and even then, I knew that money had come from people losing it in machines. That’s probably why I don’t gamble. My dad only actually took us into a casino a couple of times, but I remember him believing he would win and my mother being more rational about it.Thinking about it now, it’s absurd to take your kids to Vegas. My friend Rich remembers his parents checking him and his brother in at theCircus Circus hoteland casino – I think there was maybe a trampoline for children to jump on while the parents gambled. Afterwards, they’d hand in their ticket and pick the kids up again, like you do with your coat at the theatre.In my 20s, I’d go to Vegas with friends and, while they were gambling, I’d be documenting, running around and taking photos wherever I could. I began to realise that the gap between the absurd commercials we have in the US for casinos that promise the world, and the reality that I was seeing, was huge, almost to a comical degree. The photographs I’d been accumulating started to form a cohesive body of work, showing the contrast between the glamour in the marketing, and the actuality – which is more like going to the airport than a big night out in Monte Carlo.It epitomises Vegas – not just because of Elvis, but also because of the lights and the colourI took trips to places well known for their casinos, such as Reno, Nevada and Atlantic City, and whenever I was somewhere in the US that had one, I would seek it out. I tend to use a hit and run approach when photographing inside them. If I see security looking at me, or if other people are becoming aware of me, I’ll just move on – there’s always an embarrassment of riches to photograph, you could just go to the next table, or even the next casino. I also don’t want to be perceived as someone who might be helping someone cheat, so I try to avoid any card games.I feel like I’m setting the stage for a story, and then you let your mind fill in the blanks. This photograph of an Elvis impersonator is an example of that – one image that says 1,000 words. It’s pretty much the iconic image of myCasinoland book. Elvis was the king but there was a darker side to him too, which reflects the difference between the marketing of casinos and their reality.The photograph was taken in 2012 and it epitomises Vegas – not just because of Elvis, but also the lights and the colour. For some reason I feel more emotion when there’s more saturation in an image. There’s so much distraction going on here, but it all frames the king in the centre. He’s kind of slumped back at the slot machine: you see him from the back but you know exactly who he is.Often players go into a particular mental state at the slot machines, where they seem to be aware of nothing else. They get locked into a zone where it’s just them and the machine. I could often get pretty close, and was able to capture what was happening without them seeing me. You have to be careful though – people have come at me a couple of times. On one occasion, when I was still shooting on film, the sound of my Olympus woke a guy I’d just photographed slumped across a machine, and he really wanted to fight me. There was no reasoning with him. I managed to dodge into a club and amazingly the velvet rope kept him at bay – he wouldn’t cross it.Nowadays I carry a small Fuji, but phone cameras have got good enough for me to use for stealth work. If I pick up my Nikon with its longer lens, it’s like I’m about to point a gun at someone. In the age of social media, people are much more suspicious of a photographer’s motives than they used to be, but I am a positive person and want the best for everybody. Someone described my work as documenting the fall of an empire in the deserts of Nevada, but I’m doing it with a sense of humour and a light touch.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ©Ellen FriedlanderMichael Rababy’s CVBorn:Ohio, 1969Trained:“Studied art history at the University of San Diego, spent many hours at the Museum of Photographic Arts bookstore in Balboa Park, and regularly snuck into film classes.

Users post clips with text saying things like: “If you hear this, you’re entering a new chapter. Expect blessings within 24h.”I wanted to be this lucky girl who gets everything she wishes for if only she follows these rituals properly. A part of me did it ironically, but a part of me truly felt it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHer StageFree monthly newsletterHear directly from incredible women from around the world on the issues that matter most to them – from the climate crisis to the arts to sportEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I created a mood board in my bedroom, covering the walls in printouts of affirmations I found online. Some of them were heartfelt, some of them came from meme pages that satirised the culture: “I am in my safe zone”; “I am not clenching my jaw right now”; “Angels are watching 333”; “I am light”; “CLICK to be saved”.I noticed these images of affirmations were usually paired with light orbs. These orbs look like how we want to feel: weightless, golden, gentle, magical, powerful and limitless. I wanted to create a theatre-like set where I could portray myself embodying different kinds of lucky girls – this is the yogi lucky girl who bends over backwards for luck.The Lucky Girl Syndrome project is an interrogation of the economy of hope where girls like me find solace in using our devices and bedrooms as portals to wellness and self improvement. But it’s also part of my wider body of work where I am interested in questioning who and what the female form exists to serve. Growing up in a culture where our beauty is our worth, so much so that cosmetic surgery is normalised but Catholic morality still dictates ideas of gender roles, family and sexuality, I became attuned to how online self-help culture repackages control as empowerment, especially for women.Isabella Madridis a Colombian artist and photographerExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen behind the lensWomen's rights and gender equalityTikTokPhotographyColombiaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From then, I had the confidence to make friends and travel moreDhruti ShahWed 2 Jul 2025 01.55 EDTShareAs I watched the sleek, white motorbike roll out of the hire shop in Thakhek, Laos, I wondered if I was making a dreadful mistake. It was March 2017 and I had agreed to go on a road trip with a stranger – an American named Travis, whom I had met a few weeks earlier. We were classmates on a Rotary International Peace Fellowship, which brought together people from sectors such as academia, farming and activism to learn about conflict resolution, in Thailand. I tended to have my guard up around people I didn’t know but Travis’s constant gentle efforts to get to know me had worked, and we bonded over a shared sense of humour. When he suggested weexplore Laos together, it felt like a natural progression of our budding friendship.Travis wanted to visit a climbing hotspot, I wanted to see the Laos that wasn’t on the typical tourist trail – and it seemed like the only way we could do both was to travel by motorbike, a mode of transport I actively avoided for many years.My leg scars became a reminder and I grew cautious about doing anything involving physical riskAs a kid in London, I’d thought I would become a biker once I was old enough. My dad would zip to work on his bike every day and it seemed like a perfectly natural way to travel. But on New Year’s Day 2004, I ended up in a Cambodian medical clinic while backpacking in the coastal province of Sihanoukville. A friend and I had been travelling by motorbike – me on the back – when it stalled and crashed to the ground. As we went down, my leg bounced three times on the hot exhaust pipe. At first, I was in shock. As I realised that the crisp smell of burning was emanating from my calf, I gasped; I went to scream but the pain was so intense that I couldn’t make a sound.I tried to get help from a pharmacy but the language barrier meant I was given pigment cream for the shining, pink flesh glaring through my brown skin. Eventually, my burns were cleaned and dressed, but the wound was deeper than I had realised and I was required to return to a clinic daily for the next fortnight. I didn’t Skype my parents for several days while I tried to assess the extent of my injuries. I vowed to wear more suitable, protective clothing when riding a motorbike in future but, once I was back in London, with so many other means of transport available, I found I was keen to avoid motorbikes altogether. The scars on my leg became a permanent reminder of the incident and I grew cautious about doing anything that involved an element of physical risk.By 2017, it had been more than a decade since I had ridden on a motorbike. Travis assured me that he had a licence and would drive safely. I looked down at the scars on my leg, took a deep breath and put on my helmet.View image in fullscreen‘Hanging out with 100 howling huskies’ … Dhruti in Syötteen Eräpalvelut, Finland, 2024.Photograph: Dhruti ShahI needn’t have worried. The journey was smooth as we travelled to stunning temples, expansive lakes, hidden caves and little cafes. I even attempted rock climbing. We rode in the dark, travelling through winding mountain roads to reach scenic nooks that we would never have otherwise encountered. It was a trip that imbued me with the confidence to connect more readily with strangers and to adventure more.After I returned from Laos, I started going on more solo trips, relying on a mix of gut instinct, due diligence and being open-minded to realise my travel dreams while also staying safe.Travis introduced me to his school friend, Jackie, who showed me around Boulder during my trip to Colorado. The ripple effect of connecting with strangers continued when I took a solo trip to Puerto Rico and Jackie introduced me to Eli, a mountaineer from the Colorado climbing scene who was living in Ciales. At my San Juan guesthouse, I met Jess, Kathryn and Matt, and about an hour later, we were all heading to Eli’s family’s forest farm, The Flying Coconut. There, we shared life stories over incredibly juicy homegrown fruit – an experience I would never have had if I’d not been willing to ask people to split costs and come on something of a magical mystery tour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since the buses into town weren’t so regular, I got on a bicycle and learned to cycle for the first time in heavy, falling snow. The feeling was euphoric. My friend Erika even organised a road trip with a photographer named Teija early one dark morning so that I could fulfil a long-term desire to hang out with 100 howling huskies at Syötteen Eräpalvelut.From Travis to Teija, and with all of the many others in-between, I’ve realised that what these trips have in common is a willingness to step out of my comfort zone and forge valuable connections with people I don’t know. By opening up a little bit more each time, it has led to endless adventures – and turned many of my dreams into reality.Bear Markets and Beyond: A Bestiary of Business Termsby Dhruti Shah and Dominic Bailey(Portico) is available nowExplore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meTravelling solofeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a thick, delicious frittata-like mixture of courgettes, leeks, peas, herbs and eggs, and in Palestine it’s often made with finely chopped onions, too. I always keep a couple of tins offul(fava beans) in my pantry for those times when I crave a quick and satisfying late breakfast or weekend lunch. When simple toast and butter won’t do the trick and I’m in need of something more substantial and savoury, that’s when fava beans come to the rescue.Aubergine and fava beans with eggs (bitinjan w ful ma’ beyd; pictured top)You can substitute the eggs with feta for an extra-creamy and salty touch. Alternatively, the dish works beautifully as a vegan dish without the eggs. If fava beans aren’t available, you can easily substitute them with other tinned beans. Make sure to season the beans generously and serve them with fresh crusty bread or flatbread. This is a truly filling and satisfying meal that never fails to impress.Prep15 minSteepOvernightCook50 minServes4For the sumac onions1 large red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced1½ tbsp sumac100ml apple cider vinegar3 tbsp lemon juiceSaltFor the aubergines, beans and eggs2 medium aubergines(about 630g)80ml olive oil, plus extra to serveSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and finely chopped (175g)6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 small piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated (20g)1 green chilli, finely chopped, seeds and all (20g)1 tsp chilli flakes1 tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground cinnamon1½ tsp tomato paste2 plum tomatoes, chopped into 2cm chunks (300g)400g tin chopped tomatoes400g tin fava beans, drained15g fresh coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra to serve4 large eggs30g sumac onions(see above and method)For the sumac onions: pack the sliced onion into a 400ml jar for which you have a lid. Add the sumac and set aside. Put the vinegar, 100ml water, lemon juice and a tablespoon of salt in a medium bowl and whisk until the salt dissolves. Pour the vinegar mixture over the onions, cover and give them a gentle shake. The onions are ready to eat the next day, though they’ll keep in the fridge for up to three weeks.Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Cut the aubergines into 4cm chunks and put in a large bowl. Mix well with 40ml oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then spread out on a large oven tray lined with baking paper. Roast for 25 minutes, or until very soft and lightly browned, then remove from the oven and set aside.Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put the remaining oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute for about seven minutes, until soft and lightly browned. Add the garlic, ginger, green chilli, chilli flakes, spices and tomato paste, and cook for another minute, or until fragrant.Add the chopped tomatoes, tinned tomatoes, fava beans, 300ml water, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper, turn down the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, or until thickened.Add the aubergine chunks and cook for a further three minutes. Stir in the coriander, then turn down the heat to medium-low. Make four wells in the sauce and crack an egg into each well. Gently swirl the egg whites with a fork a little bit, taking care not to break the yolks. Simmer gently for seven or eight minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Cover the pan with a lid for the last few minutes, to speed things up.Leave to settle and cool for a couple of minutes, then garnish with the sumac onions, coriander, a drizzle of olive oil and a little salt on the eggs.Courgette and leekijeh(Arabic frittata)View image in fullscreenSami Tamimi’s courgette and leekijeh.Good with chopped salad,shattaand warm bread.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4–6250g frozen peas, defrosted2 courgettes(300g)1 small onion(150g)1 large leek, trimmed, finely chopped, washed and dried (175g)50g plain flour15g fresh parsley, finely chopped10g fresh mint leaves, thinly shredded1¼ tsp dried mint1 tsp aleppo chilli flakes, or regular chilli flakes½tsp ground turmeric1 tsp dill or fennel seeds, slightly crushed3 large eggs, lightly beatenSalt and black pepper3 tbsp olive oilLemon wedges, to serveSoured cream, to servePut the peas in a food processor and blitz for a few seconds until slightly crushed but not mushy. Transfer to a large bowl.Trim the courgettes and peel the onion, then, using the coarse side of a box grater, grate both on to a clean tea towel or muslin. Gather up the ends of the towel and twist hard over a bowl to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Add the grated courgettes and onion to the peas, then add the leek, flour, herbs, spices, eggs, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well to form a uniform batter.Put a large (28cm) shallow nonstick pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the ijeh mixture, smoothing it down to make an even patty. Partly cover the pan, then leave to cook on a low heat for about 17 minutes, shaking the pan a few times to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom and running a rubber spatula around the sides.When the edges start to go golden brown, get a large flat plate and place it over the pan. Carefully invert the pan, plate and all, so the ijeh ends up on the plate, then slide it back into the pan uncooked side down and cook uncovered for 15 minutes more, until it is firm and cooked through.To serve, slide the ijeh on to a platter, squeeze over a little lemon juice and serve with lemon wedges and soured cream on the side.Palestinian egg and chips (Batata w beyd)View image in fullscreenSami Tamimi’sbatata w beyd(AKA Palestinian-style egg and chips).This is the Palestinian equivalent of egg and chips, and is commonly enjoyed as a hearty and comforting meal. It’s a simple yet fulfilling dish, made with basic ingredients. Batata w beyd is often served as a main course, accompanied by sides of chopped vegetables, pickles, shatta and bread. Perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner, its simplicity makes it a popular choice for home cooks.Prep5 minCook45 minServes44 large potatoes(1.15kg)4 tbsp sunflower oil, plus 1 tsp extra for the onions30g butterSalt and black pepper2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped (300g)8 medium eggs1½ tsp sumac2 tbsp fresh parsley, roughly chopped2 tbsp fresh oregano leavesOlive oilPeel the potatoes and cut them into 1½cm cubes. Heat the sunflower oil and butter in a very large frying pan, add the potato cubes, a teaspoon of salt and three-quarters of a teaspoon of ground black pepper, then cook, stirring a few times, on a medium-high heat, for 17 minutes, or until the potatoes are crisp, golden brown on the outside and soft within. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl.Using the same pan, lower the heat to medium, then add the remaining teaspoon of sunflower oil and the onion, and cook, stirring, for about five minutes, until the onion is soft and light golden. Return the potatoes to the pan and stir a couple of times.Crack in the eggs and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until they are cooked through, but the yolks are still slightly runny. If you like, cover the pan with a lid for the last few minutes to speed up the process.Sprinkle with a bit more salt, the sumac and the herbs, finish with a final drizzle of olive oil and serve.This is an edited extract from Boustany: A Celebration of Vegetables from my Palestine, by Sami Tamimi, published by Ebury Press at £30.

The older I get, the more I know it. When I was 20, I could sleep anywhere: a friend’s floor, a filthy sofa – even a phone box one night. These days, I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today’s best mattresses promise all this and more. Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double and a sprung king size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium-firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.The in-vogue bed brands tend not to have showrooms, so you can’t normally try out their mattresses before you buy. Instead, they vacuum-shrink them in the factory for delivery straight to your door. These bed-in-a-box mattresses come with long trials, but you’re still buying blind. I’ve tried to shed some light on which are the best by trying them out for you.The best bedding brands interior designers use at home, from luxury linen to cool cottonRead moreI, along with a panel of my family members, tested seven bestselling bed-in-a-box mattresses. Among them were two pocket-sprung models and five hybrids (which combine memory foam with other materials), covering various degrees of firmness, features and price tags. I’ll test more – including at least one all-foam mattress – in the coming months. Meanwhile, here’s how my family got on with our top picks, including the one my dad gave up on and the one my niece didn’t want to give back.At a glanceBestmattress overall:Otty Original HybridFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProFrom £799 (single) to £1,399 (super king) at SimbaBest budget mattress:Ikea ValevågFrom £149 (single) to £359 (super king) at IkeaWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products, from mattress toppers toheated clothes airers, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I welcomed the chance to sleep on the job.How I testedView image in fullscreenBalancing a glass of water on the mattresses tested their motion isolation abilities.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFirst, I needed some sleepers. I wanted a broad range of feedback from people of varying sizes who sleep in various positions. I asked my dad (84), my niece (22), my sister and our husbands to join my mattress panel. We each spent at least a fortnight (and sometimes months) sleeping on an allocated mattress.Before we divvied them up, my panel assembled to offer their impressions of every mattress on test. I turned my house into a mattress showroom, invited everyone over and asked them to sit, bounce and lie down on every test sample, alone and together. This enabled us to compare the mattresses side by side and get an overview of their pros and cons. I collected scores out of 10 for everyone’s assessment of firmness and other factors such as breathability, motion isolation and overall comfort, then worked out our average score for each mattress.We then divided the mattresses and began the sleeping tests. To quantify sleep quality, I used thePittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which uses a questionnaire to assess factors such as how long it takes to nod off. I used this as the basis and added questions such as whether they felt back pain or woke up in the night. Some of us also used our smartwatches to gather sleep-tracking stats.View image in fullscreenWeights measured any sinking of the mattresses.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOther factors were easier to test on my own. I used dumbbell weights to measure how far each mattress sank under various weights, while an infrared thermometer and heat pad revealed how fast they could cool under a warm body. A glass of water on the surface gave an idea of how well the mattress would absorb the movement of a restless partner (“motion isolation”).Environmental credentials were another important consideration. Mattress makers are secretive about the life cycles of their products, but I discovered what I could about the materials used, their manufacture and their potential for recycling. I also checked verified reviews from paying customers and excluded any mattresses for which delivery and customer service received significant negative feedback.Read on for my guide to the best mattresses, based on these thorough tests.The mattresses sourced for this article are being donated to two charities: Southampton-based poverty support groupScratchand Hampshire-based survivors’ advocacy organisationStop Domestic Abuse.To dive deeper in to my testing process, readhow I tested mattresses for comfort, cost and sustainabilityThe best mattresses you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Wonderfully breathable’: the Ikea Valevåg.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBestmattress overall:Otty Original HybridView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyOtty’s flagship offering is a firm but cosy and supremely comfortable mattress that helped me sleep fantastically from the first night of testing. The only other one that managed this was the Simba Hybrid Pro, which is hundreds of pounds more expensive.Why we love itThe Otty has an outstanding balance of support, cushioning and breathability. My husband and I slept on it for two months and were sad to see it go. It feels ergonomically supportive from edge to edge, with no dip in the middle even after several weeks.It’s not too hard for comfort, though. As a small side sleeper, I get lower back pain on very firm mattresses, but this didn’t happen with the Otty. My sleep tracker also revealed that I woke up briefly in the night (“microarousals”) less often than usual. The surface felt breathable and cooled down faster than most other hybrids in my heat-retention tests.When I asked my family to dive in, they put the Otty fourth overall on firmness – squarely at the firm end of the wide medium-firm spectrum – and gave it the highest rating for overall comfort, with an average of 8.3/10.It’s a shame that …the firmness we loved won’t be welcomed by everyone. If you’re upgrading from a well-used pocket-sprung mattress, the strong flat surface of the Otty may take some adapting to.Suitable for:anyone who wants to upgrade to a hybrid without forking out four figuresType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 8/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first 12 months, then every three monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPur- and Europur-approved for environmental standardsTo find out more, read our fullOtty Original Hybrid mattress reviewBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £799 (single) to £1,399 (super king) at SimbaThis sumptuous mattress also had me sleeping soundly from the off. It’s expensive, and won’t be firm enough for some, but its wonderfully comfy surface makes you feel like you’re sleeping on a cloud – and it may even bring peace if you share your bed with a fidgety partner (or the dog, or the kids).Why we love itThe medium-firm Simba Hybrid Pro is supportive enough for most people, but it has a cosy, yielding feel that may be down to its upper layer of natural wool. The overall effect is luxurious and decidedly soporific.The Hybrid Pro had the best motion isolation in my test. The mattress doesn’t completely lack bounce, especially on a slatted base, but its foam layers absorb movement so well that it genuinely helped me and my husband sleep through each other’s tossing and turning.Temperature regulation was less impressive, and I wanted to disown my armpits a few times after waking up. The mattress also softened noticeably in the middle after several weeks of testing, but this is common with hybrids and may be welcomed by sleepers who like the way foam adapts to our bodies over time.Our panel’s collective firmness score was 7/10, and our comfort average was an excellent 8.1/10, although my husband and sister found it a bit too soft.It’s a shame that …the price tag is chunky, especially for a mattress that may not maintain its support consistently enough for firm-bed fans.Suitable for:couples who crave a bit of peace (but still want to share a bed)Type:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 7/10Depth:28cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first three months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030.

It’s not a hybrid but instead wraps its pocket springs in slim layers of polyfoam for cushioning. It feels much less robust than its pricier rivals, but it’d be a great choice for the kids or the spare room.Why we love itSimplicity has its benefits. The Valevåg expanded to full size faster than the hybrids and was much lighter. Finally, a mattress I could lift and manoeuvre by myself, including up and down stairs.For similar reasons, Ikea’s mattress is wonderfully breathable and may feel cooler in summer than a hybrid. With no memory foam to trap heat, it cooled down faster than any other mattress in my temperature-control test. Hi-tech open-cell foam is all very well for letting the air circulate, but plain old springs do the same for a lot less cash.My 22-year-old niece, Alex, slept on the Valevåg for two months and was energetically reluctant to give it back. She said it felt supportive enough without being “solid like some of the others”.It’s a shame that …the Valevåg doesn’t hide its cheapness. Our average firmness score was 6.8/10, which barely qualifies for “medium firm” (although Ikea does make a “firm” version). The bounce of the springs also means motion isolation is poor.Suitable for:young buyers starting out, or for a guest roomType:pocket sprungFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 6.8/10Depth:24cmCover:not removableTurn or rotate:not neededTrial period:365 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40 via theMattress Recycling PeopleSustainability credentials:2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foamsTo find out more, read our fullIkea Valevåg mattress reviewThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation’: the Origin Hybrid Pro.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £549.95 (single) to £1,459.95 (super king zip and link) at Mattress OnlineFrom £549.98 (single) to £1,119.98 (super king) at The RangeBest for:keeping cool on hot summer nightsThis is the only true pocket-sprung mattress in our roundup. A layer of UK-sourced wool just below the sleeping surface adds a slightly spongy feel, but there’s no memory foam in here, and the mattress is double-sided. Once it starts to soften, which happens fairly quickly, you can flip it to get the fresh, cool firmness of the other side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Initially, I loved its robust, traditional feel and liked the way its tufted surface allowed the air to circulate in the way modern hybrids often don’t. I often struggle with night sweats, and the breathable surface and wool layer genuinely helped me dial down the sogginess.The Millbrook doesn’t offer much in the way of motion isolation, however. Its bounciness amplified my husband’s and my tossing and turning – we’re both hit-and-miss sleepers. Another issue to emerge over the weeks was a surprising level of softening, even on my side of the bed (strange considering I’m smaller than your nan). Flipping the mattress made it feel lovely and supportive again, but we were disappointed to have to do this after just four weeks of sleeping.It didn’t make the final cut because …initially, this mattress offers plenty of support, but it needs flipping after just a few weeks. It’s also a little too bouncy for couples who want to sleep in peace.Type:pocket sprung;firmness:advertised as medium to firm, we rated as 8.5/10 then 7/10;depth:28cm;cover:not removable;turn:“regularly”;trial:60 nights;warranty:10 years;old mattress recycling:£35 with Mattress Online if you buy a new mattress;sustainability:Millbrook Beds uses fabrics and fillings “from sustainable sources”; no memory foam or chemical treatments used; Planet Mark certifiedOrigin Hybrid ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £523 (single) to £833 (super king) at OriginBest for:couples who both love a firm orthopaedic mattressOrigin claims its Hybrid Pro is “medium firm”, but it is nothing of the sort and instead came top in all my measures of firmness. If, like my sister Maeve and her husband, Ben, you crave the strong pushback of a solid mattress, you will love it. Lucky for them, they got to test it for two months.This gigantic, heavy hybrid also delivers outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation. Maeve and Ben reported that the “silky surface with long dents” kept them cool without feeling cold, and after years on a pocket-sprung mattress, they declared its movement-absorbing powers to be “life changing”.It didn’t make the final cut because …this level of firmness is too hard for many, including me.

It has a solid central section that’s firmer on one side than the other, so you flip it (with a little effort) to select your level of firmness. You then zip on a thick, spongy “comfort layer” – much like a mattress topper – on whichever side you choose.My weight tests and family feedback revealed the two sides to be disappointingly similar. Both were too soft for Maeve and Ben, who slept on this mattress for a fortnight before switching to the much firmer Origin. Their daughter Alex tried it out and also found it too soft, as did my husband.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreI liked the Wunderflip much more than my family did. Its supportive base layers provide strong, consistent pushback beneath the cushioned top layer, especially when you choose the “firmer” side. The foamy cushioning is brilliant at absorbing movement, and it all feels extremely robust.It didn’t make the final cut because …the “flip for firmness” idea doesn’t really work, because both sides are similarly soft – perhaps because the removable “comfort layer” is so soft. The hulking weight (more than 50kg for a double) makes it tricky to manoeuvre. Better to pick a side and stick with it.Type:hybrid;firmness:advertised as medium on one side and firm on the other, panel rated as 4.3 and 6.5 respectively;depth:28cm;cover:not removable;rotate:once a month for first 12 months, then every three months;trial:200 nights;warranty:10 years;old mattress recycling:£50;sustainability:foam is CertiPur approved and CFC/PBDE-free; cover is Oeko-Tex certifiedPanda Hybrid BambooView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £649 (single) to £1,050 (EU emperor) at Panda LondonBest for:couples who sleep on their sides, and anyone who overheats at nightThis fabulous-looking hybrid excels at motion isolation and temperature regulation, and its naturally hypoallergenic bamboo yarn cover may help limit morning sneezes. Its high-density foam makes it feel very firm at first, but over weeks of testing, it softened significantly without ever feeling saggy.I had allocated the Panda to my dad for the sleep test, but he couldn’t get on with it, describing it as “hard on my joints”. It felt too firm for me at first, too. But this mattress is a great illustration of why you shouldn’t judge memory foam too quickly. It adapted to become a cosy sleeping surface for me and my husband.It didn’t make the final cut because …the softening means it’s hard to judge whether it’s right for you.

Instead of packing a takeaway in a plastic box and whizzing it to your door, companies such as Otty, Eve and Simba shrink their mattresses into metres and metres of plastic and deliver them to your home.Is it necessary? No, but like Deliveroo, it’s convenient. The downside is that you’re left with an awful lot of packaging. I mean, ahideousamount. Your recycling collection may take the huge cardboard boxes, but in most areas (including mine), they won’t take the huge volume of plastic wrapping. You’ll have to take it to a household waste centre – unless you’re redecorating and need a dust sheet.Bed-in-a-box companies don’t have showrooms, so they let you sleep on your new mattress for months before you have to decide whether to keep it. My experience of these trials has been fairly smooth, with Otty and Emma both collecting mattresses and issuing refunds quickly. However, neither team was directly employed by the brands (only Ikea sent a branded van when delivering), and the Emma team didn’t know what they were collecting.No delivery team offered to take away my old mattress. Most brands offer to recycle old mattresses for a fee of about £50, but you have to organise that in addition to ordering your new mattress. It also seems expensive given that my local council’s recycling team collects mattresses for £20.Bed-in-a-box warranties typically cover 10 years. That’s excellent, but you’ll have to be careful you don’t void your guarantee by, for example, standing on the mattress or using an electric blanket (as foam can soften and even crack under too much heat).How do I know it’s a good deal?It’sBlack Fridayall year round in mattress world. Bed-in-a-box companies seem to regard “sale” prices as the rule rather than the exception, andSimba,EmmaandDormeohave all been sanctioned by the ASA for misleading marketing tactics.There are genuine deals to be found, however.

Free appAnytrackeris less quick but delivers richer results, including alerts when your desired mattress meets your desired price.How to clean a mattressHere are a few stats to help you sleep at night: the average mattress contains between 1.5 million and 10 million dust mites, depending on whom you believe. These mites feast on dead skin cells, of which you shed up to 40,000 a minute, and thrive on moisture, of which you leak about a pint a night. “Up to 10% of the weight of an old pillow could be made up of dust mite faeces,” sayresearchers from UCL. Sweet dreams.The war on dust mite poo begins with a good mattress protector and clean sheets, which you should change about once a week. A zip-off washable cover, as featured on many of our best mattresses, including theOtty Original HybridandSimba Hybrid Pro, is another key line of defence against grossness. Just make sure all these covers are fully dry after washing, because the last thing you want to do is get more moisture into the mattress. That will lead to mould – and you really do not want to share your bed withmould spores.With all the covers removed for washing, get out thevacuum cleaner. Vacuum every surface of the mattress, including the bottom if it’s one-sided, and get the nozzle into any nooks and crannies. While you’re at it, rotate the mattress from head to toe to keep it as sag-free as possible, or turn it if it’s two-sided. Now let your mattress air for a while, with an open window if the weather allows. You could even make like the Germans do and hang your duvet out to air for a few hours. Just remember that while fresh air can help dissipate smells, it also lets in allergens, so it’s worth vacuuming your mattress again before you put all the freshly cleaned elements back together again.If there are no stains or spillages on the mattress, that’s as far as you should go. But if there’s been a bed-wetting accident or breakfast-in-bed mishap, use a dry, clean sponge to mop up as much liquid as possible. The aim is to ensure no moisture soaks in. Recent blood, sweat or urine stains can be tackled by dabbing with a little cold water and washing-up liquid (don’t rub; this can spread the stain). Don’t spray carpet cleaner on the mattress because it will damage the fabric, but upholstery cleaner is safe in small doses. If there’s a smell, sprinkle baking soda over the whole surface of the mattress and leave it for several hours, then vacuum it thoroughly.How often should you replace a mattress?Your mattress is likely to need replacing after seven to eight years, according to organisations including theSleep FoundationandBed Advice UK. “After that time, your mattress will have had around four bathtubs of sweat applied to it,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science atMattress Online. “Dust, dead skin cells and other matter will also collect in the mattress, making it unhygienic.”That may be true, but most of the mattresses we reviewed come with 10-year warranties, and one – the Origin Hybrid Pro – even stretches to 15, so seven years seems short. Do I smell a mattress industry trying to sell me a new bed before I really need it? Surely it’s more environmentally and financially responsible to hang on to a mattress until it’s falling apart? Maybe, but studies suggest it’s not good for your health or your sleep.The cocktail of bacterial sleep goo that leaches into a mattress under the weight of at least one human every night eats away at its springs, fillings and foam. The result is a lumpy surface that loses its comfort and support. Support is key whenchoosing a mattress– without it, you’ll suffer all manner of maladies, including back pain, aching shoulders and poor sleep. One US study tracked a cohort of men and women with minor sleep-related pain, and whose beds were an average of nine-and-a-half years old. Switching to new, medium-firm mattresses resulted in “significant improvements” in their back pain and sleep quality.The seven-year switch is not an exact science, though. Mattress durability varies widely, and some mattresses made using high-quality materials such as natural latex can have a lifespan of up to 20 years, according to UK mattress company Latex Sense. Rather than assume your mattress will need replacing in seven years, learn the signs to look for.Sagging and failing springs are the most obvious signs it’s time for a new mattress. Others are that you wake up sneezing, feel your partner moving in bed more than you used to, and feel the bed giving way when you sit on the side. “One of the best signs is that you sleep better elsewhere,” says Shore. “If you sleep significantly better in a hotel bed, it’s probably a sign that your mattress at home needs replacing.”A few provisos, though. One thing I’ve learned from sleep-testing more than a dozen mattresses over the years is that a new bed can mess up your sleep for the first couple of nights, especially if you’re used to a much softer surface. Your body needs to adjust to being supported properly. Bear in mind that even the firmest foam layers soften quite a bit over the first few months, so give your new bed a chance – and take advantage of free trials if you don’t get on with it.Also, take mattress companies up on their recycling offers. At about £40-£50, these services cost more than kerbside council collections, but they guarantee your old bed will be disposed of responsibly and not simply chucked intolandfill.Jane Hoskyn is aconsumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

When I’ve finisheda jar, how can I use the brine in my cooking?Geoff, SheffieldLast year,Dua Lipapoured Diet Coke into an ice-filled glass, topped it up with the brine from both a tub of pickles (plus a few rogue pickles) and a tub of jalapeños, swirled it around, then drank it. While someone underthe viral TikTok videoasked, “Dua, is everything OK?”, the pop star is right about one thing: it’s time we start thinking of pickle brine as an ingredient, rather than a byproduct.“The brine retains all of that delicious pickle flavour,” says Moon Lee, head chef of no-waste restaurantSiloin London, “and a mixture of sweet and savoury undertones”. Also, because it’s fermented, “it has an almost tangy, kombucha-like taste, too. I’m from Korea, and we always make use of kimchi juice, whether in a dressing, as a seasoning for noodles or in pancake batter. Why can’t pickle brine have the same potential?”Good point well made, but what does that mean in practice? “We’ve previously combined cucumber with pickle brine and cold-pressed rapeseed oil, then topped it with chopped shallots that have been marinated in salt and sugar,” Moon says; she reckons the same approach would work a treat with wild fennel, especially.Meanwhile, pickle brine also “makes a great seasoning”, says Stuart Ralston, executive chef and owner ofAizle,Lyla,NotoandTipo, all in Edinburgh, and will put some pucker into your potatoes: “A few spoonfuls of pickle brine will make a potato salad, for example, more interesting.” Alternatively, combine 150ml each of vegetable oil and olive oil with 110ml pickle brine, 60g dijon mustard and 5g chopped fresh oregano, then “adjust the seasoning, if need be, but that won’t be far off”. Use that to dress a roast chicken, Ralston says, to serve with boiled potatoes and crisp salad leaves.Otherwise, Ralston might use the stuff to brine a chicken – “give it a few hours to make the bird more tender and retain moisture” – while the Guardian’s own zero-waste correspondent, Tom Hunt, uses it tobrine pork chopsfor similar reasons: “Pickle juiceis brimming with flavour and salt, which is exactly what’s needed to make the most flavourful pork chop out there.” Put your chop or chops in a tub in which they’ll fit snugly, then pour over the pickle juice: “Ideally enough to submerge the chop, but even a small amount will work wonders.” Leave to marinate for three hours, and ideally overnight, then, when you’re ready to cook, “lift the chops from the brine, pat dry with a clean towel and cook using your preferred method”.Of course, spent pickle brine can also simply be used to pickle something else, Moon says: “It’s a common fermentation technique known as ‘backslopping’. Keep a small amount of used brine and add it to a new batch to accelerate the pickling process.”That said, if you want to channel your inner Dua Lipa and down some pickle brine, instead, Ralston reckons it’s probably best to hold the cola: “When I lived in America, I’d often have a bloody mary at brunch, and a few splashes of gherkin brine, say, really give it a kick.” That’s not a bad way to get yourself out of a pickle.Got a culinary dilemma?

Each element corresponds to a colour and an organ in the body (earth, for example, is yellow and linked to the spleen). Years ago, Hayley made me the most deliciously vibrant and earthy bright-red dip from kale, and today’s recipe is a homage to her nourishing, elemental approach, while also saving scraps from the bin.Rainbow vegetable scrap dipsI love the adage “eat the rainbow”. Yes, it’s a bit corny, but it works, and sometimes the simplest advice is really the best. Eating a variety of colourful plants increases nutrient diversity, which supports a healthy gut. These dips are a vibrant, low-waste way to add colour, fibre and flavour to your plate by using up whatever’s already in the fridge or even destined for the compost bin.These dips can be as simple as just blending leftover boiled carrots with white beans, olive oil and lemon juice to create a bright orange spread, but here I’ve gone all in with vegetable scraps to prove a point: real discards such as pepper tops, radish greens and beetroot peelings are not only edible, but, with the application of a little love and care, they can be absolutely delicious.My usual advice is not to peel vegetables at all, because it saves time and money, while retaining flavour and fibre. But if you do peel or trim, those scraps can still be saved and used. So, this is a blueprint rather than a strict recipe: each version follows the same base formula and can be adapted to whatever you have in the house. For a dinner party, I like to make a few different-coloured dips and serve them on a platter with crudites, rye bread or crackers.Here are the four combinations I made:Red – red pepper trimmings, red apple peel, cranberries, smoked paprika;Yellow – squash skins, sweet potato peel, carrot tops and tails, turmeric, orange zest, sesame;Green – broad bean pods, courgette tops, cucumber skin, coriander stalks, cardamom, cashew, pumpkin seeds;Purple – beetroot peel, red cabbage skin, dates, cumin, sumac.Base recipe (makes 1 batch, so multiply to make a rainbow)150g raw veg scraps(eg, pepper tops, beetroot peel, courgette ends, but choose one colour of vegetable per dip)130g cooked white beans(eg butter beans or cannellini), drained and liquid reserved2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 tbsp lemon juice, or vinegarSea salt, to tasteOptional extras and toppings (choose to suit your dip’s colour and flavour)1 small garlic clove, peeledUnwaxed citrus zest(lemon, lime, orange)2 tbsp tahini, or nuts2-4 dates, cranberries or goji berries1–2 tsp ground spices(smoked paprika, cumin, turmeric, coriander, za’atar)Soft herb stalks and/or leaves(eg. mint, coriander, parsley), for toppingChilli flakes, or chopped fresh chilliToasted seeds, or dukkah or chopped herbs, to serveSteam or blanch the vegetable leftovers or clean scraps for five minutes, sticking to one colour of vegetable per dip. Tip the steamed vegetables into a high-speed blender, add the cooked white beans, extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt, then add a splash of the reserved bean liquid to help blend smoothly.Depending on your choice of scraps and desired flavour, add any optional extras that will enhance the flavour and colour – garlic, citrus zest for punch, tahini or nuts for richness, dates, cranberries or dried apricots for sweetness, as well as ground spices and chilli flakes for red heat.Blitz to a smooth, hummus-like consistency, adding more bean liquid if required, then taste and adjust for seasoning, as well as to balance the acidity, richness and sweetness. Serve as a dip or spread, topped with toasted seeds, chopped herbs or dukkah, if you like. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesWaste notFoodFood wasteSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fennel seeds in the buttery pastry give a subtle flavour surprise, although you could omit them, or try coriander seeds or ginger instead. A small batch of jam is surprisingly quick to make, but you can, of course, use shop-bought, or make use of one of those jars living rent-free in your cupboard. Then, a summer pudding-inspired cake that makes a delightful centrepiece – the juices from the berries absorb into the top third of the sponge, giving it a gorgeous, ombre tone that looks as beautiful as it tastes.Summer pudding tray cakeUse a mixture of whatever berries are plentiful; frozen will work well, too.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 min, plus coolingChill1 hrServes8For the sponge3 large eggs20g vegetable oil40gwhole milk120g caster sugar100gplain flour1½ tspbaking powderA pinch of flaky saltFor the soak550g mixed berries, fresh or frozen and defrosted100g caster sugarFor the cream300mldoublecream30gcaster sugar(optional, depending on how sweet the fruit is)Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line a 20cm square tin.Separate the eggs, and put the whites in the bowl of a stand mixer, if you have one. Whisk the oil and milk into the yolks. Whisk the egg whites until foamy, then add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whipping on high speed until you have a stiff, glossy meringue.Whisk a quarter of the meringue into the yolks to lighten, then sift over half the flour and the baking powder, and fold in. Fold in half the remaining meringue, followed by the remaining flour. Finally, fold in the last of the meringue and a pinch of salt – the batter should be very airy.Pour into the lined tin and spread with a spatula. Gently tap the tin on a counter to burst any large air bubbles, then bake for 30 minutes, until golden and firm. Leave to cool completely, then take out of the tin and put it in a larger tray or serving tin. Poke holes all over the top with a skewer or fork.Meanwhile, in a saucepan, simmer the berries, sugar and 100g water for two to three minutes (eight minutes, if using frozen berries), until the berries release their juices. Strain, catching the juices in a bowl, then leave the juices to cool for 15–20 minutes (you should be able to dip in your finger comfortably). Set aside two tablespoons of juice to decorate, then pour the rest slowly all over the sponge, not forgetting the edges. Collect any juice pooled in the tray and pour it back over the sponge.Set aside 120g of the berry pulp, then spread the rest on top of the cake. Whip the cream and sugar to medium peaks, then gently fold in the reserved pulp to make a rippled effect. Save a few large berries for the top, then spread the cream over the sponge, and drizzle on the reserved syrup and berries. Chill for at least an hour before serving.Jammy shortbread tartView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s jammy shortbread tart.Prep5 minChill30 min+Cook1 hrServes8For the quick berry jam300g mixed berries(frozen are fine)150gcaster sugar30g lemon juiceFor the shortbread dough1½ tsp fennel seeds80g light brown sugar120g room-temperature butter, plus extra for greasing1 egg(about 50g)240gplain flour½ tspbaking powder½ tspflaky saltTo finish (optional)Demerara sugarFennel seedsCreme fraiche or yoghurt,to servePut the jam ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil on a medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until glossy and thick, then test the set: put a teaspoon of jam on a small plate, pop it in the freezer for two minutes, and it should form a skin that wrinkles when you drag a finger through it, without refilling the gap. If not, cook the jam for another two minutes and retest. Pour into a clean container, leave to cool, then seal and store in the fridge.For the shortbread, blitz the fennel seeds and sugar in a blender until fine (or crush the fennel in a mortar, then mix with the sugar). Mix in the butter for a minute or two, until combined and somewhat airy, then mix in the egg. Stir in the dry ingredients until the mix comes together into a soft dough, then wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or overnight.When you are ready to bake, remove the dough from the fridge and let it soften to room temperature (you can knead it a bit to warm it up). Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and grease a 23-24cm fluted tart tin with butter.Set a quarter of the dough aside, then press the rest evenly into the base and sides of the tin. Now spread 200-250g of the jam on top (save any excess for porridge or toast). Pinch off little pieces of shortbread from the reserved dough, and use these to cover the jam, leaving a few small spaces for it to peep through. Sprinkle with demerara sugar and fennel seeds, then bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden – the jam should be bubbling in places.Once cool enough to handle, take the tart out of its tin and leave to cool before serving with a spoon of creme fraiche or yoghurt, if desired.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.

If you need to explain it twice, it’s probably too vague or complicated.”Beyond explaining what the project is, why it matters and who will benefit, and giving an initial estimate of how much it will cost, try to tell a story.“Rather than saying: ‘We want to improve the local park,’ it’s much more powerful to say: ‘Local families want to turn an overgrown park into an imaginative space where children can learn about food and nature.’ That way, you create a story, and a future that potential backers can really buy in to and see themselves getting involved in, so then they are more likely to want to support it,” Dhanak says.Build your crowd firstSuccessful fundraisers do not usually start with strangers. Most early backers come from personal and local networks – friends, family, neighbours, parents at the school gate, and so on.Once you have the support of your close circle, try sharing your idea in community WhatsApp groups and local Facebook pages.This helps get the word out and ensure you are “making as much noise about it as possible,” Dhanak says.The team you work with tends to come from this initial group, and people may have expertise, or want to offer to help. For Daniel Jones, the chair of Myddleton Road Community Benefit Society, his small “team of doers” was key to successfully raising funds to turn a former bar/restaurant in Bowes Park, north London, into a community venue calledThe Hillbilly Social.“You’re going to face a lot of challenges, and you’re going to need the right team of people to get through them, so a relatively small team of doers with perseverance is useful, with a mix of skills,” he says.Dhanak says knowing your strengths, and playing to them, is vital: “If you’re really good at planning and building out the budget but you’re not as confident with marketing, find someone in your community that can support you with that. If there’s a lot of planning permission, you could find a local architect to support you as well,” she says.Leaning on people who have successfully fundraised for similar projects is also a good place to start.However, you don’t need to be an expert on a topic to give it a go. “Just because you haven’t done it before doesn’t mean it’s impossible – you just haven’t done it before. About 65% of people that use Spacehive have no fundraising experience. They’ve never done anything like this before,” says Dhanak.Use offline supportNot everyone is online or active on social media. Posters in cafes, flyers through doors and conversations at local events can reach people who could otherwise miss your project.“Social media is obviously essential, but use your everyday networks, too – school newsletters, local exercise classes, the local choir, pub, noticeboards and library pinboards,” says Dhanak.Create a story, and a future, that potential backers can really buy into, and can see themselves getting involved inMisha Dhanak, Chief executive, SpacehiveJones’s project started with surveys at a local monthly market to gauge interest, as well as a post on a local Facebook group. The positive response they received gave the team the confidence to continue. “We just went out and got a little market stall with some flyers and a few volunteers, talking to people about what we were looking to do and handing them a flyer to ask them to fill in the survey online.“After a couple of weeks we had pledges from probably a couple of hundred local people for [a total of] £120,000. So we thought: ‘OK, this idea has got some legs.’”This kind of face-to-face contact builds trust and enthusiasm, especially in close-knit communities. “Our surveys really helped to make sure we carried people with us, and we could say all the way along, ‘we’re doing what the community wants’,” Jones adds.Think about your structureIf it is a straightforward community group run by volunteers to (for example) improve your local area, does not involve a huge budget, or require staff to be employed or premises to be leased, then an unincorporated association is likely to be the structure for you,says the Resource Centre, a charity serving voluntary and community groups in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex.“This is a simple structure you can set up yourself, without registering with anyone. All you need to do is write and agree a constitution,” it adds.However, more and more local community organisations are forming, or converting into, community benefit societies, says Co-operatives UK, a federation that represents and supports thousands of co-ops across the country.This is a legal structure for organisations that want to operate on a not-for-profit basis for purposes that benefit the community as a whole, it says. Often they use this model to raise finance via a community share issue. This is where locals and others are able to invest in the project by buying shares.Organisations such as theFinancial Conduct AuthorityandCo-operatives UKpublish information on their websites on setting up a community benefit society.Pick the right platformThere are lots of crowdfunding sites out there, and picking the right one for your project could mean the difference between getting it off the ground or not. Some, such as Spacehive, can offer advice throughout the process, while others, such as GoFundMe, help you track donations.“The platform you choose becomes an extension of your idea, in a sense,” Dhanak says.If you think you would benefit from more hands-on support, keep that in mind when you pick. It is also worth considering whether the platform you select has access to potential funding from partners, councils or businesses.“When someone is thinking about backing a project, if they see an organisation they recognise – their local council, or a brand name that they know – it gives the whole thing a huge amount of confidence that it’s going to happen,” says Dhanak.However, some platforms take a percentage of what you raise, so Jones says you need to keep this in mind.“There’s no need to spend money on expensive survey platforms. We hosted our online surveys with Google Forms, which is free.“When it came to the fund-raising, we considered some of the well-known funding platforms. We found that with their processing fees, the cost would be about 2.5% to 3% of the total funds raised, which was a significant amount, as we raised more than £280,000.“Instead, we built a simple website and signed up to Stripe – an online payment processing platform – for securely processing card and one-off direct debit payments, with much lower fees.”He adds: “We also encouraged large amounts to be sent by bank transfer. We saved more than £5,000 in fees by going down this route. Stripe held all the details we needed for more than 500 investors, which was essential.”Get funding such as grantsThere are lots of organisations and schemes out there that can potentially provide financial support in the form of grants or awards. You may want to try charities and trusts that are aligned with what you want to do.The website of the King’s Trust hasa useful list of some of these organisations.Applications to the co-op local community fundare now open– they must be submitted by midnight on 6 July. It is looking for new projects for its members to support. There is a £5m pot, and you can apply if you are a not-for-profit group that needs funding to deliver a specific project that will benefit your local community.Link with trusted partnersPartnering with community centres, local schools, councils, charities or businesses can increase your project’s credibility and resources. It shows that the project is well-connected and embedded in the community.Dhanak says that approaching potential partners with a clear idea of how your work will benefit the community, how you’ll work together and what each party will bring is essential.“You need to think about what your idea is delivering and who that will match to in terms of your local area. I would approach local businesses and community leaders for backing.”She adds: “You’re going to be adding value to the neighbourhood, so there are plenty of good reasons for them to add their support, whether that’s through donations or promotion or materials. Partners that are known in the local community can open new doors for you and increase credibility, so they can offer you more than just cash – they might have connections, spare capacity, items you need, volunteers or expertise that can be really valuable to your support your project.”She says local authorities are generally very receptive to supporting these ideas, and she advises looking into the different funds and schemes that are available.Approach potential partners with a clear idea of how you will work together and what each party will bring. Even a simple letter of support can help.Explore more on these topicsMoneyMoney hacksConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brides these days might be wearing black or red, hair up, hair down, hi-top trainers or Dr Martens boots. Similarly, bride-appropriate makeup is however one feels most attractive, comfortable, confident and oneself.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But what I will concede is that the big day often calls for a new foundation. Rarely will you be photographed as much, over so many hours, and be faced with the outcome for so many years, so it’s worth wearing something a little higher-coverage and longer-lasting than for a day at the office.Something semi-matte is ideal, since the opportunities to powder down shine will be scant and the risk of colour transfer on to a gown is higher with dewy formulas. My most commonly recommended is Lisa Eldridge’sSeamless Skin Foundation(£44), which comes in 40 thoughtfully chosen shades and gives a pretty eggshell sheen to the skin. I’ve never received any negative feedback after the big day.Similarly versatile is Dior’sForever Skin Perfect Foundation Stick(£48). If your bridesmaid has room in her bag for anything more than mints and a lipstick, fill it with this, an exceptional medium-coverage solid foundation that melts silkily upon blending, laminating the face in soft, blurry, lasting coverage that can be sheered down or dialled up according to taste. It’s also excellent for any fingertip touch-ups after the ceremony or wedding breakfast.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That price tag is hefty, but a very similar look is delivered byTrue Match Nude Plumping Tinted Serum(£14.99) from Armani stablemate, L’Oréal Paris.For problem skins where redness, acne or scarring are an issue, proceed directly to Estée Lauder for the peerlessly camouflagingDoubleWear Stay-in-place Foundation(£39.50), which not only builds up seamlessly to cover anything, but has phenomenal staying power (add setting spray and it could outlast some marriages).For oily skin types who’d like a soft matte finish with more vim, I enthusiastically recommend Anastasia Beverly Hills’Impeccable Blurring Second Skin Matte Foundation(£39, pictured above).

For over two centuries, coal from the mines of Durham and Northumberland was trundled down a maze of wagonways and rail lines to the coast to then be shipped to London.The mines are long gone, but eight miles north of Durham city, relics of the north-east’s industrial heritage can be found hidden amid ancient woodland and a steep-sided gorge.Beamish mapI’m familiar with parts of this area from childhood walks and teenage escapades, but my eight mile circular route connects key historical sites and finishes at a pub with links back to the Napoleonic wars.My journey into the past begins at Eden Place, a picnic area near the village of Beamish on the site of an old terrace of miners’ houses. I set off along a disused railway path, which until 1985 was a busy line linking the Consett steelworks with Sunderland. It is also part of the Irish Sea to North SeaC2C cycle routeso, in search of a bit of solitude, I transfer to a parallel track through the malevolent-sounding Hellhole woods. In fact, they are a delight as I stroll through patch after patch of pungent wild garlic in full flower.After wending its way across fields and a couple of roads, the route arrives atTanfield Railway– which claims to be the world’s oldest railway. Built in 1725 by the Grand Allies, an association of colliery-owning families, as a horse-drawn wagonway to carry coal from inland pits to the Tyne, it later became a rail line. Since it closed in 1964, enthusiasts have brought a three-mile section back to life, and vintage steam trains now shuttle visitors between East Tanfield station, where I am, and Marley Hill.View image in fullscreenThe stonemason who built Causey Arch turned to Roman technology for his design.Photograph: geordiepics/AlamyThe station houses a tearoom, while an engine shed displays old maps that show just how rail lines used to vein the area. It’s tempting to break off from my route and take the six-mile round trip by train to Marley Hill, but I’m keen to see the most dramatic part of the walk.A path from the car park, signposted to Causey Arch, leads into woods, and I’m soon walking along the top of a steep-sided gorge. Woodland has covered this area for centuries, and as I look down at the stream below in the gloom, it feels ridiculously remote – until the spell is broken by the hoot of a locomotive chugging along the other side of the gorge.About half an hour after leaving Tanfield, a huge bridge across the dene (valley) comes into view. This isCausey Arch, which a noticeboard proudly announces is the oldest surviving single-arch railway bridge in the world. In 1725, the Grand Allies commissioned local stonemason Ralph Wood to span the ravine. He turned to Roman technology for his design and, when the original wooden bridge fell apart, it was rebuilt in stone. But local legend has it that, fearing a second collapse, Wood committed suicide by throwing himself off the top of his construction. After restoration in the 1980s, the bridge is still standing nearly 300 years later.A noticeboard proudly announces that Causey Arch is the oldest surviving single-arch span railway bridge in the worldI walk across the top to join a few other hikers inspecting an old wagon on display, before heading down a steep path to the bottom of the gorge. Here, a footbridge gives the best view of the perfect arch, framed by the trees as it rises majestically 24 metres above the burn.As I carry on walking, I begin to hear shouting; then a wall of rain-stained, yellow sandstone comes into view. This is CauseyQuarry, a popular rock-climbing spot and the place where I learned the basics of rope work many years ago. I do a short traverse above the muddy ground for old times’ sake, shuddering slightly as I remember the rock antics of my youth.View image in fullscreenEnthusiasts have brought a three-mile section of Tanfield Railway back to life.Photograph: Paul Marshall/AlamySteps up a huge wooded artificial embankment lead to a much-needed stop at Poppy Coffee Pot cafe in the Causey car park. Fortified with cake, I continue along a bridleway, part of the 80-mileTyne and Wear Heritage Way, before heading along a track called Coppy Lane and into open countryside. This eventually turns downhill, and before long the roof tiles ofBeamish Hallappear, for centuries home to the local landowners.‘The railway that got the world on track’: a walk through 200 years of history in County DurhamRead moreStarting life as a fortified farmhouse in the 13th century, the current hall was built in the 1800s, and previous occupants include the family of former prime minister Anthony Eden. It is now a hotel and, as I stroll up for a closer look, its manicured lawns offer a welcome break from the rough tracks in the woods (doubles from £92). The old stables now house both a restaurant and The Coach House Cafe, which offers afternoon tea, but I feel a little too grubby to sit down to dainty cakes and sandwiches, and so continue on my route.With only the occasional dog walker for company, it is hard to imagine that in the early 1800s this area was a hive of industrial activityThis now clings to Beamish burn (stream), and as I turn towards a hill I begin to hear a babble of voices, then the rattle and ding of a bell as a tram moves across the skyline. I hadn’t realised I was quite so close toBeamish open-air museum, a huge 140-hectare (350-acre) site dedicated to the preservation of life in the north-east, which was last week crownedArt Fund museum of the year.With only the occasional dog walker for company, it is hard to imagine that in the early 1800s this area was a hive of industrial activity, boasting a paper mill and iron forges, one of which had the reputation of “casting the finest muzzle-loading cannon in England”. Soon after passing Flint mill, I enter Ousbrough Wood, a site of nature conservation importance comprising ancient trees and a conifer plantation that at one time provided pit props for the mines.There are myriad paths through the oak and silver birch, and I occasionally take a wrong turn, retracing my steps to get back on to the heritage way route. There’s some steep uphill walking, but eventually the path deposits me on a country road. I turn left and, after passing a row of almshouses built in 1863, I arrive at the pub.View image in fullscreenThe life-size figures at the Shepherd & Shepherdess pub are said to date from the Napoleonic wars.Photograph: Tony LeMoignan/AlamyTheShepherd & Shepherdessdates from the 18th century, getting its name from two life-size painted lead figures above the original door. The story goes that these date from the Napoleonic wars, when a French blockade on lead meant these metal figures were smuggled into Britain as “works of art”, to be melted down for weaponry. These two were saved by a squire at Beamish Hall, eventually ending up at the pub.Whatever the tale, they make a nice historical touch to this fine hostelry, complete with an open fire in the winter and a menu of sturdy pub fare. This includes lasagne, sea bass and fish and chips, as well as good vegetarian and gluten-free options. My eye, though, is drawn to the local delicacy of corned beef and potato pie served with greens, chips and gravy. Accompanied by a pint of the pub’s own cask ale, this is the perfect post-walk sustenance in Beamish country.Explore more on these topicsWalking holidaysHeritageNewcastle holidaysEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he felt he had to be there.“The hour train here and the heat will cause me spasms, pain, fatigue, and set off motor and vocal tics,” he says. “It’ll take days bedbound to recover, but if we don’t fight our own corner, who will?”Boxall, 50, has received the personal independence payment (Pip) for a decade and calls it a “lifeline”, particularly since he had to give up work as a credit controller for a high street bank. The benefit bought the wheelchair he’s using today. “It pays for care but also things that give me a life, not just an existence.”12:30‘Voting Labour is my biggest regret’: UK government's betrayal of disabled people – videoWhen news of the government’swin off the back of a major climbdownon Pip reached him, Boxall felt “disappointed” but “not disheartened”. “The patchwork of desperate, last-minute face-saving concessions, legislating on the fly, is an absolute embarrassment,” he says.“This isn’t a U-turn. It’s more smoke and mirrors,” according to Ellen Clifford from the campaign group Disabled People Against Cuts. “They might have bought votes with promises of co-producing the Pip review but how can we trust a government like this?”“Let’s not forget that the huge universal credit cut for new claimants remained in the bill unchanged,” she added. “It makes a mockery of any claims to be protecting vulnerable people.”Sarah Finnegan, housebound with severe ME, has been watching the chaos leading up to the vote at home after “months of intense fears” over losing her benefits. The 44-year-old, who asked to use a pseudonym out of worry people might not believe her illness, relies on Pip to pay carers who cook, clean and shop for her alongside her elderly parents.She’s a single mother to her five-year-old daughter and is “desperate” to be well enough to go back to work as a counsellor. “Without [Pip], I genuinely don’t know how I’d survive – how I’d keep my child warm and fed,” she says. “I’m housebound and can’t physically access a food bank.”With the Pip changes now delayed and contingent on a major review in autumn 2026, Finnegan is suspicious of the claim disabled people’s input will be genuinely taken on board.View image in fullscreenTim Boxall: ‘As a community, we’ve been put through a mental and physical wringer.’Photograph: Natasha Hirst/SuppliedCharlotte Hughes, who is unable to work due to fluid on the brain as well as anxiety and depression, says: “If the main aim of the government is to cut costs to ‘put disability benefits on a more sustainable footing’ then what are the chances of disabled people being really listened to when the Pip criteria are rewritten? The cruelty [of this legislation] is unlike any I’ve seen in recent history.”The 52-year-old has to get by on the health component of universal credit. “As a disabled person, it’s already difficult to survive. We’ve already cut back on everything that we can and we can’t cut back any more.”Despite the government’s last-minute changes, Hughes says “it’s a dark day” for the disabled community. “We expected it from the Tory party. ButLabourwere elected because of their promises to make positive changes. I didn’t vote Labour for cruelty and the continuation of Tory party policy. It’s unforgivable.”As he heads home, Boxall is “drained” and “resentful” of the months of stress he and other disabled and sick people have faced.“As a community, we’ve been put through a mental and physical wringer,” he says. “My health is at the worst I’ve known them. But we carry on fighting because it’s our lifeline at stake. Now, I start days of recuperation.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareLabourDisabilityBenefitsUniversal creditfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus, letters from a reader whose daughter is awaiting trial,Claire JauffretandRev Graham MurphyWed 2 Jul 2025 13.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 14.46 EDTShareIn 1983, along with thousands of other women, I cut down sections of the fence around RAF Greenham Common, which was to house nuclear weapons in the form of cruise missiles (Greenham Common women urge new generation to ‘rise up’ against nuclear threat, 27 July).Arrested and fined £50 for criminal damage, I was jailed for a couple of weeks for refusing to pay the fine. After the missiles arrived in 1984, I joined Cruisewatch actions, which, by obstructing the convoys on the road and throwing paintballs at them, prevented any missile deployment exercises taking place in secret. Again the charges were not severe. Arrested on Salisbury Plain on one occasion, my friends and I were released without charge. Women who did more than £10,000 worth of damage by painting the Blackbird spy plane in 1983 also had their charges dropped.This week, if the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has her way, those committing similar kinds of criminal damage could face 14 years in jail for “terrorism” (Free speech target or terrorist gang? The inside story of Palestine Action – and the plan to ban it, 28 June). Yet nonviolent civil disobedience works. In 2004, Mikhail Gorbachev said he attended the 1986 Reykjavik summit because he was confident that “the Greenham Common women and the peace move­ments of Europe […]would not let America take advantage if we took this step forward”. That step led to a 1987 treaty removing tactical nuclear weapons, including cruise missiles, from Europe.Keir Starmer plans once again to deploy tactical nuclear weapons, under US government control, on British soil andmass protests are already planned. As the Guardian pointed out in its excellent editorial on Palestine Action (23 June), Starmer might think that “redefining visible dissent as a national security threat is a way to contain public anger”, but it is unlikely to make it go away.On the contrary, Margaret Thatcher’s government appeared to recognise that increased repression of “eccentric” women might actually increase popular support for a cause. Perhaps he could learn something.Dr Lynne JonesMousehole, CornwallMy daughter is in prison awaiting trial in relation to direct action against an Israeli‑owned weapons company last summer by Palestine Action. I am reeling at the news thatYvette Cooperis planning to add the group to the terror list. This is hypocrisy of the highest order. My daughter joined Palestine Action because she saw her government breaking international humanitarian law by partnering in Israel’s genocide, including supplying weapons, and she saw that all the marches she attended and petitions she signed were roundly ignored.If Palestine Action is criminalised, so will all the people be who provide support without taking direct action themselves. Palestine Action volunteers give my daughter invaluable emotional and practical support. They visit her in prison, speak to her on the phone, write her letters and send her money and books. Will they be forced to stop, or face prison themselves?People of conscience are not terrorists or criminals. That label belongs to a government that is arming regimes, committing crimes against humanity, and crushing anyone at home who opposes these illegal acts. I think the wrong people are in prison.Name and address suppliedI wholeheartedly agree with Juliet Stevenson’s article (Palestine Action spraying paint is not terrorism. As ministers abuse their powers, I feel a duty to speak out, 30 June). I wonder whether Yvette Cooper would be where she is today without the often extreme actions of the suffragettes.Claire JauffretWimbledon, LondonSally Rooney’s brilliant defence of Palestine Action deserves wide support (Israel kills innocent Palestinians. Activists spray-paint a plane. Guess which the UK government calls terrorism, 22 June). If it is indeed made a proscribed organisation, I urge admirers of its non-violent protest to express their approval of the group in public at every opportunity. Let the police arrest all of us, send us to trial. If we believe in freedom of speech, the least we can do is to reconcile ourselves to the possibility of incarceration for the sake of that hard-won right.It is our right to express approval of non-violent direct action against cooperation with those who commit war crimes. If courts and prisons are clogged and overflowing as a result, the government will soon get the message not to mess with reasonable dissent.Rev Graham MurphyLiverpoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The article, however, runs the risk of suggesting that the author’s “wild” gravity-defying lifestyle, thoroughly enjoying her evenings and weekends after work with colleagues, food and music, and a work-hard-play-hard early career, is not an acceptable way of life.For many early-career men and women, having the freedom to choose what to do with their time outside their working hours is a defining aspect of their life. Our work lives are increasingly “alienating” us, in a truly Marxian sense, from what may be our innate “life spirit”, especially in our 20s and 30s. This applies especially to women, who spend a significant amount of their mid-careers juggling motherhood and domestic life, having recovered from childbirth and adjusting to their careers often with decreased earnings, depleted savings and lower levels of happiness.This period is, for some, followed by the responsibility to care for elderly parents. Mid-life responsibilities push out the joys of an earlier life, some of which can be simply entertainment with friends and colleagues.There is enough economic evidence that having healthy and social lifestyles have a significant effect on workplace productivity. If anything, employers should be encouraging and supporting employees to have healthy and enjoyable pastimes outside working hours, no matter how gravity-defying they may be.Sanghamitra BandyopadhyayProfessor of development economics, Queen Mary University of LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Having attended as a 16-year-old, with an £80 ticket bought with money from my part-time job, I sympathise with young people who have been priced out. But it’s not just young people –attending a festival has become another part of the social and cultural life of the country from which working people are increasingly being cut off. Sadly, this fundamentally changes the nature of a festival like Glastonbury, which for so long represented and celebrated the best of inclusivity, diversity and creativity in the UK.Huw RobertsLiverpoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Scientists suspect the unusual nature of the burial may have helped the DNA survive the past four millennia.“It’s exciting that we can get genomes from this place and time,” said Pontus Skoglund, who leads the ancient genomics laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London. “It’s only one individual, but it provides a valuable first glimpse into the ancestry of an early Egyptian in the old kingdom.”The skeleton was donated to the Liverpool Institute ofArchaeologyand later transferred to the city’s World Museum. There it survived bombings during the blitz that destroyed almost all of the other human remains in the collection.View image in fullscreenMarks on the skeleton suggest the man spent long periods sitting on hard ground with his legs and arms extended and head down.Photograph: University of LiverpoolAccording to radiocarbon dating, the man lived a few centuries after the unification of upper and lower Egypt, a critical time of transition between the early dynastic period and the Old Kingdom, which spanned the third to the sixth dynasties. The Old Kingdom, also known as the Age of the Pyramids, was marked by significant progress including the construction of the first step pyramid atSaqqara.DNA from one of the man’s teeth found he had dark skin, brown eyes and hair, and north African Neolithic ancestry mixed with a 20% genetic contribution from theFertile Crescentregion in the Middle East. The finding supports archaeological evidence of ancient trade between the two regions.View image in fullscreenThe pottery coffin.Photograph: University of LiverpoolThe man’s bones cast further light on his story. Middle-aged, perhaps in his 60s, he was old for the time and riddled with arthritis. Marks on the skeleton suggest he spent long periods sitting on hard ground with his legs and arms extended and head down. His right foot revealed unusual signs of wear.After studying tomb paintings of ancient Egyptian workers, the researchers suspect he may have been a potter or similar craftsman. The potter’s wheel was introduced to Egypt from the Fertile Crescent in about 2,500BC and was often stabilised with one foot. But the high-class burial, which took place before Egypt embraced artificial mummification, would have been unusual for such a worker.Joel Irish, a professor of anthropology and archaeology at Liverpool John Moores University, said of all the occupations the team reviewed, the bone markings were most consistent with the man being a potter, but he might have been weaving baskets or doing other work on the ground.Irish said: “It’s interesting that the man was found in a pot. That in itself is odd. He was put in a relatively high-class tomb and not any old person ends up in a rock-cut tomb. Maybe he was a super-good potter and ended up in someone’s favour.”Skoglund said the work,published in Nature, sheds light on which tombs might harbour remains that are well-enough preserved to yield large amounts of DNA.The team now plans to examine more skeletons in British collections to paint a fuller picture of the genetic history of the Egyptians. “There will be more individuals that we can get DNA from and we can use that to build an ancient, public genetic record of ancient Egypt,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGeneticsEgyptBiologyAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaArchaeologynewsShareReuse this content"

But if Moss’s ruling holds up, the Trump administration would have to renew processing asylum claims at the border.“This decision is a win for human dignity and the rule of law. It sends a clear message: the government cannot use cruelty as a weapon against people fleeing violence,” said Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project – one of several immigrant rights groups that are plaintiffs in the case.“Today’s ruling makes clear three salient points that transcend immigration at the border and speak to who we are as Americans. First, we are a nation of laws. Second, the Trump administration’s sweeping invocation of executive branch authority transgresses the bounds established by our constitution and our legislative branch. And third, the judicial branch is what stands between us and anarchy,” said Javier Hidalgo, legal director at the immigrant rights group Raices. “The Trump administration’s prerogative is once again found to be unlawful. It is increasingly clear where the illegality lies, and it is not with the immigrant families upon whom this administration is inflicting unfathomable harm.”People fleeing persecution and danger in their home countries would still be subject to a slew of other measures that have restricted access to legal immigration pathways. But the ruling would require the homeland security department to offer people at the southern border at least some way to seek refuge in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others have dispersed into Mexico, seeking work or residency there.Advocates have warned that many of the migrants left in the lurch by Trump’s abrupt asylum ban have been put in vulnerable and dangerous situations. The plaintiffs in the case challenging Trump’s ban had fled persecution in Afghanistan, Ecuador, Cuba, Egypt, Brazil, Turkey and Peru. Some have already been removed from the US.The district court ruling comes after a landmark supreme court decision last week in a case challenging Trump’s attempt to unilaterally end the country’s longstanding tradition of birthright citizenship. On Friday, the country’s highest courtruled to curb the power of federal judgesto impose nationwide rulings impeding the president’s policies.But because the case challenging Trump’s asylum ban was filed as a class-action lawsuit, it is not affected by the higher court’s restriction.Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and an architect of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, on social media criticized the case for trying to “circumvent” the supreme court ruling, even though the lawsuit had been filed as a class action months ago. He said the ruling created “a protected global ‘class’ entitled to admission into the United States”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS-Mexico borderMexicoAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This weird science has worked well before.“It’s an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. “It’s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.”‘Explosive increase’ of ticks that cause meat allergy in US due to climate crisisRead moreThe targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva ofthe new world screwworm fly.The US Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies – sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren’t fertilized and don’t hatch. There are fewer larvae, and, over time, the fly population dies out.It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the US and other countries north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southernMexicolate last year.The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southernTexasby the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the new world screwworm fly and its old world counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers – and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.“A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.Veterinarians have effective treatments for animals suffering from an infestation, but it can still be unpleasant – and also cripple an animal with pain.Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infested cattle as a youngster on his family’s farm.“It smelled nasty,” he said. “Like rotting meat.”The new world screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive midwestern or great plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the US and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can’t help but hook up with sterile males for mating.One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: females mate only once in their weeks-long adult lives.Alarmed about the fly’s migration north, the US temporarilyclosed its southern borderin May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won’t be fully open again at least until mid-September.But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.Decades ago, the US had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million flies a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5m on the Texas site and $21m to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.But, she added, “You’ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.”Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly’s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and on to the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing resembling a dark brown Tic Tac candy. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University’s extension service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile fliescrashed near Mexico’s borderwith Guatemala, killing three people.In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a “whiz packer”.The method is still much the same: light planes drop crates containing flies.Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA’s “crowning achievements”.Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn’t be shuttered after another successful fight.“Something we think we have complete control over – and we have declared a triumph and victory over – can always rear its ugly head again,” Burgess said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsInsectsFarm animalsAnimalsWildlifeHealthTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

You tremble like everything might collapse,” said the 23-year-old trainee mechanic, recalling how he and his panicked neighbours raced out on to the street.This time, though, the jolt had come not from deep below, but from high above: it was the detonation of a weaponized drone of the sort being used to hunt Haitian gang members who have hijacked most of the country’s capital since the start ofa coordinated criminal insurrection early last year.“People had told me about drones … but this one caught me off guard … It felt like it exploded right where I was standing,” said Antoine of the 6am attack last month near Sico, the working-class neighbourhood where he lives.As Haiti’s beleaguered government struggles to reconquer a sprawling seaside city now almost entirely controlled by the gangs, armed drones have become a key part of their arsenal. Since the drone campaign began in March, at least 300 people have been killed by the remote-control devices and almost 400 injured, according to a local human rights group called RNDDH.Videos of those attacks have spread rapidly on social media, painting a terrifying portrait of the drone warfare unfolding on the streets of one of the Caribbean’s largest cities.One such video, which the Guardian identified as having taken place in a gang-run area called Fort National, shows four people – at least two of them armed – moving through an alley before being hit from above by an explosion. Blue and white smoke fills the backstreet as the men scatter.Four people are hit from above by drone attack in Fort National, Port-au-Prince.Four people are hit from above by drone attack in Fort National, Haiti.Another clip, posted on social media by a US missionary, shows an attack on an evangelical theological seminary about 2 miles south-west of Fort National, not far from Jimmy Antoine’s home. At least one person can be seen sprinting for cover as the drone swoops towards its second-floor target and explodes. “I have fond memories of teaching in the very classroom it struck,” Luke Perkins, the president of the missionary group Crossworld, tweeted in mid-June.Trevor Ball, a former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician, said the drones used in Port-au-Prince appeared to be first-person-view (FPV) drones.Images ofone such improvised weaponwere shared on social media in March, reputedly from the aftermath of a police raid on a gang stronghold in the Lower Delmas area. The Guardian was able to identify this model of FPV drone, and found it being sold on Chinese e-commerce sites for about $200, making them relatively cheap and expendable.Ball said it was not possible to determine from the images the exact munitions being used but it was likely the drones had either been fitted with explosives intended for commercial mining, orblack powder– a homemade mix of potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur that is used in fireworks. “These tactics are used in other parts of the world, especially in the Ukraine-Russia war.Using first-person-view drones to deliver explosive devices has become extremely common there, and has been seen in other conflicts as well,” Bell added.One other video that surfaced earlier this year showed a targeted drone strike on a moving car less than 500 metres (547 yards) away from the compound believed to belong to Johnson André, a notorious gang boss known by the nickname “Izo” whose gang is called 5 Segonn (“Five Seconds”). The car was driving near waterways reportedly used for drug and gun trafficking by the gangs.View image in fullscreenAn soldier in Port-au-Prince on 30 November 2024.Photograph: Patrice Noel/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe provenance of the online drone videos remains unclear but many suspect at least some of them are being produced and released by a shadowy government-recruited armed group which has been enlisted to bolster the counterattack against the gangs. The aerial videos generally depict “action shots” or the moment the drone strikes on a target, often edited and set to energetic music.Last month the New York Times, citing senior Haitian and US government officials,reportedthat the controversial Blackwater founder Erik Prince had been working with the Haitian government “to carry out deadly operations against gangs that are terrorizing the nation and threatening to take over its capital”.The newspaper claimed American contractors, including Prince, had been hired “to work on a secret taskforce to deploy drones meant to kill gang members”. Two experts said Prince had recently shipped “a large cache of weapons” to Haiti and was seeking to recruit Haitian American military veterans to send to Port-au-Prince as part of a 150-strong mercenary force over the coming months.Earlier this month, Fritz Alphonse Jean, the head of the transitional council that has attempted to govern Haiti since its prime minister, Ariel Henry, was toppled early in the gang rebellion, confirmed that a private security firm had been engaged by the government. But he declined to name it or say how it was being paid. Jean argued it was impossible for Haiti’s underequipped and underfunded police to “face these challenges alone”.A drone strikes an evangelical theological seminary in Haiti.A drone strikes an evangelical theological seminary in Haiti.Perhaps surprisingly, Haitian human rights activists have backed the use of drone warfare to target criminal groups who haveforced more than 1 million people to flee their homes and killed thousands. A UN-backed international security force, led by Kenyan police officers, has so far failed to repel the criminal advance.“For us … drones are entirely proportionate to the level of weaponry the gangs possess,” said Rosy Auguste Ducéna, a respected human rights advocate who works for RNDDH in Port-au-Prince.Ducéna said her group supported such strikes against gang strongholds. “Why? Because we consider the sophistication of the weapons in the gangs’ hands, how those weapons are used to inflict suffering on the rest of the population – the crimes we know about: killings, thefts, rape, gang-rape, the burning of people’s entire belongings,” she said.Ducéna thought drones were “instilling fear” in heavily armed gang members and appeared to have such criminals on the back foot.“We cannot dismiss the fact that these operations are having an impact on them. The element of uncertainty is also very important. The gangs don’t necessarily know when or where a strike will happen, and we believe that’s one reason for the drop in gang activity we’re currently seeing,” she said, describing how the fear that has gripped her city’s streets was gradually subsiding.View image in fullscreenAn armed police officer walks near protesters making their way to the Villa d’Accueil to demand increased security from the government, in Port-au-Prince on 2 April.Photograph: Clarens Siffroy/AFP/Getty Images“Many banks have reopened, and many schools are open again. There is no longer the same tension as during the height of the insecurity … There is a glimmer of hope,” said Ducéna, although she voiced concern that the taskforce coordinating the drone attacks was being led by the office of the prime minister, Alix Fils-Aimé, rather than security officials.“We believe [this is] extremely dangerous for democracy. A political authority should not be leading a team conducting this type of operation,” Ducéna said.Foreign human rights activists and specialists question the efficacy – not to mention legality – of using weaponized drones in a country which, despite all the bloodshed, is not officially considered to be in a state of conflict.“I don’t think it works. They haven’t killed a single gang leader after three, going on four months of doing this, and we don’t know how many civilians have been harmed,” said one expert, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. “It just shows how absolutely desperate the government and the police [are].”“I think it’s a sign of desperation … It shows how desperate people are to have some sign that … something can be done to stop [the gangs]. That’s really what it is all about,” they added, fretting that gang leaders might adopt the same tactics, exacerbating an already dire situation. “What if they [the gangs] start shooting off drones? The escalation factor is also very worrying.”Earlier this month there were signs that gangs were already seeking to build their ownarsenal of drones whenthree alleged “terrorists” were arrestedin the neighbouring Dominican Republic trying to buy the devices. In recent years both Mexican cartels and drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro have started using armed drones to launch attacks on authorities or rivals.A drone strikes a car in the compound believed to belong to gang boss Johnson André.A drone strikes a car in the compound believed to belong to gang boss Johnson André.On the ground in Port-au-Prince, many offer a more positive assessment of the aerial offensive.Last month, Belony Jassé, an 18-year-old high school student who said he heard drone explosions “all the time”, finally managed to return to the home that gangs once forced her to flee after security improved.The sound of drone attacks terrified the algebra-loving teenager. “It makes you jump. It’s scary. You don’t expect the noise. You might drop whatever you’re holding. The sound is very loud. It breaks your heart, it takes time to recover. It’s heavy,” he said.But Jassé credited those attacks – coupled with an intensification of ground operations by police andvigilante groups– with the recent progress in his neighbourhood. “I don’t hear much gunfire any more. Last night I hardly heard any shots … This week I haven’t heard any gunfire at all,” he said.The situation remained critical, Jassé admitted. “But compared to how it was, I’m not scared any more.”Explore more on these topicsHaitiDrones (military)GangsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It called for the program to end on 3 August, and last week pushed back that date to 2 September.The US district judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn, however, said the homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, did not follow instructions and a timeline mandated by Congress to reconsider the TPS designation for Haitians.US says Haitians can be deported – days after ruling Haiti unsafe for AmericansRead more“Secretary Noem does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country’s TPS designation,” making her actions “unlawful”, Cogan wrote. “Plaintiffs are likely to (and, indeed, do) succeed on the merits.”Cogan also said Haitians’ interests in being able to live and work in the United States “far outweigh” potential harm to the US government, which remains free to enforce immigration laws and terminate TPS status as prescribed by Congress.Donald Trumphas made a crackdown on legal and illegal immigration a central plank of his second White House term.Cogan was appointed to the bench by George W Bush, also a Republican.In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, homeland security spokesperson, said Haiti’s TPS designation had been granted following the 2010 earthquake in that country, and was never intended as a “de facto” asylum program.“This ruling delays justice and seeks to kneecap the president’s constitutionally vested powers,” she said. “We expect a higher court to vindicate us.”Federal courts blocked Trump from ending most TPS enrollment during his first term.Nine Haitian TPS holders, an association of churches and a chapter of the Service Employees International Union filed the lawsuit on 14 March, saying Noem did not do a required review of current conditions in Haiti before ending TPS early.More than 1 million people, more than half of them children, are displaced within Haiti, where gang violence is prevalent despite a United Nations-backed security mission that began last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was speaking at an event in London paid for by Britain’s biggest weapons maker, BAE Systems. The manufacturer of artillery, fighter jets and nuclear submarines is expected to be one of thebiggest corporate beneficiaries of increased spending on weaponry.Case said: “There’s some actually quite helpful pressure, if you ask me – [this is a] slightly unpopular view – from the White House about us pulling our fingers out in Europe and actually stepping up to the plate on our defence spending.“But the reason that matters is because President Xi has publicly set out his timetable for, as he would put it, reunifying Taiwan. We’re incredibly bad at reading what dictators say in public. We spend millions of pounds on secret intelligence, which is absolutely amazing, but we’re really bad at missing what they actually say in public, which is, this is the timetable at which I want everybody to be ready for us to prepare for serious conflict.”Xi exercises near absolute power in China, but the country has strongly objected to the use of the label “dictator”,including by the former US president Joe Biden. The UK’s recent strategic defence review highlighted Chinese military exercises around Taiwan as a driver of global instability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said clear written instructions would be left behind, but did not elaborate on their contents.China annexed Tibet in 1951 and has retained tight control over the region ever since. It has said the choice of the next Dalai Lama lies only with Beijing, and has enshrined state assent for all senior Tibetan religious leaders in law. It insists the golden urn – a Qing dynasty ritual in which names are drawn by lot from a ceremonial vessel – is the only legitimate method for recognising reincarnated lamas. The Communist party must approve the final selection.Beijing has already used this approach to assert control. After the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, Tibet’s second-highest spiritual authority, in 1995, the Dalai Lama recognised a six-year-old boy as his reincarnation. The boy and his family vanished into Chinese custody days later and have not been seen since. China installed its own candidate, widely rejected by Tibetans. According to Chinese state media, the Beijing-backed Panchen Lama met President Xi Jinping just last month and pledged loyalty to the Communist party.The Dalai Lama has said his successor will be born in a free country, raising the possibility that the next reincarnation could emerge from among the Tibetan diaspora, which numbers about 140,000 globally, half of them inIndia. He has also said the next Dalai Lama might be an adult and not necessarily male.“Today’s message is that the Dalai Lama institution will continue,” Lobsang Tenzin, the trust’s second-most senior leader and known by his religious title Samdhong Rinpoche, told a news conference in Dharamshala. “There will be a 15th Dalai Lama. There will be a 16th.” He said the Dalai Lama would issue detailed instructions on how the search for the next reincarnation should proceed.Beijing swiftly rejected the Dalai Lama’s statement. “The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and other great Buddhist figures must be chosen by drawing lots from a golden urn and approved by the central government,” said the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning.“TibetanBuddhismwas born in China and is a religion with Chinese characteristics,” she told a news briefing.The clash underscores a long-running power struggle between Beijing and the Dalai Lama over who controls Tibetan Buddhism’s most sacred office. Most Tibetan Buddhists, in Tibet and in exile, oppose China’s tight control of the region.Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is the earthly manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, a revered figure in Buddhism known as the bodhisattva of compassion – a spiritual being who remains in the world to guide others on the path to enlightenment.By tradition, only the current Dalai Lama, or those he appoints, can identify his successor, using visions, omens and consultation with senior lamas and protectors of the faith.Tenzin Gyatso was recognised the 14th reincarnation at the age of two. He assumed full authority at 15 and fled Tibet four years later when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, in 1959. He has been living in exile in Dharamshala since.He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1989 “for advocating peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual respect”.He wrote in a recent book: “The purpose of a reincarnation is to carry on the work of the predecessor. The new Dalai Lama will be born in the free world.”The deputy speaker of the Tibetan parliament in exile, Dolma Tsering Teykhang, said: “The world needs to hear directly from His Holiness. China tries to vilify him at every chance … It is trying to frame rules and regulations on how to have the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in their hand.”The succession dispute has also sharpened tensions between China and India, which granted asylum to the Dalai Lama after he fled Tibet. More than 100,000 Tibetans live in exile in India. Delhi officially recognises Tibet as part of China, but it also allows the Tibetan government in exile to operate from Dharamshala.The reincarnation issue has drawn global attention. The US passed the Tibetan Policy and Support Act in 2020, threatening sanctions on Chinese officials who interfere in the selection process. The EU has voiced support for religious freedom in Tibet, but it has stopped short of taking a formal position on reincarnation.Explore more on these topicsDalai LamaBuddhismChinaIndiaTibetAsia PacificReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Some savings products also require customers to make no withdrawals.The consumer watchdog advised banks in 2023 to report the share of customers achieving their full rate; make clear whether alternative products offered better rates for those not meeting conditions; and alert customers to consider whether alternative products suit them better.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailNo major bank has adopted those recommendations in full, according to Guardian Australia analysis.The regulator also recommended banks notify customers at risk of breaching requirements, which is a measure all of the major banks say they have implemented.Spokespeople for NAB, CommBank, Westpac and ANZ said they offered in-app alerts and email reminders to help savers get their full interest rate.Kristle Cortés, associate professor and co-founder of the University of New South Wales’ RISE Finance Lab, said regulation may be required to ensure banks improve their practices.“The recommendations really go to the heart of transparency and fairness in retail banking,” Cortés said.“It’s hard to save … so without clear or better feedback, most customers don’t actually realise what rate they get, and they could potentially miss out.”The ACCC found in 2023 that those with smaller bank balances were more likely to miss out on bonus rates.Customer experienceGuardian Australia has previouslydetailed the experiences of an ING customerwho missed out on their bonus rate.One couple with a NAB account said they felt “sickened” after missing out on thousands of dollars of interest and claimed they did not receive an alert.The couple, who asked to remain anonymous, sold their home on the mid-north coast of New South Wales in April 2024 and deposited $350,000 of the proceeds in a new NAB Reward Saver account.Six months later, they realised they had unwittingly disqualified themselves from the full interest rate of 5% p.a. by withdrawing from the account each month.Had the couple made no withdrawals, the full rate would have handed them more than $8,000 over that period. Instead they received the base rate of 0.35% p.a., equating to less than $600.“[NAB] never emailed me since to say that ‘you’re losing money, you’re losing interest, you’re not meeting the conditions,’” the husband said.“Obviously it’s to their benefit – it saved them thousands.”Kylie Young, a NAB executive, said the bank did email customers to remind them if they missed the criteria and informed them on how to qualify for bonus rates when they opened the account. NAB was unable to comment on individual cases.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cheap money can then be used to finance other parts of their bank operations, including profitable mortgage books.Nearly 90% of Westpac’s household deposits now sit in conditional accounts with high advertised rates, its half-yearly report showed. Up to 15% of balances in Westpac’s Life saver account receive only the base 0.4% interest rate.The major banks have slashed the base rates paid on conditional accounts in the last year. Westpac Life savers endured the biggest cuts, now entitled to just 0.4% p.a. interest when they had received 2% in early 2024.The other big banks offer even lower base interest rates, with NAB’s base rate at just 0.1%.GraphRepresentatives of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB and ANZ declined to detail what proportion of customers achieved bonus interest in response to questions.ANZ declined to share what proportion of account balances had bonus conditions.NAB said less than 20% of its conditional account balances missed out on their bonus interest while Westpac said less than 15% of bonus account balances missed out.Guardian Australian understands 14% of balances in CommBank’s conditional account do not receive bonus interest.Spokespeople from the major banks said they aimed to inform customers and help them choose products that suited their individual circumstances.Explore more on these topicsBankingAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)Interest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Until both were demolished in recent years, Tewantin near Noosa had a big shell and big stubby a street apart from one another. Beerwah, also in the Sunshine Coast region, has both a big mower and chainsaw.But the scale, smoothness and shape of the proposed pear, she said, would be “difficult to achieve from an engineering and architecture perspective” – but “pretty spectacular” if pulled off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was not clear if this could include Israel, which buys 68% of its foreign-sourced weapons from the US.Parnell’s remarks came during a briefing in which he defended the review and pause in delivery of munitions to Ukraine but declined to discuss which specific munitions were being held back.“A capability review is being conducted to ensureUS militaryaid aligns with our defense priorities, and we will not be providing any updates to specific quantities or types of munitions being provided to Ukraine, or the timelines associated with these transfers,” he said. “We see this as a commonsense pragmatic step … to evaluate what munitions are sent and where. But we want to be very clear about this last point. Let it be known that our military has everything that it needs to conduct any mission anywhere, anytime, all around the world.”On Wednesday, Kyiv warned that a halt in shipments from the US would weaken its ability to defend against intensifying airstrikes and battlefield advances.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The so-called prioritisers have powerful allies in the Republican party, including Vice-President JD Vance, who has been a prominent critic of US aid to Ukraine.“For a long time, four years under the Biden administration, we were giving away weapons and munitions without really thinking about how many we have,” said Parnell. “I think that this president was elected on putting this country first and defending the homeland and then you couple that with … a shift to the Indo-Pacific. Part of our job is to give the president a framework that he can use to evaluate how many munitions we have and where we’re sending them.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS militaryUS foreign policyUkraineTrump administrationRussiaUS politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Kyiv said halting weapons shipments would only encourage Russian aggression, but the White House said it had been done “to put America’s interests first following a DoD [Department of Defense] review”.Colby’s review concluded in June but the decision emerged overnight after Washington confirmed reports of the change in policy.Ukraine has been coming under increased missile and drone attack from Russia, which have caused a higher level of civilian casualties, and is desperate to secure additional Patriot and other air defence systems to protect its cities.The US decision also involves Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, GMLRS missiles used by Himars rocket artillery, Stinger portable air defence systems and 155mm artillery shells originally promised by the Biden administration.Killing machines: how Russia and Ukraine’s race to perfect deadly pilotless drones could harm us allRead moreRussia launched 477 drones and decoys and 60 missiles into Ukraine on Saturday night and Sunday morning, the biggest single nightly air raid since the start of the war,according to Ukraine’s air force.Last month 28 civilians were reported killed and more than 100 injured in Kyiv after a nine-hour missile and drone attack. Nato sources said last week that it was Russia’s third largest combined attack since the start of the war.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Wednesday that Ukraine was “clarifying” details with the US. His foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on X that “we need more interceptors and systems. We are also ready to purchase or rent them.”Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the US embassy’s chargé d’affaires, John Ginkel, to a meeting with the deputy foreign minister, Mariana Betsa, to discuss US military assistance and Russia’s continuing campaign of airstrikes.“The Ukrainian side emphasised that any delay or procrastination in supporting Ukraine’s defence capabilities will only encourage the aggressor to continue the war and terror, rather than seek peace,” the ministry said.At the end of last week’s Nato summit, Donald Trump hinted that supplies of Patriot missile interceptors were running down because some had been supplied to Israel, though he suggested he would like to help Kyiv.After a meeting with Zelenskyy, the US president acknowledged that Ukraine did “want to have the anti-missile systems, as they call the Patriots, and we’re going to see if we can make some available”.But Trump added: “They’re very hard to get. We need them. We were supplying them to Israel,” implying that supporting Israel in its war with Iran – a priority for the Republican administration – had set back its willingness to help Kyiv.Nato officials said last week that Russia was producing “quite a number” of ballistic missiles itself and acquiring some from North Korea. Ukraine’s military intelligence briefed in June that Moscow was producing 60 to 70 ballistic Iskander-Ms and 10 to 15 hypersonic Kinzhals a month.Air defence interceptors take longer to produce than ballistic missiles, and efforts have been made to increase production of those used by Patriot batteries since the start of the Ukraine war. Russia, meanwhile, has boosted missile and drone production in an effort to exhaust Kyiv’s air defences.The weapons that were due to be sent are part of the $66bn worth of weapons and military aid approved by Congress under the Biden administration since February 2022. Though no new spending has been authorised under Trump, the previous military aid packages have mostly continued, aside from a short pause in March.European allies of Ukraine have sought to plug some of the gaps but western militaries have long acknowledged that US weapons represent the best munitions available, and some are deemed critical for Kyiv’s war effort.Ukraine is now largely fighting a defensive war against Russia while Trump tries to broker a ceasefire between the two countries. Moscow believes it is gradually winning the war, and peace talks have ground to halt.British sources said the US decision did not affect its own supplies to Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Most meals are canned, vacuum-packed or freeze-dried from a set of options provided by space agencies.View image in fullscreenNasa vacuum-sealed food on display at a space event in Colorado in 2019.Photograph: Jason Connolly/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin holds the record as the first person to eat in space. On his historic April 1961 mission, he sustained himself with a main course of beef and liver as well as chocolate, all squeezed from a tube.But space food has come a long way since Gagarin’s Vostok 1 journey. Fresh fruit and vegetables are available to modern cosmonauts, though only when a new spacecraft arrives at the ISS with supplies.For the sake of variety, one out of every 10 meals is prepared for specific crew members according to their personal tastes. Adenot’s menu was developed by the French chef Anne-Sophie Pic, who holds 10 Michelin stars and was named best female chef by The World’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2011.InFrance, Pic is known for taking over the family restaurant, Maison Pic in Valence, from her late father in spite of a lack of formal training, and subsequently regaining the third Michelin star her grandfather had first achieved in 1934.Pic said it was an “exhilarating challenge” to develop the menu, which includes four starters, two mains and two desserts.View image in fullscreenChef Anne-Sophie Pic, who said it was an ‘exhilarating challenge’ to develop the menu.Photograph: Philippe Desmazes/AFP/Getty Images“Cooking for space means pushing the boundaries of gastronomy,” Pic said. “With my team in my research and development lab we embraced a thrilling challenge: preserving the emotion of taste despite extreme technical constraints.”Adenot said: “During a mission, sharing our respective dishes is a way of inviting crewmates to learn more about our culture. It’s a very powerful bonding experience.”Adenot, 42, a former helicopter test pilot, is scheduled to begin her first tour on the ISS in spring 2026. During a six-month mission called εpsilon, she will carry out a range of tasks including European-led scientific experiments, medical research and maintenance on the station.Moving at a speed of 17,900mph (28,800 km/h) approximately 250 miles (400km) above Earth, the ISS orbits the planet roughly 16 times a day, which can make breakfast, lunch and dinner times hard to keep apart.Astronauts still typically eat three meals a day, with a daily calories intake of 2,500 as a guidance. Due to the special requirements for keeping meals durable and hygienic, feeding an astronaut can cost up to £20,000 a day.Because body fluids behave differently at zero gravity, cosmonauts often complain about food in space tasting bland and request spicy flavours to tickle their tastebuds, such as horseradish and wasabi.A pair of Nasa astronautsreturned to Earth in Marchafter being unexpectedly stuck on the ISS for more than nine months because of problems with Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft.Regular fine dining in space might not be the stuff only of science fiction in perpetuity. In April this year, Esa announced a project to assess the viability of producing lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other planets.The team involved said the experiment was a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the ISS in two years’ time, making 3D-printed bavette and lab-grownfritesa possibility for French astronauts of the future.Explore more on these topicsInternational Space StationEuropean Space AgencySpaceFranceFrench food and drinkEuropeFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

He has denied any wrongdoing, saying he only found out about the allegations of abuse from the media.‘A supermarket for sexual predators’: abuse scandal at elite boarding school shakes FranceRead moreThe two co-rapporteurs of the parliamentary inquiry, the centrist MP Violette Spillebout and the leftwing MP Paul Vannier, said he had not acted to address the issue of violence at Bétharram when he was education minister in the 1990s.The report said: “In the absence of action that the former education minister … had the means to take, this physical and sexual violence against the pupils of Bétharram continued for years.”Vannier told a parliament press conference on Wednesday that there had been major “failings” by the French state, the justice system and the education ministry, which failed to implement proper checks and controls. He said these failings were at every level “from the local level right up to the highest levels of state”.Vannier said the report found that Bayrou would have known about physical violence at the Bétharram school from 1995 and sexual violence from 1998. Vannier said: “At the time he had all the means to act and he didn’t act.”Vannier told the state broadcaster France Inter: “Many of the testimonies we received were beyond my imagination. I couldn’t imagine acts of torture, children being injected with water, children being deprived of sleep, children being deprived of food to punish them in endless sadistic games for years and years, devastating entire lives.”A member of Bayrou’s team rejected the findings accusing the prime minister of inaction. “It’s exactly the opposite,” the official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity. “No minister after François Bayrou organised any verification checks or inspections.”Bayrou, a centrist who wasappointed prime ministerby the president, Emmanuel Macron, in December, has denounced what he calls a political campaign of “destruction” against him.In mid-May, Bayrou was questioned for five and a half hours by the parliamentary inquiry, in one of the most delicate moments of his time in office. He struck a defiant tone at the time, telling the hearing: “I had nothing to hide.”The report found the violence at Bétharram school was systemic. The violence “was – at least in part – institutionalised”, with “a community of prominent figures providing unwavering support”, the lawmakers found.They stressed that the abuse at Bétharram was “far from being a unique case”.Such violence still persisted in private schools, particularly Catholic establishments, the authors said, pointing to a “strong code of silence”.The report warned of “virtually nonexistent” checks and an inadequate system of prevention and reporting by the state. They called for a compensation fund for victims and an end to all time limits on filing a legal complaint for child sexual abuse.Alain Esquerre, a former Bétharram pupil who exposed abuse at the school and brought together survivors to fight for justice, said it was urgent that all victims of school abuse got state recognition and parliament must pass a law removing a time limit for legal complaints over child sexual abuse.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They typically target those who they see as attractive or sexually active women.The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor’s Office (PNAT) said an investigation had been opened on Tuesday “against an 18-year-old man claiming to be part of the ‘incel’ movement”.The man has been charged with terrorist conspiracy with a view to preparing one or more crimes against persons, the PNAT said.The involvement of anti-terror prosecutors appears to indicate that French authorities recognise this form of gender-based violence as terrorism.On Tuesday evening, the suspect appeared before a judge who remanded him in custody. His lawyer, Maria Snitsar, described him as “a teenager who is suffering, not a fighter preparing for action”.According to a source, the teenager, who wanted to become an engineer, was a fan of misogynist videos on social media, particularly TikTok.Another source said this was the first time the PNAT had been called upon to investigate a man who exclusively identifies as part of the “incel” subculture.The concept had previously appeared only marginally in two cases handled by the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office.Explore more on these topicsFranceViolence against women and girlsMenWomenSocial mediaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The dead included a well-known film-maker and an artist, a 35-year-old housewife and a four-year-old child. Among the injured were a 14-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl.Under international law based on the Geneva conventions, a military force is forbidden to launch attacks that cause “incidental loss of civilian life” that is “excessive or disproportionate” to the military advantage to be gained.What is considered acceptable is open to interpretation but experts said only a target whose elimination might have a very significant impact on the course of a conflict could justify the death of dozens of civilians.The cafe had two storeys – an open upper deck and a lower floor with wide windows on to the beach and sea – and approaches that were clearly visible from above.View image in fullscreenA closeup of a bomb fragment from the ruins of al-Baqa cafe.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianGerry Simpson, of Human Rights Watch, said: “The Israeli military hasn’t said exactly whom it was targeting but it said it used aerial surveillance to minimise civilian casualties, which means it knew the cafe was teeming with customers at the time.“The military would also have known that using a large guided air-dropped bomb would kill and maim many of the civilians there. The use of such a large weapon in an obviously crowded cafe risks that this was an unlawful disproportionate or indiscriminate attack and should be investigated as a war crime.”Dr Andrew Forde, an assistant professor of human rights law at Dublin City University, said the strike was shocking. “When you see a situation where there are heavy munitions being used, particularly [in a] crowded civilian space, even with the best targeting in the world … that will necessarily create an indiscriminate outcome that is not in compliance with … the Geneva conventions,” he said.The family-run al-Baqa cafe was founded almost 40 years ago and was well known as a recreation spot for young people and families inGazaCity. It served a small selection of soft drinks, tea and biscuits.Though the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million population suffer acutelywith growing malnutritionand a continuing threat of famine, some have savings or salaries that allow them to patronise the few remaining cafes.The port area where al-Baqa cafe was located was not covered by any of the evacuation orders issued by the IDF to warn of impending military operations.View image in fullscreenA crater at the scene of Monday’s airstrike.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersMarc Schack, an associate professor of international law at the University of Copenhagen, said: “It is almost impossible to see how this use of that kind of munition can be justified. If you are talking about 20, 30, 40 or more civilian casualties, usually that would have to be a target of very great importance … For coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the accepted number for a very high-level target was less than 30 civilians getting killed, and only then in exceptional circumstances.”Trevor Ball, a weapons researcher and former US army explosive ordnance disposal technician, identified a Jdam tail section and thermal battery which he said suggested either an MPR500 or an MK-82 bomb was dropped.Another expert with extensive experience of recent conflicts identified the bomb similarly. A third said they could not make a reliable assessment from the pictures presented to them.Israel has a wide range of munitions and has frequently used much smaller weapons for precision strikes against individualsin Gaza, Lebanon and in its recent air offensive in Iran.The IDF said in a lengthy statement earlier this year that even the most sophisticated measures employed to assess civilian harm were hardly ever perfect and that its choice of munitions was “a professional matter contingent on the nature of the strike’s objective”.Thestatementsaid: “While some targets are suitable for smaller payloads, others may require heavier munitions to achieve mission success – for example, when intending to destroy structures that are built with certain hard materials, large structures, or underground tunnel.”On Tuesday, an Israeli government spokesperson said the IDF “never, ever targets civilians”.Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge that the militant Islamist group denies.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We’re not going back to that. It’s over.”Hamas negotiators were expected to meet Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo on Wednesday. Israel is not believed to have sent a delegation.US officials have supported Israel’s demand that Hamas no longer exist inGazaas a non-negotiable in any ceasefire negotiations.For many months, negotiators have been discussing intermittently a version of a ceasefire plan put forward by the US envoy Steve Witkoff that is close to previous Israeli proposals.Trump’s claim came after hebrokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, and on the same day as Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, reportedly met Witkoff and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.Trump wrote: “The Qataris and Egyptians, who have worked very hard to help bring Peace, will deliver this final proposal. I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better — IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.”Trump is expected to meet Netanyahu at the White House on Monday.There was a muted reaction in Israel to Trump’s statement, with officials stressing many unresolved issues. Israel has not sent negotiating teams either to Cairo or Qatar, where the indirect talks have been taking place.​But Yedioth Ahronoth​, a mass-market Israeli newspaper, report​ed that sources “involved in the hostage deal talks said that both Israel and Hamas were more motivated, even without clear guarantees that the war would end”.It reported: “The gaps between the sides have not been closed, but they have decreased, and the sense is that a window of opportunity now exists that Israel would like to seize, particularly ahead of Netanyahu’s trip and the optimism that Trump has projected.”Israel Hayom​, another major newspaper, quoted ​a​n Israeli official confirming that Hamas had ​m​ade concessions. “This​ progress​ was the reason that Netanyahu’s trip to Washington was ​b​rought forward,” the official​ told the newspaper.Hamas played down the prospect of a deal. Taher al-Nunu, a senior official, told AFP: “So far, there has been no breakthrough.”Trump and his aides appear to be seeking to use any momentum from US and Israeli strikes on Iran nuclear sites, as well as a ceasefire that took hold last week in that war, to secure a lasting truce in the war in Gaza.Trump told reporters during a visit to Florida that he would be “very firm” with Netanyahu on the need for a speedy Gaza ceasefire. “We hope it’s going to happen. And we’re looking forward to it happening some time next week,” he told reporters. “We want to get the hostages out.”Hamas has said it is willing to free remaining hostages in Gaza in return for a permanent end to the conflict and a full Israeli withdrawal from the devastated territory. Israel says the war can end only if Hamas is disarmed and its leadership agrees to go into exile.But after a poll boost in the wake of Israel’s war with Iran and with parliament close to a summer recess, Netanyahu may now feel he can risk a deal that might alienate rightwing coalition allies. The Israeli military has told him it has reached many of the objectives set in May, and successive opinion surveys show Israeli public support for a ceasefire that would return the 50 hostages still in Gaza.The new push for a ceasefire comes after a horrific Israeliattack at al-Baqa cafeon the Gaza seafront on Monday that medical and other officials said killed between 24 and 36 Palestinians, including children.On Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed 40 people across the Gaza Strip, the health ministry said. Hospital officials said four children and seven women were among the dead.TheIsrael-Gaza warbegan when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages to Gaza.Israel’s subsequent military assault has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians, mostly civilians – thoughexperts say this is likely to be an undercount– displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population and reduced much of the territory to rubble.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpUS foreign policyIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

A number of family members were reported to have been killed alongside him.Dr Marwan al-Sultan, a renowned and highly experienced cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in theGazaStrip, is the 70th healthcare worker to be killed by Israeli attacks in the last 50 days, according to Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), a Palestinian medical organisation.“The killing of Dr Marwan al-Sultan by the Israeli military is a catastrophic loss to Gaza and the entire medical community, and will have a devastating impact on Gaza’s healthcare system,” said Muath Alser, director of HWW.“This is part of a much longer and systematic atrocious targeting of healthcare workers sanctioned by impunity. This is a tragic loss of life, but also an obliteration of their decades of lifesaving medical expertise and care at a time when the situation facing Palestinian civilians is unfathomably catastrophic,” Alser added.View image in fullscreenKilled: Dr Marwan al-Sultan, head of the Indonesian hospital in Gaza.Photograph: X“We are in great shock and grief. He cannot be replaced,” saidDr Mohammed Abu Selmia, director of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza.“He was a prominent scholar and one of the two remaining cardiologists left in Gaza. Thousands of heart patients will suffer as a result of his killing. His only fault was that he was a doctor. We have no option but to be steadfast, but the sense of loss is devastating.”Earlier this month,al-Sultan spoke to the Guardianabout the critical situation he and other staff at the Indonesian hospital were facing as they struggled to cope with the number of civilian casualties after the escalation of Israeli attacks in May.Among the healthcare workers killed in the past 50 days were three other doctors, the chief nurses of the Indonesian hospital and al-Nasser children’s hospital, one of Gaza’s most senior midwives, a senior radiology technician and dozens of young medical graduates and trainee nurses.On 6 June, the first day of Eid, nine healthcare workers were killed in one day in airstrikes in the north of Gaza, where they were sheltering with their families, according to HWW.Fares Afana, who leads ambulance services in northern Gaza, lost his son in June. Bara’a, who was also working as a paramedic, was at an apartment block in Gaza City’s al-Tuffah neighbourhood on 9 June treating people injured in an Israeli airstrike when the building was hit for a second time by Israeli artillery, killing everyone inside.View image in fullscreenFares Afana, right, with his son Bara’a, a paramedic who was killed in an airstrike in June.Photograph: Handout“They were directly targeted,” said Afana, who says that Bara’a died alongside two other paramedics.“When I went to the place, it was a horrible sight and cruel to see their bodies torn to pieces. If there had been some reaction from the world when healthcare workers were first targeted by the Israeli forces, they would have not dared to commit more of these attacks.”He said his son had dedicated his life to the medical profession and had dreams of being a doctor. “He was kind and loved by everyone who knew him.”The total number of healthcare workers who have lost their lives in military attacks since the war began in October 2023 now exceeds 1,400 according toUN figures.More than 160 Gazan medics held in Israeli prisons amid reports of tortureRead moreInsecurity Insight, a conflict data NGO, says it hasverified the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workerswho have been killed inside health facilities, while attempting to reach wounded civilians, by Israeli sniper fire, when travelling in ambulances, while evacuating patients, at checkpoints and inside schools and refugee camps used as temporary shelters since October 2023.It is believed that hundreds more healthcare workers from Gaza remain in Israeli detention, where they have reported beingtortured, beaten and held without charge.Medglobal, a medical NGO based in the US that provides medical services and care in Gaza, says it believes more than 300 medical staff are in Israeli prisons, among them senior physicians includingDr Hussam Abu Safiya,the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital who has been held in detention since December 2024.Explore more on these topicsGazaRights and freedomIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Our failures impact audiences.“As an organisation we have not offered any significant analysis of the UK government’s involvement in the war on Palestinians. We have failed to report on weapons sales or their legal implications. These stories have instead been broken by the BBC’s competitors.”The statement alleges Gibb has a “conflict of interest” which “highlights a double standard for BBC content makers who have themselves experienced censorship in the name of ‘impartiality’.”It adds: “In some instances staff have been accused of having an agenda because they have posted news articles critical of the Israeli government on their social media. By comparison, Gibb remains in an influential post with little transparency regarding his decisions despite his ideological leanings being well known. We can no longer ask licence fee payers to overlook Gibbs’s ideological allegiances.”The letter concludes: “We, the undersigned BBC staff, freelancers and industry figures are extremely concerned that the BBC’s reporting on Israel and Palestine continues to fall short of the standards our audiences expect. We believe the role of Robbie Gibb, both on the board, and as part of the editorial standards committee, is untenable. We call on the BBC to do better for our audiences and recommit to our values of impartiality, honesty and reporting without fear or favour.”Owing to their fear of repercussions, the 111 BBC journalists signed anonymously.A BBC spokesperson said: “Robust discussions amongst our editorial teams about our journalism are an essential part of the editorial process. We have ongoing discussions about coverage and listen to feedback from staff and we think these conversations are best had internally.“Regarding our coverage of Gaza, the BBC is fully committed to covering the conflict impartially and has produced powerful coverage from the region. Alongside breaking news, ongoing analysis, and investigations, we have produced award winning documentaries such as Life and Death in Gaza, and Gaza 101.”Explore more on these topicsBBCIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelWar reportingMiddle East and north AfricaTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

So does the public.“But unless the NHS changes, the argument that it is unsustainable will grow more compelling. It really is change or bust. We choose change.”Making care more convenient for patients through the new clinics is key to the government’s plan to reinvent the NHS as a service in which more is done in community settings and less in hospitals, which have become overwhelmed in recent years by the rising need for care.That will be accompanied by two other “big shifts”: enhanced use of technology and greater emphasis on the health service preventing illness rather than treating it.Public dissatisfaction with the NHS’s inability to guarantee rapid access to GPs, A&E care and surgery, and Starmer’s previous pledges to get it back on its feet, mean that delivering the changes outlined in the 143-page plan will be key to the government’s fortunes.Health thinktanks cautioned that the plans would take a long time to push through and that patients may not see real change for some time.“Most people in this country want the NHS to survive and thrive because they rely on it,” said Steve Brine, a former Conservative health minister.“Whether this plan, and the funding the health secretary has been able to secure for it, is enough for people to feel the difference remains an open question.”The complexity and political risks involved in modernising a cherished public service raise questions about whether Starmer and Streeting “have the stomach to embark on the kind of transformation they say is required”, he said.The “neighbourhood centres” will be staffed by doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health professionals, as well as specialists in debt advice and employment, ministers say.They will offer services traditionally provided in hospitals – such as diagnostic tests, post-operative care and rehabilitation. They will be open 12 hours a day, including in the evenings and at weekends, though that will happen “eventually”, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) conceded.Health thinktanks criticised the DHSC’s lack of detail about the centres, including where they would be, who would staff them, where the funding for building new facilities would come from, and when they would actually open.Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King’s Fund, welcomed the shift from hospital to community-based care and a more people-friendly NHS but said it “has been echoed by successive governments, so whilst welcome, the vision itself is not new.“The radical change would be delivering the vision. History has shown us that you can’t simply co-locate different health professionals in a building and expect a neighbourhood health service to flourish.”Thea Stein, her counterpart at the Nuffield Trust, who is a former NHS trust boss, said that transforming the health service as Starmer is pledging “is hard, complex work, requiring leadership from politicians and NHS staff alike to challenge cultures and power dynamics, and create new ways to route money through the system”.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthKeir StarmerEnglandHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

As a result of the U-turn, she now has to fill a £5bn gap in the public finances with tax rises or cuts elsewhere.After the chancellor was seen in tears at prime minister’s questions, Downing Street moved quickly to insist she would stay in post and had not offered her resignation. “The chancellor is going nowhere,” a spokesperson said.Welfare climbdown lets genie out of the bottle, and no one knows what happens nextRead moreBut borrowing costs rose at the sharpest rate since Donald Trump’s tariff plans unsettled financial markets in April, while the pound fell against the dollar and the euro, settling only once No 10 had said Reeves would stay.Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, said on Wednesday morning that there would be tough choices to be made as a result of the welfare bill row. “There’s definitely a cost to what was announced yesterday, and you can’t spend the same money twice, so more money spent on that means less for some other purpose,” he said.Hours later, Reeves wiped away tears while sitting on the government frontbench in the Commons after Starmer refused to say she would keep her job. In a heated exchange, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, suggestedLabourMPs had said Reeves was “toast”.Reeves had appeared upset even before entering the chamber, where she had a brief altercation with Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, over potential breaches of parliamentary convention during Treasury questions on Tuesday. One witness said the chancellor told him “I’m just under so much pressure” before taking her seat.During the 30 minutes ofPMQs, Badenoch said the chancellor looked “absolutely miserable” and described her as a “human shield” for what she said was No 10’s incompetence. Reeves’s sister, Ellie, also an MP, took her hand as they left the Commons.How No 10 went from bullish to badly damaged as rebels forced further welfare bill concessionsRead moreAfterwards, Downing Street said there would be no reshuffle. “The chancellor has the prime minister’s full backing.

They are focused entirely on delivering for working people,” a spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Reeves said: “It’s a personal matter, which – as you would expect – we are not going to get into”.The Guardian understands that the prime minister spoke with the chancellor later on Wednesday afternoon.On Wednesday evening Starmer said Reeves’s tears in the Commons were “nothing to do with politics” and she will be chancellor for a “very long time to come”.Speaking to the BBC’s podcast Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, the prime minister denied suggestions the chancellor was upset by the fallout over the government’s welfare bill.He said: “That’s absolutely wrong, it’s got nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with what’s happened this week. It was a personal matter for her. I’m not going to intrude on her privacy by talking to you about that. It is a personal matter.”Asked if Reeves would remain in her post, Starmer said: “She will be chancellor by the time this is broadcast, she will be chancellor for a very long time to come, because this project that we’ve been working on to change the Labour party, to win the election, change the country, that is a project which the chancellor and I’ve been working on together.”An ally of the prime minister earlier suggested that MPs needed to stay calm and recognise that government would regularly throw up difficult moments. They added: “Who hasn’t cried at work? Obviously it’s not ideal but I think we all need to take a breath and calm down.”While economists have focused on the need for the chancellor to raise taxes at the budget, Treasury sources have warned there would now be implications for spending priorities, including ones popular with Labour MPs such as the £3.5bn cost of scrapping the two-child cap on benefit payments.“We’re not going to bluff this, we’re not going to hide it. We’re going to be clear there is a financial cost to this,” said one ally of Reeves. “Labour MPs need to understand that. Of course, tax is one of the levers we could have to pull. We’re not going to duck that.“Those Labour MPs and charities and others who want the two-child limit lifted – how are you going to pay for it now? Labour MPs made a choice last night and the government accepted that choice, but we are going to be honest that that choice comes at cost, because it does.”However, one cabinet minister said that while it would now be harder to meet the financial cost of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, the scale of the Labour rebellion over welfare suggested there might be a political imperative to do so.“We can’t go into the next election without child poverty coming down, and the cap is the most cost-effective and efficient way to do that,” they said.Meanwhile, Treasury insiders ruled out further changes to the fiscal rules. “That means more debt interest, taxpayers’ money going to hedge funds. Is that a progressive thing?” one said.No definitive plans are yet in motion for how to fill the hole left by the welfare U-turn. A government source said it would depend on future economic growth, as well as oil prices and receipts that the Treasury receives from its clampdown on tax evasion.The incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Helen Miller, said: “Since departmental spending plans are now effectively locked in, and the government has already had to row back on planned cuts to pensioner benefits and working-age benefits, tax rises would look increasingly likely. This will doubtless intensify the speculation over the summer about which taxes may rise and by how much.”Starmer declined to rule out tax rises this year. When pushed by Badenoch, he said: “No prime minister or chancellor ever stands at the dispatch box and writes budgets in the future.”The second reading of the government’s welfare bill passed its first Commons test only after a central element – changes to personal independence payments – was removed on Tuesday.The bill passed with 49 Labour MPs rebelling, more than three times bigger than the government’s previous biggest rebellion.Explore more on these topicsLabourRachel ReevesKeir StarmerWelfareTax and spendingPMQsHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their promised transformation will ensure it works in a more patient-friendly way and offers faster care, with health professionals providing a greater range of services in the same place and spotting illness earlier.The “three big shifts” in the way the health service operates will involve it becoming more tech-based, moving significant amounts of care into community settings and giving greater priority to preventing illness rather than treating it.But, as theHealthFoundation chief executive, Dr Jennifer Dixon, said: “These ambitions have appeared in NHS plans for decades.”So how different is Labour’s new NHS plan from its predecessors?2000: Then prime minister Tony Blair and his health secretaryAlan Milburnunveiled the NHSplan.This set out how the service would spend the significant extra money that flowed from Blair’s pledge months earlier to raise health spending to the European Union average, after theNHShad suffered a winter crisis in 1999-2000.It led to the NHS getting more staff, more beds, more equipment and new facilities. It also set out shorter waiting times for patients to access treatment and gave them more choice over their care. And it included new partnerships between the NHS and the private sector.The plan is widely credited with kickstarting the rebuilding of the NHS after years of neglect under the Conservatives and leading to patients getting the quickest access to care ever seen.2014: Then NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens publishedtheFive Year Forward View.It arrived after the Conservative health secretary Andrew Lansley’s reorganisation of the NHS in England andRobert Francis’s reportinto the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust care scandal. The NHS was also struggling with the coalition government’s austerity funding, which gave it far smaller budget increases than before.The plan sought to refocus the NHS to help it cope with the needs of the ageing population. It outlined plans for 50 sites that would test “new models of care”, based on different types of services – like GP surgeries, hospitals and social care – working together.It also said a “radical upgrade” in preventive health and public health measures was needed to stem a rising tide of illness.However, arecent Health Foundation analysisfound the plan’s “impact was mixed and spreading new models of care proved challenging”.“Indeed, better integration of health and social care services has been a consistent and elusive objective of NHS plans since at least the 1970s,” it said.2019: Thenprime minister Theresa May and Stevens publishedthe NHSlong-termplan.Like Wednesday’s document, it was intended to lead to dramatic changes over the next decade in the way the NHS works.It emerged as the NHS was starting to come under pressure, as staff shortages and delays for all sorts of care – in A&E, at GP practices and for hospital treatment – became a major political problem.It set out changes the service would make in return for the multibillion-pound injection of extra funding May had promised the year before in the run-up to its 70th birthday in July 2018.It included plans to bolster out-of-hospital care, reduce waiting times, “more NHS action on prevention” and enhanced use of technology.The long history of NHS reform plans shows that headline-grabbing changes ministers pledge do not always follow and, when they do, they can be slow, patchy and invisible to patients.Explore more on these topicsLabourNHSHealth policyKeir StarmerHealthWes StreetingEnglandexplainersShareReuse this content"

Davie was at the festival in the hours after the set and ordered the content not to feature in any further BBC coverage, but technical issues meant it remained on the iPlayer for several hours.In an email to the BBC’s Jewish staff network, he said he appreciated “how deeply upset and concerned you must feel about the actions of Bob Vylan on Saturday”.“I was, and remain, appalled by Bob Vylan’s deeply offensive and totally unacceptable behaviour during his Glastonbury set,” he said. “It has no place on the BBC. Also, I understand the strength of feeling in relation to the events of this weekend and other concerns from colleagues.“Let me be clear, there is absolutely no place for antisemitism at the BBC. We are all utterly committed to creating an environment where everyone is supported and can do their very best work.”Davie has come under pressure over the BBC’s coverage of the Middle East from several angles. He is also facing criticism forfailing to show a documentary about medics in Gaza, with more than 100 BBC staff anonymously signing a letter criticising the decision. Channel 4 will broadcast the documentary on Wednesday night.The government has applied significant pressure on Davie over the Bob Vylan set. The BBC has been handed a series of questions by ministers and the culture select committee about what due diligence was done on the band before Glastonbury.It has since emerged that a month before the festival, vocalistRobinson-Fosterallegedly made similar comments at Alexandra Palace, where the band were supporting Iggy Pop. He reportedly said on stage: “Death to every single IDF soldier out there, as an agent of terror for Israel. Death to the IDF.”On Wednesday evening the Metropolitan police said that officers were investigating comments allegedly made at a concert on 28 May. It was not clear when the investigation was launched.Since Glastonbury, the band have said they have been “targeted for speaking up” over Gaza. “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people,” they said. “[We] are not the story. We are a distraction from the story. And whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction.“The government doesn’t want us to ask why they remain silent in the face of this atrocity? To ask why they aren’t doing more to stop the killing? To feed the starving?”Explore more on these topicsTim DavieBBCAntisemitismGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

A visual guideRead moreParnell’s description of the strikes marked a more measured estimate than Trump’s assertions about the level of destruction. A low-confidence Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report based on early assessments said Iran’s program was set back several months.The evolving picture of the severity of the damage to Iran’s nuclear program comes as US intelligence agencies have continued to push out new assessments, using materials that suggested the centrifuges at the key Fordow enrichment site were destroyed even if it was unclear whether the facility itself had caved in.Trump advisers have used that material, which include the use of video taken from B-2 bombers to confirm simulation models of shock waves destroying centrifuges and other Israeli intel from outside Fordow, to defend Trump’s assertions, two people familiar with the matter said.The extent of the damage to Iran’s nuclear program and the fate of the country’s stockpile of enriched uranium – which could quickly be turned into a crude nuclear weapon – is important because it could dictate how long the program has been set back.The head of the UN nuclear watchdog said on Sunday that Iran could be producing enriched uranium in a few months.“They can have in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium,” Rafael Grossi the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said, adding “Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology … You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have.”The Pentagon’s preliminary DIA assessment, which was based on information from little more than 24 hours after the strikes,the Guardian previously reported, found the damage could range from Iran being able to restart the facility with new centrifuges to having to abandon it for future use.The DIA report assessed the program had been pushed back by several months, although that finding was made at the so-called “low-confidence” level, reflecting the early nature of the assessment and the uncertainty intelligence agencies have with initial conclusions.Trump advisers have pushed back on the DIA report and said privately the destruction of the centrifuges alone meant they had taken out a key component of Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons and meant it delayed the nuclear program by years.Battles over the conclusions of intelligence agencies have been at the center of American foreign policy determinations for decades, from warnings about Iraq’s weapons programs that the Bush administration used to justify the 2003 invasion that were later found to be false, to claims that a Chinese lab leak was responsible for Covid.Still, much of the controversy about the US strikes has been generated by Trump’s claiming that they “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites, which no intelligence agency has directly repeated because it is not a characterization used in intelligence assessments.Verifying the extent of the damage was made more difficult on Wednesday, after Iran put into effect a new law to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. Iran has accused the nuclear watchdog of siding with western countries and providing a justification for Israel’s airstrikes.A state department spokesperson called the move “unacceptable” and said Iran must fully comply with its nuclear non-proliferation treaty obligations, including by providing the IAEA with information on undeclared nuclear material and providing unrestricted access to any newly announced enrichment facility.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryIranUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision follows a mixed verdict that saw him found guilty of some charges but acquitted of the most serious allegations.Here are the key moments from today at a glance:A jury of eight men and four women convicted Combs of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted him of the more serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking.Judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs’s request for bail while he awaits sentencing, citing evidence of violence in his relationships as part of the decision.Combs faces up to 20 years in prison for the two charges he’s been convicted of. The prosecution said it would seek the maximum sentence. Each count carries up to 10 years.The judge proposed 3 October as a sentencing date but Combs’s legal team said it would push for expedited sentencing.Combs told his family after being denied bail: “We’re gonna make it through this I’ll see you when I get out. I love you all. Be strong.”In a post-court press briefing, the musician’s legal team celebrated the mixed verdict as a “great victory”, criticizingNew Yorkprosecutors for charging Combs.Family and fans of the music mogul embraced in the courtroom. One friend said the verdict moved him to tears.Combs himself was seen kneeling in prayer after the verdict. “I’m gonna be home soon,” Combs said, smiling and clasping his hands. “I love you. Thank you, I love you.”The streets outside the courtroom in lower Manhattan were packed with supporters and critics of the star. NYPD officers put up barricades to keep growing crowds at bay.The attorney for Cassie Ventura, Doug Wigdor, said outside the courthouse that his team is pleased that Sean “Diddy” Combs has “finally been held accountable”. “Of course, we would have liked to have seen a conviction on the sex crimes and Rico, but we understand that ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ is a high standard,” he said. “We’re just pleased he still faces substantial jail time.”This blog is now closing.

We’re facing a reality of the impact on shutting down almost half of abortion-providing health centers,” Alexis McGill Johnson,Planned ParenthoodFederation of Americas’s CEO, said in an interview Wednesday morning. “It does feel existential. Not just for Planned Parenthood, but for communities that are relying on access to this care.”Anti-abortion activists have longed to “defund”Planned Parenthoodfor decades. They are closer than ever to achieving their goal.That $700m figure represents the loss that Planned Parenthood would face from a provision in the spending bill that would impose a one-yearMedicaidban on healthcare non-profits that offer abortions and that received more than $800,000 in federal funding in 2023, as well as the funding that Planned Parenthood could lose from Title X, the nation’s largest family-planning program. In late March, theTrump administration frozetens of millions of dollars of Title X funding that had been set aside for some Planned Parenthood and other family-planning clinics.“Essentially what you are seeing is a gutting of a safety net,” said McGill Johnson, who characterized the bill as a “backdoor abortion ban” in a statement.Medicaid is the US government’s insurance program for low-income people, and about 80 million people use it. If the latest version of the spending-and-tax bill passes, nearly 12 million people are expected to lose their Medicaid coverage.Donald Trumphas said that he would like the bill to be on his desk, ready for a signature, by 4 July.The provision attacking Planned Parenthood would primarily target clinics in blue states that have protected abortion rights since the overturning of Roe v Wade three years ago, because those blue states have larger numbers of people on Medicaid. Although not all Planned Parenthood clinics perform abortions, the reproductive healthcare giant provides 38% of US abortions, according to the latestdatafrom Abortion Care Network, a membership group for independent abortion clinics.Among the clinics at risk of closure, Planned Parenthood estimated, more than 90% are in states that permit abortion. Sixty percent are located in areas that have been deemed “medically underserved”.In total, more than 1.1 million Planned Parenthood patients could lose access to care.“There’s nowhere else for folks” to go, McGill Johnson said. “The community health centers have said they cannot absorb the patients that Planned Parenthood sees. So I think that we do need to just call it a targeted attack because that’s exactly how it is.”Nationally, 11% of female Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of 15 and 49 and who receive family-planning services go to Planned Parenthood for a range of services, according to ananalysisby the non-profit KFF, which tracks healthcare policy. Those numbers rise in blue states like Washington, Oregon and Connecticut.In California, that number soars to 29%. The impact on the state would be so devastating that Nichole Ramirez, senior vice-president of communication and donor relations at Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties, called the tax-and-spending package’s provision “a direct attack on us, really”.“They haven’t been able to figure out how to ban abortion nationwide and they haven’t been able to figure out how to ban abortion in California specifically,” said Ramirez, who estimated that Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties stands to lose between $40m and $60m. Ramirez continued: “This is their way to go about banning abortion. That is the entire goal here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In June, as the spending-and-tax bill moved through Congress,Autonomy News, an outlet that focuses on threats to bodily autonomy, reported that Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s accreditation board had sent waivers out to affiliates to apply for approval to cease providing abortions in order to preserve access to Medicaid funding. On Wednesday, theNew York Times reportedthat a memo sent to the leadership of one California affiliate suggests that leaders there had considered ending abortion services.McGill Johnson said that there have been discussions within Planned Parenthood’s network about what it would mean to stop offering abortions. But no affiliates, to her knowledge, are moving forward with plans to stop performing the procedure.“Educating our volunteers and teams around hard decisions to stand and understand the impact of that is different than weighing and considering a stoppage of abortion,” McGill Johnson said.The budget bill and Title X funding freeze aren’t the only sources of pressure on the group. The US supreme court last week ruled in favor ofSouth Carolinain a case involving the state’s attempt to kick Planned Parenthood out of its state Medicaid reimbursement program – a ruling that will likely give a green light to other states that also want to defund Planned Parenthood.At least one other organization that provides abortion and family-planning services, Maine Family Planning, will be affected by the provision, according to the organization’s CEO, George Hill. Maine Family Planning directly operates 18 clinics, including several that provide primary care or are in rural, medically underserved areas. If the provision takes effect, Hill estimates, the organization would lose 20% of its operating budget.“It’s dressed up as a budget provision, but it’s not,” Hill said. “They’re basically taking the rug out from under our feet.”Explore more on these topicsPlanned ParenthoodTrump administrationUS CongressUS domestic policyUS taxationAbortionWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Yet in the years since then, the company has moved in the opposite direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence. In its latestsustainability report, Google said its carbon emissions had increased 51% between 2019 and 2024.New research aims to debunkeven that enormous figure and provide context to Google’s sustainability reports, painting a bleaker picture. A report authored by non-profit advocacy group Kairos Fellowship found that, between 2019 and 2024, Google’s carbon emissions actually went up by 65%. What’s more, between2010, the first year there is publicly available data on Google’s emissions, and 2024, Google’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 1,515%, Kairos found. The largest year-over-year jump in that window was also the most recent, 2023 to 2024, when Google saw a 26% increase in emissions just between 2023 and 2024, according to the report.“Google’s own data makes it clear: the corporation is contributing to the acceleration of climate catastrophe, and the metrics that matter – how many emissions they emit, how much water they use, and how fast these trends are accelerating – are headed in the wrong direction for us and the planet,” said Nicole Sugerman, a campaign manager at Kairos Fellowship.The authors say that they found the vast majority of the numbers they used to determine how much energy Google is using and how much its carbon emissions are increasing in the appendices of Google’s own sustainability reports. Many of those numbers were not highlighted in the main body of Google’s reports, they say.Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasRead moreAfter the report published, Google called its findings into question in a statement.“The analysis by the Kairos Fellowship distorts the facts. Our carbon emissions are calculated according to the widely used Greenhouse Gas Protocol and assured by a third party. Our carbon reduction ambition has been validated by the leading industry body, the Science Based Targets initiative,” said a spokesperson, Maggie Shiels.The authors behind the report, titled Google’s Eco-Failures, attribute the discrepancy between the numbers they calculated and the numbers Google highlights in its sustainability reports to various factors, including that the firm uses a different metric for calculating how much its emissions have increased. While Google uses market-based emissions, the researchers used location-based emissions. Location-based emissions are the average emissions the company produces from its use of local power grids, while market-based emissions include energy the company has purchased to offset its total emissions.“[Location-based emissions] represents a company’s ‘real’ grid emissions,” said Franz Ressel, the lead researcher and report co-author. “Market-based emissions are a corporate-friendly metric that obscures a polluter’s actual impact on the environment. It allows companies to pollute in one place, and try to ‘offset’ those emissions by purchasing energy contracts in another place.”The energy the tech giant has needed to purchase to power its data centers alone increased 820% since 2010, according to Kairos’s research, a figure that is expected to expand in the future as Google rolls out more AI products. Between 2019 and 2024, emissions that came primarily from the purchase of electricity to power data centers jumped 121%, the report’s authors said.“In absolute terms, the increase was 6.8 TWh, or the equivalent of Google adding the entire state of Alaska’s energy use in one year to their previous use,” said Sugerman.Based on Google’s current trajectory, the Kairos report’s authors say the company is unlikely to meet its own 2030 deadline without a significant push from the public. There are three categories of greenhouse gas emissions – called Scopes 1, 2 and 3 – and Google has only meaningfully decreased its Scope 1 emissions since 2019, according to the Kairos report. Scope 1 emissions, which include emissions just from Google’s own facilities and vehicles, account for only 0.31% of the company’s total emissions, according to the report. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come primarily from the electricity Google purchases to power its facilities, and scope 3 accounts for indirect emissions from all other sources such as suppliers, use of Google’s consumer devices or employee business travel.“It’s not sustainable to keep building at the rate [Google is] building because they need to scale their compute within planetary limits,” said Sugerman. “We do not have enough green energy to serve the needs of Google and certainly not the needs of Google and the rest of us.”Thirsty, power-hungry data centersAs the company builds out resource-intensive data centers across the country, experts are also paying close attention to Google’s water usage. According to the company’s own sustainability report, Google’s water withdrawal – how much water is taken from various sources – increased 27% between 2023 and 2024 to 11bn gallons of water.The amount is “enough to supply the potable water needs for the 2.5 million people and 5,500 industrial users in Boston and its suburbs for 55 days”, according to the Kairos report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amazon employees recently put forth a package of shareholder proposals that asked the company to disclose its overall carbon emissions and targeted the climate impact of its data centers. Theproposalswere ultimately voted down. On Sunday, several organizations including Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club, published anopen letterin the San Francisco Chronicle and the Seattle Times calling on the CEOs of Google, Amazon and Microsoft to “commit to no new gas and zero delayed coal plant retirements to power your data centers”.“In just the last two years alone, your companies have built data centers throughout the United States capable of consuming more electricity than four million American homes,” the letter reads. “Within five years, your data centers alone will use more electricity than 22 million households, rivaling the consumption of multiple mid-size states.”Google’s emissions up 51% as AI electricity demand derails efforts to go greenRead moreIn its own sustainability report, Google warns that the firm’s “future trajectories” may be affected by the “evolving landscape” of the tech industry.“We’re at an extraordinary inflection point, not just for our company specifically, but for the technology industry as a whole – driven by the rapid growth of AI,” the report reads. “The combination of AI’s potential for non-linear growth driven by its unprecedented pace of development and the uncertain scale of clean energy and infrastructure needed to meet this growth makes it harder to predict our future emissions and could impact our ability to reduce them.”The Kairos report accuses Google of relying “heavily on speculative technologies, particularly nuclear power”, to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030.“Google’s emphasis on nuclear energy as a clean energy ‘solution’ is particularly concerning, given the growing consensus among both scientists and business experts that their successful deployment on scale, if it is to ever occur, cannot be achieved in the near or mid-term future,” the report reads.The Kairos report alleges the way that Google presents some of its data is misleading. In the case of data center emissions, for example, Google says it has improved the energy efficiency of its data centers by 50% over 13 years. Citing energy efficiency numbers rather than sharing absolute ones obscures Google’s total emissions, the authors argue.“In fact, since 2010, the company’s total energy consumption has increased 1,282%,” the report concluded.Explore more on these topicsGoogleAlphabetGreenhouse gas emissionsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

On the campaign trail last year, Trump threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcasting licence if elected.The lawsuit also alleged that CBS aired two versions of the interview in which Harris appeared to give different answers to the same question about the Israel-Hamas war. CBS said the lawsuit was “completely without merit” and had asked a judge to dismiss it.In an amended complaint filed in February, Trump increased his claim for damages to $20bn and added a claim that CBS’s editing of the interview violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, which makes it illegal to use false, misleading or deceptive acts in commerce.The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee. The case entered mediation in April.The settlement includes an agreement that 60 Minutes would release transcripts of interviews with future US presidential candidates after they aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Edward A Paltzik, a lawyer representing Trump in the civil suit, could not be immediately reached for comment.Paltzik has previously said “real accountability for CBS and Paramount will ensure that the president is compensated for the harm done to him, and will deter the fake news from further distorting the facts to advance a partisan agenda”.The settlement comes as Paramount prepares for an $8.4bn merger with Skydance Media, which requires the approval of federal regulators at the FCC.But US and California lawmakers have said any settlement may violate bribery laws.“Paramount appears to be trying to settle a lawsuit that it has assessed as ‘completely without merit’,” the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden said in a May letter to Paramount’s chair, Shari Redstone.“Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act.“If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials, they may be breaking the law.”Sanders said it was “a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press – an essential part of our democracy. It is a victory for a president who is attempting to stifle dissent and undermine American democracy.”The settlement is the latest example of media corporate parent companies making concessions to Trump and theTrump administration, which frequently casts unfavorable coverage as “fake news”.On Tuesday, Trump and the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, threatened to sue CNN over its reporting on an app designed to help people avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and over the reporting of a damage assessment on Iran’s nuclear facilities that was unfavorable to the administration’s claims.The settlement also comes after Meta Platforms, the Facebook and Instagram parent company, said on 29 January it had agreed to pay about $25m to settle a lawsuit by Trump over the company’s suspension of his accounts after the 6 January 2021 attack at the US Capitol.Paramount’s decision to settle the case – which has reportedly caused deep upset in the CBS newsroom – also follows ABC News agreeing to pay $15m to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate comments by the anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found civilly liable for rape.Explore more on these topicsParamount PicturesCBSDonald TrumpTrump administrationKamala HarrisUS television industryUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Details were scarce and it was not immediately clear how the trans-shipment provision would be implemented.Vietnam would also provide the United States with more market access, with US exports to the country facing no tariffs, Trump said. That agreement appears to include US exporters of large-engine cars, according to Trump and Vietnamese state media.Nike expects Trump tariffs to cost it $1bnRead more“It is my Great Honor to announce that I have just made a Trade Deal with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,” Trump said on Truth Social.“It is my opinion that the SUV or, as it is sometimes referred to, Large Engine Vehicle, which does so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam,” Trump said.The Vietnamese president, Tô Lâm, asked in a phone call with Trump earlier on Wednesday that the United States recognize Vietnam as a market economy and remove restrictions on the exports of hi-tech products to the country, Vietnam News Agency reported. Those changes have long been sought by Hanoi and dismissed by Washington.Since Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese goods in his first term, US trade with Vietnam has exploded, though almost all of it in the form of goods to the United States from Vietnam as importers sought workarounds for the China levies.Since 2018, Vietnam’s exports are up nearly threefold from less than $50bn that year to about $137bn in 2024, Census Bureau data shows. US exports to Vietnam are up only about 30% in that time – to just over $13bn last year from less than $10bn in 2018.The White House and the Vietnamese trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump announced a wave of tariffs for countries around the world on 2 April, before pausing the implementation of most duties until 9 July. More than a dozen countries are actively negotiating with theTrump administrationto avoid a steep rise in tariffs on their exports.The Trump administration has teased that a deal with India is also coming soon, but it has said that others may not be ready by 9 July.Britain negotiated a limited trade deal with the Trump administration, accepting a 10% US tariff on many goods, including autos, in exchange for special access for aircraft engines and British beef.Like the agreement struck with Britain in May, the one with Vietnam resembles more a framework than a finalized trade pact.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationInternational tradeTrump tariffsVietnamDonald TrumpEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts had expected it to report deliveries of about 394,378 vehicles, according to an average of 23 estimates from the financial research firm Visible Alpha, though projections went to as low as 360,080 units based on estimates from 10 analysts over the past month. Analysts use the number of vehicles delivered to customers as a metric of success to evaluate both automotive sales and production.Tesla shares fall as company reports first decline in annual deliveriesRead more“The market is reacting to the deliveries not being as bad as potentially thought with multiple analysts cutting their forecasts over the past week,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.The stock has lost 25% of its value so far this year as investors feared brand damage in Europe, where sales have slumped most sharply, and in the US from Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics and his role in spearheading the Trump administration’s cost-cutting effort. The day Trump and Musk split publicly in early June, Tesla lost about $150bn in market value. Its share price has somewhat recovered in the ensuing month, but Trump and Musk have likewise reignited their feud as they spar over Trump’s sweeping tax bill.Tesla’s plummeting deliveries in a steadily growing global EV market come despite Musk saying in April that sales had turned around.The company refreshed its top-selling Model Y crossover earlier this year to boost demand, but the redesign forced a production halt and prompted some buyers to delay purchases in anticipation of the updated version.Most of Tesla’s revenue and profit come from its core EV business, and much of its trillion-dollar valuation hangs on Musk’s big bet on converting its vehicles into robotaxis.Tesla last month rolled out a robotaxi service in limited parts of Austin, Texas, for a select group of invitees and with several restrictions, including having a safety monitor in the front passenger seat. The pilot was limited, though, with only about a dozen Robotaxis on the road. The US National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration opened an investigation into the launch of the autonomous ride service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the CMA said that they were not sufficient to address its concerns.The CMA told Ticketmaster the voluntary undertakings it would accept to address its concerns.In a letter to the business and trade select committee – which has been investigating ticket pricing, competition and consumer protection – the CMA said it received a response from Ticketmaster this month.“Having carefully considered Ticketmaster’s response, the CMA’s view is that there is a fundamental disagreement … about whether Ticketmaster’s practices infringed consumer law,” the CMA said in a section of its submission relating to the Oasis investigation,publishedon Wednesday.“Ticketmaster has declined to provide undertakings in the terms sought by the CMA or indicate whether there is a form of undertakings which it would be prepared to offer.”The CMA is concerned that the ticketing company may have breached consumer protection law by labelling certain seats as “platinum”, and selling them for almost 2.5 times the price of standard equivalent tickets, without sufficiently explaining that they did not offer any additional benefits and were often located in the same area of a stadium as standard tickets.The regulator also said fans were not informed there were two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with many waiting lengthy periods in online queues without understanding they would be paying much higher prices than they expected.It also said that while it had not found evidence that Ticketmaster used an algorithmic“dynamic” pricing modelduring the Oasis sale it was concerned that consumers were “not given clear and timely information about how the pricing of standing tickets would work”.The CMA said that the failure of the consultation process with Ticketmaster meant that it was now in a position to look at taking legal action.“The CMA has written to Ticketmaster to confirm that it has now discharged its obligation to consult with Ticketmaster and, given that no undertakings have been offered or agreed, is now preparing to litigate the matter if necessary,” it said in the letter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s an interesting thought if you think it through. We are really at a tipping point and it has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine, it’s a complete change of global relationships.”Scherer said the world economy had been “lifted on the backs of people working hard for Europe in China, in India” and the new balance in the global supply chain was the western leaders’ own creation.Scherer said he was not pleading for special treatment and was confident AMG would succeed in the auto market’s green transition, but was not optimistic that Europe’s dependency on China would change.AMG Lithium in Bitterfeld-Wolfen in former east Germany opened last year and aims to produce 20,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide a year, enough to supply 500,000 EVs. It produced its first test batch last month and hopes to produce commercial quantities later this year.Scherer said he has “no doubts that we will be able to sell this [product] within Europe”, but added: “I’m talking more about the long term; about strategic investment in European resources, European refineries, this has to happen now, because it takes you five years if you are lucky to get this far.”View image in fullscreenBitterfeld-Wolfen where AMG Lithium’s factory is situated.Photograph: Kristin Bethge/The GuardianIt has taken the company five years and £150m to get to its current position, with no sign of a rival for two or three years. “It is a slow process,” he said.He was highly critical of the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act 2024 (CRMA), seen as the backbone of the EU’s strategy to reduce its reliance on China, arguing it fails to match US moves to push manufacturers to buy locally.“Unfortunately, the CRMA doesn’t hold you responsible for anything, for example, in the mining of raw materials there is no incentivisation or penalisation to do mining in Europe,” he said.“It is completely opposite to the US where they have a local content policy that sticks. There, they have to have a certain percentage of materials they see as critical to be produced on US soil.“We don’t have that. We have intentions, but nothing tangible. You don’t have to pay if you don’t buy from the EU, so why would you? Instead, you just continue purchasing from China.”China, by contrast, has a near 20-year start on Europe, having set the strategy to acquire stakes in mines and supply contracts all over the world as part of Xi Jinping’s 2013 belt and road initiative.It now refines 60% of the world’s supply of lithium on its own soil and controls 60% of the world’s production of battery components, giving it a dominant position across the markets.The consensus in his industry is that those in the critical raw material sector need protection while they go through the lengthy process of trying to grow to match Chinese state-backed rivals, Scherer said.“I don’t mean you have to support every investment with public grants,” he said. He suggested Brussels could offer temporary tariffs or tax incentives similar to the US’s Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivises those who buy home-produced lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite – all critical to creating green technologies.Brussels and Washington are still thrashing out trade negotiations before the 9 July deadline whena threatened 50% tariffcould be imposed on all EU imports to the US. European negotiators are seeking to trim a possible 10% baseline levy and win concessions in key areas, including trying to reduce a 25% border tax imposed on cars and a 50% rate on steel and aluminium.As far as Scherer is concerned, Germany’s struggling auto industry may yet have further to fall before it improves. “You cannot wait for Brussels to make decisions,” he said.One of his biggest gripes is the price of energy in Germany, which Eurostat puts at 37% higher than the EU average. It is also the bugbear of the German steel industry withThyssenKrupp warning last night that the sector could be wiped outby a combination of Trump tariffs, high energy costs and cheaper Chinese imports.Combining temporary tariffs and tax incentives with an invitation to the Chinese to invest in Europe on condition they employ Europeans could be the answer, Scherer said.“We have to create an environment which enables western companies to safeguard their investments, not for everything, but critical technology especially in the auto industry where you are replacing the internal combustion engine technology with a new one. This is highly strategic and important move.”Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeAutomotive industryGermanyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEuropean UnionGlobal economyChinese economynewsShareReuse this content"

The system in question was a third-party platform used by the airline’s contact centre, which contains the records of 6 million customers.The data includes customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers. It did not contain credit card details, financial information or passport details.Frequent flyer accounts were not compromised, neither were passwords, Pins or login details.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailQantas said it first detected the unusual activity on Monday and immediately took steps to contain the system.Qantas is assessing the portion of data stolen but said it was expected to be “significant”.In an updated statement to customers on Wednesday afternoon, Qantas said the cybercriminal had “targeted a call centre and gained access to a third-party customer servicing platform”.The identity of the attacker is not yet known but is believed to bear similarities to the tactics of the so-called Scattered Spider ransomware group that had been targeting airlinesand retail storesin the US and UK.The Guardianreported in Maythat Scattered Spider is unusual among hacking groups deploying ransomware because it is composed of native English speakers from countries such as the UK, US and Canada.The FBI last week warned airlines in the US that the group was targeting the aviation sector. In a poston X, the FBI said the group uses social engineering techniques, often impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access, and bypassing multi-factor authentication.“They target large corporations and their third-party IT providers, which means anyone in the airline ecosystem, including trusted vendors and contractors, could be at risk,” the FBI said.They then steal sensitive data for extortion and often deploy ransomware that locks up company systems.The federal minister responsible for cybersecurity, Tony Burke, would not confirm when asked on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing on Wednesday afternoon whether it was the Scattered Spider ransomware group. Burke said he had been briefed, but would allow the cybersecurity agencies to make the announcements on any alleged culprits.“The reality is with these networks, they’ll go where they can find vulnerability,” he said.Burke said when companies rely on third parties for their systems, it makes their cybersecurity obligations “more complex”.Qantas said it has informed the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, as well as the Australian federal police.The airline’s chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, said the company had recruited independent specialised cybersecurity experts to investigate the matter.A dedicated customer support line and a dedicated page on the company’s website will update customers as the investigation progresses.“We sincerely apologise to our customers and we recognise the uncertainty this will cause,” Hudson said. “Our customers trust us with their personal information and we take that responsibility seriously.Qantas rebounds from worst-ever performance to be named world’s 14th best airline in rankingRead more“We are contacting our customers today and our focus is on providing them with the necessary support.”Cyber-attacks remain on the increase in Australia,after superannuation funds in April suffered hacks on a small handful of customersthat resulted in more than $500,000 being taken from their accounts.In May, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner said the number of data breaches reported under the mandatory notification scheme had increased by 25% in 2024, compared with 2023.According to the report covering 1 July to 31 December 2024, there were 595 data breaches in the latter half of the year, taking the total number of breaches reported that year to 1,113, up 25% from 893 in 2023.In the half year, the highest number of reports came from health providers (121) followed by government (100), finance (54), legal and accounting (36), and retail (34).The report found 69% of the data breaches occurred due to malicious or criminal attack, with phishing – that is, using compromised credentials to access data – being the most common at 34% of such incidents. It was followed by ransomware at 24%.The majority of reported breaches affected fewer than 5,000 people each but two were reported to affect between 500,000 and 1 million people. Most personal information in the breaches comprised contact information, ID information or financial or health information.Explore more on these topicsQantasCybercrimeAirline industryInternetShareReuse this content"

As her troublesome back injury continued to restrict her work on the practice court, she has also had to deal with undisclosed personal issues. Her expectations for the tournament were low.It is reflective of Raducanu’s personal growth and maturity that she has taken those difficulties in her stride and found a way to continue to move forward. In one of her most significant matches of the year so far, the British No 1 spectacularly rose to the occasion on Centre Court, producing a brilliant performance to outplaythe 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova6-3, 6-3 and return to the third round.With the victory, Raducanu set up a highly anticipated showdown with Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1. The Belarusian had earlier defeated Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (4), 6-4.Raducanu revels in Centre Court joy after ‘one of the best matches I’ve played’Read more“I think today I played really, really well,” Raducanu said. “There were some points that I have no idea how I turned around, one for sure that I remember in the second set. I knew playing Marketa was going to be an extremely difficult match, she’s won this tournament and it’s a huge, huge achievement. She’s also in form really well. I’m just so happy about how I competed, put my game on the court and I was just focused the whole way through.”Despite Vondrousova’s lesser ranking of No 73, this was an extremely difficult match against one of the most in-form players in the draw and Raducanu was the underdog. Even though the Czech has endured an injury-ravaged career, her talent has always been undeniable and she offered a reminder of it 10 days ago by spectacularly winning the Berlin Open, with wins over Sabalenka and Madison Keys. Her form, and the fact that she defeated Raducanu in their only meeting this year, in Abu Dhabi in February, made her the favourite.As the late afternoon shadow expanded across the court and both players settled into the familiar surroundings of Wimbledon’s showcase, the early exchanges offered few surprises. While the Briton tried to dictate from the beginning by taking the ball early and changing directions frequently, Vondrousova attempted to arrest her rhythm by constantly mixing up the trajectory, spin and speed of her shots while placing the ball in difficult positions.But Raducanu was ready. She served well early on and her comfortable early service games emboldened her to take full control of the baseline. She imposed sustained pressure on Vondrousova with her relentless aggression, eventually taking the first break of the opening set with a supreme running backhand down-the-line passing shot, establishing a 4-2 lead. Raducanu did not allow her poor subsequent service game to dent her confidence, immediately retrieving the break before closing out the set.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu comfortably outplayed her in-form opponent on Centre Court.Photograph: The GuardianWith the first set secured, Raducanu continued to put Vondrousova under constant pressure, suffocating the Czech with her return and particularly striking her forehand brilliantly. Raducanu’s relentless positivity on court has been notable recently; almost every winning shot was punctuated with a triumphant fist-pump, but her composure in the decisive moments was even more impressive. She remained calm throughout the second set, serving extremely well as the finishing line neared.Raducanu said: “I knew today, I had to be aggressive because Marketa would beat me if I was gonna push the ball around but Mark [Petchey] has helped me a lot. Everyone in that box has really been there for me, my friends, it’s amazing to have them here as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raducanu has strived to surround herself with familiar faces she trusts in order to ensure that she can be completely honest with both the people surrounding her and herself. She has come to understand that the only way she can find success in this sport is if she understands how to enjoy her work.Katie Boulter crashes out of Wimbledon with misfiring serve as Sonay Kartal advancesRead moreAlong with the improvements to her mental approach, this performance was also a reflection of three months of work with Petchey, her current coach. Despite their unusual ad-hoc setup, with Petchey often planning their work around his broadcasting schedule, Raducanu has taken positive steps forward.They have worked hard on her serve, which after being a massive liability earlier this year was excellent in the important moments, particularly as she fended off break chances deep in the second set. She has forced herself to dictate more with her forehand, and the improvements on that stroke were clear as Raducanu ensured that her forehand was the dominant stroke in the match. She will now try to bring both her growing confidence and quality to her upcoming meeting with the best player in the world.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Emma RaducanuWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

You want a perfect world where you perform and win but sometimes you perform and you don’t win. We will definitely look back at this game but Switzerland are a top team, playing at home, the opening game, I thought they were fabulous.”There were doubts over the capabilities of theNaticoming into their home Euros. Ramona Bachmann’s anterior cruciate ligament injury denied the host nation a figurehead, Lia Wälti, who was brilliant in Basel, has had her fitness questioned after a stop-start season for Arsenal and only Finland and Wales sat below the Swiss in the Fifa world rankings of the sides here.There was no dampened optimism from the sea of red that marched towards the stadium for an hour in the searing heat, ready to spend an evening peeling sweaty backs off plastic seats as the temperature remained at 32C at kick-off.“We didn’t win the game, there’s such a small difference between being successful and unsuccessful,” said Pia Sundhage, the Switzerland manager. “I’m very disappointed but tomorrow it’s important we look at the performance and take confidence from that.”View image in fullscreenHegerberg heads in Norway’s equaliser.Photograph: Kristian Skeie/Uefa/Getty ImagesThe mood was electric inside St Jakob-Park, the home of FC Basel, in Basel and although the 37,500-capacity stadium was no match for the2022 opener at Old Traffordin scale, it made up for it in volume. “Wäl-ti, Wäl-ti, Wäl- ti” the fans chanted towards their talismanic captain, whose visage adorns Adidas billboards across the city facing off with Germany’s Jule Brand. If a crowd could compensate for the small pool of players available, the league in Switzerland not yet being fully professional and only five of the 23-player squad playing their domestic football on home soil, then it did its best to do so.The energy from the crowd was matched by the energy on the pitch. TheNatihad come to compete, not just host. Expectations around their opponents were cautiously high. Norway possess individual attacking talent that would be the envy of any team and yet they have struggled in tournaments, a team ofgalácticosthat at times look like they don’t know each other. At the World Cup in 2023 they scrapped through the group stage by the skin of their teeth, and they have failed to escape the group in the previous two editions of the European Championship, including suffering a humiliating 8-0 defeat by England in 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, it was the home team that impressed. There was an energy to the Swiss and their wingers in particular had great joy in behind Norway’s wing-backs. Wälti and Géraldine Reuteler both tested the goalkeeper Cecilie Fiskerstrand from distance and their four corners inside 15 minutes were a reflection of their fighting spirit.Reuteler stung the bar, and the opening goal arrived to reward the patient and encouraging crowd four minutes later. Riesen, given an acre of space on the left, swung herself towards the box before sending in a low cross for Smilla Vallotto. She failed to control the ball or get a shot away but Riesen was on hand to collect, creeping it past Fiskerstrand and in.The Swiss began the second half as they had the first, but Norway pulled themselves back into the match out of nowhere nine minutes after the restart, Hegerberg powering in a header from close range after the Swiss goalkeeper Livia Peng had flapped at a rare Norway corner. It was a flattering scoreline for the pre-match favourites and they punished the hosts for not capitalising on their dominance four minutes later, a quiet Graham Hansen bursting to life and escaping 18-year-old Iman Beney on the left before hooking the ball into the middle toward Hegerberg. Julia Stierli got in ahead of the Champions League record goalscorer but deflected the ball into her own net. For the first time the Norwegian fans could be heard over the Swiss, having previously been drowned out and camouflaged, red shirts among red shirts.Ada HegerbergIt was almost disaster for the hosts in the 67th minute when Reuteler handled from a corner and the referee pointed to the spot, but Hegerberg put her penalty wide.After that reprieve, Riesen went down under pressure from Mathilde Harviken at the other end, contact looked minimal, but the video assistant referee overturned the initial penalty decision for a marginal offside in the buildup.Frustrated by Norwegian time wasting – “I don’t want to comment on that,” said Sundhage, when asked about her remarks on TV on the matter – Switzerland fought to the end but they could not find the final ball that would have given them a point. Defeat will hurt, but this was a performance full of promise, one that will act as a warning to Finland and Iceland of what is to come but that also took the fans watching on a journey full of passion that will likely reap rewards.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Switzerland women's football teamNorway women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The unidentified woman also accuses Hairston of intentional infliction of emotional distress. She is seeking a jury trial and compensatory damages.According to the filing, which was reviewed by USA Today, the woman alleges that Hairston unexpectedly showed up at her dorm room on 24 March 2021. He told her he wanted to “hang out” with her, and the woman said she was tired and didn’t want a visitor. She said she was going to bed and walked away from the door.Per USA Today, the woman claims in the lawsuit that Hairston followed her into her bedroom, then forced himself upon her and sexually assaulted her after she rejected his requests to have sex.“Our client showed remarkable strength in coming forward, and we are proud to stand with her in pursuit of accountability and justice,” said Peter Flowers, one of the women’s attorneys, according to the report. “No one – regardless of their status or athletic success – is above the law.“Before the draft, the Bills were aware of the allegations made by the woman, who had filed a report with the university.“He’s an impeccable kid. We did a lot of research,” general manager Brandon Beane said the day after the draft. “I think all teams were aware of the Title IX thing. That was fully investigated by the school. He even volunteered to do a polygraph and had notes. It was one of those where there was zero information saying that this actually happened, to what the accusation was.“You can’t just take someone’s account and think that’s the truth. But yes, we fully investigated that. If there was anything to that, he wouldn’t have been invited to the combine. ... Every person you talk to at Kentucky, teammates, staff there, plus what we’ve done, I would say this is a heck of a young man, every person you ask. That’s unfortunate when things like that are attached to someone’s name; in this case, it doesn’t seem to be anything there.”Explore more on these topicsBuffalo BillsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But despite last month’s “groundbreaking”, its completion is anything but certainDavid LengelWed 2 Jul 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 18.23 EDTShareIt had just turned 8am on a crystal clear, late June Monday morning, but it was already 85F (29C). Despite the tolerable heat (for the desert), a giant air-conditioned tent had been erected on the former site of the Tropicana, the famed hotel which was demolished in a controlled implosion last October. Athletics owner John Fisher, Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred and a gaggle of politicians had gathered on the compact, nine-acre site for a ceremony more than two years in the making: thegroundbreaking for the new A’s stadiumon the Las Vegas Strip, coming your way in 2028.On the surface, it was your run-of-the-mill pomp and circumstance: a series of uneven speeches mixed in with a few kids gushing over how much they can’t wait to have the former Oakland and current A’s in Las Vegas. But if you had been following the long-running A’s stadium saga, one which led them to atemporary minor-league residency in Sacramentothis season, you didn’t have to look far beyond the rented heavy-duty construction props to see the farce, and you didn’t have to dig much deeper than the dignitaries shoveling into the makeshift baseball diamond to understand what this ceremony really was: the latest stop on Fisher’s neverending, would-be stadium tour.The heavy equipment staged behind A’s owner John Fisher at today’s stadium groundbreaking was 𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐲 and isn’t being used in construction, a PR person confirmed. 1/3#Athletics#LasVegas#StadiumDeals#ENR#RentAGroundbreakingpic.twitter.com/hkZRM4PWGy— Doug Puppel (@dougpuppel)June 23, 2025“This could be an entire 10-part Netflix docuseries,” says Neil DeMause, editor ofField of Schemes, a site that follows the trials and travails of stadium construction and renovation in North America. “All the twists and turns in all the different places in the Bay Area they looked, and John Fisher throwing a hissy fit and going off to Las Vegas. And now them being in Sacramento but saying they’re going to move to Las Vegas, but still not actually seemingly making any progress. I mean, it’s a lot.”JC Bradbury, an economist who studies the financing of sports venues, is similarly mystified about what the next step is. “It’s unclear what the endgame of John Fisher is,” he says. “Whether he miscalculated, doesn’t understand, doesn’t care about money, or there’s something I’m just totally missing in all of this”It’s not the first time the A’s have faced questions abouttheir ability to build their new stadium. As far back as 2001, the A’s tried to construct a successor to the aging,dilapidated Oakland Coliseumin at least nine sites across the Bay Area, including their final bid, a waterfront shipping port known as Howard Terminal. The city had agreed to hand Fisher, a part-owner and heir to The Gap clothing empire, some $750m in infrastructure and grants before he controversially pulled out of the deal and fled for the desert.Why would Fisher leavenearly a billion dollars for a park on a 55-acre plot, in a top-10 television market in love with its ballclub, for nine acres and a minuscule market with fans who don’t know their A’s from their elbow? We still don’t know, but there are plenty of new questions to try and answer about a process that doesn’t add despite Fisher, Manfred, and the Vegas officials who insist that everything is on time and on schedule.What we do know is that Fisher has not surpassed the $100m he must spend on the parkto unlock the $380m in public dollars; he’s reportedly spent half that on planning and development. We also know that costs of construction are rising. One of the reasons that Stuart Sternberg, owner of the Tampa Bay Rays, says he pulled out of a $600m public subsidy deal is that Hurricane Milton caused a delay to construction of his new stadium, and so he wantedeven morepublic capital to make him whole on potential overruns. Perhaps seeing a future of cash calls,Sternberg is selling the Rays, another team with long-term stadium issues currently playing home games in a minor league park.Fisher, who on the surface has far less business acumen than Sternberg, has seen construction prices rise for the original 33,000-capacity stadium, which would be the smallest inMLB, from $1.5bn to the $1.75bn figure announced six months ago. With an unstable inflationary environment, potential tariff costs and heavy debate on interest rates, Alexander Marks, who heads up Schools over Stadiums, a protest group that has tried to block massive public subsidies that were provided for a billionaire’s ballpark despite Nevada’s abysmal education rankings, is among critics who believe the price doesn’t add up.View image in fullscreenAthletics owner John Fisher courts potential future fans.Photograph: John Locher/AP“Schools in Clark County aren’t being built because of construction costs,” Marks says. “The Wynn Resorts just announced that they would be putting their renovations on hold because construction costs are up. So it’s kind of odd that this is the one guy in Vegas that has figured out how to keep costs the exact same, which leads me to believe that’s not the case.”Turns out Marks was on to something. On Saturday, just days after the “groundbreaking”, Fisherfinally admittedthat the cost could rise yet again to $2bn. It takes time to get the raw materials and labor in place for a project of this scale, and time is quickly translating into money, all while the A’s owner is on the hook for all overruns.So where is all this capital coming from? And does Fisher have, or wish to spend, his family fortune on the ballpark? The back-of-the-napkin math says the 64-year-old currently has a $300m loan from Goldman Sachs, $380m in public dollars androughly $175m from Aramark, the stadium vending group that purchased an equity stake in the A’s in May. That’s around $855m, leaving a sizable gap left to get this project over the line. On 18 June, Fisher, who Forbes says is worth $3bn, announced he’s selling Major League Soccer’s San Jose Earthquakes, who werevalued in January by Sportico at $600m. It’s a move that will both take time to complete and seems hasty considering the money pit this project is becoming.Fisher is short – way short – and that will mean digging deep into his own pockets and risking his family wealth for a project that makes little fiscal sense to anyone analyzing in good faith. The A’s are valued at roughly $1.7bn, close to the recent Baltimore Orioles sale, but the latter actually have a major-league park to play in. The A’s stadium could cost over a billion of Fisher’s own money, and so there are serious doubts as to whether this venue will actually happen. Are there contractor deals done? Has a memorandum of understanding, outlining financial obligations, outlining the intentions and expectations of the parties involved, actually been written?“Fisher has to realize he’s a dead man walking,” Bradbury says. “And he is sort of trying to play out the string to save as much face as he can. And what’s eventually going to happen is someone will come in and be the savior. And that may involve not being inLas Vegas.”Even if the stadium is actually built, and the low-budget A’s do land in Vegas, there are even more issues waiting. Despite the 40 million visitors that Las Vegas counts annually, the A’s will have to fight to fill seats while competing with live entertainment and nightlife, gambling and the NFL’s Raiders and the NHL’s Golden Knights, at least for a few months a season, all inside their tiny market. So with all that said, why didn’t the A’s fight to play at least some games at the local minor-league park and try to get some grassroots support going? It’s just another confounding move by Fisher, who made the shortsighted move to play in Sacramento in order to keep revenue from his local television deal.Meanwhile, over in Sactown, not only are the A’s not selling out their small minor league park, but their failure to take the capital’s name and embrace the city in any tangible wayhas alienated fansin what’s meant to be their home for three years. Not to mention that players are already fed up with their substandard ballpark. Bradbury speculates that with all the bad will surrounding the club, they could wind up in Salt Lake City or elsewhere next season. So now Fisher is, and let’s say it politely, disliked, in multiple cities. And should the stadium deal in Las Vegas unravel, it would make for a unique trifecta.That leads to the final question. Why? Why would a billionaire go through all these trials and travails for a move that seemingly doesn’t add up, practically or fiscally? We know the then-Oakland A’s needed some sort of stadium deal in place by 2024 in order tokeep their slice of MLB’s revenue sharing stream, but that doesn’t begin to explain it.“This is the dog catching the car,” DeMause says. “And now that he has caught the car, I don’t think he had any idea what to do with it. He switched up on stadium sites [in Las Vegas] in a matter of 24 hours. He did not have a plan for where to play onceOaklandkicked him out, even though he didn’t have a lease. It either didn’t occur to him or he figured he would figure it out later.”The case against Fisher is damning, yet instead of selling and walking away with a tidy profit, he soldiers on. Is it a case of a wealthy team owner thoroughly enjoying the attention of desert-based suitors after years of combat with Oakland’s leaders? Is it a case of an heir on a quest to prove to someone, maybe himself, that he has the chops to pull something like this off? DeMause believes it’s all possible, but offers up a simpler explanation.“It’s very, very clear: he’s really bad at this.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsBaseballUS sportsOaklandLas VegasMLBWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wiegman’s appointment followed a tumultuous time, with the pandemic forcing a one-year delay to the 2020 Olympics and 2021 Euros. Phil Neville’s contract ran until July 2021 and poor form led tothe announcement, on 22 April 2020, that he would not stay longer. Four months later, the Football Associationannounced Wiegmanwould take over. However, with the Dutchwoman committed to taking the Netherlands, the European champions, to the Tokyo Olympics, England would have to wait. Questions about whether Neville would be handed a short-term deal to lead Team GB at the Olympics were unanswered. In January 2021, shortly before it is believed the FA was about to announce who would travel with Team GB,Neville departed for the Inter Miamihead coach role.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman arrives for her first day at the office on 9 September 2021.Photograph: PA /AlamyThe FA turned to the recently appointed assistant manager Hege Riise tofill the England roleon an interim basis and later asked her tolead Team GB. After a limp end to Neville’s tenure, with five defeats, three unconvincing wins and a draw, there was despondency and a sense that the small cracks evident in England’s 2019 World Cup run had opened wide. The team were defensively fragile, creatively weak and overreliant on Ellen White’s goals digging them out of holes. Riise got off to a good start with a6-0 England winover Northern Ireland but defeats by France and Canada followed andTeam GB crashed outin the Olympic quarter-finals with an agonising 4-3 extra-time defeat by Australia. Wiegman’s job was big: to turn around a team that had lost their way, but she came in with solid credentials, having led the Netherlands to the European title in 2017 and a World Cup final in 2019.SWUnbeaten charge to Euro 2022Sep 2021-Jun 2022The buildup to Wiegman’s first match, a World Cup qualifier against North Macedonia in Southampton, was rocked by an ankle injury to Steph Houghton. Wiegman had named Houghton as the captain and it proved something of a sliding doors moment for the centre-back; one of England’s best performers for the previous decade never wore the armband again. To say Wiegman’s team made a strong start would be a major understatement. In her first six games England scored a remarkable 53 times without conceding and, in what felt like no time at all, the Lionesses had an air of invincibility. Yes, the standard of the opposition was flattering them, but this free-flowing, confident England suddenly looked incomparable with the side that had limped to defeats a few months previously. Her desire for perfection was evidenced on a torrential night in Riga.England had beaten Latvia 10-0in some of the soggiest conditions you could imagine, in an eerily flat atmosphere with no fans permitted in the Daugava stadium because of a pandemic-related curfew, and yet Wiegman felt her players had been “a little bit sloppy”. The Lionesses dulywon the reverse fixture 20-0.View image in fullscreenEllen White became England’s all-time leading goalscorer in the 20-0 demolition of Latvia.Photograph: Molly Darlington/Action Images/ReutersDraws with Canada and Spain in 2022’s Arnold Clark Cup gave England the tougher tests they needed and they lifted that trophy thanks to amemorable win over Germany. The feelgood mood strengthened during their warm-up friendlies for that summer’s Euros, as 3-0, 5-1 and 4-0 wins over Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland respectively gave the Lionesses a new aura going into a home tournament.TGHistory makersJul 2022Wiegman became the first manager to deliver back-to-back European titles for different nations when Englandlifted the 2022 European Championshiptrophy. Everything came together at the right time and everyone – players, coaches, staff, media and fans – seemed to be singing from the same hymn sheet. The unbeaten run to the final helped and again created an air of invincibility, and the manager’s blunt honesty on her expectations that endeared her to the players. “Everybody knows where they stand so there’s no guessing games behind closed doors and I think that does take the pressure off,” said Keira Walsh before the tournament. “The mentality now is just all about doing the best for the team and the team winning, rather than individuals. I think you can see that in the way we play.” Critical to their success was also the building of a pressureless environment. “I don’t know how she does it, to be honest with you,” said Walsh. “It’s easy for me to sit here and say it feels less tense, because it just does.” During the tournament the manager was unshakeable. Sticking with the same starting XI throughout was a masterstroke, with Alessia Russo and Ella Toone providing impetus and an element of the unknown from the bench.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman and Beth Mead with their medals after England beat Germany to win the Euro 2022 final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe team also had luck on their side, in that they sustained no significant injuries and that when Wiegman and the back-up keeper Hannah Hampton contracted Covid-19, it was around the time of the final group game with England already through. An injury to Germany’s Alexandra Popp in the warm-up before the final was a huge literal and psychological boost.SWFirst Europe, next the worldAug 2022-Jul 2023Wiegman’s European champions took on the then world champions, the United States, at Wembley in October 2022 and recordeda memorable victory, and the manager’s unbeaten streak would continue to April 2023, taking in two further trophies: a safelyretained Arnold Clark Cupand a new piece of silverware,the Finalissima, secured via a penalty shootout against Brazil, the champions of South America.

This was a team breaking history in so many ways.View image in fullscreenMary Earps celebrates after her heroics in the penalty shootout helped England win the Women’s Finalissima against Brazil at Wembley in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe honeymoon had to end eventually, though, andWiegman’s first defeatarrived at Brentford against Australia. Worse was to come that month, when Leah Williamson sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury, joining Beth Mead on the knee injury absentee list for the World Cup. Then Millie Bright was a doubt for the tournament and Wiegman’s first streak of misfortune had arrived. The players, meanwhile, were embroiled in arow with the FA over bonusesand commercial deals, which spilled into the public domain on the eve of the World Cup. Bright was passed fit just in time to fly to Australia but England were seemingly stumbling, for the first time under Wiegman. Or were they?TGA sickener in SydneyJul 2023-Aug 2023Wiegman produced her first tactical surprise and it worked to good effect, a 3-5-2 formation, utilising Lauren Hemp as a more central forward, helping England progress from what had been an uninspiring pair of opening 1-0 victories over Haiti and Denmark to putting six goals past China. The Lionesses had to show their dogged defensive side in this campaign but displayed their nous in big games to find a way to Wiegman’s fourth consecutive major tournament final. There were rumours of rivals trying to poach her but before the final in Sydney but Mark Bullingham said the FA would“100% reject” any approaches. “We think Sarina is doing a great job and hope she continues doing it for a long time,” the FA’s chief executive said. “Sarina could do anything she wants in football.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman comforts Lauren James after defeat in the World Cup final.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PAThe Lionesses left Australia immensely disappointed, afterlosing 1-0 to Spain, an agonising second World Cup final defeat in a row for Wiegman, but months laterWiegman extended her contractuntil after the 2027 World Cup to have another crack with England at that ultimate prize.TGSigns of trouble?Sep 2023-Apr 2025England have played 24 games since the World Cup, winning 14, drawing four and losing six. Placed alongside the unbeaten run before the 2022 Euros, this doesn’t look great but the introduction of the Nations League has significantly increased the calibre of teams England face on a regular basis. “The levels of the game are improving so much,” Wiegman said in February. “You can’t just take for granted that you’ll win … Before the Nations League we would play different countries from different levels – we’re never going to win 20-0 again. I don’t think that’s competitive anyway.” England have twice failed to qualify for the Nations League finals, which includedmissing out on Olympic qualificationfor Team GB.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman takes a training session at St George’s Park.Photograph: Jacob King/PAIt hasn’t been smooth sailing. The Lionesses have looked unconvincing at times, particularly defensively, and a little too predictable. But nothing can progress upwards all the time and injuries have also had an impact, with Williamson taking time to return to her best, Hemp, Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway also sustaining knee injuries and Lauren James among others unavailable at various points.SWA storm before some calmMay 2025-The May-June 2025 international camp was the most turbulent of Wiegman’s tenure, by far, amid three high-profile withdrawals, for three different reasons.Mary Earps retired from England duty, and the sadness of Wiegman’s face was unmistakable as she discussed the matter, in possibly the most cagey of her press conferences to date, the head coach saying: “I don’t give any information about these private conversations.” Soon after,Fran Kirby alsoended her England career, after Wiegman – typically direct and honest – had explained she would not pick her for the Euros. WhenBright withdrewfrom Euros selection the next day to look after her mental health and an exhausted knee, suddenly there were suggestions of a crisis, but Wiegman produced a defiant performance at her squad-announcement press conference and switched the mood.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman leads a team huddle after the Nations League match against Portugal in May.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty Images“I don’t go around the bush,” she said, of the way she handles conversations with players.

They received a boost pre-tournament with the return of the captain, Glódís Viggósdóttir, who had missed the final few months of the Bundesliga season with a knee injury. Inter’s goalkeeper Cecilía Rúnarsdóttir made her Euros bow while Sveindis Jónsdóttir, widely considered to be their best attacking outlet, took up her place on the wing.Katariina KosolaIt had been a week of mixed fortunes for Finland when Adelina Engman was ruled out of the tournament on Tuesday. The 21-year-old Anni Hartikainen was called up in her place but was unable to join up with the team until after their opener. The positive, however, was the return to fitness of the integral Natalia Kuikka who made it through a friendly with the Netherlands unscathed.

Over 2,000 Iceland fans were expected to have travelled and were making themselves heard in their customary fashion.Despite the difference in rankings and a bright start from Halldórsson’s side, Finland settled into the game and dominated much of the first half. Sällström had a close-range shot blocked and her team gathered momentum as they were afforded space in central areas. Rúnarsdóttir was named the Serie A goalkeeper of the year this season and had to be at her impressive best to keep out the lively Kosola.Iceland started to create opportunities of their own. Jónsdóttir’s dangerous long throw is notorious and she caused problems at the near post with her trademark move.The Angel City winger had been pinned back by the impressive Emma Koivisto but was at the heart of the best move of the first half. Breaking on to Karólína Vilhjálmsdóttir’s cutting ball, she delivered the perfect pass across the face of goal for Sandra Jessen, only for Koivisto to make a stunning block.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Calling them obnoxious is intended as a compliment. Infused with a champion spirit after appointing José Mourinho in 2004,Chelseawere renowned for their resilience and snarl, impossible to intimidate and more concerned with winning trophies than whether outsiders thought they were a great bunch of lads or liked their style of play.Their mentality was unrivalled and lasted even after Mourinho left. SinceAbramovich’s sale in 2022, though, Chelsea have gone down a very different road when it comes to building a dressing room culture. There are no ready-made talents arriving at Stamford Bridge and there have been plenty of times during the past three years when supporters have been left wondering why a team once marshalled by Petr Cech, Ashley Cole, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba were so lacking in character.In-form Foden and sluggish Dias – what did we learn from City’s Club World Cup? | Jamie JacksonRead moreAbramovich’s successors are done listening to their critics. Pilloried for embarking on a strategy of targeting young players on long contracts, theTodd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownershipsense vindication is coming. The argument that leaders can be developed is starting to hold water, even if it remains valid to argue that bringing in an established star or two in key positions could help Chelsea get over the line in the big competitions. Paris Saint-Germain did notwin the Champions Leaguewith a team of kids; they also had Marquinhos (31) in defence, Fabián Ruiz (29) playing brilliantly in midfield and Ousmane Dembélé (28) scoring for fun up front.Even so, there is a growing feeling Chelsea will emerge from the adversity and upheaval after the change of ownership with a stronger mentality and greater togetherness. There was particular satisfaction athow they fared against Benficain the last 16 of the Club World Cup last Saturday. An implosion would not have been surprising after a weather delay lasting close to two hours was followed by Benfica forcing extra time after a controversial 95th-minute penalty.Chelsea responded, winning 4-1 to set up a quarter-final with Palmeiras on and much was made of Levi Colwill’s performance. True, it was risky when the centre-back wagged a finger at the referee, Slavko Vincic, and appeared to swear at the Slovenian after Benfica were awarded their spot-kick. There are usually ramifications for behaving like that and Colwill was lucky not to receive at least a yellow card. Chelsea will expect the 22-year-old to channel his emotions better.View image in fullscreenLevi Colwill (right) has words with Slavko Vincic after the referee awarded Benfica a late penalty.Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty ImagesEqually, they like Colwill is showing fight and desire and he has stepped up and taken on more responsibility in recent months. Colwill scored the winner when Chelsea clinched Champions League qualification bybeating Nottingham Forestat the end of last season and his aggression proved vital against Benfica. He refused to be bullied and was involved in the game’s turning point, pressing high to win possession and drawing Gianluca Prestianni into a foul that led to the 19-year-old forward being sent off with the game locked at 1-1.There is room for improvement. As an academy product, Colwill is under more pressure than most to show leadership in central defence. Fans demand a lot from one of their own.

He has toughened up during the past 12 months, but Chelsea want him to bulk up even more and become more dominant in the air.“We could be here for ages,” he says after being asked what part of his game needs to be better. “I am nowhere near where I would like to be. Defending one-v-one has been tough, but I think I’ve proved that I’m getting a bit better. I’m good at times when I’m trying to make passes and there are other times where I’ve been a bit lazy.”The England international is hard on himself. “You’ve got to be if you want to be the best and strive for the best things possible,” he says. “You might think a pass is easy – you can take your mind off it. You take your mind off something for half a second and that can make a big, big difference.“We all know how big this club is and how the culture of the club has always been to win. We’re just trying to reinforce that to the young boys, to the boys coming in, that this club is for winners only. That’s what we need to strive towards. That’s what we want to do together.”Colwill echoed what Chelsea are saying internally. They see a group of kids growing together. There was amusement at the otherwise languid Cole Palmer losing his cool and picking up a booking for being involved in a shoving match after Prestianni’s red card. Perhaps some of the old snarl is returning.Explore more on these topicsChelseaClub World Cup 2025Club World CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The France Under-21 international has a €40m release clause in his contract with the Spanish club butEvertonhave been negotiating for several weeks to lower the asking price.A breakthrough has been made this week and, while the deal is not yet complete, the 22-year-old appears poised to become David Moyes’s second summer signing, following the £12.6m deal to sign Carlos Alcaraz permanently.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreBarry, who was part of the France squad at the recent European Under-21 Championship, scored 11 goals in La Liga last season as Villarreal qualified for the Champions League. A new striker is a priority for Moyes as he oversees a major overhaul of the Everton squad this summer. The clubmissed out on Liam Delap, declined to take up an option to sign Armando Broja on a permanent basis from Chelsea and have seen Dominic Calvert-Lewindepart as a free agent.Meanwhile, Jarrad Branthwaite has credited Everton’s new ambition under Moyes as a key factor in his decision to sign a five-year contract with the club. The 23-year-old has been Everton’s young player of the year for the past two seasons.Everton had previously resisted interest from Manchester United in the Carlisle-born defender, who would have been in England’s European Under-21 Championship squad but for a hamstring injury.Chelsea have also been linked with Branthwaite, but he said it was “an easy decision” to commit his future to Everton. He cited Moyes and the club’s new direction under the ownership of The Friedkin Group as key influences. “I’ve been at Everton for five-and-a-half years now and I’ve seen the change the club’s had over the past six months. It’s very exciting for us as a team, as players, to have that going on in the background and to be starting the new season at the new stadium. The ambition was a huge thing.“The way the manager wants us to go as a team and what he wants us to do for next season and where he wants us to challenge for has had a big impact on the decision. I think you saw towards the end of last season as a team what we can do. The manager has been really good, not only for me but for the group. You saw the change in results, the change in mood since he came in. He drives the demands every day to be better.”Moyes said: “He is still only 23 and his best years are hopefully still ahead of him. We believe he can have a huge role to play in an exciting new era at the football club.”View image in fullscreenJarrad Branthwaite attracted interest from Manchester United and Chelsea but has decided to commit his future to Everton.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersMeanwhile, Jarell Quansah has completed his move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen in a deal worth up to £35m. The 22-year-old enjoyed an impressive European Under-21 Championship campaign as part ofa triumphant England side, but found opportunities limited at club level last season. The homegrown central defender started four league games, 13 in all competitions, as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté established a title-winning partnership.Liverpool will receive a guaranteed £30m for Quansah plus £5m in add-ons. The deal is the third between the clubs this summer, following the Premier League champions’ acquisition of Jeremie Frimpong andrecord-signing Florian Wirtz.Despite selling the young defender, who made his debut in 2023 and signed a new long-term contract at Anfield in October,Liverpoolconsider Quansah a player of rich potential and have negotiated a pre-agreed buy-back clause. “Everybody at LFC would like to thank Jarell for his contributions and wish him the very best for the future,” the club said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since retiring from playing aged 26 after fracturing his skull – a horror injury that required 14 metal plates to be inserted into his skull, held together by 28 screws – he has built a library of coaching experience, working under José Mourinho, Antonio Conte and Ange Postecoglou. This season, after accepting his first full-time managerial roleat West Brom, he has an opportunity to show his workings. “My last game was as a 25-year-old and I have had a seven-, eight-year apprenticeship, which in normal circumstances is quite a long time,” he says.Nothing was normal about the end of Mason’s playing career. For a while there were 45 staples and he had a six-inch scar across his head. For about 10 days he had to be spoon-fed and being able to pick up a glass of orange juice was a major milestone. At the time he felt his career was in its infancy but stepping into coaching, initially in the Spurs academy, he discovered a new passion. “I definitely have a fire inside of me to be successful and fulfil the sort of dreams and ambitions that I had as a player,” he says.Morecambe owner sacks board of directors in attempt to avoid administrationRead moreHe will always be eternally grateful for Mauricio Pochettino handing him his top-flight debut at the club he joined aged eight, in a north London derby at Arsenal no less. Mason’s final season with Tottenham culminated inwinning the Europa League, the club’s first trophy in 17 years and their first European triumph since 1984. That night hardened Mason’s belief it was time to move on. Across seven years on the Spurs staff, including two spells in interim charge after the sackings of Mourinho and Conte, he estimates he has prepared for hundreds of matches, in the Premier League and Europe.But nothing hit quite like that night in Spain. “For me, it just felt like the perfect ending to a great chapter of my life,” the 34-year-old says. “Bilbao was a confirmation. I’d been there as a player when we’d lost a cup final and it hurt. I’d managed in a cup final [the Carabao Cup defeat by Chelsea in 2021] and lost and it hurt. To close that chapter with what we achieved was great; it felt good to end the season that way. I knew after that that my time had come to an end. The opportunity to work with Ange – I’d only signed a two-year contract and it was an incredible two years. But as soon as we achieved that, it confirmed it was the right time. It didn’t feel right to continue. The possibility might not have even been there. The season finished three days later, I spoke to the [West Brom] chair [Shilen Patel] and Andrew [Nestor, the sporting director] at Albion.”He was intent on becoming a No 1 after that first spell in interim charge after Mourinho was sacked, when at 29 Mason became the youngest coach in Premier League history. Mason thinks he felt ready to manage when targeted by clubs a couple of years ago but, enthused by working as an assistant to Postecoglou, he stayed at Spurs. “Fast-forward two years, to be part of history was amazing. Now, I want to write my own script and the timing of being here at this club feels right.”View image in fullscreenRyan Mason is not setting any bold predictions for his first season in charge at West Brom.Photograph: Adam Fradgley/West Bromwich Albion FC/Getty ImagesIt is a month to the day since Mason, almost half the age of his predecessor, Tony Mowbray, was announced as Albion’s head coach. Mason, who was on Albion’s shortlist when Carlos Corberán departed for Valencia last December, will be one of several new faces in the Championship technical areas this season, with nine second-tier clubs having replaced their manager since the end of last season and another, Leicester, seeking asuccessor to Ruud van Nistelrooy. The managerial churn in the Championship is startling: aside from Kieran McKenna and Phil Parkinson, who return to the second tier after relegation and promotion respectively, Portsmouth’s 39-year-old head coach, John Mousinho, comfortably represents the longest-serving manager in the division at almost two and a half years.Over the course of an hour in the Richardson Suite at the Hawthorns on Wednesday, Mason delivered a polished performance at his media unveiling. No sweeping statements or grand messages. But Mason, who took charge of his first Albion training session last Thursday and will take his squad to Austria on Saturday for a training camp in Burgenland, where they will play Dynamo Kyiv, allowed himself a chuckle as he fielded a question with a nod to his old boss.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 35-year-old former forward, who retired after a glittering playing careerin 2023, added: “We are interested in getting Cardiff. It’s my home club, it’s where I grew up and my uncle [Chris Pike] used to play for them. To be involved with an ownership group would be a dream come true.“It is a club close to my heart and I would love to be able to be a part of growing Cardiff and taking it to the Premier League where it belongs. I know how amazing the Welsh fans and Cardiff fans are. It would be amazing to try and do something together. We are trying to engage with Cardiff and more news will come out on that in the future, but hopefully we can get something done.”The makeup of the group led by Bale is unknown but it is thought to include US investors. Last month an initial proposal by Bale’s consortium was reportedly dismissed by Tan. Cardiff have been approached for comment.Bale, who won the Champions League five times with Real, was linked with a move to Cardiff towards the end of his playing career, before the 2022 World Cup.

And which teams have beaten the most champions in winning the Champions League/European Cup?”Let’s just clarify that Paddy is referring to reigningleaguechampions, here, not reigning European champions, to which we had a few answers. Even in an era in which many Champions League teams are also-rans from the big leagues around Europe, the answer to the first question is no.Dirk Maas was quickly in touch (with some others) to tell us this before digging into the details to find an answer for the teams that have beaten the fewest reigning league champions. “Liverpool (2004-05), Barcelona (2005-06), Manchester United (2007-08), Chelsea (2011-12 and 2020-21) and Real Madrid (2015-16) have beaten only two league champions en route to their Champions League triumph,” writes Dirk. “Of these teams, Liverpool eliminated the most non-reigning champions: six. Their first (Grazer AK, in the final qualifying round) and their last opponents (Milan, in the final) were 2003-04 champions. In between, Monaco, Olympiakos, Deportivo La Coruña (in the group stage), Bayer Leverkusen (in the round of 16), Juventus (quarter-finals) and Chelsea (semi-finals) were not. Last season, Paris Saint-Germain came close to Liverpool’s record: beating three champions and nine non-reigning champions.”View image in fullscreenBarcelona defeated six reigning league champions when they win the Champions League in 2009.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APPeter Tomlin has mailed in with the lowdown on teams that have beaten the highest number of reigning league champions on their way to lifting the European Cup/Champions League. “The answer is six – and this has been achieved on six separate occasions, with the most recent being Barcelona in 2014-15,” he writes. “They beat Apoel, Ajax, PSG, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Juventus. The other teams to match this feat were as follows:2008-09 Barcelona(Wisla Krakow, Shakhtar Donetsk, Basel, Lyon, Bayern Munich, Manchester United)1999-00Real Madrid(Porto, Olympiakos, Dynamo Kyiv, Rosenborg, Bayern Munich, Manchester United)1996-97Borussia Dortmund(Widzew Lodz, Steaua Bucharest, Atlético Madrid, Auxerre, Man Utd, Juventus)1995-96Juventus(Borussia Dortmund, Steaua Bucharest, Rangers, Real Madrid, Nantes, Ajax)1991-92 Barcelona(Hansa Rostock, Kaiserslautern, Sparta Prague, Dynamo Kyiv, Benfica, Sampdoria).“With the current format, it would be mathematically possible to defeat 17 champions if a club started in the first qualifying round, won all eight matches in the group phase then went all the way to the final, having been drawn against reigning champions in every match, although this scenario is extremely unlikely.”Dirk has been back in touch to add Marseille (1992-93), Milan (1993-94) and Barcelona (2014-15) to that list of teams on six but we have Marseille drawing with Rangers twice in the group stage so that means they are stuck on five. So we have eight European Cup-winning teams who achieved the feat of beating six champions.Top scorer for two clubs in one season“This past season Finnish striker Joel ‘Danger’ Pohjanpalo was the top goalscorer for the two teams he represented: Venezia in Serie A and Palermo in Serie B,”notes Ville Leino.“Has this feat been accomplished by any other players?”We may have answered this before in an ancient Knowledge though our search through the archive has drawn a blank, and we’re getting old, so forgive us. In any case our friend and yours, Dirk Maas, has presented us with the distinguished group of hotshots which Pohjanpalo has now joined.Klaas-Jan Huntelaar(Heerenveen and Ajax): 2005-06 Eredivisie.Kris Boyd(Kilmarnock and Rangers): 2005-06 Scottish Premier League.Dieter Schatzschneider(Hannover 96 and Fortuna Köln): 1982-83 2.

This meant, for example, that Alexander Johansson, a new signing from Tvååker, scored a consolation goal for newly promoted Varberg against Hammarby in a 5-1 defeat on 24 February, 2020. It would be 113 days until Varberg played their first-ever Allsvenskan game, a 3-0 win at Helsingborg, on 15 June.” So Johansson beats Jobe’s two-month wait by some distance.View image in fullscreenJobe Bellingham celebrates after scoring his first goal for Borussia Dortmund.Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/APMore non top-flight teams playing in EuropeWe have had some additions to our list of second-tier clubs playing in Europe. Sunderland (1973-74) and Southampton (1975-76) played in the Cup Winners’ Cup after unexpected FA Cup glory. And until 1999, as Gareth Thomas points out, Welsh teams playing in the English Football League could qualify for the Cup Winners’ Cup by winning the Welsh Cup. Here’s a list of them:Newport County:one appearance in Cup Winners’ Cup; best performance QFs in 1980-81; lowest position when qualifying third in fourth tier in 1979-80.Wrexham:five appearances in Cup Winners’ Cup; best performance QFs in 1975-76; lowest position when qualifying 13th in fourth tier in 1985-86.Swansea City: seven appearances in Cup Winners’ Cup; best performance second round in 1982-83; lowest position when qualifying 17th in third tier in 1965-66.Cardiff City:14 appearances in Cup Winners’ Cup; best performance SFs in 1967-68; lowest position when qualifying ninth in the fourth tier in 1991-92.Knowledge archive“England won the European Under-21 Championship with a few players aged 22,”begins Dom Miller.“This is due to current age rules of players being eligible if born on or after 1 January 2002, so 21 or younger at the start of the year the qualification began. The oldest player in the tournament was Stoke City’s Million Manhoef, who was born on 3 January 2002. He was 23 years, five months and 25 days old on the day of the final. However, I’m sure back in the 70s and 80s sides were allowed a couple of over-age players. So who is the eldest under 21 player?”You’re right Dom, and we answered this questionback in 2009. Here is the most relevant part.Michael Haughey points out, Under-21 teams used to be allowed to have over-age players. “The oldest U-21 player I can think of,” he writes, “was Hamish McAlpine of Dundee United and Scotland who played five games for the Scottish Under-21 team when he was 35.” And all above board too. Unlike some others Pablo Miguez could mention: “Brazilian Carlos Alberto played in the 2003 Youth World Cup at a mere 25 years old. He admitted it later, and that caused him to be suspended for a year.”The Knowledge archiveCan you help?“Emi Martínez was sent off on the last day of the season, followed by rumours of a return to Argentina. Should he join a club beyond the FA’s reach what happens to his suspension? Is it held in abeyance or can he have a suspension ‘time out’?” asks Paul Mumby.“While looking up Adam Lallana on his retirement, I noticed he was a runner-up in League One and the Championship with Southampton and the Premier League with Liverpool. He also has runners-up medals in the Champions League, League Cup and Europa League,” writes Paul Savage. “So that’s six different competitions he’s been runner-up in. Can anyone top that? Or is there anyone who can equal it but without winning anything? He’s was also in the PFA team of the year in three divisions. Can anyone top that?”“As of 30 June, Ángel Di María tops the Club World Cup Golden Boot race with four goals – all of them penalties.

Two titanic five-set matches later, the Sydneysider is still standing on the green lawns of SW19, just.With Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt, the last Australian man to win at Wimbledon, watching on, Thompson beat Benjamin Bonzi 7-5, 6-7 (2-7), 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in nine minutes shy of four hours. After Bonzi hit a return into the net on the second match point, Thompson let out a primal scream into the evening sky, smiled and pointed to his heart.‘Most special day of my life’: world No 733 Tarvet enjoys limelight in Alcaraz defeatRead more“Everyone the whole week has just told me to show some ticker, so I just pointed to it and said, that’s some fucking ticker,” said Thompson, adding the gesture was aimed at Hewitt, who often used the phrase himself and had been demanding it from Thompson.After his first-round defeat of Vit Kopriva, when he came from two sets down, Thompson looked shattered, said he was not enjoying himself, and wondered aloud if he would even be able to start Wednesday’s match. He is now proud of himself, but still not enjoying it.“The only thing that brought me a smile is the win and the fact that I didn’t have to be out there anymore because it was so tough,” Thompson said. “It’s frustrating. There’s movements I can’t do, but the competitive juices are keeping me going. It’s not just the back, it’s everything. I’m super stiff. I’m not practising, but I keep moving and I’m having lots of treatment, yoga, core.”Having hauled himself on to Court 15, Thompson found 31-year-old Bonzi facing him, the 64th-ranked Frenchman who had shocked last year’s semi-finalist Daniil Medvedev in the first round.Thompson, ranked No 44 after an injury-hit season that has led to him sliding out of the top 30, is a better player than the 29-year-old from Nimes, especially on grass, and to start with it showed. At 5-5 he set up two break points with a pair of superb volleys. Having broken, he then came back from 0-30 on his own serve before taking the set with a sweet passing shot.But Bonzi changed his game, driving Thompson back to limit the doubles ace’s chance to show his volleying prowess. The second set went with serve, then Bonzi won five successive points to seize control of the tiebreak. He followed up with a break at 3-3 in the third, from which he served out.At that stage Thompson looked done. But more than most he is a player who leaves it all out there. In the fourth he broke at 3-2, and held on to level the tie. The final set could have gone either way as both men battled fatigue and the setting sun. Each had break-point chances. Crucially, at 5-5, with a tiebreak looming, Thompson held, then broke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think I was just doing the basics very, very well. I executed really well today. I’m just so happy to have that level.”Although Vondrousova has struggled with numerous injuries over the last two years, falling as low as No 164 in the WTA rankings last month, she arrived atWimbledonas one of the most in- form players after winning the Berlin Open on grass, a run that included a win over Sabalenka. With her superior form, her history at Wimbledon and her victory over Raducanu earlier this year in Abu Dhabi, Vondrousova entered Centre Court the favourite.“There’s no better feeling than winning here at Wimbledon, winning on Centre Court, it honestly makes everything worth it,” said Raducanu. “You forget about everything, all the ups and downs – and many downs – when you’re out there and you win. It’s so fleeting. It lasts a few minutes after the match and now. Quickly you need to kind of get back in gear for the next day and the next round. For the rest of the evening I’m going to enjoy that one because I think it was really special.”Raducanu’s victory ensures that she will return to Centre Court for one of the toughest challenges in her sport as she faces Sabalenka, the No 1 seed and a three-time grand slam champion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plan was to make inroads before the last, vague vestige of green was burned from the surface and it so nearly came good during an opening spell from Chris Woakes that brought the wicket of KL Rahul but also two marginal umpire decisions that both favoured that batting side. “On a day like this, it is frustrating,” Woakes said. “It was a good day but it felt like a day that could have been so different.”Twice batters were saved on umpire’s call when England reviewed on-field decisions of not out – first in the seventh over, with India 14 without loss, when Yashasvi Jaiswal was reprieved, and then in the 11th, when they were 21 for one, with Karun Nair the beneficiary. On both occasions DRS technology showed the ball going on to hit the stumps, but not by enough for the TV umpire to reverse the decisions taken by the Bangladeshi umpire Sharfuddoula. Jaiswal went on to score another 75 runs and Nair another 26 before the India captain, Shubman Gill, scored an unbeaten 114 to take his team to 310 for five at stumps.Shubman Gill digs in to steady India and hold off England’s battling bowlersRead more“We looked at the wicket this morning and there was a little bit of grass still on it, and we thought if it was going to do a bit it would be first up,” Woakes said. “And it could have been justified because we could easily have had them 30 for three. A couple of decisions go our way early doors and we’re looking at a completely different day ahead – at 30 for three you’re into the middle order when the ball is still hard and new. They’re decisions which can obviously go your way or not. That’s the game we play.”Englandwon the first Test at Headingleyhaving reached stumps at the end of the opening day with India on 359 for three, so this position is unlikely to daunt them. “We actually look at it and say it’s probably been a very good day,” said Woakes. “If we can break this partnership you’re into the tail, then hopefully we can get batting as soon as possible. A great day would have been 300 for seven – if we’d got two more in that last session it would have been a very, very good day on what’s a very good batting surface from what we’ve seen.”Jaiswal, who was eventually caught behind off the bowling of Ben Stokes for 87, insisted India were feeling equally positive about their overnight position. “I think the situation is very nice and we ended up on a very good score,” he said. “We just need to focus on our process. That is what we always try to do. We just need to keep doing what we are doing and keep believing.”View image in fullscreenIndia’s Yashasvi Jaiswal said they were feeling positive about their overnight position.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersIt promises to be a trying Test for the bowlers, on a wicket that has so far offered them little assistance. “I’d be amazed if it changes too much,” Woakes added. “It didn’t feel like a massive nick-off wicket, to be honest. It didn’t feel like it had the pace in it for that. So it felt like the stumps and lbw were what we were looking for. It was trying to find the right length that allowed you to be full enough not to get driven, but still bring the stumps into play.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And on the other side of the net is theWimbledonchampion.Yet that was the situation that Oliver Tarvet, the world No 733 from St Albans, found himself in on Wednesday as he lined up to face the brilliant SpaniardCarlos Alcaraz.And while there was no fairytale ending, withTarvet losing 6-1, 6-4, 6-4he left to a standing ovation and warm words from his illustrious opponent, who predicted that he could go on to achieve great things.Carlos Alcaraz shakes off Tarvet from his back without inhibitions or regrets | Jonathan LiewRead more“Big praise to Oliver,” said Alcaraz. “Only his second match on the tour and I just love his game. Some great tennis. I had to be really focused and play my best tennis. If he keeps practising hard and playing at a professional level, I think he can go far.”It has been some journey. A week ago, nobody in tennis circles had heard of Tarvet, who studies communications and marketing at the University of San Diego.After making the 5,482-mile trip to London to play in the Wimbledon qualifying tournament, he then had to win three matches to even make it to the main event. But having arrived at Centre Court, Tarvet looked right at home as he played his brand of attacking tennis from the off.In one respect, Tarvet could not lose, because nobody expected him to beat Alcaraz. Yet, somehow, he also won by showing he belonged.“There were a lot of nerves,” he said afterwards. “I woke up a couple times in the night from the adrenaline and in the car my heart rate was going quicker than it usually does. But a big emphasis was to enjoy, enjoy the moment and enjoy the opportunity, because it doesn’t come around too often. And I think I did a pretty good job of that.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz congratulates Oliver Tarvet (left) after their match on Centre Court.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It’s not the result that I wanted, but it was definitely the most special day of my life.”It would have been easy for Tarvet to be overawed. He was the lowest-ranked player in the entire draw and until last week, he had never played an opponent ranked higher than 367.Now he was facing afive-time grand slam winner, on the most famous court in the world. Many would have shrunk under the intensity of the experience and the power of Alcaraz’s groundstrokes. Yet Tarvet battled to the end.The first set was surely the least one-sided 6-1 scoreline of the tournament. Tarvet had breakpoints in three of Alcaraz’s service games, only for the Spaniard to find incredible winner after winner.Yet Tarvet refused to allow his spirit, or his level, to drop. There was an explosion of joy and hope when he broke to lead 2-0 at the start of the second set, and while he could not see it out, Alcaraz increasingly knew he was in a real match. It was a similar story in the third set, but Alcaraz just had a little more power and nous.“I definitely had chances that should give me confidence that I was competing,” said Tarvet. “I just need to credit him. He plays the big points just incredibly well. And that’s the difference. I felt I was in the first set and yet I lost it 6-1. And it’s an intimidating place to be when you are hitting a second serve with Carlos Alcaraz standing there.”View image in fullscreenOliver Tarvet put in a battling performance against the reigning Wimbledon champion.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianTarvet is the latest of a growing number of British players who are using the US college system as a finishing school before turning professional. Both Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley, who are both ranked inside the world’s top 70, have shown how it can work.However, it also means that while the other players who made the second round here will earn at least £99,000, under US college rules he can only claim $10,000 (£7,290) in profit every year, as well as any expenses incurred during the events.Not that Tarvet minds, given the memories he has made. “My goal for going into the first round of qualifying was just to play my brand of tennis,” he said. “Obviously it was a great opportunity for me. And I have proved that was worth that wildcard and that chance.”On the third day of action there were three more British victories with Sonay Kartal getting things under way by beating Viktoriya Tomova. Norrie followed suit with a surprise four-set victory over the 12th seed Frances Tiafoe. Late into the night Emma Raducanu also booked her place in the last 32 with a win over 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.Meanwhile, whatever happens next in Tarvet’s burgeoning career, he will always be able to tell the story of a remarkable day. And as a communications and marketing student, he was also able to deliver a message with punch and panache: British tennis has another exciting young talent on its hands.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Carlos AlcarazTennisWimbledonnewsShareReuse this content"

He also coached the Los Angeles Lakers and is 454-304 in his career.Brown also won four championships as an assistant coach, three with the Golden State Warriors and one under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio.His coaching staff will be discussed in the coming days, the person told AP.Thibodeau led the Knicks to their only sustained success of the 2000s, with four playoff appearances in his five seasons.

For many of the league’s brightest stars, Milano-Cortina will be their first opportunity to represent their countries at the Olympic level.“The return to the Olympics marks a monumental moment for hockey,” said NHLPA executive director Marty Walsh. “Best-on-best international tournaments like the Olympics provide the opportunity to create extraordinary moments for our players and fans alike.”Among the 12 nations competing in the men’s tournament, several have already revealed their first six preliminary selections, all of them NHL stars. Team USA’s early roster features Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes, Auston Matthews, Charlie McAvoy as well as brothers Brady and Matthew Tkachuk. The tournament will run from 11 through 22 February 2026.While the agreement has been in the works for over a year, finalizing it required prolonged negotiations and delicate coordination between all four governing bodies. “It’s been a long time coming,” said NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly. “Our stars are thrilled to be there and take part in the Olympics. It’ll be great for hockey – including the National Hockey League.”To mark the occasion, the NHL is planning a special send-off event in February at UBS Arena in New York. The gathering, expected to replace the traditional All-Star Weekend, will bring Olympic-bound players together before they depart for Italy.The decision is about more than player experience or competitive balance, but part of a wider effort to grow the sport on a global scale.“One of the benefits, clearly, of NHL players being able to participate in the Olympics is we’re expanding the reach of the sport,” Daly said. “The Olympics is the world’s biggest stage for sports.”NHLPA senior director for international strategy Rob Zepp echoed that view, describing the Olympics as a unique opportunity to connect with new audiences. “This increased broader viewership allows us to cast a wider net and drum more people into the game,” he said.The deal also reflects a shared long-term vision. According to Daly and Tardif, the NHL and its partners are committed to a regular cadence of top-level international events, alternating between the Olympics and the World Cup of Hockey every two years. If successful, this would mark the first time the sport has achieved a consistent best-on-best schedule in the modern era.Looking further ahead, both parties expressed optimism about NHL participation at the 2034 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. “If we do well [in 2026 and 2030], I would be surprised if we organize a competition without the NHL,” said Tardif.For now, the focus shifts to Milano-Cortina, where fans will once again witness hockey’s elite face off for Olympic gold, a long-awaited return that promises to reshape the international landscape and inspire a new generation.As Daly put it: “We’re looking forward to it. It’s going to be great for hockey.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026NHLIce hockeyUS sportsWinter OlympicsInternational Olympic CommitteeShareReuse this content"

The American’s band of supporters were halfway out of their seats to acclaim a vital break – only to see it land just wide. A relieved Norrie had clawed back to deuce from 0-40 down, and he seized the moment to hold, then break and gradually exert an ever-stronger grip on a match that had briefly threatened to get away from him, as he eventually ran out a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 winner.Katie Boulter crashes out of Wimbledon with misfiring serve as Sonay Kartal advancesRead moreThere were definite echoes as he did so of the form and resilience that carried the British No 3 all the wayto the semi-finals here three years ago. That run deep into the second week also propelled him to a career-high No 8 ranking, but after an injury-troubled second half of 2024, he had dropped all the way to No 91 in mid-May before a run to the last 16 at the French Open edged him back within sight of the top 50.Tiafoe, meanwhile, went into the match buoyed by a career-best run to the quarters at Roland Garros last month. In a tight opening set, the American’s touch and willingness to try something different kept his opponent guessing during a series of baseline duels, and one subpar service game from Norrie was enough to see it slip away.View image in fullscreenFrancis Tiafoe proved to not be too big a foe for Cameron Norrie.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHe served three straight aces to close out both the seventh and ninth games, but the damage had been done in the fifth, where some fine shot-making by Tiafoe – including a perfectly disguised lob that left Norrie planted and bewildered – combined with a dip in the British player’s first-serve percentage, allowing his opponent to carve out the only two break points of the set. He took the second of those as Norrie sent a forehand long.Tiafoe’s first-serve percentage, meanwhile, was barely 50%, and while he had more than enough quality to beat his first-round opponent, Elmer Møller, with a similar strike rate on first serve, Norrie proved to be a much more demanding proposition. He both fought and thought his way back into the match, and by the middle of the third set, he was consistently finding a way to wrest back the advantage in points where Tiafoe held an early edge.There was a big fist-pump from the American as he quickly retrieved an early break in the third, but no way back after Norrie seized on a weak second serve at break point in the eighth game and then served it out. The balance had shifted slightly but decisively in his favour, and the crowd could sense it too, urging their favourite home in a fourth set that always seemed to be edging Norrie’s way.The sliding-doors moment in the second set was the first thing on Tiafoe’s mind afterwards, not least as it was a near carbon copy of the previous point, at 15-40, when he had also carved out a decent chance to put away a winner.View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie celebrates as he comes from a set down.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It was two shots in open space where I picked them, I guess, right, and didn’t make either of them,” he said. “I think that was a huge turning point, I thought his intensity and belief went much higher, and he played much better. It could go anywhere in the court and the point is over, so that was hard.”Wimbledon diary: England managers, SUVs and Jack Draper’s facial hairRead moreNorrie, meanwhile, is enjoying every step of the process as he works towards a possible return to the second week here – for only the second time in his career – and the upper reaches of the world rankings.“I played an unreal match,” he said. “All-around complete, serving well, moving well, solving the drop shot really well, which in the past I haven’t always done. Hitting the slice, coming forward well, being clinical.“I think it’s a good thing to go through, being injured, not winning, then having resilience to back yourself.“For me now, coming into the match against Frances, being the underdog, play for free, it’s a lot easier than in the past when the pressure was on me. It’s nice to hunt the other guys and be on the flipside.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The notes have previously been written by humans.X said using AI to write factchecking notes – which sit beneath some X posts – “advances the state of the art in improving information quality on the internet”.Keith Coleman, the vice-president of product at X, said humans would review AI-generated notes and the note would appear only if people with a variety of viewpoints found it useful.“We designed this pilot to be AI helping humans, with humans deciding,” he said. “We believe this can deliver both high quality and high trust. Additionally we published a paper along with the launch of our pilot, co-authored with professors and researchers from MIT, University of Washington, Harvard and Stanford laying out why this combination of AI and humans is such a promising direction.”But Collins said the system was already open to abuse and that AI agents working on community notes could allow “the industrial manipulation of what people see and decide to trust” on the platform, which has about 600 million users.It is the latest pushback against human factcheckers by US tech firms. Last monthGoogle said user-created factchecks, including by professional factchecking organisations, would be deprioritised in its search results. It said such checks were “no longer providing significant additional value for users”. In January,Meta announced it was getting rid of human factcheckersin the US and would adopt its own community notes system on Instagram, Facebook and Threads.X’s research paper outlining its new factchecking system criticised professional factchecking as often slow and limited in scale and said it “lacks trust by large sections of the public”.AI-created community notes “have the potential to be faster to produce, less effort to generate, and of high quality”, it said. Human and AI-written notes would be submitted into the same pool and X users would vote for which were most useful and should appear on the platform.AI would draft “a neutral well-evidenced summary”, the research paper said. Trust in community notes “stems not from who drafts the notes, but from the people that evaluate them”, it said.But Andy Dudfield, the head of AI at the UK factchecking organisation Full Fact, said: “These plans risk increasing the already significant burden on human reviewers to check even more draft notes, opening the door to a worrying and plausible situation in which notes could be drafted, reviewed, and published entirely by AI without the careful consideration that human input provides.”Samuel Stockwell, a research associate at the Centre for Emerging Technology and Security at the Alan Turing Institute, said: “AI can help factcheckers process the huge volumes of claims flowing daily through social media, but much will depend on the quality of safeguards X puts in place against the risk that these AI ‘note writers’ could hallucinate and amplify misinformation in their outputs. AI chatbots often struggle with nuance and context, but are good at confidently providing answers that sound persuasive even when untrue. That could be a dangerous combination if not effectively addressed by the platform.”Researchers have found that people perceive human-authoredcommunity notes as significantly more trustworthythan simple misinformation flags.An analysis of several hundred misleading posts on X in the run-up to last year’s presidential election found that in three-quarters of cases, accurate community notes were not being displayed, indicating they were not being upvoted by users. These misleading posts, including claims that Democrats were importing illegal voters and the 2020 presidential election was stolen,amassed more than 2bn views, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate.Explore more on these topicsXArtificial intelligence (AI)InternetSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts had expected it to report deliveries of about 394,378 vehicles, according to an average of 23 estimates from the financial research firm Visible Alpha, though projections went to as low as 360,080 units based on estimates from 10 analysts over the past month. Analysts use the number of vehicles delivered to customers as a metric of success to evaluate both automotive sales and production.Tesla shares fall as company reports first decline in annual deliveriesRead more“The market is reacting to the deliveries not being as bad as potentially thought with multiple analysts cutting their forecasts over the past week,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.The stock has lost 25% of its value so far this year as investors feared brand damage in Europe, where sales have slumped most sharply, and in the US from Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics and his role in spearheading the Trump administration’s cost-cutting effort. The day Trump and Musk split publicly in early June, Tesla lost about $150bn in market value. Its share price has somewhat recovered in the ensuing month, but Trump and Musk have likewise reignited their feud as they spar over Trump’s sweeping tax bill.Tesla’s plummeting deliveries in a steadily growing global EV market come despite Musk saying in April that sales had turned around.The company refreshed its top-selling Model Y crossover earlier this year to boost demand, but the redesign forced a production halt and prompted some buyers to delay purchases in anticipation of the updated version.Most of Tesla’s revenue and profit come from its core EV business, and much of its trillion-dollar valuation hangs on Musk’s big bet on converting its vehicles into robotaxis.Tesla last month rolled out a robotaxi service in limited parts of Austin, Texas, for a select group of invitees and with several restrictions, including having a safety monitor in the front passenger seat. The pilot was limited, though, with only about a dozen Robotaxis on the road. The US National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration opened an investigation into the launch of the autonomous ride service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They could also be applied to cars, trains, electrical equipment and other objects that will require more cooling in a world that is heating up.Using machine learning, researchers at universities in the US, China, Singapore and Sweden designed new paint formulas tuned to best reflect the sun’s rays and emit heat, according to a peer-reviewed studypublishedin the science journal Nature.It is the latest example of AI being used to leapfrog traditional trial-and-error approaches to scientific advances. Last year the British company MatNex used AI to create a new kind of permanent magnet used in electric vehicle motors to avoid the use of rare earth metals, whose mining is carbon-intensive.Microsoft hasreleasedAI tools to help researchers rapidly design new inorganic materials – often crystalline structures used in solar panels and medical implants. And there are hopes for new materials to better capture carbon in the atmosphere and to make more efficient batteries.The paint research was carried out by academics at the University of Texas in Austin, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the National University of Singapore and Umeå University in Sweden. It found that applying one of several new AI-enabled paints to the roof of a four-storey apartment block could save electricity equivalent to 15,800 kilowatt hours a year in a hot climate such as Rio de Janeiro’s or Bangkok’s. If the paint were applied to 1,000 blocks, that could save enough electricity to power more than 10,000 air conditioning units for a year.Yuebing Zheng, a professor at the University of Texas and co-leader of the study, said: “Our machine learning framework represents a significant leap forward in the design of thermal meta-emitters. By automating the process and expanding the design space, we can create materials with superior performance that were previously unimaginable.”He said a month’s work designing a new material was being done in a few days using AI and that new materials that may never have been discovered through trial and error were being created.“Now, we follow the machine learning output, [its instructions for] the structure and what kind of materials we should use, and we can get it right without going through many, many design and fabrication testing cycles.”Dr Alex Ganose, a chemistry lecturer at Imperial College London who also uses machine learning to design new materials, said: “Things are moving very fast in this space. In the last year or so there have been so many startups trying to use generative AI for materials.”He said the process of designing a new material could require the calculation of millions of potential combinations. AI allows material scientists to push through previous restrictions in computational power. It also means the traditional process of creating a material and then testing its properties can be reversed, with scientists able to tell the AI what properties they want upfront.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Materials sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

Yet in the years since then, the company has moved in the opposite direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence. In its latestsustainability report, Google said its carbon emissions had increased 51% between 2019 and 2024.New research aims to debunkeven that enormous figure and provide context to Google’s sustainability reports, painting a bleaker picture. A report authored by non-profit advocacy group Kairos Fellowship found that, between 2019 and 2024, Google’s carbon emissions actually went up by 65%. What’s more, between2010, the first year there is publicly available data on Google’s emissions, and 2024, Google’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 1,515%, Kairos found. The largest year-over-year jump in that window was also the most recent, 2023 to 2024, when Google saw a 26% increase in emissions just between 2023 and 2024, according to the report.“Google’s own data makes it clear: the corporation is contributing to the acceleration of climate catastrophe, and the metrics that matter – how many emissions they emit, how much water they use, and how fast these trends are accelerating – are headed in the wrong direction for us and the planet,” said Nicole Sugerman, a campaign manager at Kairos Fellowship.The authors say that they found the vast majority of the numbers they used to determine how much energy Google is using and how much its carbon emissions are increasing in the appendices of Google’s own sustainability reports. Many of those numbers were not highlighted in the main body of Google’s reports, they say.Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areasRead moreAfter the report published, Google called its findings into question in a statement.“The analysis by the Kairos Fellowship distorts the facts. Our carbon emissions are calculated according to the widely used Greenhouse Gas Protocol and assured by a third party. Our carbon reduction ambition has been validated by the leading industry body, the Science Based Targets initiative,” said a spokesperson, Maggie Shiels.The authors behind the report, titled Google’s Eco-Failures, attribute the discrepancy between the numbers they calculated and the numbers Google highlights in its sustainability reports to various factors, including that the firm uses a different metric for calculating how much its emissions have increased. While Google uses market-based emissions, the researchers used location-based emissions. Location-based emissions are the average emissions the company produces from its use of local power grids, while market-based emissions include energy the company has purchased to offset its total emissions.“[Location-based emissions] represents a company’s ‘real’ grid emissions,” said Franz Ressel, the lead researcher and report co-author. “Market-based emissions are a corporate-friendly metric that obscures a polluter’s actual impact on the environment. It allows companies to pollute in one place, and try to ‘offset’ those emissions by purchasing energy contracts in another place.”The energy the tech giant has needed to purchase to power its data centers alone increased 820% since 2010, according to Kairos’s research, a figure that is expected to expand in the future as Google rolls out more AI products. Between 2019 and 2024, emissions that came primarily from the purchase of electricity to power data centers jumped 121%, the report’s authors said.“In absolute terms, the increase was 6.8 TWh, or the equivalent of Google adding the entire state of Alaska’s energy use in one year to their previous use,” said Sugerman.Based on Google’s current trajectory, the Kairos report’s authors say the company is unlikely to meet its own 2030 deadline without a significant push from the public. There are three categories of greenhouse gas emissions – called Scopes 1, 2 and 3 – and Google has only meaningfully decreased its Scope 1 emissions since 2019, according to the Kairos report. Scope 1 emissions, which include emissions just from Google’s own facilities and vehicles, account for only 0.31% of the company’s total emissions, according to the report. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come primarily from the electricity Google purchases to power its facilities, and scope 3 accounts for indirect emissions from all other sources such as suppliers, use of Google’s consumer devices or employee business travel.“It’s not sustainable to keep building at the rate [Google is] building because they need to scale their compute within planetary limits,” said Sugerman. “We do not have enough green energy to serve the needs of Google and certainly not the needs of Google and the rest of us.”Thirsty, power-hungry data centersAs the company builds out resource-intensive data centers across the country, experts are also paying close attention to Google’s water usage. According to the company’s own sustainability report, Google’s water withdrawal – how much water is taken from various sources – increased 27% between 2023 and 2024 to 11bn gallons of water.The amount is “enough to supply the potable water needs for the 2.5 million people and 5,500 industrial users in Boston and its suburbs for 55 days”, according to the Kairos report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amazon employees recently put forth a package of shareholder proposals that asked the company to disclose its overall carbon emissions and targeted the climate impact of its data centers. Theproposalswere ultimately voted down. On Sunday, several organizations including Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club, published anopen letterin the San Francisco Chronicle and the Seattle Times calling on the CEOs of Google, Amazon and Microsoft to “commit to no new gas and zero delayed coal plant retirements to power your data centers”.“In just the last two years alone, your companies have built data centers throughout the United States capable of consuming more electricity than four million American homes,” the letter reads. “Within five years, your data centers alone will use more electricity than 22 million households, rivaling the consumption of multiple mid-size states.”Google’s emissions up 51% as AI electricity demand derails efforts to go greenRead moreIn its own sustainability report, Google warns that the firm’s “future trajectories” may be affected by the “evolving landscape” of the tech industry.“We’re at an extraordinary inflection point, not just for our company specifically, but for the technology industry as a whole – driven by the rapid growth of AI,” the report reads. “The combination of AI’s potential for non-linear growth driven by its unprecedented pace of development and the uncertain scale of clean energy and infrastructure needed to meet this growth makes it harder to predict our future emissions and could impact our ability to reduce them.”The Kairos report accuses Google of relying “heavily on speculative technologies, particularly nuclear power”, to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030.“Google’s emphasis on nuclear energy as a clean energy ‘solution’ is particularly concerning, given the growing consensus among both scientists and business experts that their successful deployment on scale, if it is to ever occur, cannot be achieved in the near or mid-term future,” the report reads.The Kairos report alleges the way that Google presents some of its data is misleading. In the case of data center emissions, for example, Google says it has improved the energy efficiency of its data centers by 50% over 13 years. Citing energy efficiency numbers rather than sharing absolute ones obscures Google’s total emissions, the authors argue.“In fact, since 2010, the company’s total energy consumption has increased 1,282%,” the report concluded.Explore more on these topicsGoogleAlphabetGreenhouse gas emissionsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Users post clips with text saying things like: “If you hear this, you’re entering a new chapter. Expect blessings within 24h.”I wanted to be this lucky girl who gets everything she wishes for if only she follows these rituals properly.

I created a mood board in my bedroom, covering the walls in printouts of affirmations I found online. Some of them were heartfelt, some of them came from meme pages that satirised the culture: “I am in my safe zone”; “I am not clenching my jaw right now”; “Angels are watching 333”; “I am light”; “CLICK to be saved”.I noticed these images of affirmations were usually paired with light orbs. These orbs look like how we want to feel: weightless, golden, gentle, magical, powerful and limitless. I wanted to create a theatre-like set where I could portray myself embodying different kinds of lucky girls – this is the yogi lucky girl who bends over backwards for luck.The Lucky Girl Syndrome project is an interrogation of the economy of hope where girls like me find solace in using our devices and bedrooms as portals to wellness and self improvement. But it’s also part of my wider body of work where I am interested in questioning who and what the female form exists to serve. Growing up in a culture where our beauty is our worth, so much so that cosmetic surgery is normalised but Catholic morality still dictates ideas of gender roles, family and sexuality, I became attuned to how online self-help culture repackages control as empowerment, especially for women.Isabella Madridis a Colombian artist and photographerExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen behind the lensWomen's rights and gender equalityTikTokPhotographyColombiaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a simple bat-and-ball game, created in 1958 by scientistWilliam Higinbothamat the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, that is widely the considered the first ever video game created purely for entertainment. Tennis for Two ran on an oscilloscope and was designed as a minor diversion for visitors attending the lab’s annual open day, but when people started playing, a queue developed that eventually extended out of the front door and around the side of the building. It was the first indication that computer games might turn out to be popular.I’ve been unable to find out if Ralph Baer, the inventor of the first mass-produced games console, theMagnavox Odyssey, ever played Tennis for Two. However, when he was developing the idea of a TV that could play games, while working at the defence contractor Sanders Associates in the late 1960s, the rudimentary elements of what his prototype consoles could display on screen were vertical lines and square dots. When Magnavox released the product in 1972, its key games were Table Tennis and Tennis (the same as Table Tennis, except you could place a plastic overlay of a tennis court on your TV screen). These allowed two players to bat a ball to each other, adding a little “spin” by flicking the dial on the side of the primitive joypad. This was an extension of the knob on the Tennis for Two controller that let you alter the height of your return shot, but neither game really allowed much in the way of player skill.From here, of course, we get to Pong, widely considered the first smash hit video arcade game. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell played tennis on the Odyssey and thought he could do better; with programmer Al Alcorn, he divided the onscreen bat into eight areas, each deflecting the ball at a different angle. Here we had the true beginnings of input finesse, a crucial element of all future video games, giving the player room to add skill and timing to their shots. Pong was such asuccess, Bushnell realised Atari needed a single-player version – hence the 1976 coin-opBreakout, where you hit the ball not at another human participant but at a wall of disappearing bricks. Breakout was effectively a one-player tennis game, and its brilliance had two major ramifications for the video game industry in Japan: it was the first successful release for legendary manufacturer Namco after its purchase of Atari’s Japanese arm in 1974, effectively propelling the company into the video arcade business; Breakout also inspired a game designer named Tomohiro Nishikado, who would use it as the basis of a certain 1978 arcade game,Space Invaders. So you see, tennis is responsible for the entire shoot-em-up genre.View image in fullscreenAhead of his time … Ralph Baer, pictured in 2009, holding his ‘Brown Box’ prototype of the first consoles.Photograph: Jens Wolf/APTennis sims were also vitally important in the early home computer gaming boom of the 1980s. Titles such as Match Point on the ZX Spectrum and International Tennis on the Commodore 64 provided compelling and intuitive two-player experiences that didn’t require a whole team of animated players like footie sims. The accessibility of tennis as a game concept also appealed to Nintendo, with its Tennis, Mario Tennis andWii Tennis(from Wii Sports) games becoming its most popular sporting titles.Since then, every generation of consoles has had its staple tennis titles, usually not as big and showy as the football or basketball sims, but always there in the background, perfect for when non-gamers wanted to join in the fun. Namco’s Smash Court, Codemasters’ Pete SamprasTennis, 2K’s TopSpin and Sega’s Virtua Tennis have added interesting assets to the central concept of hitting a ball over a net, and while they have all sought to simulate a range of surfaces and competitions, it’s the idyllic vision of the Wimbledon grass court that has sold them. In tennis, you have an almost unique set of properties: wide consumer knowledge, an easy-to-understand rule-set married to deep skill mechanics and a highly constrained play space providing concentrated single-screen action.Would people have queued for hours outside a science research base in Upton, New York, in the autumn of 1958 to play a space blaster or kung fu fighting game? I don’t think so – it would have been unworldly and mystifying to many attenders. Look at Computer Space, the first commercially available space shooter arcade game, released in 1971 (designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney) – it did modestly well, but it was far from the global success that Pong achieved. The controls were too complicated, the concept too abstract. Tennis was the Trojan horse of the video game industry – it snuck video games into our homes and our amusement arcades, and by the time we realised what had happened, it was too late ever to go back.What to playView image in fullscreenRetro treat … Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition.Photograph: Team 17I was going to be predictable and recommend a tennis game here – probably a classic such asVirtua TennisorTop Spin 4– but instead I’m going for a different sort of retro treat.Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Editionis a modern update of what many consider to be the pinnacle of the Worms series, 1999’s Worms Armageddon, a daft multiplayer turn-based battle game where you set out to destroy your enemy’s army of annelids with sheep launchers, banana bombs and … a concrete donkey.It’s such a ridiculous and funny game, but also requires deep tactical thinking and such a mastery of angles and trajectory it may as well be considered educational software.

What’s the latest thinking?”As referenced in the What to Read section above, Laura Fryer, an early Xbox employee, has stated that Microsoft is preparing to kill games hardware development in favour of getting its Xbox app on to different platforms. We’ve seen this approach taking shape with the recentROG Xbox AllyandMeta Quest 3S Xbox Editionannouncements; Samsung is also making Xbox game streaming a part of its Smart TVs. However, Microsoft has alsojust announceda multi-year partnership with chip manufacturer AMD, which it stated would include “Future Xbox consoles”. Meanwhile, Sony, which lacks the sort of ecosystems open to Microsoft thanks to Windows, has recentlyreiterated its commitment to dedicated games consoles, which is unsurprising considering that PS5 has sold around 78m units, and rumours of a third Switchare already swirling. Earlier this month, Switch 2 sold over 3.5m units in its first four days on sale – a record for console hardware.So no, I don’t think dedicated games consoles are going anywhere soon. They’re convenient, cheaper than buying and maintaining a gaming PC and offer a more stable and reliable experience than streaming games via a set-top box. Also, after five years of increased virtualisation, where we generally don’t own the music we listen to or the movies we watch, there is a growing kickback against digital apps and streaming services – the games console is a desirable object, specifically designed for fun and rife with sentimental memories. It’s illogical really to want a big chunk of plastic and circuit boards to play games on, but when that chunk looks as cool as aMega Drive, aNeo Geoor aPlayStation 5, it becomes more than just a platform. While we still enjoy visible artefacts that express our likes and tastes, there will be consoles to put next to the TV and gaze at adoringly.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.In last week’s Pushing Buttons, we incorrectly said that the film Walkabout was directed by Peter Weir.

It’s big, brash and impossibly enjoyableTom ReganWed 2 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 05.01 EDTShareWhile searching for gold in the dingy mines of Ingot Isle, a severe storm sweeps dungaree-donning hero Donkey Kong into a vast underground world. You think he’d be distraught, yet with the subterranean depths apparently rich in banana-shaped gemstones, DK gleefully uses his furry fists to pummel and burrow his way towards treasure. From here, the first Donkey Kong platformer since 2014 is a dirt-filled journey to the centre of the Earth.Much like the Battlefield games of old, Bananza is built to let you pulverise its destructible environments as you see fit. That seemingly enclosed starting area? You can burrow your way through the floor. Bored with jumping through a cave? Batter your way through the wall instead. There’s a cathartic mindlessness to smashing seven shades of stone out of every inch of the ground beneath you, pushing the physics tech to its limits and seeing what hidden collectibles and passageways you unearth.In order to add an element of humanity to all the destruction, a young girl named Pauline (whom players may recognise from classic DK games) joins Donkers for the ride, perching on his simian shoulders while singing, like a Brit School-trained parrot.View image in fullscreenLike a Brit School-trained parrot … Pauline joins DK for the ride in Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoIn a welcome nod to the jazz-filled refrains of Super Mario Odyssey, Pauline sends DK into a frenzy by warbling like Mariah Carey. As DK locks into a gorilla groove by thumping on his chest, Pauline steps up to the mic and sings her heart out, powering him up to new hulking heights – his Bananza form – allowing him to smash through concrete as he glows red and embarks on a rhythmic rampage. As DK’s journey progresses, you unlock additional animal-themed transformations, with one later level seeing DK flutter through the air as a pretty bizarre-looking Ostrich.As it’s 2025, there’s now a skill tree, enabling players to upgrade DK’s moves, raise his health and even teach him new attacks and tricks. Continuing the RPG-lite approach, collectible hidden fossils are also carefully scattered across each new level, a currency used to buy new stat-boosting outfits. More importantly, these outfits are a huge amount of fun, allowing you to swap DK’s default crimson fur for a more gothic black-furred Kong – along with a pair of blue denim dungarees and a yellow tie of course.Thanks to its 3D hub worlds, ranged projectiles and wacky transformations, there’s more than a whiff of Rare’s seminal N64 Donkey Kong platformer to Bananza. Part Banjo-Kazooie, part Incredible Hulk simulator, the destruction-led chaos is a world away from the pristine Super Mario Odyssey. If you get tired of punching, you can opt to chuck objects at your surroundings instead. Donkey Kong can hurl slabs of stone and granite at foes, walls and ... well, anything really, even launching a special glowing material to destroy cursed structures and unlock one-off challenge areas. Some NPCs are even made out of gems, allowing you to pulverise them mid-conversation before they slowly reassemble, feigning nonchalance with a dead-eyed look in their shimmering crystallised irises.View image in fullscreenAn eyeball-straining degree of carnage … Donkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoThe development team seems to have had fun coming up with new fearsome foes for DK to face off against. From being bombarded by hordes of tiny angry blobs, to battering a golden skeletal pterodactyl or fleeing a hopping stone alligator head, the slightly nightmarish threats that you pulverise match Bananza’s off-kilter tone, looking pleasingly distinct from the usual Mario fare.Bosses promise to be a big part of Bananza too, with DK clashing with the nefarious VoidCo, a brooding gang of villainous apes who steal DK’s much-coveted Banandium Gems. Grumpy Kong, for example, pilots a towering concrete mech which you have to chip into layers, eventually lowering him to ground level and doing what DK now apparently does best – delivering a brutal beating.Mine kart sections make a welcome return, seeing you leap between rails to dodge obstacles and take out enemies and structures alike by chucking glowing rocks into them until they explode. In a bid to keep the frame-rate solid while you chisel the landscapes around you in real time, the visuals take a slight hit. While character models look great, certain environments and areas look a little bland – but most of the time, you’re moving too swiftly to truly care. While we start off in a dingy mine, we travel through a luscious lagoon and find our way leaping out of deadly rivers of toxins in a poison-filled swamp.Like Odyssey, there’s a half-hearted co-op mode in Bananza. Put in the sulky boots of Pauline, a second player can click and chip away at the environment via the Joy-Con mouse. Each click chucks or destroys bits of the environment, with both players reaching a screen-filling, eyeball-straining degree of carnage. Give this to a young’un and furious-click induced chaos will no doubt ensue. You have been warned.Donkey Kong Bananza is weird, a little janky at the moment and more chaotic thanNintendoplatformers of old. It’s the playable equivalent of Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit, big, brash and impossibly enjoyable. While the Switch 2 has been accused of being iterative rather than innovative, for his first Switch 2 appearance, it seems that the iconic ape is burrowing his way towards a new type of fun.Donkey Kong Bananza is released on 17 July on Nintendo Switch 2Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsNintendo Switch 2NintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

The media mogulBarry Diller, to name just one, donated a cool $250,000 to Andrew Cuomo’s campaign, only to see the disgraced former governor lose by a decisive margin.But Diller would soon be able to drown his disappointment inGreat Gatsby-themed cocktailsas hejoinedTom Brady, Ivanka Trump and at least three Kardashians for the cheeriest event on this season’s oligarchic social calendar:the Venetian weddingof the former TV journalist Lauren Sánchez and the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.It was a juxtaposition that even CNN questioned, as the networkcut from an interviewwith Mamdani to coverage of the gilded spectacle. Thereportedly $50maffairbooked all nineof Venice’s yacht ports,closed parts of the city to the publicand forcedthe relocation of hotel gueststo make room for the happy couple. It all served as a stark if sumptuous reminder that there is no expense the megarich won’t pay to secure their own comfort – except, of course, the toll their extravagance takes on the communities from whom they extract their wealth.The lovebirds’ choice of Venice alone demonstrates their carelessness. Because the city comprisesmore than 100 islandsin the Adriatic Sea, it’suniquely vulnerableto rising sea levels driven by warming global temperatures. Though Sánchezclaims to be“dedicated to fighting climate change”, and Bezos hascalled the issue“the biggest threat to our planet”, their guests arrived in the City of Bridges via96 private jets,the most carbon-intensive modeof transportation. Bezos has made splashy commitments to fighting climate change, like pledging$10bnto his Bezos Earth Fund, while Amazon has promised to becomecarbon neutralby 2040. But emissions from Amazon’s delivery fleetsoaredfrom 2019 to 2023, and itsnewest data centerwill guzzle millions of gallons of water and the energy equivalent of one million homes every year.This disingenuousness is as much a business strategy for Bezos as Prime’s two-day delivery, enabling him to launder his reputation without hurting his bottom line. The pattern played out last year with his ownership of the Washington Post – where, as soon as he felt threatened by an ascendant Donald Trump, journalistic integrity fell overboard more quickly than an inebriated wedding guest on a luxury gondola.As I covered ina columnearlier this year, Bezoskilled the Post’s endorsementof Kamala Harris,directed the editorial boardto publish op-eds that only support “personal liberties and free markets” andoversaw the exodusof more than 20 reporters and editors. Pamela Weymouth, granddaughter of trailblazing Post publisher Katharine Graham, described this capitulation ina recent piecefor the Nationas endangering “the very thing that makes America a democracy”.In fairness to Bezos, though, charity-washing is an occupational hazard for billionaires. Mark Zuckerberg initially donated to organizations fighting the California housing crisis thathe helped exacerbate, before quietlyending his fundingthis year. The Gates Foundationgives 90% of its fundingto non-profits in wealthy countries rather than the impoverished ones whose GDPs are smaller than its namesake’s net worth. The magnanimity of the uber-wealthy tends to produce what the journalist Anand Giridharadashas called“fake change”, or efforts that stop short of systemic change because those systems underpin the benefactors’ vast wealth.That’s why any vision of progressive change cannot rely on Bezos or his celebrity wedding guests to operate against their self-interest. (No, not even Oprah.) A Green New Deal will not come from oligarchical guilt, but from mass movements. Like the one thatdeployed almost 30,000 door knockersand pooled funds from 27,000 donors to share Mamdani’s message of genuine economic empowerment.Mamdani’s victory on Tuesday added to a growing body of proof that even billionaires don’t always get what they want. Last year, Elon Muskspent more than a quarter of a billion dollarselecting Republicans, but no amount of money could save him from Donald Trump’s mercurial temper. Nor did his wealth sway the voters of Wisconsin, where hecontributed $21mto a state supreme court candidate who ended up losing by 10 points.Voters’ growing skepticism of the 1% is no doubt being stoked by grassroots activism. Like in Venice, where local protesters threatened to fill canals withinflatable crocodiles, forcing the wedding of the century to relocate to the city’s outskirts. Back stateside, progressives Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez continue todraw record crowdsacross the country on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. At a recent stop in Oklahoma – a state Trumpwon by 33 points– Sanders spoke toa standing-room only crowd.Might a billionaire backlash be building, just in time for next year’s midterms?Explore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionJeff BezosZohran MamdaniVeniceClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

In response, the recently elected Liberal PM put forward a 127-page bill that includes, among other worrying provisions, sweeping changes to immigration policy that would make the process much more precarious for refugees and could pave the way for mass deportations.Canada said it would stand up to Trump. Instead, it’s taking cues from him | Shiri Pasternak and Dayna Nadine ScottRead moreIf passed, Carney’sStrong Borders Act(or Bill C-2) would bar anyone who has been in the country for more than a year fromreceiving refugee hearings. That would apply retroactively to anyone whoentered the country after June 2020. If they arrived on foot between official ports of entry, meanwhile, they would have toapply for asylum within 14 daysof entering Canada – a disastrous outcome for people fleeing Trump’s persecution. The bill also gives the immigration minister’s office the authority tocancel immigration documents en masse.This bill has been widely condemned by politicians and advocacy groups such asAmnesty Internationaland theMigrants Rights Network, who are rightly worried about just how much havoc a change like this could wreak. Jenny Wai Ching Kwan, a member of parliament for Vancouver East,told reportersthe bill would breach civil liberties and basic rights.So what excuse does Canada have for this kind of 180 on its immigration legacy?According to the government, the aim of this legislation is to “keep Canadians safe by ensuring law enforcement has the right tools to keep our borders secure, combat transnational organized crime, stop the flow of illegal fentanyl, and crack down on money laundering”.In reality, Bill C-2 contains measures that the public safety minister, Gary Anandasangaree,has admittedwere a response to “the concerns that have been posed by the White House”.“There are elements that will strengthen [our] relationships with the United States,” hesaidin a press conference. “There were a number of elements in the bill that have been irritants for the US, so we are addressing some of those issues.”Canadians said no to Trump – so why is Mark Carney pushing a Maga-inspired border bill? | Erica IfillRead moreTim McSorley, the national coordinator for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, condemned the federal government over the senselessness of this move. “If the government is serious about addressing concerns regarding illegal gun and drug trafficking, it must introduce legislation specifically tailored to that goal, as opposed to a wide-ranging omnibus bill,”he said.The demonization of immigrants has been a talking point for populist leaders throughout the west, so it’s not surprising to see Carney lean into that rhetoric in order to appease Trump. Spurred on by the xenophobic rhetoric coming out of the US, Britain, and large swaths of Europe, anyone who comes from away is forced to bear the blame for the economic messes and ensuing societal erosion these countries have found themselves battling.By feeding directly into this pipeline, Carney makes Canada not the powerful country poised to beat Trump at his dangerous games (elbows up, my foot), but a cowardly ally in the US’s campaign of terror against immigrants.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyMigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS immigrationAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

But we can be thankful that one group of people – federal district court judges – have bravely stood up to him and his many illegal actions.His excesses include gutting federal agencies, deporting immigrants without due process,firing thousands of federal workersdespite their legal protections, and ordering an end to birthright citizenship. Intent on upholding the constitution and rule of law, district court judges have issuedmore than 190 ordersblocking or temporarily pausing Trump actions they considered illegal. Their decisions have slowed the US president’s wrecking ball as it demolishes federal agencies, devastates foreign aid, decimates scientific research and demoralizes government employees.Those of us who held out hope that the supreme court, as rightwing as it has become, would join the district courts and stand up to Trump had our hopes dashed in a big way last week. The six hard-right justices delivered a major victory to Trump as they rolled over like puppies and ruled that district court judges can no longer, except in very limited circumstances, issue nationwide injunctions to halt Trump’s illegalities.In the6-3 decision, the justices ruledthat when district judges are convinced that a presidential action is illegal, they can issue injunctions that only cover the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit – they can only issue nationwide injunctions if they conclude that such action is the only way to assure complete relief to the plaintiffs. (The court wrote that plaintiffs might still be able to win broad injunctions by bringing class actions.)That case,Trump v Casa, involved Trump’s executive order that prohibited birthright citizenship – despite the 14th amendment’s language specifically guaranteeing it. In that case, Trump challenged district court judges’ nationwide injunctions upholding birthright citizenship –three district court judgeshad found Trump’s order to be unconstitutional and issued nationwide injunctions. In the Casa case, the justices limited their ruling to the validity of nationwide injunctions, without ruling on the constitutionality of Trump’s ban on birthright citizenship.In a stinging dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the court’s supermajority of “complicity” with Trump’s efforts to make a “solemn mockery of our Constitution”. With Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joining her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that “by stripping federal courts” of their extensive injunctive powers, the supreme court “kneecaps the Judiciary’s authority to stop the Executive from enforcing even the most unconstitutional policies”.There are two big problems with the Casa decision. First, it gives a red light to what has been the most effective check on Trump’s illegalities and authoritarian power grab. Second, the ruling gives a gleaming green light to Trump to speed ahead with more illegal actions, knowing that district court judges will be far less able to crack down effectively on his lawless acts.For the liberal justices and many Trump critics, a huge concern is that when a district court judge now finds a Trump policy to be unlawful, the judge can enjoin it only for the plaintiffs in the case. Meanwhile Trump can continue imposing that policy in the 49 other states. In her separate dissent, Jackson wrote: “The Court’s decision to permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.”The US supreme court has dramatically expanded the powers of the president | Moira DoneganRead moreOne thing seemed extraordinarily obtuse about the supermajority’s decision: they seemed infinitely more concerned that a district court judge’s nationwide injunction might exceed that judge’s legal authority than they were concerned about Trump’s unprecedented authoritarian actions and illegal excesses: his freezing of congressionally approved funding, his siccing the justice department on critics, his ordering retribution against law firms that hired lawyers he didn’t like, his freezing billions in grants to universities because they have diversity policies he detests.In the majority opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that judges don’t have “unbridled authority” to ensure that presidents comply with the law. While many political scientists are sounding the alarm that Trump is creating an authoritarian presidency insufficiently checked by the constitution’s separation of powers, Barrett warned of an “imperial judiciary”. The conservative supermajority failed to see the authoritarian forest for the trees; they seem blind to who is the real threat to our democracy. It isn’t district court judges upholding the law. It is a president who has suggested he’sabove the law.The Casa decision continues a dangerous pattern in which the conservative justices bow to Trump.In another caselast week, the court issued an unsigned decision, with the three liberal justices dissenting, that in effect said it wasfine for Trump to deportimmigrants to third countries, rather than their own, without giving them a chance to be heard about why that third country might be dangerous for them. Not only did the court let the Trump administration short-circuit due process in that case, but it gave Trump a victory in a case wherehis administration had twice disobeyeda district court judge’s orders. By failing to criticize the administration’s brazen defiance of a lower-court judge, the supermajority dangerously seemed to signal that it is OK for the administration to flout district judges’ orders.In another important case, the court ruled for Trump by halting a lower court’s order thatGwynne Wilcox be reinstatedto the National Labor Relations Board, after Trump fired Wilcox without giving any reason, despite federal law saying NLRB members can be fired only for malfeasance. Then there was last year’sdisastrous immunity decision, in which Chief Justice John Roberts, as if in a creative writing class, seemed to magically add new clauses to the constitution. Roberts’s majority ruling granted Trump presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for “official presidential acts” – a ruling that many legal scholars say has emboldened Trump to violate the law.Assuming the conservative supermajority wants to preserve our democracy and defend our constitution, it’s maddening and perplexing that they keep delivering victories to Trump. Perhaps they rule for him because they watch Fox News too much and believe Trump is a paragon of upholding the law. Or perhaps the justices fear that Trump will savage and ridicule them if they dare rule against the Maga king. Or perhaps the justices rule repeatedly for Trump because they fear he will defy their decisions if they rule against him – and they’ll become the first supreme court in history that a president repeatedly defies.In what is often called the most important supreme court case in history, Marbury v Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in 1803 that “it is emphatically” the role of the judiciary “to say what the law is”. Sadly, last week’s Casa decisionturned Marbury on its head in many ways. By limiting the ability of district court judges to say what the law is and make sure the executive follows it, the court’s supermajority is giving Trump far more power than before to “say what the law is”. Without district courts able to issue quick nationwide injunctions to curb Trump’s many illegalities, it may take a year or two or more before the supreme court acts to put a nationwide halt to some of Trump’s more egregious illegal actions.Considering that Trump has describedhimself as kingand talked ofsuspending the constitution, the supreme court is making a dangerous mistake in giving Trump more power while hamstringing the ability of brave, principled judges to rein in his excesses.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

These provide the data on everyone’s 2022-23 tax returns.If you love spreadsheets, you’ll love this release – one of them has 167 columns of data on everything from how many people earned “less than $0” (110,372) to how many of those who earned more than $1m had a Hecs debt (73). It also revealed that91 millionaires paid no taxbecause they were able to reduce their “taxable” income to below the tax-free threshold.But as most of you are sensible and do not love spreadsheets, let me dive into them and tell you what you need to know.Negative gearing is back in styleOne of the problems for those wishing to negative gear is that record low interest rates make this rather difficult (this might have broken the record for “most Australian-first-world problem ever written”).This was the case in 2020-21 and 2021-22 when the cash rate hit 0.1%, and for the first time since John Howard introduced the 50% capital gains tax discount, the number of rental profits exceeded rental losses. But in 2022-23 interest rates rose significantly, and as a result the rental loss numbers also rose (and profits fell):If the graph does not display click hereGiven the lag of rate rises and because some investors might have been able to fix their rates for a period, I suspect this time next year the number of rental losses will rise even more.Negative gearing remains the favourite of high-income earnersI have long joked that if you were an enterprising real estate agent, you could do a lot worse than set up camp wherever anaesthetists and surgeons were holding conferences, given they are always the most likely occupations to negative gear. And so it remains – 25.5% of surgeons negatively geared a property, while 24.9% of anaesthetists did as well.If the graph does not display click hereAlmost half of capital gains go to people earning more than $1m a yearThere has been a lot of talk this year about capital gains due to the changes to the superannuation tax concessions taxing unrealised capital gains – ie the value of assets held by a person in their super funds – of earnings in balances over $3m.Australian property prices are accelerating again – nearly twice as fast as wagesRead moreBut for most of us capital gains are a non-entity – most of us earn our income from our salary or wages and we get taxed at the income tax rate. Capital gains however get a 50% discount if you have owned the asset for more than a year.If that feels like a rort, well, welcome to Australia’s tax system.Ninety per cent of Australians earned less than $150,000 in total income in 2022-23. That 90% earn about 72% of all the wages and salaries in Australia, but they earn just 19% of all the capital gains in Australia.By contrast, the 24,350 people who earned more than $1m a year make up just 0.2% of all individuals in the tax system, but earned 46% of all the capital gains in Australia:If the graph does not display click hereAnd when you compare the average wages and capital gains by total income range, it’s pretty clear than the very rich get most of their income from capital gains rather than wages (as well as dividends and franking credits that come from owning shares):If the graph does not display click here$3m superannuation remains a long way away from almost everyoneSpeaking of tax dodges, the tax stats also give us the latest figures for median superannuation balance by age and gender.In 2022-23, the median superannuation balance for women in their early 60s was just $153,685, while for men it was $205,385.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This means more than half of people nearing retirement have only around a third of money in their super to be able to retire comfortably.ASFA also suggests that for a 32-year-old to be able to have a comfortable retirement they should now have $83,000 in their super. The median balance however for people ages 30-34 is just $38,525.It really is getting a bit silly trying to argue against the changes to the tax concessions of superannuation balances above $3m:If the graph does not display click hereIf you earn more than $150,000 you are in the top 10% – and you are probably a manThe ATO rather wonderfully breaks down the incomes of all Australians into percentiles – to let you know where you sit among the rest of all the income earners in Australia.Women are very much overrepresented in the bottom half of the income scale. There are 3.52 million women in the bottom income half, but just 2.8 million men.By contrast, at the very top 1% there are 35,315 women compared with 91,160 men.The median earnings is about $70,000. Earning more than $150,000 puts you in the top 10% – and 70% of those are men:If the graph does not display click hereThe gender pay gap remains wideWhenever we hear talk about the gender pay gap it is in either hourly or weekly terms. But this hides how many hours (or days) people actually work. If a man and woman are both earning $50 an hour, but the man gets 40 hours a week, while the woman only gets 20 hours, are we really going to say there is no gender pay gap?The ATO tax stats show all – because it records how much you earn in a year, which is pretty crucial given you have to pay bills all year round, not just the weeks you earn money.And once again the difference is stark.Take for example the most male- and female-dominated occupations, plumbers and midwives:If the table does not display click hereBut perhaps we should not be too shocked that men are paid more on average in the most female-dominated occupation, because in almost all jobs men earn more:If the graph does not display click hereWhile it might be easy to suggest that this is just the way it is, a couple of examples show how things can change.Since 2016 both women’s cricket and football (across all codes) has gained much greater visibility and support, and it is clearly present in the gender pay gap. In 2016-17, women made up just 3.3% of the 2,911 people who listed “footballer” as their main occupation; in 2022-23 it was 18% – from 96 women to 537. Similarly, women now make up 36% of the 403 professional cricketers in Australia.And while men still get paid much more than women, the closing of the gap is quite stark – and something unfathomable a decade ago.If the graph does not display click hereIt’s worth remembering that gender pay gaps – just as how incomes and wealth are taxed – are not set in stone, and things can always be made more fair.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsTaxGender pay gapBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

In 1948, Clement Attlee’s government made a choice founded on fairness: that everyone in our country deserves to receive the care they need, not the care they can afford.That the NationalHealthService was created amid the rubble and ruin of the aftermath of war makes that choice all the more remarkable. It enshrined in law and in the service itself our collective conviction that healthcare is not a privilege to be bought and sold, but a right to be cherished and protected. Now it falls to our generation to make the same choice.There have always been those who have whispered that theNHSis a burden, too expensive, inferior to the market. Today, those voices grow louder, determined to use the crisis in the NHS as an opportunity to dismantle it. This government rejects the pessimistic view that universal healthcare could be afforded in the 20th century but not in the 21st. So does the public. But unless the NHS changes, the argument that it is unsustainable will grow more compelling. It really is change or bust. We choose change.Today, the prime minister will launch our 10-year plan for health, to radically reimagine healthcare. More care will be available on your doorstep and from your own home, with thousands more GPs. Services and resources will be moved out of hospitals and into the community. New neighbourhood health centres[?]will house doctors, nurses, physios, therapists, tests, scans and urgent care under one roof, built around patients’ convenience.AI technology will liberate frontline staff from the drudgery of admin, giving them time to care. Saving just 90 seconds of data entry and note-taking per appointment would be the equivalent of hiring an extra 2,000 GPs. For patients, tech will make booking appointments and managing your care as easy as doing your shopping online.By treating and caring for patients closer to home, we will reach patients earlier, to catch illness before it worsens, and prevent it in the first place. Our plan brings together a coalition of the willing on public health,working with supermarketsto make the healthy choice the easy choice and pharmaceutical companies to secure obesity jabs for NHS patients.The plan is backed by an extra£29bn investment to fund the reforms, better services and new technology.I am sometimes told that NHS staff are resistant to change. In my experience, they’re crying out for it. They have suffered the moral injury of turning up to work, slogging their guts out, only to leave at the end of the day feeling exhausted and demoralised by the conditions that patients are being treated in because of circumstances beyond their control.I spoke to a nurse in a community clinic who told me she spends more time filling out forms than seeing patients. That’s not why she joined the NHS. We need to free up our staff to do what they do best – care. They’re the ones driving innovation on the frontline, and their fingerprints are all over this plan.To succeed, we need to defeat the cynicism that says that “nothing ever changes”. We know the change in our plan is possible because it is already happening. We have toured the country and scouted the world for the best examples of innovation and reform. If Australia can effectively serve communities living in the remote outback, we can meet the needs of people living in rural and coastal England. If community health teams can go door to door toprevent ill health in Brazil, we can do the same in Bradford. We know we can build the “neighbourhood health service”, because teams inCornwall,CamdenandNorthumberlandare already showing us how.Since July, we’ve already begun to turn the tide. We promised to deliver 2m extra elective appointments in our first year – we’ve delivered4m and counting. Through our plan for change, we’ve takenalmost a quarter of a million casesoff the waiting list.The science is on our side. The revolution in genomics, AI, machine learning and big data offers a golden opportunity to deliver better care for all patients and better value for taxpayers. We will take it, marrying the ingenuity of our country’s leading scientists with the care and compassion of the health service.Above all else, we will give power to the patient. In an age of next-day deliveries, an NHS that forces you to wait on the phone at 8am to book an appointment feels ridiculously outdated. Patients don’t just want a service from the NHS, we want a say. We don’t want the same as everyone else; we want care that meets our individual needs. Equality does not mean uniformity, it means that every person receives the right care for them.This plan will give people real choices, faster responses and a say in how their care is delivered and where. It will fulfil Nye Bevan’s commitment in 1948 that the NHS would put a “megaphone in the mouth” of every patient, and make sure that the advantages enjoyed by the privileged few were available to all.We know the British people are counting on us to make sure that the NHS not only survives, but thrives. We are determined not to let them down.That’s the plan – now it falls to us and the 1.5 million people working in the NHS to deliver it. It won’t be easy, but nothing could be more worthwhile. If we succeed, we will be able to say with pride, echoed through the remaining decades of this century, that we were the generation that built an NHS fit for the future and a fairer Britain, where everyone lives well for longer.Wes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s why it could be a good thingLarry ElliottThe education secretary speaks of ‘worrying repercussions’ – but as far as wellbeing goes, the UK might be a lot better offWed 2 Jul 2025 11.50 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 11.55 EDTShareBack in the early 1970s when he was lead singer with the Faces, few of his fans would have expected Rod Stewart to be still belting out Maggie May at Glastonbury more than half a century later. Long gone are the days when rock stars hoped to die before they got old. Instead, 80-year-old rock stars symbolise the fact that Britain and other developed economies have ageing populations. Women are having children later in life and having fewer of them.Politicians are starting to fret about the prospect of a decreasing number of people of working age supporting an ever-increasing number of pensioners. Just this week, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the falling birthrate had “worrying repercussions” and thatshe hoped tobe able to make it easier for women to have children.This might seem a curious concern given that the UK’s population has risen from fewer than 60 million at the turn of the millennium to 67.2 million by 2022 and is expected to rise by another 5 million by 2032. Yet the fertility rate in England and Wales – the number of live births per woman – is currently 1.44, the lowest since records began in 1938 and well below the 2.1 level consistent with a stable population. If that trend continues and net migration is reduced, the number of people in the UK will eventually start to decline.So much is obvious. Less clear is what, if anything, policymakers should do to raise fertility rates. The answer may well be nothing. A falling population is not a disaster. It might even be a good thing.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, would certainly disagree with that conclusion. So would France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. Italy has a tax-free allowance – a “baby bonus” – for women having children. Macron has a plan for France’sdemographic rearmament. In 2019, Hungary offered women a€30,000 (£26,000) interest-free loanthat would be non-repayable in the event that they had three or more children. The chances of the UK matching that level of generosity given the strains on the public finances are infinitesimally small.Yet the evidence from countries that have already hit the panic button over declining populations is not encouraging. Fertility rates in Italy, France and Hungary remain well below 2.1 despite the fiscal inducements. And that’s because the factors that are persuading women to delay having children – or not have children at all – are stronger than government tax breaks or interest-free loans.Make no mistake, these are welcome changes. Women are better educated than they have ever been. More of them go to university, so have the possibility of securing interesting and well-paid jobs. It is not surprising that for many of them career progression takes precedence over childbirth in their 20s. The days when households were financially dependent on one male breadwinner are over – and a good thing too.It is also tough for women who do want to start a family at a younger age. Rising house prices have resulted in home ownership rates among 25- to 34-year-oldsdeclining from 59% to 39%since 2000. Rents have also increased sharply.Given all this, it is hard to see much future for pronatalist policies in the UK. The reality is that the demographic makeup of Britain will change over the coming decades as people live longer and fertility rates remain well below 2.1. If net migration is below the levels of recent years, the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks thepopulation could be 1.2 million lowerin 2072 than it was in 2022.Is this really so much of a problem? The economist David Miles – one of those responsible for putting together the OBR’s economic and fiscal forecasts – says not. In a recent paper, he argues that the catastrophising about shrinking populations is “largely bunkum”.In part, that’s because the global population is expected to continue growing for some decades to come, putting added pressure on the environment and speeding up climate breakdown. It makes little sense to adopt policies designed to increase fertility rates when the UK is an overcrowded island in an overpopulated world.But it is also the case that the combination of an ageing and gently falling population could result in living standards rising. Older people tend to save more and that means the ratio of capital to worker will increase. There will, in other words, be fewer workers but they could well be more productive.Bridget Phillipson says she wants more young people in UK to have childrenRead moreMeasured by gross domestic product, the economy would be getting smaller, but GDP per head – a much better measure of wellbeing – would be increasing. There would be less congestion on the roads, less pressure on public services and less competition for housing. Japan already has an ageing and shrinking population and seems to be coping just fine.To be sure, there will still need to be policy changes in Britain. If there are going to be fewer young people, it is bad for the economy as well as a waste of individual potential for them not to be working. To that extent, the motivation behind the government’s botched welfare reforms makes sense. Childcare needs to be more affordable and changes to the pension age might also be required to extend the working lives of those able to do so.But it is not inevitable that a falling population would be bad for the economy. It would certainly be good for the planet.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPopulationOpinionMigrationBridget PhillipsonLabourChildbirthcommentShareReuse this content"

Psychological sibling warfare is rifeWed 2 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 19.05 EDTShareHow normal is sibling-on-sibling savagery? It’s a question I asked myself last week while watching two small children fight, Mike Tyson-style, on Instagram Reels.The kids, maybe four and two, wore boxing gloves and squared off on a grippy, padded floor. The older sister was thumping her brother like her life depended on it. His retaliation attempts, while honourable, were largely futile – age was on her side. Still, his spirit didn’t break. Every time she totalled him, he got back up, ready for more.It was addictive to watch – not just for their agility, but because it transported me, like a whiff of forgotten perfume, to my childhood.‘Don’t get into the it’s-not-fair game!’ How to survive the hell of sibling rivalry – as a child and a parentRead moreGrowing up, my older sister was my archnemesis. I can pinpoint the moment it began: my fifth birthday. I went to the toilet and, when I came back, all of my friends were gone from the lounge room. I panicked. Had they gone home? Without saying goodbye? No. Worse. They were in my sister’s bedroom, hanging out with her instead of me. My heart sank. I knew I’d lost them. As any younger sibling will attest, you’ll never be more entertaining than an older sibling with a cooler room and a lava lamp.Her version of our villain origin story would read differently. She’d probably say it started when I stole her Motorola Razr, opened the “voice recordings” folder and found a clip of her breathily singing Jessica Simpson’s With You. It was the kind of blackmail material a younger sibling can only dream of. I played it to Mum and Nana. They both laughed – a rare reaction, given they’d hate for either of us to feel embarrassed for expressing ourselves. Unfortunately, despite their empathy, a tone-deaf rendition of “with nothin’ but a T-shirt on” was comedy gold. My sister walked in and her face went so red it almost turned purple. She was livid. And so, in her mind, it began.Our fighting got progressively worse as time wore on. The smallest of slights would set off explosive brawls. A front seat “dibsed”, a remote control hogged, a McDonald’s french fry secretly snuck before we got home. Each petty win kept the flame of our feud alive.On rare occasions, our altercations would spill out on to the street. This was typically when my sister would refuse to drive me to school. Banshee-level screaming would ensue, followed by some light kicking through the window.I genuinely thought no siblings in Australia were capable of fighting as ferociously as we did – until I posted the boxing toddlers to my Instagram Story with the caption: “Me and my sister over a Kookai top.” The post exploded. My DMs lit up. Suddenly, I had hundreds of similarly harrowing tales.When I mentioned chasing my sister with kitchen scissors, someone replied: “Endless leg kicks when they’re above you. Only way to win.” Some stories unlocked repressed memories. “My brother used to chase us with a knife, then smear tomato sauce on himself and play dead,” said one person. “I think that’s why I’m great in emergencies.” Me too! I once staged my own murder scene so my parents would think my sister killed me before they got home.Early-2000s technology was a major trigger. Rows over the family computer were common. One sister smashed her brother’s Xbox and scattered the pieces across a 4km radius, so Xbox fragments haunted him wherever he went. One girl broke her sister’s finger while watching Charmed, but only let her cry during the ad breaks.Psychological warfare was rife. One woman’s sister told her a bath bomb was a tablet she “had to consume”. A four-year-old was convinced by her brothers to “take a shit in the backyard at a family BBQ”, for reason unknown. She followed through, quite literally. Another sibling was told he’d been found at a servo wrapped in a Subway footlong.Growing up surrounded by boys, I’m fascinated – and a bit scared – by the dynamic between sisters | Rebecca ShawRead moreWhile all of these stories sound borderline deranged, almost everyone who submitted them sounded glad to have had the experience. The white-hot panic of being chased around the kitchen island with a sharp object? That must breed resilience. I’d like to think it was character-building. I truly feel like no one can hurt me as badly as my sister did. There’s power in that.Even at our worst, there was always one rule: only we were allowed to terrorise each other. When some boys stole my bike from the milk bar in primary school, my sister chased them down, gave them a spray and retrieved my two wheels. Years later, on one of the rare occasions we went clubbing together, we were each other’s bodyguards. I’ll never forget the rage that bubbled up from somewhere deep inside me when I saw a man grab her for a dance against her will. I kicked off and he got kicked out. My sister and I danced in peace and, naturally, argued in a taxi home.Is it possible to move on from this dynamic? For full-on, lifelong fighters, sometimes it takes a family emergency for you to call tools down. It happened for my sister and me during Covid. Our dad – the man whose incandescent temper we surely inherited – was diagnosed with cancer. It shifted something in the family dynamic. Fighting, while at times horrible, was our default setting. When we were forced to reflect on the possibility of losing him, a new normal emerged. It finally became clear that we wouldn’t always be fortunate enough to spoil the peace of our nuclear family, however dysfunctional.The decision to form a truce after 26 years of full-pelt warfare wasn’t intentional. It wasn’t acknowledged with some grand gesture, a big apology or by “hugging it out”. Our hatred just silently slipped away. I guess I felt as though my parents finally deserved to experience having children who didn’t hate each other. My dad is fine now. And my sister and I? We are even better.Lucinda Price is an author and comedian who goes by the name FroomesExplore more on these topicsSiblingsOpinionFamilyParents and parentingAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

This timely film was originally produced for the BBC by award-winning production company Basement Films. The BBC has been delaying it since February, arguing it couldn’t go out before a review into an entirely different film, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone,had culminated. That was a poor editorial decision with no precedent. But poorer still: after months of leaving the film in limbo, last week theBBC announced it wouldn’t air it– leaving it for Channel 4 to pick up.Why? TheBBCsaid it might create “the perception of partiality”. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was lifted from a dystopian novel. Perception, after all, has nothing to do with impartiality – at least in an ideal world. The BBC seems to have said the quiet part out loud. Impartiality, as far as it’s concerned, is about PR, optics and managing the anger of certain groups, rather than following the evidence and championing robust journalism – no matter who’s angered, no matter how it looks.More than 100 BBC journalistshave now anonymously signed a letter, calling the choice not to broadcast Gaza: Doctors Under Attack a “political decision” that doesn’t reflect the quality of journalism in the film. The BBC, they say, is “an organisation crippled by the fear of being perceived as critical of the Israeli government”. The letter says the decision not to air this film came straight from the top, and many BBC staff – junior and senior – are unhappy with it. They feel it doesn’t reflect the organisation’s values, and that there was no acceptable editorial justification for delaying and then canning it. Some have been brave enough to voice this internally, but their concerns haven’t been heard.It’s no surprise to me that the BBC isn’t listening to its own journalists over this film. It’s also no surprise to me that more than 100 BBC journalists felt they needed anonymity to criticise the board’s decision. Because this isn’t the first anonymous letter. Twenty months ago, while I was working as a journalist in a BBC newsroom, coveringGazaday in and day out, I realised that my news organisation wasn’t accurately telling this story. But I didn’t feel I could openly criticise editorial policy without being taken off the story or coded as biased, and I wasn’t alone.View image in fullscreenA scene from the Gaza: Doctors Under Attack film to be shown on Channel 4.Photograph: Basement FilmsIn November 2023, I wrote the first letter out of the BBC, expressing concerns about the Gaza coverage. It was signed by just seven other BBC journalists, andreported on by Al Jazeera. By the time I wrote my last letter,published inthe Independenta year later, more than 100 BBC journalists had signed anonymously, alongside hundreds of industry professionals and respected media lecturers. This was around the time I left the organisation, unable to continue in good conscience. Dissent was clearly growing. But people were still afraid to speak openly.Last week in parliament, the BBC’s director of news, Richard Burgess, claimed the organisation listens to its journalists. But my letters weren’t heard, and nor were my efforts to raise the alarm internally. In the year from October 2023, I organised staff, attended multiple “listening sessions” with executives, helped put together dossiers of poor coverage, wrote to executives and relevant teams, and did my best to cover Gaza while hamstrung by obstructive editorial policy and an unwillingness to cover the story.I was a BBC-trained journalist horrified at the contradiction between the ideals of our public broadcaster – accuracy, transparency, public trust – and its actions. Editorial caution had become editorial cowardice. Decisions were being shaped by fear – of complaint campaigns and lobby groups, of being told off by higher-ups. This had left us with coverage that was overall inaccurate, failing to communicate the disproportionality, scale, gravity and illegality of Israel’s actions in Gaza – actions now deemed a genocide by various experts and humanitarian organisations.Inaccuracy is more than telling an overt lie. Inaccuracy comes in many forms: omitting key stories, omitting key context, speaking to one group far more than another. Good journalism is about following the evidence. And if the BBC’s approach has been shaped by evidence, why did it speak to more than double the number of Israelis, compared with Palestinians, in the year after 7 October 2023? Why did it omit key legal context – such as the January 2024 international court of justice ruling – from its coverage? These choices skew reality. Both are findings from a recent damningCentre for Media Monitoring reporton the BBC’s Gaza coverage, with data-backed insights into how it has failed to tell the full story.‘Heads will roll’: BBC reckons with bias accusations over Israel and Palestine coverageRead moreAnd it hasn’t learned its lesson. Perhaps if the BBC had listened to these journalists over the past year and a half, Gaza: Doctors Under Attack would have aired in February when it was ready, instead of becoming another gaping omission in BBC coverage.BBC impartiality is dead. The fiction that our public broadcaster can stay perfectly neutral, without being influenced, is fracturing around us. Every so-called “controversial” story has exposed a new fault line, showing how unwilling the BBC is to wade through influence and disinformation to get to the truth – in certain cases. Gaza, climate breakdown, migration: these are stories where public opinion has been polarised, powerful lobby groups are at play, or where the government or major corporations have come down on one side. This is where the BBC is most needed but fails most catastrophically.Those at the top of the BBC now have a choice. They can once again ignore the alarm raised by their own journalists, and continue to chip away at the trust of audiences and staff. Or they can finally – after 20 months – listen.Karishma Patel is a former BBC journalist and newsreader turned media criticDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But society has hard calls to make: sometimes perfect is not worth havingWed 2 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 12.46 EDTShareIt’s the perfect Wimbledon. The sun is out, the Brits are firing and as for the scoring, that too will be somewhat perfect, this being the first Wimbledon since the tournament told the line judges, long the arbiters of accuracy, that after 148 years, their services willno longer be required.Arguments, unpredictability and, as the cameras zoom in to the line judge whose eyesight judgment prompts a participant explosion, buttock-clenching awkwardness in close-up: goodbye to all that. Hello, AI and sharp-eyed robots, analysing in real time 18 lots of footage.It’s perfect now, but is it progress? After the first day, players complained that while the calls were perfect in their accuracy, they were imperfect in that the gizmo’s volume was set too low and they could not hear the verdicts.To some extent, Wimbledon is falling into line – both the Australian and US Opens, and very many of the lesser professional tournaments, have waved goodbye to the humans and embracedelectronic line calling. The players wanted it. They strive truly, madly and deeply for perfection; their short, explosive careers cannot hinge on the human fallibility of others.But look at Centre Court without the sentries posted around the border, and without the quiet ceremony that has always marked the departure of one set of line judges and the arrival of another. One day their absence will feel natural and maybe we’ll forget they were ever there, barking their assessments. But for now, their absence feels like a loss. Game, set and match to the gizmos.Of the grand slams, the premier tournaments of world tennis, only the French Open has resisted the temptation to shoo away the line judges and embrace electronica, and you may think therein lies a morality tale of sorts. When the Wimbledon plan was mooted, one experienced line judge there spoke not just of the hurt of being abruptly discarded but also of her worry that line judges, drawn from clubs around the country, were a crucial link between the elite game, with its Wimbledon showpiece, and the grassroots, which has perennially felt neglected. They saw being asked to participate at Wimbledon as a reason to stay connected, a kind of lodestar. “I worry that smaller tournaments willstruggle to find line judgessoon,” she said.At the French Open this year, FrenchTennisFederation president Gilles Moretton was asked why it remains loth to regulate battle on the red clay with technology and cleaves to its line judges.He thought the gizmos were not quite perfect, citing a 10% error rate. He said never say never, but primarily he said: “We need those people working all year long in our tournaments, promoting tennis in small clubs, being there for club matches. If we stop having those linesmen, those referees, we feel that is not too good for tennis in France maybe, and I think it may be the same in other countries.”PerhapsWimbledonis right – in lockstep with inevitability and history’s sweep – but it’s worth taking a moment to think about the value and cost of perfection.Farewell tradition, hello robots: Wimbledon adjusts to life without line judgesRead moreTalk to a football fan about VAR. Thevideo assistant referee systemwas designed to help match officials make perfect decisions but has instead robbed too many games of flow, joy and spontaneity. Do I want glaring mistakes to stand? No. Do I want a brilliant goal disallowed because the gizmo picked up an attacker’s elbow tip rendering them offside? No, I don’t want that either. Do I want to wait five minutes to celebrate a goal while the gizmo and its handlers, pursuing their perfection, deliberate? No, I really don’t. Do I want my team to lose because the referee made an error? No, of course not, but I also think that human fallibility is what makes it a flesh-and-blood endeavour.As the technological possibilities increase, with an AI model for everything now, we are going to have to face and answer some hard questions about whether we want perfect (or just good enough) and/or whether we prize humans. Of course there will be a need for both, but if we leave big tech and commerce to make those decisions, the society of the future may not be calibrated the way we’d like.I’m no luddite. Machines and tech do some things better. But humans are human. They smile at you at the supermarket checkout, can out-banter any bot at the bank or the hardware store and they added to the spectacle that is Wimbledon. They’re not perfect, but I will always miss them when they’ve gone.Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025OpinionWimbledonTenniscommentShareReuse this content"

This is just gas market Groundhog DayTristan EdisThe ACCC has been running an inquiry into the sector since 2017 and has been saying the same thing every year. The answer is obviousWed 2 Jul 2025 02.03 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 03.25 EDTShareThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is yet againwarning of imminent gas shortfallsfor Australia’s east coast. In response, the federal government hasannounced another reviewinto whether we need to reform our gas market regulation.Given the ACCC has been running a gas market inquiry since 2017 and has been saying pretty much the same thing every year since – essentially that gas producers treat Australian consumers like second class citizens – isn’t the answer blindingly obvious?For the past few years, the gas market has been stuck in Groundhog Day. Each year the gas producers tell us that the only problem is slow government approvals for new developments. Interestingly governments have approved many new gas developments, for example Santos’ Narrabri gas field was approved in 2020 but is yet to proceed.Yet each year we find ourselves in the predicament of imminent shortfalls. Then the government steps in to “negotiate” (or is it beg?) for the gas producers to pretty please provide some extra gas to domestic consumers at a price that won’t cripple them. In response the gas companies miraculously find some extra gas under the couch and dribble out a little bit more, but not too much that it might noticeably reduce prices.Labor is open to fresh options to secure east coast gas supplies. Is it about to make a radical shift?Read moreSome gas producers appear to be engaged in a phenomenon so well known to economists they’ve invented a term for it: “strategic withholding”. This is where a producer knows that if they pull back a bit on production then they can force up prices enough that it will increase their overall long-term profits. So, the government can grant permission to exploit extra gas fields, but that doesn’t mean a producer will give us extra gas if it will reduce prices.The Victorian government proposed that in order to assist manufacturers desperate for gas, it would free up gas supply for them byswitching households away from gas appliancesto electric-powered ones. This would not only assist manufacturers, it would also leave households financially better off.Independentanalysis by the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysisfound it would save households $6.3bn on their energy bills over 10 years, compared with an extra cost of new appliances of $3.5bn. Not to mention it would substantially reduce carbon emissions.The counterattack from the oil and gas lobby was vociferous.The gas pipeline lobby has been threatening that they’d be massively hiking pipeline charges to make up for the loss of revenue from households. There have been claims that the forthcoming gas shortage was somehow thefaultof the Victorian government for being“anti-gas”. This went to the extent of Santosaccusingthe Victorian government of being akin to that of North Korea. You just had to ignore the fact that gas pipeline flow data clearly shows gas suppliers have beenfunnelling large quantities of Victorian gas northwardfor years. Meanwhile the net gas coming south from Queensland’s gas exporters has been a tiny dribble. You also had to ignore the fact that under this “anti-gas” government, gas producers have been free to pursue new Victorian gas supply investments in recent times involvinghundreds of millions of dollars.In the face of attacks, the Victorian government pulled back from a phase-out of gas heaters. This would have been the greatest financial and gas supply benefit to consumers of any single energy policy currently in contemplation by Australian governments. Victorian residential gas heating is responsible for about70 petajoules of gas consumption per annumwhich is 20% more gas than currentlyconsumed by all of Victoria’s manufacturing facilitiesand around two to four times the amount ofgas used in power generation in Victoria.Another way of looking at it is that it would provide around the same amount of extra gas as former federal Liberal leader Peter Dutton had promised under his gas reservation policy. A policy which his colleagues had claimed would“flood” the market with gas.Yes, a gas heater phase out would have overruled consumer choice. But how many households do you know that when confronted with a broken down heater in winter think through the gas market supply-demand balance over the next decade in deciding what to do? How many pull out a spreadsheet to evaluate the costs and benefits for them to switch over to electric compared to industrial manufacturers?Those who claim we must leave consumers to choose are the same types of people that gullibly believed oil and gas companies would put the interests of Australian consumers first over making money from LNG export plants.Tristan Edis is director of analysis and advisory at GreenEnergyMarketsExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionGasAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)commentShareReuse this content"

But the world needs to see itThe film the BBC refused to air shows the targeting, detainment and torture of medics in Gaza. Its relentless timeline of horrors will never leave youStuart HeritageWed 2 Jul 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 19.03 EDTShareThe biggest, and possibly only, failure of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack is that the circumstances of its broadcast threaten to overshadow its content.A brief recap: this film was first commissioned by the BBC, only to be dropped when another documentary – Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone –sparked a furoreover impartiality.The abandonment drew uproar from within the corporation, scorn from the wider media and the inescapable sense that what started as a vital piece of film-making had devolved into yet another navel-gazing referendum on the purpose of the BBC.Thanks to Channel 4 picking it up late in the day, Gaza: Doctors Under Attack now exists in the world, and it has never been more evident that this is a work that demands to be seen.Doctors Under Attack bills itself as a “forensic investigation” into claims that the IDF has been systematically targeting Palestinian medics in all 36 of Gaza’s hospitals. The attacks, according to the United Nations, follow a set pattern. First, a hospital comes under bombardment, then it is besieged. After that, it is raided by tanks and bulldozers and its medical workers are detained. And then, once the hospital has essentially been rendered non-functional, the forces move on and repeat.It’s a strategy designed to cripple Gaza for years to come, says one talking head. After all, when a building is destroyed, you can throw up another in its place. But medics require years of training. Rob Gaza of their expertise and you deny its chances of ever rebuilding. This is despite, as the film repeats time and time again, healthcare workers being protected under international law.The power of Doctors Under Attack comes in the unhurried way it chooses to unfurl its thesis. There is no clear manipulation, no central villain. What there is, however, is an unceasing timeline of horrors.We are shown doctors doing their best in overwhelmed hospitals with no water or electricity, racing to treat wounds that have already begun to rot. We are shown them coming under what seem like targeted attacks, being detained in black sites where they will be tortured and interrogated. There is footage of a gang rape by soldiers. We are shown children, injured and dead, in vast numbers.The central part of the film, however, is stories of individual doctors. There is Dr Khaled Hamouda, discussing the direct attack on his home that killed 10 members of his family, and the drone strike that moments later hit the house the survivors escaped to. His wife and young daughter dead, he then took refuge in the grounds of his hospital, which was bombarded and raided. He was detained along with 70 other doctors, and beaten.View image in fullscreen‘No water, no electricity’ … surgeons at work in Gaza: Doctors Under Attack.Photograph: Basement FilmsAnd then there is Dr Adnan al-Bursh, who was detained, stripped, interrogated, disappeared and tortured. Unlike Hamouda, we do not get to hear his testimonial, because he died in prison. But we do get to hear the calls he made to his family before then, telling his children to look after their mother. To hear their stories is to be filled with utter hopelessness.There have been several muscular documentaries about the Palestinian territories this year, either setting the table of the conflict or – as with the case ofLouis Theroux’s film The Settlers– trying to understand the psychology behind those who choose to exacerbate it.But Doctors Under Attack is by far the most unsparing. The discussion of what has happened to the detained doctors, verified by an anonymous Israeli whistleblower, is the stuff of nightmares. There are beatings. There is torture. Most unsettlingly of all, there are descriptions of mistreatment by Israeli doctors, who would perform procedures without anaesthetic and inform the prisoners that “You are a criminal and you have to die.”The BBC dropped Doctors Under Attack due to the risk that it created “a perception of partiality”. However, it is hard to square that claim with the film that has aired on Channel 4. Clarification has been sought from the IDF at every turn. The events of 7 October 2023 are shown here just as graphically as the footage of injured Palestinian children. The film-makers understand that the slightest sign of bias would collapse the argument.In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would “make people angry, whichever side they take.” She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you. It will provoke an international reaction, and for extremely good cause. Forget what got it stopped at the BBC. It is here now and, regardless of how that happened, we owe it to the subjects to not look away.Gaza: Doctors Under Attackis on Channel 4nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGazareviewsShareReuse this content"

We meet the ‘social urbanists’ credited with reducing crime – and even temperaturesOliver WainwrightWed 2 Jul 2025 11.13 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 12.17 EDTShareLilac-flowering creepers engulf an abandoned house on a street corner in Medellín,Colombia, spilling from the roof and smothering most of the upstairs windows. A giant fan palm is visible through one opening, while a knotty tangle of aerial roots cascades down to the pavement from another. Step through the doorway of this overgrown ruin, and you find not a scene of desolation and decay but a sleek steel frame holding up the crumbling facade, which forms an unusual entrance to an enchanting new public park.“We behaved more like archaeologists than landscape architects,” says Edgar Mazo of Connatural, the firm behind theParque Prado, in the working-class neighbourhood of Aranjuez. He leads me through a series of planted terraces; fountain grasses and trumpet trees sprout from where a derelict car park and abandoned homes once stood. “You dig up the concrete, water gets into the ground, vegetation grows up, and the people come back,” he adds, speaking through a translator. “That’s natural regeneration.”If you dig up the concrete, water gets into the ground, vegetation grows – and people come backIn recent decades, Medellín has been widely celebrated for its astonishing urbantransformation. In the 2000s, it went from being one of the most dangerous cities on the planet, riven by murderous drug cartels, to a case study in the miraculous peace-bringing powers of architecture and landscape. Sergio Fajardo, the son of an architect who served as Medellín’s charismatic mayor from 2004 to 2008, was hailed for sprinkling the city’s poorest neighbourhoods with dazzling new libraries, stadiums and swimming pools.These determinedly “iconic” projects were enthusiastically feted on the pages of glossy design magazines, and their stories recounted in keynotes at international conferences. Impoverished hillsides were connected to a new metro system with an elegant web of cable cars and outdoor escalators, while parks dotted with expressive architect-designed canopies sprang up across the city. The dramatic fall in crime during Fajardo’s term was largely credited to this vision of “social urbanism”, and the increase in the amount of public space per citizen.View image in fullscreenNatural colonisers … kids and plants now have free rein.Photograph: Isaac RamirezBut the Medellín miracle has since lost some of its sparkle. Take theBiblioteca España, one of the flagship projects, designed by Colombian star architect Giancarlo Mazzanti. It stands as a striking cluster of chiselled concrete boulders, rising from the hillside in the formerly no-go barrio of Santo Domingo. But it has been shuttered since 2015,due tostructural defects. Or look at the outdoor escalators, which snake their way up the slopes of Comuna 13, one of the most notorious gangland neighbourhoods. Built to improve access for residents of the steep hillside, they have now become an overrun tourist attraction for Pablo Escobar-themed slum tours (which are often run in cahoots with the gangs). With more than 25,000 visitors riding the moving stairs here each week, localsbarely have spaceto use them.Temperatures have reduced by 3C. Birds and frogs that hadn’t been seen in the city for decades have returnedMazo’s work takes a markedly different approach from the 00s penchant for spectacle. When he was asked to look at the sloping half-hectare site in Aranjuez, which was home to a rundown car park and six boarded-up houses, abandoned for more than a decade, there was an existing plan to raze everything and replace it with a park traversed by a big zigzagging ramp. It looked like a hangover from the earlier lust for shape-making, something that might photograph well from a helicopter.Instead, Mazo and his team decided to keep most of what was already there. Almost 70% of the material on-site remains, albeit in a new form. Walls and floor slabs were chiselled from the two-storey parking structure, and the rubble used to fill the basements of the houses, with soil packed on top. The buildings’ roof timbers were reclaimed and used to make benches, while the landscape was shaped in such a way that rainwater is retained, meaning that no artificial irrigation is needed. The team even collected seeds from the plants that had sprung up on the plot, so they could be scattered around the new park after the project’s construction – allowing the natural colonisers back in.View image in fullscreenReclaimed … old bricks and roof tiles serve as retaining walls.Photograph: Connatural ArchiveThe project was built during the pandemic for a cost of just $1.5m (£1.1m), and the lockdowns allowed time for the plants to establish, without the threat of being trampled by visitors. Five years on, the planting has reached a level of maturity that makes this urban oasis seem like it’s always been there – a rare fruition of the Covid-era prophecies of nature reclaiming the city.The result is a beguiling place, where the sloping topography is mediated not by a great switchback ramp, but by a series of stepped terraces and slopes that form little outdoor rooms. The former car park’s concrete frame makes for an imposing armature at the centre of the park, supporting a raised steel walkway and framing a series of semi-enclosed spaces beneath it. Reclaimed bricks and stacked roof tiles serve as retaining walls, creating a rugged backdrop to lush clumps of grasses and palms. Gabion cages filled with rocks and rubble line water retention ponds, and provide platforms for seating. A sandy clearing down below makes space for ballgames and events, while park-goers can watch the action from the terraced decks above, and enjoy a grandstand view across the sprawling city and its seven hills.“When people first colonised this valley,” says Mazo, “they used to climb up to the top of the hills to communicate with each other. The park now becomes part of that system, giving people an elevated view to connect with others.”View image in fullscreenUrban oasis … an aerial view.Photograph: Connatural ArchiveCrucially, there’s a space for everyone here – from elevated walkways, to quiet shrub-lined reading areas, to seating tucked away from prying eyes. The sense of fragmentation, as well as the level changes, allow different social groups to coexist. On a Tuesday afternoon, most of these different compartments have their own distinct visitors. A student sits cross-legged on a bench by a giant monstera plant, drawing, while a couple canoodle on the deck above him. A solo pensioner takes in the view from the top, enjoying the shade of a kapok tree. Dog-walkers come and go, while a pair of middle-aged guys get stoned in one corner, not very well hidden behind fluffy fronds of purple grass.Parque Prado was one of thepilot projectsof the city’s Plan de Renaturalización, an initiative launched in 2016 to introduce 120 neighbourhood parks (20 of which Mazo was commissioned to design) and 30 green corridors, ripping up asphalt and concrete to improve groundwater infiltration, and planting urban orchards to mitigate the effects of climate crisis. In some areas, temperatures have reduced by as much as 3C, while several species of birds, lizards and frogs have returned, which hadn’t been seen in the city for decades. There have been harder-to-measure social impacts, too.“Some local residents were initially worried about the park,” says Mazo. “The area had become known for drug addicts and prostitution, and they thought it would only make things worse.” The opposite has happened. By creating space for different walks of life to mingle, “people are mixing here without any problems”, he says. “Some people assume that a completely flat, open surface with no vegetation means you can have more surveillance,” he adds. “But if you have different shapes, levels and conditions, people can identify with the space, feel more comfortable and take care.”Local residents have taken such ownership over the park that they voluntarily clean it up and have started doing some guerrilla gardening – planting seeds for the space to take on a life of its own.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureColombiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

To me, this seems a fair exchange, in the great cosmic talent pool: you can either be superhumanly athletic, or you can be charismatic. To be both is borderline greedy. This balancing act does mean that great documentaries about sporting stars are few and far between.Earps has always been a bit different. When she won the BBC’sSports Personality of the Year award in 2023, the personality part shone as much as the sport. With England, she had won the Euros in 2022, and got to a World Cup final just a year later, taking small consolation from walking away with the Golden Glove if not the ultimate prize. She had also fought for an England women’s goalkeeper’s replica shirt to go on sale, after realising there was no plan to release one. Here, it sounds as if she spoke out, despite knowing it could be a risky move.This documentary hones in on the two history-making tournaments, but it does have time to whiz through what got her there in the first place. She reminisces about playing against Hucknall Town for West Bridgford Colts as a youngster and how saving a penalty became her lightbulb moment. (It’s another side of Hucknall, which is having a big 2025 on TV, as the setting for the outstanding dramaWhat It Feels Like For a Girl.) She bounced around various clubs from 2011 until she signed for Manchester United in 2019. This serves as a solid overview of women’s football over the past two decades. Like many women, she wasn’t sure that football could be a sustainable career, and she describes having to “gamble” on whether it was worth taking that chance on herself.It’s safe to say that her career gamble paid off. Earps comes across as a considered decision-maker, even when taking on Nike over the replica shirt. She describes her personal low, of finally getting her chance to start for England under Phil Neville, only to receive “brutal feedback” following a loss to Germany. She was not called up again, and remembers it being a “very lonely” time. Loneliness is a theme. From her current training ground at Paris Saint-Germain, she talks about how the keeper’s lot can be a solitary one. They train separately, are analysed separately; other goalkeepers, as she has recently learned, are competition.In fact, by 2021, Earps had, notoriously, almost given up on international football. It took a new England manager, Sarina Wiegman, to spot her talent and put her trust in her for the now infamous Euros of 2022. It is strange to look back and think that it was ever a risk, but Earps says she thinks people questioned both her experience and Wiegman’s decision-making. We all know how she responded to the pressure, though there are some nice anecdotes here, such as a revelation about what the England captain, Leah Williamson, shouted in her ear after they beat Spain in the quarter finals.During the World Cup, Earps’ parents briefly went viral when they were interviewed by a reporter who had no idea who they were and wanted to know how they got their hands on a goalkeeper’s shirt. Sadly, they don’t reference that lovely moment here, but her mother and her brother pop over to Paris to see her, and, in the case of her brother, to tease her, in a way that only siblings can.Elsewhere, there are the standard supportive tales from her teammates. The eternally good value Ella Toone turns up and jokes that she’s “talking about Mazza again”, before discussing their sisterly relationship. Alessia Russo talks about Earp’s “tunnel vision” on game day. Lucy Bronze and Jill Scott recall Earps’ early days in the squad, and Wiegman talks about the potential she saw in her.Watching replays of those thrilling moments from 2022, and from the 2023 World Cup – the goals scored, but of course, the crucial saves, too – should be more than enough to rev England fans up for the start of another Euros campaign, though this documentary is also bittersweet, given that Earps won’t be there to play her part in it.Mary Queen of Stops aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionMary EarpsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Michael Rababy’s best photograph‘I use a hit and run approach when photographing inside casinos. On one occasion, the sound of my camera woke a guy up and he wanted a fight’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 2 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 2 Jul 2025 12.17 EDTShareAs a kid, I would see a new casino every time I visited Vegas with my family. They were huge, multimillion dollar investments and even then, I knew that money had come from people losing it in machines. That’s probably why I don’t gamble. My dad only actually took us into a casino a couple of times, but I remember him believing he would win and my mother being more rational about it.Thinking about it now, it’s absurd to take your kids to Vegas. My friend Rich remembers his parents checking him and his brother in at theCircus Circus hoteland casino – I think there was maybe a trampoline for children to jump on while the parents gambled. Afterwards, they’d hand in their ticket and pick the kids up again, like you do with your coat at the theatre.In my 20s, I’d go to Vegas with friends and, while they were gambling, I’d be documenting, running around and taking photos wherever I could. I began to realise that the gap between the absurd commercials we have in the US for casinos that promise the world, and the reality that I was seeing, was huge, almost to a comical degree. The photographs I’d been accumulating started to form a cohesive body of work, showing the contrast between the glamour in the marketing, and the actuality – which is more like going to the airport than a big night out in Monte Carlo.It epitomises Vegas – not just because of Elvis, but also because of the lights and the colourI took trips to places well known for their casinos, such as Reno, Nevada and Atlantic City, and whenever I was somewhere in the US that had one, I would seek it out. I tend to use a hit and run approach when photographing inside them. If I see security looking at me, or if other people are becoming aware of me, I’ll just move on – there’s always an embarrassment of riches to photograph, you could just go to the next table, or even the next casino. I also don’t want to be perceived as someone who might be helping someone cheat, so I try to avoid any card games.I feel like I’m setting the stage for a story, and then you let your mind fill in the blanks. This photograph of an Elvis impersonator is an example of that – one image that says 1,000 words. It’s pretty much the iconic image of myCasinoland book. Elvis was the king but there was a darker side to him too, which reflects the difference between the marketing of casinos and their reality.The photograph was taken in 2012 and it epitomises Vegas – not just because of Elvis, but also the lights and the colour. For some reason I feel more emotion when there’s more saturation in an image. There’s so much distraction going on here, but it all frames the king in the centre. He’s kind of slumped back at the slot machine: you see him from the back but you know exactly who he is.Often players go into a particular mental state at the slot machines, where they seem to be aware of nothing else. They get locked into a zone where it’s just them and the machine. I could often get pretty close, and was able to capture what was happening without them seeing me. You have to be careful though – people have come at me a couple of times. On one occasion, when I was still shooting on film, the sound of my Olympus woke a guy I’d just photographed slumped across a machine, and he really wanted to fight me. There was no reasoning with him. I managed to dodge into a club and amazingly the velvet rope kept him at bay – he wouldn’t cross it.Nowadays I carry a small Fuji, but phone cameras have got good enough for me to use for stealth work. If I pick up my Nikon with its longer lens, it’s like I’m about to point a gun at someone. In the age of social media, people are much more suspicious of a photographer’s motives than they used to be, but I am a positive person and want the best for everybody. Someone described my work as documenting the fall of an empire in the deserts of Nevada, but I’m doing it with a sense of humour and a light touch.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: ©Ellen FriedlanderMichael Rababy’s CVBorn:Ohio, 1969Trained:“Studied art history at the University of San Diego, spent many hours at the Museum of Photographic Arts bookstore in Balboa Park, and regularly snuck into film classes.

We’ve gone decades – centuries, really – in this country with barely any exhibitions dedicated to the work of Indigenous artists, but recently, everything’s changed. Galleries, museums and institutions across the UK are hosting shows by artists from communities in South America, Australia, the US and Europe at an unprecedented rate.Tate Modern in London is putting on its first-ever major solo show by a First Nation Australian artist in July, with a Sámi artist from Norway taking over the Turbine Hall in October. There are shows by Native American artists at Camden Art Centre in London and Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery, while painters and weavers from the Amazon and Argentina are coming to Manchester’s Whitworth and Bexhill-on-Sea’sDe La Warr Pavilion.View image in fullscreenSpeculative apparatus 2 for the work of nohkompan by Duane Linklater.Photograph: Courtesy Catriona Jeffries, Vancouver. Photo: Toni Hafkenscheid.This explosion in attention is at least partly thanks to the2024 Venice Biennale. The most recent edition of the art world’s ultimate taste-making event was a big, bold celebration of Indigenous art on a scale most western audiences had never encountered before. It was, quite appropriately and relatively humorously, called Foreigners Everywhere.The usual Jeff Koons-ian glitz, hazy figuration, hyper-academic conceptualism and postmodern abstraction of the contemporary art world was swapped for tapestries from South America, mythological drawings from northern Canada and swirling, mesmerising paintings from rural Australia.One Golden Lion, the Biennale’s top prize, was awarded to Kamilaroi/Bigambul Australian artistArchie Moore, who created a dizzyingly celestial family tree, detailing 65,000 years of ancestry in chalk on black walls – a near endless journey through familial time and space.The other Golden Lion went toMataaho Collective, a group of Māori women from New Zealand, for an installation of crisscrossing strands of fabric straps that cast interlocking shadows as you entered the main exhibition. Arguably the greatest accolades in art, both awarded to Indigenous artists.Which isn’t to say that all of this attention and praise is a totally new phenomenon. “Australian First Nations’ art has been receiving international attention for decades and is no longer considered just a niche market or as specialised art,” says Kelli Cole, a Warumungu and Luritja curator who’s organisingTate Modern’s big summer celebrationof the art of the late Emily Kam Kngwarray.Aboriginal art and its distinctive dot painting-style first started making waves in the wider art world in the 1970s, and has steadily grown in popularity – and acceptance – ever since. Kngwarray’s huge, seemingly abstract paintings and textiles (also currently on display in a smaller exhibitionat Pace Galleryin London) have all the hallmarks of what audiences associate with Aboriginal art: dots and lines in bright whites, earthy ochres and sun-drenched yellows, intersecting and weaving together to create dreamy, hallucinatory visions of wide open terrain and ancestral lands, or what Aboriginal people call “Country”.View image in fullscreenGorgeous, chaotic … Sin título (Untitled) by Santiago Yahuarcani.Photograph: Crisis Gallery/© Santiago YahuarcaniFor a lot of viewers, part of the appeal of Aboriginal art is the superficial similarities to western abstraction, but the work has deeper meaning. “The dot painting style is a sophisticated visual language derived from Country. It’s a practice informed by generations of deep knowledge, designed to communicate vital information,” says Cole. “For First Nations people, Country is not just land; it’s a living entity, encompassing spiritual, social and geographical origins, inextricably linked to identity and responsibility. Artists like Kngwarray visually articulate this profound connection, inviting global audiences to understand art not as detached objects, but as expressions of custodianship, belonging and a continuous reciprocal relationship with ancestral lands.”Younger Indigenous Australian artists, however, have moved away from the more traditional approach of painters such as Kngwarray. “I have a lot of respect for the old people – their strong culture, their knowledge and their art – but a young fella like me doesn’t want to make traditional paintings,” says Vincent Namatjira, a Western Aranda artist whose satirical, political approach to portraiture has seen him receive both praise (he was the first Indigenous winner of the Archibald prize for Australian portraiture) and a hefty amount of controversy.Namatjira, whoseshow at Ames Yavuz in Londonopens in September, comes from a long line of artists – his great-grandfather was the hugely influential watercolourist Albert Namatjira – and uses his joyful, colourful portraits to lampoon the wealthy and powerful, taking aim at British royalty, Captain Cook and Australian billionaires (one of whom, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, tried to have his “unflattering” portrait of her removed from an exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia last year and “permanently disposed of”).Namatjira also uses his work to celebrate important figures in his community. “For me, portraying these Indigenous heroes is about equal recognition. I want to make sure that Indigenous leaders are properly recognised and acknowledged. My three daughters are all growing up now and I want them, and other Aboriginal kids, to be able to see these strong examples of Indigenous leadership, to feel proud and empowered.”View image in fullscreen‘Unflattering’ …. a portrait of Gina Rinehart donated to NGA and a portrait of Gina Rinehart by Australian artist Vincent NamatjiraComposite: National Gallery of Australia / EPAHis political approach is one that resonates with a lot of Indigenous North American artists. Jaune Quick-to-See-Smith – a citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana who died earlier this year – currently has a showat Stephen Friedman Galleryin London, and an exhibition due to open at Fruitmarket in Edinburghin November. Her work combined pop appropriation, mixed-media modernism and Indigenous culture “to remind viewers that Native Americans are still alive”.Duane Linklater, an Omaskêko Ininiwak artist from Ontario, Canada, with a show openingat Camden Art Centrethis month, makes minimal installations intended to “create space for Indigenous presence in every moment”. Art, for many Indigenous people, is a tool of resistance, and a way of affirming their existence.Claudia Alarcón is an Indigenous artist from the La Puntana community of Wichí people in northern Argentina, where she leads a collective called Silät, bringing together 100 female weavers to create colourful tapestries filled with references to animals and nature. There are footprints, eyes, trees, all arranged into stunning, abstract geometric compositions. Their work is on showat Cecilia Brunson Projectsin London and theDe La Warr Pavilionin Bexhill.View image in fullscreenClaudia Alarcón and Silät Tayhin at De La Warr Pavilion.Photograph: Claudia Alarcón & Silät: Tayhin, 2025, Installation View, De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-On-Sea. Photography: Rob Harris“We chose the name Silät because it is a word in our language which can be translated as ‘message’ or ‘announcement’,” she says. “For us, it is a message of presence. It is a manifestation, like a whisper, of the strength of our knowledge. Our weavings are a proclamation that we continue to defend our memory, our territory, united. Indigenous existence is constantly under threat. We are walking a new path, telling new stories, but all of this is part of the long-standing defence of our culture, which is always present. Always.”Defence is important, because Indigenous lands are under critical threat from exploitative commercial parties, and also more widely from climate change. Santiago Yahuarcani – a leader of the Aimeni clan of the Uitoto in Peru whose exhibitionat the Whitworth Art Galleryin Manchester opens this month – addresses that threat head-on in his work, with gorgeous, chaotic canvases that paint nature in a constant, violent battle with man, lamenting the brutal destruction of the Amazon, and calling desperately for change.‘They came for our land, our wood, our gold’: Santiago Yahuarcani, Peruvian painter of dancing dolphins – and genocideRead moreIt’s an approach shared by Norwegian Sámi artist Máret Ánne Sara, whose previous work has seen her place a pile of bloodstained, bullet-pierced reindeer skulls outside the Norwegian parliament. She will be taking on theTurbine Hallcommission at Tate Modern in October. “I fear the path we’re currently walking globally, as a human species, is failing,” she says. “The understanding that nature sustains life is fading from human consciousness. I’m trying to puncture the reality that we’ve been sold. I believe that Indigenous philosophy can offer collective strategies to protect life for the future; to rethink and re-understand our place within a larger system.”Lumping such an incredibly diverse array of artists into one big, sweeping “Indigenous art” bracket is obviously problematic. But there are themes that connect these communities, and to an extent their art, around the world. “I see myself as part of something larger. I know there are other groups, with other languages, who are my brothers and sisters, with whom we share a history of struggle, and also of pain,” says Alarcón. “What matters most is to keep fighting for our rights and our memories, which are also the rights of our territory.”Whether in Norway, Peru, Canada or Australia, Indigenous artists are united not just by a shared connection to the land and its custodianship, but by having survived centuries of colonial subjugation, capitalist exploitation and ongoing climate annihilation. Proof of their endurance will be written across the walls of galleries across the UK this year, in powerful, political and often incredibly beautiful art.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous artArtIndigenous AustraliansTurbine HallTate ModernDe La Warr PavilionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not an exact science, it’s a guesstimate. Thing is, I play so many shows, and so many of them are just like impromptu that we really don’t know. So I think it’d be a bit much to really get the bells and whistles out. We think it’s the Block9 show in the afternoon tomorrow – we think! But no candles, sadly.“I’m very, very proud of my relationship with Glastonbury and my history with it and I’m lucky, because as a DJ, you can play multiple sets. Obviously, there’s probably people who’ve been to more Glastonburys, but they’ve only played one show per festival – that’s not going to get you into big high figures.”When I take my shoes off I stop being reasonable Norman and I become irresponsible FatboyView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFire it up! Fatboy Slim at Lonely Hearts Club“My first Glasto show was on the Pyramid stage in 1986 with the Housemartins, and we didn’t know anything really about Glastonbury or festivals. We’d never played in daylight before – we only ever played in clubs – and also we thought that Glastonbury was full of bearded hippies who would probably throw mud and bottles of piss out at us. So we went on quite nervous and quite agitated, but that was quite good in the Housemartins, channelling that aggression – we had the nice tunes, but there was a lot of aggression. We made an awful lot of friends, and it changed our view about Glastonbury. The only weird thing was me and Paul [Heaton] have both had fairly successful careers, but neither of us had managed to get back on the Pyramid stage for 38 years. Last year, Paul played the Pyramid stage and he phoned me up and said, ‘Will you come on anddo a song with us, just to celebrate?’”View image in fullscreenFatboy Slim prepares before performing at Lonely Hearts Club stageView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDropping bangers at Lonely Hearts Club, with Stella McCartney backstage“My favourite Glastonbury moment was playing for [Rob da Bank’s label] Sunday Best. I was four days in at that point, my mind had been expanded, altered and distorted, as was everybody’s around me. So I decided if I played a record backwards, would people dance backwards? And it was a good theory. Obviously with CDJs, you can press reverse, but with the record, you have to physically rewind it. So I played Block Rockin’ Beats, by the Chemical Brothers, pretty much at the right speed but backwards. And it worked. Everybody got the joke. It was just after Twin Peaks too, so everybody was like, dancing backwards to the music. What I forgot was that Ed from the Chemical Brothers was in the DJ booth with me, and he went, ‘What are you doing?’ I’m like, ‘I want to see if they can dance backwards.’ He’s like, ‘Oh, great!’ That’s probably the most out there I’ve ever been.”View image in fullscreenFatboy Slim performs at Lonely Hearts Club stage at Silver HayesView image in fullscreen“I loved the Rabbit Hole. It was never the same [after it closed]. Absolutely anything could happen, and sometimes it did. I much prefer the smaller stages to the big ones, but having said that, when we did the Park the other year, that felt pretty much like the perfect gig. We brought Rita Ora on – I don’t normally do showbiz-y things like that.

My daughter’s here, my ex wife [Zoe Ball] is here. We’re all hanging out. It’s beautiful. Woody came to Glastonbury when he was about eight, and it didn’t go well for him or for me and Zoe. But when he started coming under his own steam, it’s weird, because we didn’t teach him anything, he just assimilated himself into the fabric of it and made all these friends the first year he went. He was built for Glastonbury: he’s just got that energy, he wants to talk to everybody, he wants to change the world. Everybody keeps telling me how cool my son is or how mental my son is, sometimes both.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe crowd at Genosys, Block9“As a festival, Glastonbury never sold out to the man. The Eavis family have kept it independent, which means they’re in charge of the way it feels and the way it looks, and people respect that. There’s nothing corporate that interferes and dictates, you know, and it’s not about making money. The music business, especially when money comes in, it distorts your creative ideas and the feel of it and it becomes a money-making machine. But the Eavis family never sold out.

While on tour in the US with his newly formed band Beady Eye, Liam speculates that it was due to Noel not being invited to Liam’s previous weddings. “He goes on about how he wasn’t invited to my wedding. No one was at my wedding but [the bride’s] mum and my mum. Get over it, mate.”View image in fullscreenThings escalate … Noel and Sara MacDonald, pictured here in 2018.Photograph: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock11 JulyThings escalate after Noel speaks in an interview about Oasis having to cancel their performance at V festival in 2009 after Liam had supposedly contracted laryngitis – Noel alleges this was actually due to Liam being hungover. Liam sues Noel and demands an apology, stating: “The truth is I had laryngitis, which Noel was made fully aware of that morning, diagnosed by a doctor.” Noel apologises and the lawsuit is dropped.20 AugustIn an interview with Q magazine Liam takes aim at Noel’s new music and his new look. “Listen, our kid’s a mouthy fuck too. He said we had a year to come up with a band name and came up with Beady Eye. He had three and came up with the High Flying Turds. I don’t know who dressed him but he looks like something out of Westlife.”1 DecemberWhen asked about reuniting with his brother for a 20th anniversary celebration of (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, Liam says: “I’d rather eat my own shit than be in a band with him again. He’s a miserable little fuck … If the fans want it, though, I’d do it.”201227 JuneDespite the strong words in December, Noel says he had been in contact with Liam that Christmas, but he also denies any chance of a reunion. “I haven’t been in touch. I last texted him at Christmas after the City match. I don’t think it’s gonna happen. It would be great for everyone else except me … I don’t think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness; I mean, Liam does publicly, but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn’t take anything he says seriously.”20135 JuneLiam explains his complex feelings about his brother. “I love our kid – as in the Noel that’s not in a band and not in the music business and not all that bullshit that people see he is. But the band Noel? … I absolutely fucking despise.”6 JuneView image in fullscreen‘I love our kid’ … Liam Gallagher performs with Beady Eye at Glastonbury festival, 2013.Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPAFans are given fresh hope asLiam tells the Guardian: “We could bury the hatchet for a quick lap of honour … I’d do it for nowt, but if someone’s going to drop a load of fucking money, I’d do it for that too … [Then] I’d still go back to Beady Eye and Noel would go back to his thing.”19 SeptemberOf a reunion, Noel tells NME: “One can never say never, because one might be skint. But I’ve got no intention. I’m not interested.”201425 OctoberLiam’s band Beady Eye break up. Noel is sympathetic though perhaps with a veiled criticism of Liam, saying in December: “I’m very fucking sad about Beady Eye, because I know they really wanted to make it work. I wanted it to work for them. I was out with Gem Archer the other night. The vibe I’m getting is that it was a shock, although not completely surprising.”201514 MarchLiam develops his Twitter account as the chief forum to deliver blows to his brother. He posts a picture of him wearing a High Flying Birds backstage pass captioned: “Keeping it in the family”. For a brief moment it seems the feud is cooling.6 MayBut Noel accuses Liam of stirring up false rumours of an Oasis reunion: “It wasn’t his pass. He wasn’t there. It was my other brother’s pass. If he’d had been at one of my gigs, you would’ve known about it because he’d have made his way on stage and started acting like a fucking gobshite. He’s being a bit disingenuous to Oasis fans in the sense that he always gets their hopes up.”Liam tweets in response: “I see Noel Katie Hopkins Gallagher is talking out of his slack arse again go and polish your SAXAPHONE Ha ha,” ending the tweet with his new trademark, “LGx”.201624 MayView image in fullscreenA familiar insult … Noel Gallagher performs with High Flying Birds in Munich, 2016.Photograph: Sven Hoppe/EPALiam airs grievances about Noel refusing to participate in an Oasis reunion, ending: “FUCK OASIS”. This is also when he begins posting photos of his brother with the caption of “potato” in each one, claiming “he looks like one.” It soon becomes a familiar insult.2 OctoberThe documentary about the band, Supersonic, is released and Liam attends the premiere, though not without taking a swing at Noel’s absence. When asked about the likelihood of Noel turning up too, he says, “Oh no, Noel won’t be here. He’s in one of his really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really big houses. Probably eating tofu while having a face peel. Isn’t that right, man of the people?”201731 MayLiam releases his first single as a solo artist, and further dismisses the idea of reforming Oasis. “[Working with Noel] bores the death out of me,” he says, adding that the pair had not had any contact in years.4 JuneAfter the bombing of Manchester Arena at an Ariana Grande concert, the One Love Manchester concert is held to honour the victims. Liam performs three songs, including Oasis’s Live Forever with Coldplay. He attacks Noel on Twitter for not appearing: “Noels out of the fucking country weren’t we all love get on a fucking plane and play your tunes for the kids you sad fuck.”In a Sunday Times interview a few days later, Noel says he wasn’t asked to perform, and adds: “Young Mancunians, young music fans, were slaughtered, and he, twice, takes it somewhere to be about him. He needs to see somebody.” More “potato” jibes are thrown in response, with Liam alleging: “I got proof you were asked and declined.”201819 JulyNoel plays a no-alcohol show at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland. Liam responds: “I forgive you now let’s get the BIG O back together and stop fucking about the drinks are on me LG x”. When Noel doesn’t respond, Liam tweets: “I’ll take that as a NO then.”20192 JulyView image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher performing at One Love Manchester.Photograph: Dave Hogan for One Love Manchester/PAAfter One Love Manchester, few thought the feud could get any worse. But when Noel’s wife Sara MacDonald is asked if she would watch Liam’s performance at Glastonbury she declines and calls Liam a “fat twat doing his tribute act”. Noel then posts a screenshot of a message Liam sent to Noel’s daughter Anaïs reading “tell your step mam to be very careful”.“So you’re sending threatening messages via my teenage daughter now are you?”, Noel wrote. “You always were good at intimidating women though eh?” Liam apologises: “My sincere apologies to my beautiful mum Peggy and my lovely niece Anais for getting caught up in all of this childish behaviour I love you both dearly”.5 AugustNoel speaks to the Guardian in an interview headlined with the quote: “I liked my mum until she gave birth to Liam.”Noel adds: “That’s not the first time he’s sent texts to my daughter, or left threatening phone calls on my wife’s answering machine. So when he’s threatening my wife via my teenage daughter, I’m thinking, you know, if you weren’t a rock star, if you were just an uncle who worked in a garage, you’d be getting a visit from the police. But because you’re a rockstar, wahey, you get away with that shit.”Noel says the incident means they are unlikely to ever reconcile. “Because I’ve got one fatal flaw in my otherwise perfect makeup as a human being, which is I don’t forgive people. Once you start texting my children – and his two sons have been going for her, too – and legitimise my wife being bullied on the internet, where she has to shut down Instagram accounts because of the vile shit being written about her and my daughter, then it ain’t happening.”He also uses the interview for a dig at Liam’s new solo music. “I think it’s unsophisticated music. For unsophisticated people. Made by an unsophisticated man. Who’s giving unsophisticated orders to a load of songwriters who think they’re doing the Oasis thing … I reckon if I put my two sons in a room – one’s nine, one’s 11 – for about 45 minutes, they could probably muster up something better than that new single of his.”202030 AprilNoel releases a demo of Oasis’s Don’t Stop … without Liam’s vocals or guitarist Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs’ riffs. As expected, Liam takes to Twitter: “Oi tofu boy if your gonna release old demos make sure im singing on it and boneheads playing guitar on it if not it’s not worth a wank”.202122 MaySpeaking on The Jonathan Ross Show, Noel responds to a claim that he’d turned down £100m to get Oasis back together. He says, “There isn’t £100m in the music business, right, between all of us … If anybody wants to offer me £100m now, I’ll say it now, I’ll do it. I’ll do it for £100m.” Liam responds online with: “I’d do it for FREE”.20 OctoberNoel shares what he believes was “the beginning of the end” for the brothers’ relationship while on The Matt Morgan Podcast. He tells the story of how he donated clothes from Liam’s brand Pretty Green to a charity shop before the brand launched in 2009: “Liam gave us a load of clobber, not just me, he gave the band it. I went straight to the charity shop and left it in the shop doorway. He went fucking mental. He said, ‘If you didn’t fucking want it, you should have just said you didn’t fucking want it, you cunt.’ It was on the shop mannequin in Barnardo’s a month before it launched. If push comes to shove, that was the beginning of the end.”202219 OctoberWhen asked by a fan on Twitter if there would be any Oasis hit songs featured in his new documentary, Knebworth 22, Liam is quick to blame Noel for the lack of the band’s songs: “No Oasis songs as the angry squirt has blocked them he also blocked the Oasis I sang for Taylor Hawkins tribute he’s a horrible little man.”202311 JuneOn the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast Noel addresses claims Liam is calling for an Oasis reunion and bizarrely ends up comparing him to Puss in Boots from Shrek. “Well, I know for a fact he doesn’t want it either, but he likes to paint this picture of, you know, this little fucking guy who’s sitting with his suitcase packed by the door, you know, like the little fucking cat from fucking Shrek, you know, the little fucking Spanish cat with these big fucking teary eyes. ‘I’m [gonna] go and do it now for you fans. I love you.’ It’s like, well, fucking call me then. And he hasn’t called me. And until he does, it’s fucking going nowhere.”202412 JanuaryView image in fullscreenAll’s well that ends well? Noel and Liam performing in Milan, 2008.Photograph: Fabio Diena/AlamyJust months before the reunion is announced, Liam is still venting about Noel. Hetells the Guardianif he could go back in time to the Paris gig that ended Oasis, he’d “fill in” Noel and Oasis’s manager. “They threw me under the fucking bus. All my life caved in,” Liam says in a long rant, pacing around the room. “There were 40 or 50 people working for Oasis. All of a sudden, everyone was out of a job. Meanwhile, he’s off with his guitar and his wife, having a lovely time … I know I’ve been humbled. And thank fuck for it because it’s made me a better person. But he’s not. He’s still going round thinking he’s the man, but we’ll see.”25 AugustBut wait! Liam tweets: “I never did like that word FORMER.”27 AugustOasis write on Twitter (which by now has become X):“The guns have fallen silent.The stars have aligned.The great wait is over.Come see.It will not be televised.”Explore more on these topicsOasisLiam GallagherNoel GallaghertimelinesShareReuse this content"

Thank you, gentlemen.”Freese said in May that he was “not angry – just a bit shocked and disappointed” when he was told that Foo Fighters wanted “to go in a different direction with their drummer”. Foo Fighters did not comment on Freese’s departure.Freese was the replacement for Taylor Hawkins, who died in 2022 aged 50. Grohl paid tribute to Hawkins in his letter, saying: “Your name is spoken every day, sometimes with tears, sometimes with a smile, but you are still in everything we do, everywhere we go, forever.”A new drummer has not been announced; a statement alongside Today’s Song says: “Foo Fighters areDave Grohl, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett and Rami Jaffee.”Grohl is married to Jordyn Blum, the mother of three of his daughters. In September 2024 he said in a statement: “I’ve recently become the father of a new baby daughter, born outside of my marriage. I plan to be a loving and supportive parent to her. I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness.”In his announcement of Today’s Song, Grohl perhaps made an oblique reference to these widely publicised struggles, using the metaphor of a lobster shedding its shell. “The point being that life’s challenges have a way of signalling the need for change and growth, so when that time comes, you retreat, rebuild, and resurface stronger than before.”The admission of infidelity somewhat tarnished the image of a man who was often described as “the nicest man in rock”. Foo Fighters cancelled a headline festival performance and retreated from the public eye for a time, though Grohl reunited with Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic in January for a benefit concert after the LA wildfires.Foo Fighters will return to live music in October, playing four concerts across east Asia and another in Mexico City in November. Their most recent album is 2023’sBut Here We Are.Earlier this week they released I Don’t Wanna Hear It, a cover of a song by punk band Minor Threat, with instrumentals recorded in 1995 but vocals recorded earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsFoo FightersDave GrohlPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The act is the subject of a police investigation for leading crowds in chants of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to theIsraelDefense Forces.A statement posted on the festival’s Instagram account said: “Bob Vylan will not be appearing at Radar festival this weekend.”The headliner slot for Saturday now reads “TBA” (to be announced) on the website of the festival, which takes place at Victoria Warehouse from Friday to Sunday.In response, the group shared the festival’s statement on Instagram with the caption: “Silence is not an option. We will be fine, the people of Palestine are hurting.Manchesterwe will be back.”The chant that sparked the furore was made by the band’s frontman, Pascal Robinson-Foster, who goes by the alias Bobby Vylan, on stage at Glastonbury and streamed live on theBBC.The broadcaster later said the chant was “antisemitic”. It was called “appalling hate speech” by the government and“vile Jew-hatred”by the UK’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis.Bob Vylan, who formed in Ipswich in 2017, also had their US visas revoked in the aftermath of the performance.In a statement on Instagram, Bob Vylan said: “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine … a machine that has destroyed much ofGaza.”They said they were “a distraction from the story”, adding: “We are being targeted for speaking up.”Israel began bombing Gaza on 7 October 2023 after Hamas – a proscribed terror group in the UK – killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and took 251 others hostage.Since then the IDF has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza – including hundreds of journalists and aid workers – with more than a third of the casualtiesthought to be children.Many thousands more have been injured. However, it is impossible to independently gather casualty figures as Israel does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza.Bob Vylan are still expected to perform at the Boardmasters surfing and music festival in Newquay, Cornwall, in August.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025IsraelIsrael-Gaza warBBCManchesterFestivalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The film covers its inception, testing and deployment in Japan in 1945, when the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to the deaths of as many as a quarter of a million people by the end of that year – as well as hastening the end of the conflict.View image in fullscreenCillian Murphy in Oppenheimer.Photograph: Universal Pictures/APThe film depicts Oppenheimer after the war as increasingly wracked by the legacy of his invention, and haunted by images of suffering. However, Cameron said he was among those viewers who felt the film did not go far enough in depicting the immediate aftermath of the attacks.“It’s not like Oppenheimer didn’t know the effects,” he said. “I don’t like to criticise another film-maker’s film, but there’s only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience, and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him.“But I felt that it dodged the subject. I don’t know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn’t want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail. I’m just stupid that way.”Oppenheimer was released in 2023 and won Oscars for best picture, director, leading actor (for Murphy), supporting actor (for Robert Downey Jr), and three others. It also made $975m (£720m) at the box office.At the time of its release, Nolan responded to criticism similar to that put forward by Cameron by explaining he wanted to represent Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. “It was always my intention to rigidly stick to that,” he toldVariety. “Oppenheimer heard about the bombing at the same time that the rest of the world did.View image in fullscreenChristopher Nolan, centre, and Cillian Murphy, right, during the making of Oppenheimer.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures“I wanted to show somebody who is starting to gain a clearer picture of the unintended consequences of his actions.

No problem. You come to my premiere and say nice things.”Cameron’s film, which has not yet begun formal production, will be an adaptation of Charles Pellegrino’s forthcoming nonfiction bookGhosts of Hiroshima, which brings together testimonies from victims and survivors of the attacks.Before then he will release the latest Avatar film, Fire and Ash. His first entry in that franchise is the highest-grossing film of all time, while the sequel is the third.

Zellweger appears in a behind-the-scenes role, with the world premiere of her directorial debut, an animated short film called They. And in what appears something of a coup, the festival will screen 4K restorations of Connery’s six “official” James Bond films: Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.Connery’s name is now firmly imprinted on the festival, with its main feature-film prize named after him and screenings of short films developed through theSean ConneryTalent Lab, an offshoot of the actor’s foundation and the National Film and Television School Scotland. Festival director and CEO Paul Ridd said: “The legacy of Scotland’s biggest global star is central to what we’re trying to do, connecting it with the future generation of film talent and all the philanthropic work the Connery Foundation do across film and various other causes is of vital importance to us. To have access to those six wonderful James Bond films and showing them on the big screen is very special.”The 2025 edition marks the third event sincethe dramatic collapse of the Centre of the Moving Image, the festival’s then parent organisation, in October 2022, which also resulted in the closure of Edinburgh’s celebrated Filmhouse cinema and its sister cinema in Aberdeen. Helped by the wider international festival that takes over the city every August, ashort-notice scratch eventwas put together for the summer of 2023, while Ridd was installed as the head of a new organisation for 2024, which returned the festival to something comparable to its former status. And in a piece of good news for both the festival and the city itself,the Filmhouse in Edinburgh reopened in Juneafter a high-profile campaign.Ridd says the festival is looking to consolidate its revival. “We are thinking about this as year one with last year being year zero. We were really pleased with what we brought together last year, so for 2025 we are looking at what worked previously and not deviating really away from that. What’s different, I guess, this year is that we’ve had a significantly higher volume of submissions sent to us, which is fantastic.”This year the festival’s competition (for the “Sean Connery prize for feature film-making excellence”) comprises 10 world premieres, including Campbell X’s “queer road movie” Low Rider, Swedish documentary Once You Shall Be One of Those Who Lived Long Ago about a physically collapsing mining town, and In Transit, a drama about an artist and her model starring Jennifer Ehle. An Out of Competition section includes high-profile films such as theDardenne brothers’ Young Mothers, a study of a centre for pregnant teenagers,Jan-Ole Gerster’s Islands, with Sam Riley as a washed-up tennis coach, and The Memory Blocks, a new film from experimental documentary-maker Andrew Kötting.The festival is also leaning intoa resurgence of interest in archive and back catalogue films; alongside a retrospective of westerns by famed genre director Budd Boetticher (including 1957 classic The Tall T), Edinburgh is staging a series of screenings of films nominated by their in-person guests, all of whom will introduce their picks as well as taking part in an In Conversation event. The Last King of Scotland director Kevin Macdonald, who will appear alongside his brother, Trainspotting producer Andrew Macdonald, has chosen Soviet war classic The Cranes Are Flying; Candyman’s Nia DaCosta will talk about Doug Liman’s 90s drug deal comedy thriller Go; and Ben Wheatley, whose new film Bulk is leading the festival’s Midnight Madness strand, has gone for Ealing comedy classic The Man in the White Suit.Equally as important as the programme was the decision to move the festival back to its August time slot, having been shifted to June in 2008 as a strategic decision by the UK Film Council, then in charge of industry policy, as a way of giving space between the Edinburgh and London film festivals (with the latter taking place in early October). This has reunited the film festival with the energy of the international and fringe festivals, as well as potentially adding some purchase in the autumn awards season. Ridd says: “I’m very conscious that August is a strategic position for a lot of film distributors to launch their films going into that awards period. So I think August is a pure positive for us.”He adds: “This is a beautiful city, and you’ve got all of this other art going on all around you. It’s a unique feeling and I know what a big opportunity that represents to us, to emulate that spirit of discovery.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The caves are like a kind of political rhetoric in themselves, a message convoluted and endless. Their vanished inhabitants obsess him. Since the Neanderthal extinction, “the wedge between human beings and nature” has become “far deeper than the wedge between factory owners and factory workers that created the conditions of twentieth century life”. The left, he believes, needs to properly understand this.Meanwhile, shadowy French authorities have decided that Lacombe and the “Moulinards” – the post-Debordian eco-commune he mentors by email – need to be steered out of their less than utopian rural domesticity and towards some act of serious terrorism, so they can be dealt with. So they hire Sadie Smith, a freelance American spy-cop, to infiltrate and provoke an outrage. The situation Sadie finds on the ground is confused and intersectional, centred on a real-life green issue: the diversion of local water supplies into vast “mega-basins” to support corporate agribusiness projects at the expense of the local farmers and the environment. Actors within and without the Moulinard commune, less in bad or good faith than in something shifting constantly between the two, all have their motives for protest or intervention.Sadie is a triumph of character – not quite fully self-deceived, not even entirely corrupted by the barely controlled confusions, emotional complications and near-disasters of the deep-cover agent’s life. She’s a satire, but she’s also being straight with us. She’s not quite a sensationist, although the world pours in on her senses, and through hers into ours. How, Rachel Kushner asks in this Booker-shortlisted novel, does the individual’s embrace of experience interface with the ideological? In what circumstances can ideology even permit an interface? Sadie Smith is perhaps both question and answer.M John Harrison£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePsychologyThe truth about teenagersComing of AgeLucy FoulkesComing of AgeLucy FoulkesThe truth about teenagersWhat does your reminiscence bump look like? If this sounds like a blow to the head with a touch of amnesia, it isn’t – but it might be just as painful. No, as Lucy Foulkes explains in her eye-opening guide to the psychology of adolescence, it’s the period of life during which people report the greatest number of important autobiographical memories. For most of us it starts around 10 and peaks at 20, taking in a plethora of firsts: first kiss, first love, first time drinking alcohol or taking drugs, first time away from home. Not to mention exams, bullying, breakups and bereavement. Thinking about it, maybe a concussion would be preferable. But then, as this book shows, it’s these enduringly vivid years that define the adults we become.Foulkes, a research fellow in psychology at the University of Oxford, conducted 23 in-depth interviews for Coming of Age and they are by turns funny, hair-raising and desperately sad. Occasionally, like Naomi’s account of her first love, Peter, they have a sort of novelistic potency. In any case, the majority of readers will find someone they can identify with among her diverse cast of teenagers. Most are now in their 30s or older and are looking back wistfully, with regret, or with something like equanimity. Their accounts allow Foulkes to bring out her central point: that we narrate our lives into being, and that adolescence is so important partly because it is where this narration begins in earnest. The stories we tell ourselves shape who we are, and we can get stuck in these stories, or change them to our advantage.Coming of Age ends movingly. Foulkes showed each of her subjects what she’d written to make sure they were happy with how they’d been portrayed. These were stories of joy, pain and loss that had reverberated through their lives. For many, seeing them presented as part of the broader story of adolescence prompted a re-evaluation. One said their “shoulders had finally dropped” after 20 years, another that they now felt ready to talk to others about what they had been through. Adolescence may be the first draft of personhood, but it doesn’t have to be the last, as this wise and revelatory book shows.David Shariatmadari£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseGeopoliticsMinute by minute accountNuclear WarAnnie JacobsenNuclear WarAnnie JacobsenMinute by minute accountThere is, as Jacobsen says, “no such thing as a small nuclear war”: it would mean the end of civilisation. In this powerful book, she describes in horrifying detail how it could happen today. The US has been preparing plans for a nuclear third world war since at least the 1950s, when the H-bomb was created. This was many times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, which killed at least 80,000 people instantly.By 1960, the US war plan for a pre-emptive strike on the Soviet Union predicted 275 million people would die in the first hour, followed by 325 million more from radioactive fallout. A Soviet counterstrike would have killed 100 million Americans and a similar number from fallout. Someone who was privy to these top-secret plans likened them to the Nazis’ preparations for genocide.Jacobsen’s deeply researched book consists of a minute-by-minute account of a frighteningly realistic scenario in which North Korea launches a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at the Pentagon in Washington. It is what the US and Russia feared most during the cold war. Each country devised meticulous protocols to ensure their massive arsenals could still be launched, even when their leaders had been killed. Jacobsen shows in chilling detail how these plans would be implemented, from the moment the launch of “the all-powerful, unstoppable, civilisation-threatening ICBM” is detected, to the president’s decision to hit North Korea with 82 nuclear warheads 20 minutes later. But as the US ICBMs have to overfly Russia to hit North Korea, the Russians mistakenly believe they are the target and launch their own missiles at America – a fatal miscalculation for the entire world.A mere 32 minutes after launch, the North Korean missile hits Washington: “Never in the history of mankind have so many human beings been killed so fast.” Forty minutes later the Russian missiles begin hitting America in a barrage of “nuclear hellfire” that would lead to the deaths of more than 5 billion people. It would also cause a “nuclear little ice age”, destroying agriculture around the world for a decade.Jacobsen rightly says that “the whole premise of using nuclear weapons is madness”. As gripping as any thriller, her book brilliantly portrays the horrific reality of nuclear war and the threat it continues to pose to the very survival of human life on our planet.PD Smith£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA well-mapped romanceYou Are HereDavid NichollsYou Are HereDavid NichollsA well-mapped romanceMichael, 42, a bearded geography teacher from York, is walking 200 miles across Britain in order not to think about his recent divorce. His concerned friend Cleo gathers a small party to accompany him for the first few days, including her old friend Marnie, 38, a copy editor, also divorced, living in Herne Hill.Backstories are gently woven: unremarkable childhoods, how their marriages fell apart, the arc of their careers. Then everyone else goes home, and we are left with Marnie, Michael, their growing sexual chemistry and Britain’s spectacular landscapes.Nicholls’s novels often confound narrative expectations – most notably with the shock ending of One Day – but there are few surprises here. Short, pacy chapters are energised by a trail mix of jolly headings: in one section, playlist songs that Marnie and Michael share – “Don’t Speak by No Doubt (1996)”, “No Limit by 2 Unlimited (1992)”. Droll signposting aside, we are following the Jane Austen map of romantic plotting: two wounded but complementary souls, initial indifference, misdirected affections, growing attraction, misunderstandings, obstacles, hope and resolution.There is satisfaction to be taken from this midlife redemption tale, not least because it fills a gap: Nicholls’s novels now cover love and marriage across every age bracket from teens to mid-50s. It may not be challenging – unlike Austen’s Persuasion, quoted in the epigraph, it offers neither visceral desperation nor pent-up agonies – but for many it will be a comforting antidote to the grimness of our grim world, a crowd-pleaser and, surely, a TV hit-to-be.Lucy Atkins£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseLettersLet me be your fantasyWantGillian AndersonWantGillian AndersonLet me be your fantasyPart of the pleasure of reading Want – a collection of 174 anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world – is that the scenarios are often strikingly odd. One contributor dreams of being fed chocolate by the Hogwarts potion master. Another longs to have sex with her office door knob. Women are still seen as less sexual than men, but this book attests to a vivid imaginative hinterland, where the desires are far more inventive than the “Milf” and “cheerleader” tropes that dominate man-made porn. In one particularly detailed submission, a woman daydreams about breastfeeding an attractive cashier at the supermarket.The fantasies in this book are sometimes shocking, but hard limits were imposed during the selection process to remove anything that, if acted out in real life, would be illegal. Want is edited by Gillian Anderson, who has restyled herself as a sort of sexual agony aunt after playing a charismatic therapist in Netflix’s Sex Education. In her introduction, Anderson explains how she struggled with the less straightforwardly empowering submissions. Some did make the final cut, but they are punctuated by anxious self-justification. One woman interrupts her fantasy about being held captive by a group of robbers to insist that she is “a feminist”, and that the imaginary robbers have her “consent”.Some of the stories in this book feel too self-censored to be truly erotic. Even so, Want makes for addictive reading. More compelling than the fantasies themselves are the frequent glimpses into the women’s real worlds. One contributor confesses that she fantasises about her partner’s death – she longs to be free, because she has never explored her true feelings for women. Another writes that she brings herself to orgasm by thinking about her husband cheating on her. He has been unfaithful in reality, so every time she does this, she cries. The real-life loneliness conveyed here is much rawer than the wish-fulfilment. At its best, Want gives you privileged access into the most painful, truthful corners of these women’s lives.Kitty Drake£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA transcendent late giftRosaritaAnita DesaiRosaritaAnita DesaiA transcendent late giftAnita Desai’s riddling and haunted new novel is set in motion when Bonita, a young Indian woman, meets a tricksy figure in a park in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. A student of Spanish, Bonita is leafing through local newspapers when she is approached. “The Stranger” – elderly, overfriendly and peculiarly dressed “in the flamboyant Mexican style that few Mexican women assume at any other than festive occasions” – claims to know Bonita’s dead mother, whom she calls “Rosarita”. She says they met and became friends when the latter came to pursue art under the tutelage of Mexican maestros. Bonita has no recollections of her mother painting or travelling to Mexico. She remembers, however, “a sketch in wishy-washy pale pastels that had hung on the wall above your bed at home, of a woman seated on a park bench – and yes, it could have been one here in San Miguel – with a child playing in the sand at her feet”. The woman “is not looking at the child and the child is not looking at her, as if they had no relation to each other, each absorbed in a separate world, and silent”.Written in the second person, the novel interrogates the gulf that can exist between a parent and her child, and the sketch – forgotten and recalled – is a sly mise en abyme that also speaks to the fickleness of memory, and the ever-porous boundaries between the past and the present.Desai has been writing for more than six decades now. Thrice shortlisted for the Booker prize, she is known for the effortless lyricism of her sentences, the deceptive simplicity of her stories, and her canny eye for detail. This is a novel of profound philosophical inquiry, pondering the enigmas of the mind and the self, the frontiers of fantasy and reality, and ultimately, whether one person can ever fully imagine and understand the life of another.Yagnishsing Dawoor£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseHistoryAn insider’s takeAn African History of AfricaZeinab BadawiAn African History of AfricaZeinab BadawiAn insider’s takeThere is no shortage of big tomes about Africa written by old Africa hands – those white journalists, memoirists, travel writers or novelists who know Africa better than Africans. This genre, lampooned by Binyavanga Wainaina’s satirical essay How to Write About Africa, weaves together stories that exalt the continent’s landscape but decry its politics, that revere its wildlife but patronise its people, that use words such as “timeless”, “primordial” and “tribal” when explaining Africa’s historical trajectories.Zeinab Badawi’s An African History of Africa is a corrective to these narratives. Ambitious in scope and refreshing in perspective, the book stretches from the origins of Homo sapiens in east Africa through to the end of apartheid in South Africa. It is informed by interviews Badawi conducted with African scholars and cultural custodians, whose expertise, observations and wisdom are threaded through the book.The very act of telling African history from an African perspective and making this history accessible to a wide audience is an assertion of dignity and an invitation to learn more. As Badawi puts it: “I hope I have demonstrated that Africa has a history, that it is a fundamental part of our global story, and one that is worthy of greater attention and respect than it has so far received.” She most certainly has.Simukai Chigudu£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseBiographyFriendship and rivalry in LADidion & BabitzLili AnolikDidion & BabitzLili AnolikFriendship and rivalry in LAJournalist Lili Anolik’s latest book is a “provocation”, a dual biography of the two friends who carved their initials on to the counterculture of 1960s and 1970s California. Joan Didion used her reporting skills to fashion herself into a serious-minded literary titan, while Eve Babitz’s novels and essay collections, compiled from the same social scenes but shaped more loosely and with greater spirit, fell into relative obscurity. That is, until Anolik tracked Babitz down in 2012, by then seriously ill and living in squalor. Anolik became obsessed, helping to restore Babitz’s reputation as a writer and chronicler of Los Angeles life, eventually writing the 2019 biography Hollywood’s Eve. “My preoccupation was unbalanced, fetishistic,” she admits here.This time, Anolik uses Didion as the headliner, though seemingly through gritted teeth. When Babitz died, aged 78, in 2021 – just days before Didion, who was 87 – her sister Mirandi discovered boxes of papers in the back of a wardrobe. Anolik was reeled in by an excoriating but unsent letter from Babitz to Didion, which she chooses to interpret as a platonic “lovers’ quarrel”. Babitz assails her friend and occasional collaborator (Didion briefly edited Babitz’s first collection, before Babitz “fired” her) for what she perceives as Didion’s dislike of women, her contempt for art, and her deference to her husband. Anolik takes this wounded screed and runs with it, replaying Babitz’s story through its entanglements with Didion’s. This is vivid, entertaining stuff and often gallops along as if it’s been up all night at one of Didion and Dunne’s notorious Franklin Avenue gatherings, but it is, perhaps, more provocative than entirely convincing.Rebecca Nicholson£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseEssaysPortrait of the artistsThe Position of SpoonsDeborah LevyThe Position of SpoonsDeborah LevyPortrait of the artists\"It is a writing adventure to go in deep, then deeper, and then to play with surface so that we become experts at surface and depth,” writes Deborah Levy, and it’s as good a statement of intent as any in this collection, which delves into topics both trivial and profound: brothel creepers, car crashes, lemon curd, trauma.The theme, insofar as there is one, is the artists who have inspired her. Many of these are women, and Levy writes skilfully on the complex interplay of self-presentation and effacement that’s often demanded of female creativity. Lee Miller “both hides from and gives herself to the camera”; Francesca Woodman makes “herself present by making herself absent”. Artists and writers invent things, but they invent themselves too.Levy is good on the prices we find ourselves paying: for art, for love, for fitting in. Of Ann Quin, the avant garde, working-class writer who drowned herself in the sea off Brighton, she says: “I want to know more about what it took to want to swim home and I know Quin could have told me.” In another short piece called Values and Standards, she writes about an acquaintance she sometimes meets at the school gates. This woman’s husband takes pleasure in humiliating her; to survive, “she had removed her own eyes and saw the world and herself through his eyes”. Levy wonders if she ever “puts her own eyes back in”, and considers her own narrowing of vision at times when “other things had become bigger. Perhaps overwhelming.”Here is Levy on the French writer and film-maker Marguerite Duras: “She thinks as deeply as it is possible to think without dying of pain … She puts everything in to language. The more she puts in, the fewer words she uses.” At her best, Levy pulls off a similar feat, plunging into the depths, taking us with her.Freya Berry£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClosePoetryA dazzling voiceBad Diaspora PoemsMomtaza MehriBad Diaspora PoemsMomtaza MehriA dazzling voiceThe long-awaited debut collection from the former Young People’s Poet Laureate for London invites readers to consider the concept of diaspora. Mehri brings unflinching discursive skills to verse that melds criticism, autobiography and essay while still achieving a crisp sonic momentum characteristic of lyric poetry.The meanings of diaspora in this collection are as varied as the forms Mehri deploys: prose poems, found poems, poems using emojis and erasures. “Diaspora is witnessing a murder without getting blood on your shirt.” “I don’t want to guard something I don’t own.” Mehri finds a new tone somewhere between Gwendolyn Brooks’s effortless musicality and Carolyn Forché’s noun-laced haunting intensity. Hers is a dazzling voice that refuses to speak from a podium, preferring to examine guilt, culture and personhood from within the “nightly decision” of community.Oluwaseun Olayiwola£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionLife after the apocalypseJuiceTim WintonJuiceTim WintonLife after the apocalypseTim Winton and speculative fiction may seem an odd combination. His novels excel at the here and now, depicting lives at the margins, young love and young parenthood, violence at the hands of fathers. But the harsh beauty of the western Australian landscape has long been a presence in his work, and Winton has also long highlighted his country’s fragility in the face of climate chaos, and been fiercely critical of the exploitation of Australia’s mineral wealth. So the cli-fi premise of Juice, his latest novel, could be a perfect Winton fit.Set in an unspecified future, some centuries from now, the book opens on a man and a girl driving across a landscape blackened by ashes. The hellscape is worthy of the Mad Max franchise, with slave colonies springing up from the parched earth like termite mounds. There are echoes of Cormac McCarthy’s The Road here, too, in the black dust thrown up by the vehicle’s tyres, and in the child passenger, observing everything with a mute wariness. And Winton’s ending is a masterstroke, the heart-in-your-mouth final chapter one of the best things I’ve read in a long time.Rachel Seiffert£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseFictionA historic heroYorùbá Boy RunningBiyi BándéléYorùbá Boy RunningBiyi BándéléA historic heroLike the protagonist of Yorùbá Boy Running, Biyi Bándélé had been running from a young age. At 14, he won a writing competition at school; another award in his 20s, for his radio play script Rain, took him to London in 1990. He hit the ground running there, publishing his first novel, The Man Who Came in from the Back of Beyond, in 1991. This was the beginning of a prolific and multifaceted career that, sadly, came to an end when Bándélé died suddenly in 2022 at the age of 54.At the time he was putting the finishing touches to his film adaptation of Wole Soyinka’s play Death and the King’s Horseman – a play very much centred on death and redemption and now available on Netflix as Elesin Oba: The King’s Horseman. He was also working on this posthumous novel, Yorùbá Boy Running, partly inspired by the history of Bándélé’s great-grandfather, who, like his protagonist, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, was formerly enslaved.One doesn’t come to a posthumous novel for its perfect finish; not all the sections of the book are as polished or as inventive as the opening part. The editors have done a great job of ordering and signposting the different sections with dates and thematic headings, making it easier to follow the sometimes intricate chronology of the narrative. We are lucky and grateful that the author was able to leave us with this bookend to his glorious if truncated career that began long ago in Kafanchan, Nigeria, when he started running towards a distinguished future in faraway London.Helon Habila£8.99 (RRP £9.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreCloseEnvironmentA message of hopeInto the Clear Blue SkyRob JacksonInto the Clear Blue SkyRob JacksonA message of hopeRob Jackson has a dream: to restore the Earth’s atmosphere to pre-industrial levels of greenhouse gases. For more than a decade, the professor of environmental sciences and chair of the Global Carbon Project has focused his research on reducing levels of methane, the greenhouse gas responsible for about a third of recent atmospheric heating. Methane concentrations are accelerating faster today than at any time. The cause is unclear but, as the climate heats up, it may may be due to emissions from tropical wetlands or thawing Arctic permafrost.There is so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from fossil fuels that restoring its level to what it was before the industrial revolution is impossible. You would have to remove a trillion tons of pollution: “No one reading this book will live long enough to see that happen.” But that is not the case for methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas. Methane’s concentration could be restored to pre-industrial levels by removing “only” two to three billion tons: “My dream is to see this happen in my lifetime.” Jackson believes this is now the only way of slowing global warming in the next decade or two, in order to delay crossing critical temperature thresholds, such as 1.5 and 2C increases.Jackson explains here the possible methods of “drawdown”, or cleansing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Extracting 400bn tons of carbon dioxide would cost $40tn, “larger than the combined annual GDPs of China and the US”. He frankly admits that removing methane from the air is more difficult than carbon dioxide. But the advantage is that, unlike carbon dioxide, it doesn’t need to be captured and stored underground.Jackson points out the sobering fact that “no fossil fuel shows a sustained decline in global use”. Ultimately, this pollution will need to be removed if the Earth is to remain habitable. In this important book, Jackson makes a compelling case for methane removal, together with emissions reductions. He lucidly explains the threats facing the planet, as well as the science of drawdown. Through conversations with innovators, conservationists, business leaders and activists, he offers a powerful message of hope, showing how change can and must happen, if we are to restore the climate and reduce global temperatures.PD Smith£9.89 (RRP £10.99) - Purchase at the Guardian bookshopRead moreClose"

If an experience is an article of clothing, then memory is the garment after it’s been washed, not according to the instructions, over and over again: the colours fade, the size shrinks, the original, nostalgic scent has long since become the artificial orchid smell of fabric softener. Giyora Shiro, may he rest in peace, was thinking all this while standing in line to get into the next world …”That’s quite the opener for a story, isn’t it? The apt but just slightly ridiculous metaphor, which is then revealed as not an authorial pronouncement but a character’s ruminations. And then we meet the character – excellently specific name – and we find out he’s dead, and, in that drolly formulaic aside “may he rest in peace”, we meet the author too.The novelist David Mitchell once said that a common element in great writing, as opposed to merely “really, really good writing”, is a sense of humour. The Israeli writer Etgar Keret’s short stories certainly qualify on that count. He’s not always or even often trying to make you laugh, but everything he writes is suffused with a wan metaphysical wit: you come to expect the rug-pull, the sad trombone. He’s an absurdist, a surrealist, and a writer who revels in the way that in a few paragraphs you can take the reader anywhere.Where some authors will set vast cycles of fiction in a shared universe, Keret does the opposite. Every story is its own universe, and the 200-odd pages of each of his collections are a multiverse. The stories in Autocorrect, his seventh, are gleaming splinters:multum in parvo. He offers yelp-making casual swerves of perspective. “People, by the way, became extinct a short time later,” we’re told halfway through the last paragraph of one story – that flamboyantly casual “by the way” being very Keretian.In that sense, he resembles the science fiction writer Ted Chiang, with story after story serving as a thought experiment, a parable or a koan, seeded with a big idea. But what he’s interested in is how ordinary people, horny or hungry or a little petty, will react in their ordinary ways to the extraordinary. Hence the opening of one story, for instance: “The world is about to end and I’m eating olives. The original plan was pizza, but …” Or another: “The aliens’ spaceship arrived every Thursday.” In still another, For the Woman Who Has Everything, someone trying to find his wife an original present for her birthday names an asteroid after her – a few hours before that same asteroid is due to obliterate the Earth: “The birthday card Schliefer bought had a picture of a shooting star, and the caption said ‘Make A Wish’ in gold letters.”The opening story, A World Without Selfie Sticks, opens with the narrator describing self-reproachingly how he started yelling at a woman he thought was his girlfriend Deborah when he bumped into her in a coffee shop. Only a week previously, he explains, she had supposedly flown to Australia to do her doctorate – and here she was back in town without telling him. Of course he was angry and hurt. It turns out the woman he’s yelling at (Not-Deborah, he comes to call her) is a doppelganger from a near-identical alternative universe. She has been sent to our world as part of a top-rated TV gameshow: to win the show (and be zapped home) each of the five contestants must identify “the one thing that exists in their world but not the one they’ve been sent to” (the winner of the last series had been sent to a universe without selfie sticks). I shan’t spoil the twist, but it’s a love story and a philosophical what-if all at the same time.The story that will get most scrutiny, A Dog for a Dog, describes the narrator and his brother heading into the Arabic quarter of an Israeli city for revenge after their dog is killed in a hit-and-run. Transposing Israeli-Palestinian hatred from a policy position to street level, it’s a delicately anticlimactic, perfectly balanced vignette, shadowed by violence as well as uneasy complicity in violence and collective punishment. Meanwhile, Strong Opinions on Burning Issues winks at the psychic temper of the times, and Outside refracts the experience of the Covid lockdowns into a surreal little parable. But these are literary responses rather than position statements. (And all but a couple of the stories were written before 7 October.) Politics is mostly absent, in a low-key rebuke to the philistine school of thought that says an Israeli artist should be obliged to make political art.Other stories take us to different versions of the afterlife, or into a simulated reality where the introduction of an “undo” feature – spill your coffee, you can set the universe back 30 seconds – poses an existential threat. Director’s Cut is a real-time biopic of an ordinary man with a 73-year running time; the press screening at once winks at Plato’s cave (the only person who doesn’t die of old age emerges thinking the film was reality) and Borges’s 1-1 scale map. There’s a world not that far from our own, where AI companions are proposed to cure loneliness; and one where time travel only takes off when it’s rebranded as a weight-loss treatment.Yet for all its vast reach, Keret’s prose, translated from Hebrew by Jessica Cohen and Sondra Silverston, is downbeat and matter-of-fact. It’s full of people negotiating the bewildering and alienating and bathetic furniture of modernity: Tinder dates, Zoom calls, Skype meetings, virtual reality, small ads, tedious queues, spoiler alerts, unexpected deaths. Autocorrect isn’t so much a book as a library of tiny books, from an author who conveys as well as any I can think of just how much fun you can have with a short story.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The islands and littorals of the Mediterranean gave Durrell his subject, remade by him into a theatre in which men and women, displaced by the political and social violence of the mid-20th century, stumbled towards each other amid the ruins of ancient civilisations.It feels right, then, that this biography of Lawrence Durrell, only the second major one since his death in 1990, is by Michael Haag, who spent his career writing about the eastern Mediterranean. Haag’s best book was Alexandria: City of Memory (2004), which drew on the writings ofCavafy, EM Forster and Durrell to reconstruct the polyglot culture of the Greek, Italian, Jewish and Arabic population that flourished for centuries on the shores of north Africa. By the time of his own death in 2020, Haag had completed this biography of Durrell up to the year 1945, and the decision was made to publish posthumously. The result reads like an abbreviated account of Durrell’s life rather than an amputation: despite not becoming a significant literary figure until 1957, most of Durrell’s formative experiences had taken place by the time he left the city at the end of the war.Haag’s insistence on treating place not just as a matter of landscape but also as social nexus provides new insights into Durrell’s earliest years. The standard version has always been that his family was Anglo-Indian, with parents who were ethnic Britons living and working during the Raj while longing continually for “home”. Lawrence Durrell Sr was even that quintessential figure, a civil engineer, at work on the railways that were joining up the subcontinent. Yet Haag’s forensic analysis reveals that the Durrell family was located very far down colonial India’s pecking order. Both Lawrence Sr and his wife, Louisa Dixie, were “country born” in the Punjab, with only tenuous connections to Britain. On Louisa’s side there may have been Indian blood. The decision not to automatically send the four surviving Durrell children back to “Blighty” (a corrupted Urdu word) for their education likewise marked the family out as being perilously close to the Eurasians who made up colonial India’s subaltern class.Haag is also able to put to rest some of Durrell’s more outrageous fibs. It is not true that his family was Irish – he probably just liked the way it made him seem not-English. Nor, in his boarding school in Darjeeling, could young Larry see Everest from the foot of his bed: the windows of his dormitory looked out on to dreary playing fields. Such misdirections were perhaps an attempt to disguise a childhood that was distinctly troubled. Louisa – “Mother” in My Family and Other Animals (1956), by younger brother Gerry – had already started her descent into full-blown alcoholism, an addiction she passed on to all three of her sons.Haag has dealt before with the Corfu idyll in The Durrells of Corfu (2017), but in this retelling he reminds us that even in Eden things were not always as they seemed. On the island, the Durrells were socially suspect: the gentry class found them rough and boorish, while the priests and peasants were deeply offended by their insistence on swimming in the nude without worrying who saw them.This biography inevitably comes into its own once Larry touches down in Alexandria in 1942 as the newly appointed press attache to the British embassy. Haag’s descriptions of the city’s melting-pot culture and its steamy eroticism are wonderfully done. It was here that Larry met Eve Cohen, the model for Justine in the first volume of The Alexandria Quartet, who became his second wife.Durrell’s previous biographer Ian MacNiven was in the tricky position of having been invited by his subject to write the book, for which he would be given access to private papers. The result was both overlong and overawed. Haag doesn’t set out to do a hatchet job, but he is clearer on Durrell’s dark side. The puckish author, no more than 5ft 4in tall, was free with his fists, snobbish and racist (Eve’s Jewishness seemed both to intrigue and repel him). The book’s cut-off point of 1945 means that later accusations by Durrell’s daughter Sappho that he compelled her into an incestuous relationship are not explored. She killed herself at the age of 33.Missing, too, is any assessment of where Lawrence Durrell’s literary reputation currently stands. In truth, he is not much read or liked now, his books coming over as bloated and cod-metaphysical in a way no amount of gorgeous phrase-making can quite redeem. Durrell’s time may come again, but at this point we will have to be satisfied with Haag’s account of him as a supreme writer of place, rather than as an astute investigator of the human condition or, even less persuasively, an overlooked modernist master.Larry: A New Biography of Lawrence Durrell 1912-1945 by Michael Haag is published by Profile Books (£25).

Released in the hell of July 2020, it came with the requisite boxes ticked (big star, international locations, franchisable setup) but felt closer to the real thing than most, proving to be a hit for those eager for escapism, scoring one of the streamer’s biggest launches to date.Heads of State review – John Cena and Idris Elba sell fun throwback Amazon comedyRead moreBut like many Netflix films, its cultural impact was negligible, popular for a weekend or three but failing to live on in any notable way after, consumed with speed and forgotten at a similar pace. A sequel was inevitable yet unnecessary, and while one was given a green light at the start of 2021 and started production in 2022, it’s taken another three years to see the light of day. Not only does The Old Guard 2 bear the bruises of such a cursed post-production process but it’s also weakened by such a distance from the first, forcing us to remember something most of us had resigned to the ether (it’s telling that to promote the sequel, Netflix hasrecruitedits stars to recap the first film).It’s not as if we’re dealing with a straightforward action flick either, the mythology of The Old Guard, based on Greg Rucka’s comic book series, requires enough convoluted exposition for us to pull up the original’s Wikipedia plot description to understand just what the hell is going on in the follow-up. Should something intended to be a summer lark really feel like such hard work?It’s made mostly tolerable byCharlize Theron, an actor and a movie star we just don’t see enough of and when we do, it’s quite often not what we want to see her in. Theron, who gave us one of the greatest character studies of the 2010s in Jason Reitman’s vastly underrated Young Adult, has decided to remain boringly unchallenged as of late, slumming it in flimsy franchise fodder (her last non-genre role was playing Megyn Kelly in 2019’s dubious #MeToo dud Bombshell, although that could be conceivably classed as horror). She returns to play Andy, a once immortal warrior who (and I had to remind myself of this) was made mortal in the first film, a danger that should technically add suspenseful stakes to her extravagant fight sequences (but alas). This time around, an old comrade returns from centuries of punishment (Ngô Thanh Vân) and partners with a humanity-hating immortal (Uma Thurman) causing Andy and her team to take action.While it should, in an era of increasingly bloated runtimes, be a boon to have it all wrapped up in under 97 minutes (sans end credits, far shorter than the 125-minute original), The Old Guard 2 is a panicked rush to wrap things up, poorly developed and confusingly plotted, a swift and savage franchise-killer. Along with last week’sM3gan 2.0, whichbombed at the box officeafter a 2.5 year gap, it serves as a reminder to studios why speed and simplicity are both essential for sequels in an attention economy where films just don’t have the same media footprint they once had. In the time it took to beat this one into shape, it seems like those involved have also forgotten what made the first one work, the replacement of director Gina Prince-Bythewood with Victoria Mahoney leading to a considerable drop in action sequence effectiveness while the original’srather groundbreaking queernesshas now been almost entirely excised. The first film had a surprising, swooning kiss from immortal lovers played byMarwan KenzariandLuca Marinelli, but this time around, their foreheads briefly touch instead. There’s also a coy confusion over just what the relationship is between Andy and her one-time partner, who are gay in the comics, but are presented as, ahem, longtime companions here, the film acting as an amusingly abrupt end to Pride month.Theron is an actor who’s tirelessly working even when the script isn’t asking her to, but this is a waste of not only her but also a returning Chiwetel Ejiofor, as well as Thurman who has moments of slithering fun as the villain but she’s used so sparingly, it’s akin to a cameo role. The last act sets her up to be a bigger part in the third film but, slight snag here, there hasn’t been any official confirmation of The Old Guard 3, something that might shock viewers given the baffling cliffhanger ending. It’s not as if some b-plot threads are left dangling but instead, the entire film is left shoddily unfinished, a truly heinous decision that threatens to turn the series into the new Divergent (a cancelled fourth film leaves that franchise forever incomplete). Perhaps that might be for the best.The Old Guard 2 is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsCharlize TheronUma ThurmanAction and adventure filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Suicide Squad veteransIdris Elbaand John Cena are redeployed in this gun show from Nobody director Ilya Naishuller, respectively, as the UK prime minister and US president at loggerheads. President Derringer, barely six months in office, resents the PM for not doing more to help him get elected. Prime Minister Clarke, a six-year incumbent mired in an approval ratings slump, has already dismissed the president – a swaggering former action hero – as a Schwarzenegger knockoff. After a joint press conference goes sideways and spoils the announcement of a Nato-supported energy initiative, the pair are forced on an Air Force One ride to help repair the PR damage – but it gets worse when the plane is shot down.Jurassic World Rebirth review – Scarlett Johansson runs show as near-extinct franchise roars back to lifeRead moreAs it turns out, the Nato energy thingy was cribbed from a nuclear scientist that alliance forces neutralized to head off the threat of another Hiroshima – and his father, a psycho arms dealer named Viktor Gradov (a rueful Paddy Considine), is bent on revenge. In fact, the two-hour film opens with Noel – a skull-cracking MI6 agent played byPriyanka Chopra– leading a covert strike on Gradov in the middle of the world famous Tomatina festival in Buñol, Spain, that turns upside down when she and her team are felled in the food fight. That botched operation – part of a wider sabotage, as we’ll learn later – is top of mind when the president and prime minister bail out of Air Force One (under attack from without and within) into a Belarusian wood. From there, they must find their way back to safe harbor – not knowing whom they can trust when they get there, of course. All the while they’re being chased by Gradov’s hell-raising henchmen Sasha and Olga “the Killers”, whom Aleksandr Kuznetsov and Katrina Durden play like Boris and Natasha, but eviler.It’s the kind of paint-by-numbers summer tentpole that would have drawn a crowd in 2013 – when Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down were doing serious box office numbers. The fact that Amazon MGM went straight to streaming with it, instead of doing an exclusive theatrical release first, speaks volumes about the state of play in the film industry – and, perhaps, the mixed reception forG20, their straight-to-streaming shoot-em-up about the female president who has to fight her way out of a global summit.But where a Bezos studio head could make the case that Viola Davis isn’t a solo draw (even as her body of work suggests otherwise), the lack of faith in Heads’ theatrical potential is beyond comprehension. John Cena remains one of, if notthebiggest draw in professional wrestling, while popping up in everything from the Fast and Furious franchise to the Simpsons. Idris, star of big (Hobbs & Shaw) and small screen (Luther, The Wire), has been touted as a possible James Bond successor for a solid decade. Chopra is a Bollywood superstar who successfully pivoted to network TV and married a Jonas brother. Why did Amazon think this film wouldn’t do well at the cineplex?They should’ve had more confidence in their leads, all three of whom meet the broad performance profile for a popcorn thriller. Elba in particular does a deft job of toggling from his Odd Couple chemistry with Cena (the exceptional actor-wrestler besides Dave Bautista who canreallyplay the margins between tough and tender) to the romantic chemistry with Chopra (who gets to kick ass and take punches just like in her Quantico days). The rest of the cast delivers, too. Richard Coyle plays against his Coupling type as the PM’s dour right hand, while Sarah Niles – with her resting “bitch, please” face – is a study in quiet strength again as the president’s top aide and best bud. Stephen Root, a hacker double agent, is always a treat. And Jack Quaid, fresh off playing lead inNovocaine, hams it up so hard in his handful of appearances as a CIA safe house watchman that he earns his very own end-credits scene.Throughout, Naishuller cooks up action sequences that leave plenty of room for pratfalls and one-liners. (The PM, a Royal Army vet, detonating a smoke bomb in his own face; puns are Noel’s love language; etc) And the writing – a team effort between Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec (Ghost Protocol) and Harrison Query (who also gets story credit) – has command. When two major characters went missing for chunks of the film (Chopra’s was gone for nearly an hour), they would smartly bring them back with a snappy, Edgar Wright-style montage explaining where they had been. Bleeding hearts will keep watching for the sermon on Nato’s value as a peace-keeping force, and maybe look away when it ends in a massive shootout.Fun, fiery and totally frivolous, Heads of State is a perfect summer movie with great potential for future sequels. (The end scene certainly sets that up.) But getting it to launch first in theaters next time might take a global coalition.

The time has come to acknowledge Eleanor Coppola’s magnificent achievement here as first among equals of the credited directors in shooting the original location footage (later interspersed with interviews by Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper), getting the stunningly intimate audio tapes of her husband Francis’s meltdown moments and, of course, in unassumingly keeping the family together while it was all going on.With his personal and financial capital very high after The Conversation and the Godfather films, Coppola put up his own money and mortgaged property to make this stunningly audacious and toweringly mad version of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness from a script by John Milius; it is transplanted from 19th-century Belgian Congo where a rogue ivory trader has gone native in the dark interior, to south-east Asia during the Vietnam war where a brilliant US army officer is now reportedly being worshipped as a god among the Indigenous peoples and must have his command terminated “with extreme prejudice”.Marlon Brandohad a whispery voiced cameo as the reclusive demi-deity, Martin Sheen was the troubled Captain Willard tasked with taking Kurtz down and Robert Duvall is the psychotically gung-ho Lt Col Kilgore, who leads a helicopter assault.Haemorrhaging money and going insanely over-schedule, Coppola shot his film in thePhilippinesduring burning heat, humidity and monsoons and borrowed army helicopters and pilots from President Ferdinand Marcos, only to find that on many occasions – especially during the legendary Ride of the Valkyries attack scene – filming had to halt as the Filipino military would ask for their helicopters back so they could suppress a communist insurgency. In fact, Coppola found himself reproducing reality on a 1:1 scale. As he said in his Cannes press conference, which opens the documentary: “The film is not about Vietnam; it is Vietnam, it’s what it was really like.” Well, bravura auteur rhetoric is an accepted Cannes press conference tradition. The film was arguably just what Vietnam was like for the Americans – though nobody actually died and perhaps it is time to re-state something about Vietnam that gets lost for later generations: a considerable proportion of US soldiers were drafted.The agony was there from the beginning. Coppola originally cast Harvey Keitel as Willard but didn’t like what he was doing and fired him on pretty much the first day – a traumatic and legally fraught event that can’t be talked about too clearly in the documentary. Sheen, the replacement, was a heavy drinker and smoker whose “breakdown” scene in his seedy Saigon hotel room was a dangerous, booze-fuelled improvisation. It was a personal primal scream, which contributed so much to his stress that he had a near-fatal heart attack, almost scuppering the entire production. The documentary’s most gripping moment is Coppola yelling at someone on the phone not to talk about Sheen’s heart attack in case the resulting gossip causes his financial backers to lose their nerve. Sam Bottoms, playing one of Willard’s crew, talks cheerfully about doing speed and LSD during filming; he can’t have been the only one.And all the time Coppola was suppressing intense anxiety that he was making a mediocre, pretentious movie. Like Conrad, he wanted to satirise the hubris and grotesque vanity of the west’s imperial ambitions – and there is something else as well. Willard comes to understand that in killing Kurtz, he is not interrupting or thwarting his occult ritual; he is in fact participating in it, and completing it. Perhaps Coppola came to believe something similar, that he was having his own epiphany-slash-nervous-breakdown in the jungle. It wasn’t quite an apocalypse for him, although he arguably never made anything as good again. As it is, it might have been good to have had Coppola and Milius discuss that title: it sounds like a demand, coming from someone who won’t wait for apocalypse a moment longer. It might be prescriptive and absurd, but as with the film itself, you wind up believing in it.Hearts of Darkness: A Film-Maker’s Apocalypse is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 July, and on UHD and Blu-ray from 28 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsApocalypse NowFrancis Ford  CoppolaMarlon BrandoMartin SheenPhilippinesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then again, French opéra-ballet has always presented challenges, from the substantial forces required to do it justice to the need for specialist vocal techniques rarely encouraged this side of the Channel: a gifted practitioner of the French baroque must be across a dizzying nine different types of trill.Premiered in Paris in 1735, Rameau’sballet héroïquetapped into Enlightenment tropes of the noble savage and the export of European ideals to the New World, whether the inhabitants wanted it or not. Its exotic locations – Turkey, Peru, Persia and the North American wilderness – present a modern-day director with a veritable minefield of cultural sensitivities. Happily,Bintou Dembélé, whose roots are in French hip-hop, navigates these perilous waters with ease, conjuring up an irresistible blend of pop culture and inclusive storytelling.Presented on a bare stage, with musicians on rostra at the back, there are times when this discreetly truncated interpretation comes across as more choreographed concert than opera, but with musicians and dancers ranging freely throughout the auditorium it also feels thoroughly immersive. Lighting designer Benjamin Nesme’s illuminated floating circle does duty as a rose-tinted Persian fountain, the torrid Peruvian sun and a North American forest. The disc’s detachable light sticks are often all that’s required to illuminate a singer’s face. Charlotte Coffinet’s gender-fluid, street-savvy costumes bring a chilled vibe to musicians and dancers alike.View image in fullscreenCrushing it … Les Indes Galantes at The Grange festival, 2025.Photograph: Richard Hubert SmithThe production simmers before it sizzles. The abstract choreography of the prologue occasionally treads water, ditto in the Turkish act. By the time we make landfall in Peru, however, the supple dancers – drawn from Dembélé’s company Structure Rualité – are crushing it with spellbinding outbursts of breaking, popping andwaacking. The Inca temple, volcanic eruption and all, is vividly conveyed, while Rameau’s Dance of the Peace Pipe crackles with leaps, whoops and stamps. The subsequent slow-motion slaughter of one half of the company by the other is a powerful reminder of colonialism’s brutal legacy.Musical standards are exemplary.Cappella Mediterranea, playing under founder and conductor Leonardo García-Alarcón, produce a dynamic, spicily textured and disciplined blend, complemented by the specialist baroque voices of the BelgianChoeur de chambre de Namur. Four busy singers cover the various vocal roles, all thoroughly idiomatic and blessed with immaculate diction.Ana Quintansis a standout as the goddess Hébé;Laurène Paternòa feisty North American maiden;Alasdair Kent– a proper French high tenor – makes a charmingly fickle Spaniard; and sonorous bassAndreas Wolfis enormously persuasive as the fanatical Inca high priest. The Grange festival deserves the Legion of Honour for bringing this imaginative production to our shores.Final performance on 2 July.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

For over two centuries, coal from the mines of Durham and Northumberland was trundled down a maze of wagonways and rail lines to the coast to then be shipped to London.The mines are long gone, but eight miles north of Durham city, relics of the north-east’s industrial heritage can be found hidden amid ancient woodland and a steep-sided gorge.Beamish mapI’m familiar with parts of this area from childhood walks and teenage escapades, but my eight mile circular route connects key historical sites and finishes at a pub with links back to the Napoleonic wars.My journey into the past begins at Eden Place, a picnic area near the village of Beamish on the site of an old terrace of miners’ houses. I set off along a disused railway path, which until 1985 was a busy line linking the Consett steelworks with Sunderland. It is also part of the Irish Sea to North SeaC2C cycle routeso, in search of a bit of solitude, I transfer to a parallel track through the malevolent-sounding Hellhole woods. In fact, they are a delight as I stroll through patch after patch of pungent wild garlic in full flower.After wending its way across fields and a couple of roads, the route arrives atTanfield Railway– which claims to be the world’s oldest railway. Built in 1725 by the Grand Allies, an association of colliery-owning families, as a horse-drawn wagonway to carry coal from inland pits to the Tyne, it later became a rail line. Since it closed in 1964, enthusiasts have brought a three-mile section back to life, and vintage steam trains now shuttle visitors between East Tanfield station, where I am, and Marley Hill.View image in fullscreenThe stonemason who built Causey Arch turned to Roman technology for his design.Photograph: geordiepics/AlamyThe station houses a tearoom, while an engine shed displays old maps that show just how rail lines used to vein the area. It’s tempting to break off from my route and take the six-mile round trip by train to Marley Hill, but I’m keen to see the most dramatic part of the walk.A path from the car park, signposted to Causey Arch, leads into woods, and I’m soon walking along the top of a steep-sided gorge. Woodland has covered this area for centuries, and as I look down at the stream below in the gloom, it feels ridiculously remote – until the spell is broken by the hoot of a locomotive chugging along the other side of the gorge.About half an hour after leaving Tanfield, a huge bridge across the dene (valley) comes into view. This isCausey Arch, which a noticeboard proudly announces is the oldest surviving single-arch railway bridge in the world. In 1725, the Grand Allies commissioned local stonemason Ralph Wood to span the ravine. He turned to Roman technology for his design and, when the original wooden bridge fell apart, it was rebuilt in stone. But local legend has it that, fearing a second collapse, Wood committed suicide by throwing himself off the top of his construction. After restoration in the 1980s, the bridge is still standing nearly 300 years later.A noticeboard proudly announces that Causey Arch is the oldest surviving single-arch span railway bridge in the worldI walk across the top to join a few other hikers inspecting an old wagon on display, before heading down a steep path to the bottom of the gorge. Here, a footbridge gives the best view of the perfect arch, framed by the trees as it rises majestically 24 metres above the burn.As I carry on walking, I begin to hear shouting; then a wall of rain-stained, yellow sandstone comes into view. This is CauseyQuarry, a popular rock-climbing spot and the place where I learned the basics of rope work many years ago. I do a short traverse above the muddy ground for old times’ sake, shuddering slightly as I remember the rock antics of my youth.View image in fullscreenEnthusiasts have brought a three-mile section of Tanfield Railway back to life.Photograph: Paul Marshall/AlamySteps up a huge wooded artificial embankment lead to a much-needed stop at Poppy Coffee Pot cafe in the Causey car park. Fortified with cake, I continue along a bridleway, part of the 80-mileTyne and Wear Heritage Way, before heading along a track called Coppy Lane and into open countryside. This eventually turns downhill, and before long the roof tiles ofBeamish Hallappear, for centuries home to the local landowners.‘The railway that got the world on track’: a walk through 200 years of history in County DurhamRead moreStarting life as a fortified farmhouse in the 13th century, the current hall was built in the 1800s, and previous occupants include the family of former prime minister Anthony Eden. It is now a hotel and, as I stroll up for a closer look, its manicured lawns offer a welcome break from the rough tracks in the woods (doubles from £92). The old stables now house both a restaurant and The Coach House Cafe, which offers afternoon tea, but I feel a little too grubby to sit down to dainty cakes and sandwiches, and so continue on my route.With only the occasional dog walker for company, it is hard to imagine that in the early 1800s this area was a hive of industrial activityThis now clings to Beamish burn (stream), and as I turn towards a hill I begin to hear a babble of voices, then the rattle and ding of a bell as a tram moves across the skyline. I hadn’t realised I was quite so close toBeamish open-air museum, a huge 140-hectare (350-acre) site dedicated to the preservation of life in the north-east, which was last week crownedArt Fund museum of the year.With only the occasional dog walker for company, it is hard to imagine that in the early 1800s this area was a hive of industrial activity, boasting a paper mill and iron forges, one of which had the reputation of “casting the finest muzzle-loading cannon in England”. Soon after passing Flint mill, I enter Ousbrough Wood, a site of nature conservation importance comprising ancient trees and a conifer plantation that at one time provided pit props for the mines.There are myriad paths through the oak and silver birch, and I occasionally take a wrong turn, retracing my steps to get back on to the heritage way route. There’s some steep uphill walking, but eventually the path deposits me on a country road. I turn left and, after passing a row of almshouses built in 1863, I arrive at the pub.View image in fullscreenThe life-size figures at the Shepherd & Shepherdess pub are said to date from the Napoleonic wars.Photograph: Tony LeMoignan/AlamyTheShepherd & Shepherdessdates from the 18th century, getting its name from two life-size painted lead figures above the original door. The story goes that these date from the Napoleonic wars, when a French blockade on lead meant these metal figures were smuggled into Britain as “works of art”, to be melted down for weaponry. These two were saved by a squire at Beamish Hall, eventually ending up at the pub.Whatever the tale, they make a nice historical touch to this fine hostelry, complete with an open fire in the winter and a menu of sturdy pub fare. This includes lasagne, sea bass and fish and chips, as well as good vegetarian and gluten-free options. My eye, though, is drawn to the local delicacy of corned beef and potato pie served with greens, chips and gravy. Accompanied by a pint of the pub’s own cask ale, this is the perfect post-walk sustenance in Beamish country.Explore more on these topicsWalking holidaysHeritageNewcastle holidaysEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each element corresponds to a colour and an organ in the body (earth, for example, is yellow and linked to the spleen). Years ago, Hayley made me the most deliciously vibrant and earthy bright-red dip from kale, and today’s recipe is a homage to her nourishing, elemental approach, while also saving scraps from the bin.Rainbow vegetable scrap dipsI love the adage “eat the rainbow”. Yes, it’s a bit corny, but it works, and sometimes the simplest advice is really the best. Eating a variety of colourful plants increases nutrient diversity, which supports a healthy gut. These dips are a vibrant, low-waste way to add colour, fibre and flavour to your plate by using up whatever’s already in the fridge or even destined for the compost bin.These dips can be as simple as just blending leftover boiled carrots with white beans, olive oil and lemon juice to create a bright orange spread, but here I’ve gone all in with vegetable scraps to prove a point: real discards such as pepper tops, radish greens and beetroot peelings are not only edible, but, with the application of a little love and care, they can be absolutely delicious.My usual advice is not to peel vegetables at all, because it saves time and money, while retaining flavour and fibre. But if you do peel or trim, those scraps can still be saved and used. So, this is a blueprint rather than a strict recipe: each version follows the same base formula and can be adapted to whatever you have in the house. For a dinner party, I like to make a few different-coloured dips and serve them on a platter with crudites, rye bread or crackers.Here are the four combinations I made:Red – red pepper trimmings, red apple peel, cranberries, smoked paprika;Yellow – squash skins, sweet potato peel, carrot tops and tails, turmeric, orange zest, sesame;Green – broad bean pods, courgette tops, cucumber skin, coriander stalks, cardamom, cashew, pumpkin seeds;Purple – beetroot peel, red cabbage skin, dates, cumin, sumac.Base recipe (makes 1 batch, so multiply to make a rainbow)150g raw veg scraps(eg, pepper tops, beetroot peel, courgette ends, but choose one colour of vegetable per dip)130g cooked white beans(eg butter beans or cannellini), drained and liquid reserved2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 tbsp lemon juice, or vinegarSea salt, to tasteOptional extras and toppings (choose to suit your dip’s colour and flavour)1 small garlic clove, peeledUnwaxed citrus zest(lemon, lime, orange)2 tbsp tahini, or nuts2-4 dates, cranberries or goji berries1–2 tsp ground spices(smoked paprika, cumin, turmeric, coriander, za’atar)Soft herb stalks and/or leaves(eg. mint, coriander, parsley), for toppingChilli flakes, or chopped fresh chilliToasted seeds, or dukkah or chopped herbs, to serveSteam or blanch the vegetable leftovers or clean scraps for five minutes, sticking to one colour of vegetable per dip. Tip the steamed vegetables into a high-speed blender, add the cooked white beans, extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt, then add a splash of the reserved bean liquid to help blend smoothly.Depending on your choice of scraps and desired flavour, add any optional extras that will enhance the flavour and colour – garlic, citrus zest for punch, tahini or nuts for richness, dates, cranberries or dried apricots for sweetness, as well as ground spices and chilli flakes for red heat.Blitz to a smooth, hummus-like consistency, adding more bean liquid if required, then taste and adjust for seasoning, as well as to balance the acidity, richness and sweetness. Serve as a dip or spread, topped with toasted seeds, chopped herbs or dukkah, if you like. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesWaste notFoodFood wasteSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a thick, delicious frittata-like mixture of courgettes, leeks, peas, herbs and eggs, and in Palestine it’s often made with finely chopped onions, too. I always keep a couple of tins offul(fava beans) in my pantry for those times when I crave a quick and satisfying late breakfast or weekend lunch. When simple toast and butter won’t do the trick and I’m in need of something more substantial and savoury, that’s when fava beans come to the rescue.Aubergine and fava beans with eggs (bitinjan w ful ma’ beyd; pictured top)You can substitute the eggs with feta for an extra-creamy and salty touch. Alternatively, the dish works beautifully as a vegan dish without the eggs. If fava beans aren’t available, you can easily substitute them with other tinned beans. Make sure to season the beans generously and serve them with fresh crusty bread or flatbread. This is a truly filling and satisfying meal that never fails to impress.Prep15 minSteepOvernightCook50 minServes4For the sumac onions1 large red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced1½ tbsp sumac100ml apple cider vinegar3 tbsp lemon juiceSaltFor the aubergines, beans and eggs2 medium aubergines(about 630g)80ml olive oil, plus extra to serveSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and finely chopped (175g)6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 small piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated (20g)1 green chilli, finely chopped, seeds and all (20g)1 tsp chilli flakes1 tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground cinnamon1½ tsp tomato paste2 plum tomatoes, chopped into 2cm chunks (300g)400g tin chopped tomatoes400g tin fava beans, drained15g fresh coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra to serve4 large eggs30g sumac onions(see above and method)For the sumac onions: pack the sliced onion into a 400ml jar for which you have a lid. Add the sumac and set aside. Put the vinegar, 100ml water, lemon juice and a tablespoon of salt in a medium bowl and whisk until the salt dissolves. Pour the vinegar mixture over the onions, cover and give them a gentle shake. The onions are ready to eat the next day, though they’ll keep in the fridge for up to three weeks.Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Cut the aubergines into 4cm chunks and put in a large bowl. Mix well with 40ml oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then spread out on a large oven tray lined with baking paper. Roast for 25 minutes, or until very soft and lightly browned, then remove from the oven and set aside.Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put the remaining oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute for about seven minutes, until soft and lightly browned. Add the garlic, ginger, green chilli, chilli flakes, spices and tomato paste, and cook for another minute, or until fragrant.Add the chopped tomatoes, tinned tomatoes, fava beans, 300ml water, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper, turn down the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, or until thickened.Add the aubergine chunks and cook for a further three minutes. Stir in the coriander, then turn down the heat to medium-low. Make four wells in the sauce and crack an egg into each well. Gently swirl the egg whites with a fork a little bit, taking care not to break the yolks. Simmer gently for seven or eight minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Cover the pan with a lid for the last few minutes, to speed things up.Leave to settle and cool for a couple of minutes, then garnish with the sumac onions, coriander, a drizzle of olive oil and a little salt on the eggs.Courgette and leekijeh(Arabic frittata)View image in fullscreenSami Tamimi’s courgette and leekijeh.Good with chopped salad,shattaand warm bread.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4–6250g frozen peas, defrosted2 courgettes(300g)1 small onion(150g)1 large leek, trimmed, finely chopped, washed and dried (175g)50g plain flour15g fresh parsley, finely chopped10g fresh mint leaves, thinly shredded1¼ tsp dried mint1 tsp aleppo chilli flakes, or regular chilli flakes½tsp ground turmeric1 tsp dill or fennel seeds, slightly crushed3 large eggs, lightly beatenSalt and black pepper3 tbsp olive oilLemon wedges, to serveSoured cream, to servePut the peas in a food processor and blitz for a few seconds until slightly crushed but not mushy. Transfer to a large bowl.Trim the courgettes and peel the onion, then, using the coarse side of a box grater, grate both on to a clean tea towel or muslin. Gather up the ends of the towel and twist hard over a bowl to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Add the grated courgettes and onion to the peas, then add the leek, flour, herbs, spices, eggs, a teaspoon and three-quarters of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well to form a uniform batter.Put a large (28cm) shallow nonstick pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the ijeh mixture, smoothing it down to make an even patty. Partly cover the pan, then leave to cook on a low heat for about 17 minutes, shaking the pan a few times to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom and running a rubber spatula around the sides.When the edges start to go golden brown, get a large flat plate and place it over the pan. Carefully invert the pan, plate and all, so the ijeh ends up on the plate, then slide it back into the pan uncooked side down and cook uncovered for 15 minutes more, until it is firm and cooked through.To serve, slide the ijeh on to a platter, squeeze over a little lemon juice and serve with lemon wedges and soured cream on the side.Palestinian egg and chips (Batata w beyd)View image in fullscreenSami Tamimi’sbatata w beyd(AKA Palestinian-style egg and chips).This is the Palestinian equivalent of egg and chips, and is commonly enjoyed as a hearty and comforting meal. It’s a simple yet fulfilling dish, made with basic ingredients. Batata w beyd is often served as a main course, accompanied by sides of chopped vegetables, pickles, shatta and bread. Perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner, its simplicity makes it a popular choice for home cooks.Prep5 minCook45 minServes44 large potatoes(1.15kg)4 tbsp sunflower oil, plus 1 tsp extra for the onions30g butterSalt and black pepper2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped (300g)8 medium eggs1½ tsp sumac2 tbsp fresh parsley, roughly chopped2 tbsp fresh oregano leavesOlive oilPeel the potatoes and cut them into 1½cm cubes. Heat the sunflower oil and butter in a very large frying pan, add the potato cubes, a teaspoon of salt and three-quarters of a teaspoon of ground black pepper, then cook, stirring a few times, on a medium-high heat, for 17 minutes, or until the potatoes are crisp, golden brown on the outside and soft within. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl.Using the same pan, lower the heat to medium, then add the remaining teaspoon of sunflower oil and the onion, and cook, stirring, for about five minutes, until the onion is soft and light golden. Return the potatoes to the pan and stir a couple of times.Crack in the eggs and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until they are cooked through, but the yolks are still slightly runny. If you like, cover the pan with a lid for the last few minutes to speed up the process.Sprinkle with a bit more salt, the sumac and the herbs, finish with a final drizzle of olive oil and serve.This is an edited extract from Boustany: A Celebration of Vegetables from my Palestine, by Sami Tamimi, published by Ebury Press at £30.

When I’ve finisheda jar, how can I use the brine in my cooking?Geoff, SheffieldLast year,Dua Lipapoured Diet Coke into an ice-filled glass, topped it up with the brine from both a tub of pickles (plus a few rogue pickles) and a tub of jalapeños, swirled it around, then drank it. While someone underthe viral TikTok videoasked, “Dua, is everything OK?”, the pop star is right about one thing: it’s time we start thinking of pickle brine as an ingredient, rather than a byproduct.“The brine retains all of that delicious pickle flavour,” says Moon Lee, head chef of no-waste restaurantSiloin London, “and a mixture of sweet and savoury undertones”. Also, because it’s fermented, “it has an almost tangy, kombucha-like taste, too. I’m from Korea, and we always make use of kimchi juice, whether in a dressing, as a seasoning for noodles or in pancake batter. Why can’t pickle brine have the same potential?”Good point well made, but what does that mean in practice? “We’ve previously combined cucumber with pickle brine and cold-pressed rapeseed oil, then topped it with chopped shallots that have been marinated in salt and sugar,” Moon says; she reckons the same approach would work a treat with wild fennel, especially.Meanwhile, pickle brine also “makes a great seasoning”, says Stuart Ralston, executive chef and owner ofAizle,Lyla,NotoandTipo, all in Edinburgh, and will put some pucker into your potatoes: “A few spoonfuls of pickle brine will make a potato salad, for example, more interesting.” Alternatively, combine 150ml each of vegetable oil and olive oil with 110ml pickle brine, 60g dijon mustard and 5g chopped fresh oregano, then “adjust the seasoning, if need be, but that won’t be far off”. Use that to dress a roast chicken, Ralston says, to serve with boiled potatoes and crisp salad leaves.Otherwise, Ralston might use the stuff to brine a chicken – “give it a few hours to make the bird more tender and retain moisture” – while the Guardian’s own zero-waste correspondent, Tom Hunt, uses it tobrine pork chopsfor similar reasons: “Pickle juiceis brimming with flavour and salt, which is exactly what’s needed to make the most flavourful pork chop out there.” Put your chop or chops in a tub in which they’ll fit snugly, then pour over the pickle juice: “Ideally enough to submerge the chop, but even a small amount will work wonders.” Leave to marinate for three hours, and ideally overnight, then, when you’re ready to cook, “lift the chops from the brine, pat dry with a clean towel and cook using your preferred method”.Of course, spent pickle brine can also simply be used to pickle something else, Moon says: “It’s a common fermentation technique known as ‘backslopping’. Keep a small amount of used brine and add it to a new batch to accelerate the pickling process.”That said, if you want to channel your inner Dua Lipa and down some pickle brine, instead, Ralston reckons it’s probably best to hold the cola: “When I lived in America, I’d often have a bloody mary at brunch, and a few splashes of gherkin brine, say, really give it a kick.” That’s not a bad way to get yourself out of a pickle.Got a culinary dilemma?

Fennel seeds in the buttery pastry give a subtle flavour surprise, although you could omit them, or try coriander seeds or ginger instead. A small batch of jam is surprisingly quick to make, but you can, of course, use shop-bought, or make use of one of those jars living rent-free in your cupboard. Then, a summer pudding-inspired cake that makes a delightful centrepiece – the juices from the berries absorb into the top third of the sponge, giving it a gorgeous, ombre tone that looks as beautiful as it tastes.Summer pudding tray cakeUse a mixture of whatever berries are plentiful; frozen will work well, too.Prep5 minCook1 hr 10 min, plus coolingChill1 hrServes8For the sponge3 large eggs20g vegetable oil40gwhole milk120g caster sugar100gplain flour1½ tspbaking powderA pinch of flaky saltFor the soak550g mixed berries, fresh or frozen and defrosted100g caster sugarFor the cream300mldoublecream30gcaster sugar(optional, depending on how sweet the fruit is)Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line a 20cm square tin.Separate the eggs, and put the whites in the bowl of a stand mixer, if you have one. Whisk the oil and milk into the yolks. Whisk the egg whites until foamy, then add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whipping on high speed until you have a stiff, glossy meringue.Whisk a quarter of the meringue into the yolks to lighten, then sift over half the flour and the baking powder, and fold in. Fold in half the remaining meringue, followed by the remaining flour. Finally, fold in the last of the meringue and a pinch of salt – the batter should be very airy.Pour into the lined tin and spread with a spatula. Gently tap the tin on a counter to burst any large air bubbles, then bake for 30 minutes, until golden and firm. Leave to cool completely, then take out of the tin and put it in a larger tray or serving tin. Poke holes all over the top with a skewer or fork.Meanwhile, in a saucepan, simmer the berries, sugar and 100g water for two to three minutes (eight minutes, if using frozen berries), until the berries release their juices. Strain, catching the juices in a bowl, then leave the juices to cool for 15–20 minutes (you should be able to dip in your finger comfortably). Set aside two tablespoons of juice to decorate, then pour the rest slowly all over the sponge, not forgetting the edges. Collect any juice pooled in the tray and pour it back over the sponge.Set aside 120g of the berry pulp, then spread the rest on top of the cake. Whip the cream and sugar to medium peaks, then gently fold in the reserved pulp to make a rippled effect. Save a few large berries for the top, then spread the cream over the sponge, and drizzle on the reserved syrup and berries. Chill for at least an hour before serving.Jammy shortbread tartView image in fullscreenNicola Lamb’s jammy shortbread tart.Prep5 minChill30 min+Cook1 hrServes8For the quick berry jam300g mixed berries(frozen are fine)150gcaster sugar30g lemon juiceFor the shortbread dough1½ tsp fennel seeds80g light brown sugar120g room-temperature butter, plus extra for greasing1 egg(about 50g)240gplain flour½ tspbaking powder½ tspflaky saltTo finish (optional)Demerara sugarFennel seedsCreme fraiche or yoghurt,to servePut the jam ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil on a medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until glossy and thick, then test the set: put a teaspoon of jam on a small plate, pop it in the freezer for two minutes, and it should form a skin that wrinkles when you drag a finger through it, without refilling the gap. If not, cook the jam for another two minutes and retest. Pour into a clean container, leave to cool, then seal and store in the fridge.For the shortbread, blitz the fennel seeds and sugar in a blender until fine (or crush the fennel in a mortar, then mix with the sugar). Mix in the butter for a minute or two, until combined and somewhat airy, then mix in the egg. Stir in the dry ingredients until the mix comes together into a soft dough, then wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or overnight.When you are ready to bake, remove the dough from the fridge and let it soften to room temperature (you can knead it a bit to warm it up). Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and grease a 23-24cm fluted tart tin with butter.Set a quarter of the dough aside, then press the rest evenly into the base and sides of the tin. Now spread 200-250g of the jam on top (save any excess for porridge or toast). Pinch off little pieces of shortbread from the reserved dough, and use these to cover the jam, leaving a few small spaces for it to peep through. Sprinkle with demerara sugar and fennel seeds, then bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden – the jam should be bubbling in places.Once cool enough to handle, take the tart out of its tin and leave to cool before serving with a spoon of creme fraiche or yoghurt, if desired.Nicola Lamb is a pastry chef and author of the weeklyKitchen Projectsnewsletter and Sift, published by Ebury Press at £30.
