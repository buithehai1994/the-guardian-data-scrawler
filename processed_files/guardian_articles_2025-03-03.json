That is up from 731 million and 198 million respectively in 1990.Without urgent policy reform and action, the report says, more than half of those aged 25 or above worldwide (3.8 billion) and about a third of all children and young people (746 million) are forecast to be affected by 2050.Graph showing the number of adults aged 25 and above, and the number of children and young people, living with obesity from 1990 to 2050The research predicts a particularly alarming rise (121%) in obesity among children and younger people, with the number predicted to be living with obesity predicted to hit 360 million by 2050.“The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,” said lead author Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the University of Washington.The numbers affected vary across the globe, the study shows. More than half of the adults classified as overweight or obese live in just eight countries: China (402 million), India (180 million), the US (172 million), Brazil (88 million), Russia (71 million), Mexico (58 million), Indonesia (52 million) and Egypt (41 million).Chart showing the number of people with obesity in each of the eight countriesBy 2050, about one in three children and young people living with obesity (130 million) are forecast to be in just two regions – north Africa and the Middle East and Latin America and the Caribbean – with seismic health, economic and societal consequences,the report says.The researchers warned that children everywhere are gaining weight faster than previous generations and obesity is occurring earlier, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer occurring at a younger age.For example, in high-income countries, about 7% of men born in the 1960s were obese by the time they were 25. But this increased to 16% for men born in the 1990s, and is predicted to reach 25% for men born in 2015.In the UK,the Lancet reportpredicted that among children aged five to 14, obesity will rise from 12% of girls in 2021 to 18.4% in 2050, and from 9.9% to 15.5% in boys over the same period.Nearly a quarter of the world’s obese adult population in 2050 are forecast to be aged 65 or above, intensifying the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and wreaking havoc on services in low-resource countries.A second study also published on Monday, by the World Obesity Federation, warned in particular of the impact of obesity in poorer countries.“By far the greatest number of premature deaths attributable to high BMI are in lower- and upper-middle-income countries – indicating poor levels of treatment available,” its authors wrote.Johanna Ralston, the chief executive of the WorldObesityForum, said: “Obesity has significant health, economic and societal impacts that are likely to be more challenging for lower-resourced countries to address.”The researchers behind the Lancet study noted some limitations, including that while they used the best available data, predictions were constrained by the quantity and quality of past data. The potential impact of emerging interventions, such as weight-loss drugs, were also not considered.Writing in a linked comment, Thorkild Sørensen of the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved with the research, said the scale of the obesity crisis was now so significant that there would have to be public health interventions worldwide.Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

The two were traveling with tattoo equipment.“I just want to get home, you know? I’m really desperate,” Brösche toldABC News10News in a phone interview from a detention facility.Lofving, a designer, had just moved toLos Angeleswhen she met up with Brösche in Tijuana with plans to cross the border together and travel to Los Angeles, but Brösche never made it to the city.Brösche had her German passport, confirmation of her visa waiver to enter the country, and a copy of her return ticket back to Berlin, Lofving said. But she was still pulled aside for a secondary inspection by a US Customs and Border Protection agent.Brösche said she then spent days detained in a cell at theSan Diegoborder before being taken into custody by Ice. The agency brought her to the Otay Mesa detention center, where she’s now been for more than a month.According toKPBS, US Customs and Border Protection accused Brösche of planning to violate the terms of the visa waiver program by intending to work as a tattoo artist during her time in Los Angeles.According to ABC’s 10News, she was forced to spend eight days in solitary confinement in the facility.“She says it was like a horror movie. They were screaming in all different rooms. After nine days, she said she went so insane that she started punching the walls and then she’s got blood on her knuckles,” Lofving said of her friend’s experience.Lofving said she asked Ice agents if Brösche could be sent back to Mexico, but they responded that her lack of legal residency would mean she would be deported back to Germany. Lofving also said she tried to get help from the German consulate inLos Angeles.Lofving initially had no idea where Brösche was being held or if she had already been deported toGermany. It was only after pleading for help online and using the federal Detainee Locator website that she was able to track down her friend.It would be 25 days before Lofving would find and be allowed to visit her friend at the detention center, where she remains.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationSan DiegoGermanyMexicoLos AngelesCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

Although this is difficult to quantify, it warned that actions being taken by businesses and individuals to avoid being a victim of crime – such as not visiting the high street, or deferring investment – could take the total cost to as much as £250bn, or 10% of GDP.With the government under pressure to find money for public services and defence spending, Policy Exchange said Labour needed to invest an additional £5bn a year into tackling a crisis in prison capacity, the size of the policing workforce and clearing backlogs in the courts.Alongside highlighting austerity, the thinktank recommended reforms to sentencing, including automatic tougher sentences for prolific offenders and deportation of foreign offenders.The report, which was also backed by the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, urged the government to increase public spending on policing and the criminal justice system to help underpin the economy.Official figures show a steady increase in levels of crime over recent years, while Britain’s largest retailers have warned of arise in shopliftingwith huge costs for the industry. Last year, Sharon White, the former chair of the John Lewis Partnership, described the increase as an “epidemic”.Police-recorded shoplifting has increased by 51% relative to 2015 and is at its highest level in 20 years. Police-recorded robberies and knife crime offences are up 64% and 89% respectively over the same period.Javid, who was home secretary between 2018 and 2019, before briefly serving as chancellor until early 2020, wrote in the foreword to the report that he was proud of his record in government for tackling crime, but added: “that said, there’s clearly more to do.”“History teaches us that economic activity flourishes in societies that value law and order. When consumers and businesses know that contracts will be honoured, and that the fruits of their labour will be protected from theft and the threat of violence, they have the confidence to work, to earn and to build something of value. Without this confidence we all suffer.”Labour has sought to crack down on crime, with Keir Starmer having said in opposition years of cuts to police funding and changes to sentencing rules were a “Tory shoplifter’s charter” for the rise in crime rates across the UK.However, there are concerns that a tight position in the public finances and the government pushing to increase defence spending could lead to funding restraint for public services in chancellor Rachel Reeves’s spring spending review later this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This however would complicate Labour’s promises not to return to austerity, as well as campaign pledges to fix battered public services.Haldane, who is now the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, said: “We are approaching what will almost certainly be a brutal, and what could be an electorally defining, public spending review.“In an era of acute anxiety, this report is an arresting clarion – and wake-up – call to all political parties on the true and rising economic costs of crime and the societal consequences of continuing malign neglect of that most foundational of government responsibilities – the security of citizens.”Diana Johnson, the minister for crime and policing, said: “In the next decade, this government plans to halve violence against women and girls and knife crime, and restore public confidence in policing and the criminal justice system, as part of the Safer Streets Mission.“Through the Plan for Change, we will also bring visible policing back to communities, with 13,000 extra neighbourhood police officers, PCSOs and specials. Alongside this, the government will build 14,000 more prison places by 2031 to lock up dangerous offenders.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsCrimePolicePrisons and probationUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Not because he peddles conspiracy theories and makes Nazi salutes, but because of the huge damage he is doing to scientific institutions in the US. Now let’s see if he really believes in free speech,” he wrote.Muskresponded: “Only craven, insecure fools care about awards and memberships. History is the actual judge, always and forever. Your comments above are carelessly ignorant, cruel and false. That said, what specific actions require correction? I will make mistakes, but endeavor to fix them.”Concerns include Musk’s incendiary comments – such as calling the British MP Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, a “rape genocide apologist”.“I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires fellows to have ‘due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by [the Royal] Society’,” Curry wrote in the letter.Scientists have also raised concerns over Musk’s actions within the Trump administration, where he oversees the US “department of government efficiency”. The cost-cutting operation has threatened the funding of scientific and medical communities, among other areas.The meeting of the fellowship of the Royal Society, which began at 6pm on Monday, was arranged to discuss the principles around public pronouncements and behaviour of fellows.The Royal Society’scode of conduct and disciplinary regulationsstate: “Fellowship and foreign membership of the society is a privilege predicated on adherence to particular standards of conduct.”Among other points, the document says: “When speaking or publicising statements in a personal capacity, fellows and foreign members must still strive to uphold the reputation of the society and those who work in it, and be mindful that what is said or stated in a personal capacity could still impact the society.”After the meeting, the Royal Society released a statement saying the fellows agreed on the need to stand up for science and for scientists around the world in the face of the growing challenges science faces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This action was taken on 20 February.”Channel 4 News said the boy’s appearances represented “a handful of minutes across hundreds of hours of Channel 4 News output covering the Israel-Hamas war” and “appeared alongside other voices, including Israeli voices, as part of wider packaging and reporting for Channel 4 News and in line with our principles of due impartiality”.On Monday, the regulator Ofcom warned it has “ongoing concerns” about the “nature and gravity” of the BBC documentary onGaza.In a letter to the BBC, Ofcom chairMichael Gradealso warned the regulator could “intervene” to handle a complaint if it is not satisfied with the corporation’s internal investigation.Explore more on these topicsChannel 4Television industryBBCMichael GradeHamasGazanewsShareReuse this content"

Its resurgence threatens the fragile progress we’ve madeJustin KirklandMon 3 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 10.43 ESTShareIgot into my one and only physical fight when I was in seventh grade. It was right after school let out, the other boy was called Nathan, and moments before I launched at him, he knocked the books out of my brother Casey’s hands and called him “retarded”. More than 20 years after that scuffle, I still wonder how often Casey, a now 35-year-old autistic man, is called that word. Given the current political landscape, I’m certain he’s going to start hearing it more often.The R-word is in a new era of prominence in rightwing, chronically online circles – especially on 4chan and X. A favorite of those who currently hold power or stand to gain power underDonald Trump’s second administration, the slur is being used with gleeful relish to belittle and mock ideological enemies.In the past year,Elon Muskhas used the R-word at least 16 times on X. Hethought Ben Stillerwas one for endorsing Kamala Harris; so was the Facebook co-founderDustin Moskovitzfor comparing Tesla to Enron.Elsewhere, brash, right-leaning personalities such as the political commentator Dave Rubin, and Dasha Nekrasova and Anna Khachiyan of the podcast Red Scare, frequently throw the word around with provocative irreverence, attempting to discredit those who don’t align with their politics.White House social media Trump-style: bad taste, sycophancy and trollingRead moreTrump reportedly used the word to denigrate bothJoe BidenandHarrisin private conversations during the 2024 election. When Trump won in November, a “top banker” toldFinancial Times: “I feel liberated. We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pussy’ without the fear of getting cancelled.” (Interestingly, this banker chose to remain anonymous.)I’ve spent my life on the lookout for this word: how it shrinks people with intellectual disabilities down to a caricature, incorrectly depicting them as incapable of coherence and, ironically enough, social decorum; how it communicates a lack of respect for their humanity. It’s just something that you do when you have an autistic brother. And while the slur was certainly more prevalent when we were teenagers in the early 2000s, this resurgenceis still menacing, not least because I can’t fight Musk after class.Right now, the right wants a word that stings, and the R-word does the trick, according to Dr Kelly Wright, an experimental sociolinguist, lexicographer and assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin. In the 2000s,disability advocates waged a moderately successfulsocial campaign to stop kids (and everyone else) from using the slur. Now, its proponents cling to itbecauseof its taboo nature, lauding it as a victory over censorship by the woke mob (like the insults “libtard”, “fucktard” and “gaytard” before it).“Conservatives are empowered … People struggle with holding back what they actually want to say, so there’s something psychologically ‘freeing’ for this group of empowered people to be able to be like: ‘I’m going to punch up my words with something edgy and get attention,’” said Wright, whose work focuses on self-censorship, or the ways we limit ourselves when speaking.“[It is used] in a ‘please see me’ way.”The R-word isn’t just a rallying cry. It’s an attack on someone’s personhoodThey are getting seen. A recentstudy from Montclair State Universityfound that Musk’s use of of the slur in early January correlated with a 200% spike in usage of the word by users on X, the platform Musk owns, in the days following.“There’s this whole generation of people whodiduse it in a more neutral way in the beginning, especially when we were younger,” Wright said. Now, “it’s like, ‘Oh, this other person who I identify with is using it.’ It gives people permission.”Cut to inauguration weekend, when the tech right and Maga youth descended on DC,throwing aroundthe sluras they celebrated their win over the left. Just this week, Muskrespondedto a critical post on X: “I’m tempted to call this guy a retard, but I won’t because I’ve used that word too many times.” (Ironically enough, X’s own AI chatbot outlined the slur’s offensive history in thereplies.)But the R-word isn’t just a rallying cry. It’s an attack on someone’s personhood.We’ve seen this before. Starting in 1910,the term “mental retardation”was used to diagnose those who were “feeble-minded”, failed to develop on the average timeline, and were deemed by some doctors as “incurable”. Around the same time, the belief that undesirable traits – specifically intellectual disabilities, and eventually race and sexual orientation – could be “bred out” of existence was growing in popularity in the US.This eugenics movement was endorsed by political powerhouses and substantial research on eugenics was bankrolled by the likes of theCarnegie Institutionand theRockefeller Foundation.View image in fullscreenPeople protest the film Tropic Thunder over its use of the R-word in Los Angeles in 2008.Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty ImagesAdvocates of eugenicssuggested people with disabilities should be institutionalized and separated by gender, so as to discourage “bad breeding”. It was the popularity of the eugenics movement that served as inspiration for the Nazi party: in 1939, the Third Reich began systematically murdering Germans with disabilities in institutions; an estimated quarter of a million people were killed during this“euthanasia” program, at least 10,000 of them children. Stateside, tens of thousands of people with intellectual disabilities wereforcibly sterilizedfrom the turn of the century and into the 1970s. People with disabilities didn’t secure sweeping civil rights, including equal access to employment and housing assistance, until the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 – just one generation removed from present day.“[The use of the R-word] is absolutely historically linked to the understanding that ‘retarded’ children are defective children and that we can eliminate defective children for the good of society,” said Topher Endress, a reverend in Missouri who holds a doctorate in philosophy from Vanderbilt University. His focus is disability theology, including the words used to describe people with intellectual disabilities, and he spends much of his days working with this community. “I mean, that’s the basis of eugenics. I’m a little fearful of seeing this word pop back up because it does have such a strong eugenic connotation,” he continued.Today, approximately7.4 million peoplein the US have an intellectual or developmental disability. Vocational services have connected them to employment in service, healthcare and food industries.Madeline Stuart, a model with Down syndrome and autism, walked her first runway in 2015 after falling in love with modeling at a fashion show.The chef Adam Libby,who has Down syndrome, treats his 2.6 million TikTok followers to cooking demos and recipes (pizza sauce and dough, all from scratch). Stories like these are everywhere, chipping away at the stigma around intellectual disabilities. But this is a highly vulnerable community, and their recent successes have hinged in part on government support systems put in place to foster growth and independence. This progress is still so fragile.Musk, a man who launched aNazi saluteat Trump’s inauguration festivities,has alignedhimself dangerouslyclosely with eugenicist thinking. Musk, who has said he is on the autism spectrum himself, also wields oligarchic power as he attempts toeliminate“unnecessary spending” in the federal government with Trump’s blessing. Early on, Musk set his sights onMedicaid, which was created in part to ensure people with disabilities had access to affordable healthcare. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are looking toslash Medicaid spendingto support Trump’s tax cuts. When the Trump administration temporarily froze federal funds in its second week, programs like vocational rehabilitation and disability housing assistance were put into jeopardy, according to theAmerican Association of People with Disabilities, which condemned the move. One source toldProPublicathat even one more spending freeze could keep their organization from delivering hot meals to people with disabilities.Trump, who has usedeugenicist languageto describe undocumented immigrants,impliedthat February’s deadly plane and helicopter crash was linked to the FAA’s hiring of people with “severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions”, dragging disability into his anti-DEI crusade.And Trump’s pick to run the Department of Education, Linda McMahon, could bedisastrousfor children with disabilities, reports the New Yorker, as the department helps fund special education programs across the US. It’s also likely that McMahon would advocate for school choice, redirecting tax dollars to private schools that are not legally required to accept students with intellectual disabilities.According to Endress, people who use the slur “understand at a deep level that there is a bottom rung to our social hierarchy, and that is intellectually disabled people. And so because the word ‘retarded’ still links to them and pretty much to them alone, it becomes the worst insult you could give somebody,” Endress says.If the government were to withhold care from our most vulnerable, leaving them unhoused and uneducated and without healthcare or employment, it would make it easier to point a finger at them and say: “What a burden.”“It [suggests] you are the worst of the worst … You don’t deserve to be part of our social fabric,” Endress said.Casey works at a Wendy’s in our hometown – he’s been employee of the month twice (I have to brag about him when I can). We talk on the phone weekly, and he recently told me that, unfortunately, someone called him a “retard” late last year. One of his coworkers jumped over the counter and laid into the guy. Again, one person in the right place at the right time.In that way, I see the rise of the R-word as a gauge for how far society is willing to let people like Musk and Trump go. And while I believe that in most reasonable environments, it’s still very much taboo to say the word aloud, the fact that it’s being said by some of the most powerful people in the world, with no recourse, says enough.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityElon MuskDonald TrumpTrump administrationSocial mediaUS politicsRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was the concise verdict of Eléonore Caroit, the vice-chair of the French national assembly’s foreign affairs committee. And the optics of Sunday’scrisis talks on Ukrainebore this out, with Keir Starmer at the very centre of the leaders’ joint photo.“You are back on the scene, of the leadership in Europe,” Caroit told the BBC on Monday morning. James MacClearly, the Liberal Democrat MP who speaks for the party on Europe, was equally adamant,praising the prime ministerfor taking this chance “to bring us back to the heart of Europe where we belong”.So is this a post-Brexit turning point? Is the UK, which since 2016 has become accustomed to watching from afar as European decisions are made, at the heart of the action once more?The slightly unsatisfactory answer is: it depends. There are, however, a few things that seem clear.The first is that Starmer, in his self-declared mission to be a“bridge” between Europe and Donald Trump’s tempestuous America, has made himself a significant player in efforts to ensure a fair and secure peace deal for Ukraine.While the UK prime minister arrived at the White House two days after Emmanuel Macron and was somewhat less ostentatious with thetactile “Trump whispering”than the French president, he was arguablyreceived with greater warmthby the US president.And after his attempts to draw Trump into backing a peace deal were derailed by Volodymyr Zelenskyy’sabrasive treatmenta day later, Starmer tried to mend the damage,receiving the Ukrainian president warmlyin London and speaking by phone to Trump on consecutive days.The other point of general agreement is that in trying to keep a peace plan involving the US on track while also pushing ahead with European efforts at Sunday’s conference in London, Starmer has shown the skills of a natural diplomat.Beyond general cross-party support for his plan, Starmer has been praised by the likes of the Conservative former defence secretaryBen Wallace, the Tory backbench grandeeRoger GaleandSimon Fraser, the former head of the Foreign Office, for, as the latter put it, having “played a blinder in recent days”.But whether this heralds anything more permanent, let alone if it could mark any softening of EU attitudes as Starmer embarks on the longer-term project of easing post-Brexit ties with Brussels, remains to be seen.“Starmer has done it all very well, but it’s partly a question of circumstance, in that the reason London could convene this event is that the EU clearly isn’t the optimal institution to handle all the things that are going on,” said Anand Menon, the director of the thinktankUK in a Changing Europeand professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London.“Brexit didn’t stop us collaborating very closely with the EU overUkraineanyway. The really interesting issue will be when it comes to the economics of defence – that is to say, the money the European Commission is pouring into joint procurement schemes and things like that, because at the moment they are limited to members of the single market.”Western countries must keep military aid flowing to Ukraine, Starmer warnsRead moreEven if the UK decided to take part in joint defence procurement with the EU, Menon added, it seemed unlikely the EU would be tempted to pull back on the red lines it had set out in terms of updating the UK’s post-Brexit relations.“If you’re fighting off populists [in other EU countries] who are saying, ‘We want a looser relationship with theEuropean Union, we don’t want all these rules and regulations,’ what you don’t want to provide them [with] is an economically successful Britain that seems to be getting the best of both worlds,” he said.There are also the domestic political considerations. Starmer has been very clear he hasno plans to relitigate Brexit, and the threat from Reform UK in many Labour seats will sharpen minds still further.But at the same time, it is fair to say that Sunday’s summit showed the definitive end to the immediate post-Brexit era under the likes of Boris Johnson, where, as Menon put it, it was “a politically good thing to be at loggerheads with Europe”.A whole series of international orthodoxies have been overturned by the Ukraine war and now the second Trump presidency. And one of them might be a UK edging further into the European spotlight. On those terms at least, Britain is back.Explore more on these topicsBrexitForeign policyKeir StarmerUkraineEuropeEuropean UnionDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The group’s near-total dominance of the Lebanese state for the past two decades has been weakened by the losses it has suffered in the past year of war.Massive crowds attend funeral of late Hezbollah leader NasrallahRead moreThe war started when Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel “in solidarity” with Hamas on 8 October 2023. Fighting was concentrated near the Lebanese-Israeli border, until Israel dramatically expanded its aerial campaign and invaded southLebanonin late September, leaving more than 3,900 dead across the country and destroying dozens of Lebanese border villages such as Aitaroun.Most of Hezbollah’s senior leadership was killed in the fighting, along with thousands of its fighters, and many of its weapon caches were destroyed.But the damage inflicted on the group has also been felt heavily by the communities in southern Lebanon that make up its support base.In Aitaroun, one of Lebanon’s hardest-hit villages, residents were left wondering if their sacrifices were worth it.Maggie Seyedhassan, a 23-year-old student attending Friday’s funeral, was carrying a picture of her neighbour Abbas. He was killed along with 22 other Aitaroun residents in an Israeli strike on Aitou, a Christian town in north Lebanon where they had taken shelter.“Abbas didn’t want to be a martyr. He had so many things he wanted to do with his life. The price of this war was huge. Why did we have to fight it?” Seyedhassan said.View image in fullscreenFour lorries carry the coffins of the dead through Aitaroun.Photograph: Mahmoud Zayyat/AFP/Getty ImagesAhmad Grube, a 67-year-old farmer and resident of Aitaroun, has been sleeping in a tent after his home was heavily damaged in an Israeli strike. The village has no running water or electricity as a result of damage to public infrastructure.Like others the Guardian spoke to in the border villages last week, Grube had yet to receive compensation from Hezbollah for damage caused by fighting.Hezbollah promised early in the war to compensate anyone who suffered damage. Now, with wide swathes of the country primarily populated by members of its base destroyed, Hezbollah has struggled to find the funds to fulfil its promise and has asked its supporters for patience.“We’re not optimistic at all. The future of our kids, it’s all gone. And we don’t expect to receive the value of the house back,” Grube said.Israel/Lebanon mapLebanon and Hezbollah have looked to the international community for money to rebuild the war-torn country, which has sustained damages estimated to be in the billions. The militia has backed the country’s new government in order to get reconstruction money flowing to Lebanon, despite previously blocking the appointment of the country’s current president.Lebanon’s government has pledged to restore the state’s monopoly on violence and to work towards disarming all militias in the country, a statement primarily directed at Hezbollah.As a condition of the 27 November ceasefire with Israel, Hezbollah has withdrawn its weaponry from its historical heartland south of the Litani River, about 18 miles from the Israeli border.The subsequent fall of the Assad regimeon 8 December in Syria was another loss for the group, which used Syria as a vital lifeline to ferry funds and arms from Iran to Lebanon.The Lebanese army has been active in enforcing the terms of the ceasefire deal. It has been dismantling military assets belonging to the group in south Lebanon and conducted raids in the southern suburbs of Beirut, something unthinkable just six months earlier.Has Hezbollah really been defeated? – podcastRead moreHezbollah has also lost control of key assets such as the Beirut airport and smuggling routes along the Syrian border, both historically key for its cashflow. On Friday, Reuters reported that someone was caught arriving at the Beirut airport from Turkey carrying $2.5m(£2m) in cash apparently destined for Hezbollah.View image in fullscreenThe procession on Friday was one of the largest mass funerals held in Lebanon since the war started.Photograph: Hassan Ammar/APDespite this, last Thursday, Hezbollah MPs endorsed the new government and gave it a vote of confidence.According to a western diplomat in Beirut, Hezbollah is in “wait and see mode”, as it recovers from the war and adjusts to a new political reality in Lebanon and the wider region.“They are playing along because it’s the best option they have. It’s temporary,” the western diplomat said under the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.Experts have said Hezbollah is still the strongest domestic political actor by far – and should not be underestimated. “We’re telling our closest allies, especially the US, not to alienate parts of the population, that’s a recipe for failure. The group is not dead,” the western diplomat said.Explore more on these topicsHezbollahLebanonMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelSyriaIranfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Cannes has felt its presence known more and more in recent years.Last season, The Zone of Interest, Killers of the Flower Moon, Anatomy of a Fall, Perfect Days, Four Daughters and Robot Dreams all turned a Croisette bow into either an Oscar nomination or a win while this year it wasn’t justAnorathat followed the same route. Other big Cannes winners last night included Flow, The Substance and Emilia Pérez, while nominees included The Apprentice, The Seed of the Sacred Fig, The Girl with the Needle and short The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent.With nine wins out of 31 nominations, it’s believed to bea record yearat the Oscars for Cannes movies.It makes for a stark comparison with last year’s Venice film festival. The Brutalist and I’m Still Here might have followed through, winning four between them last night, but big bets such as Babygirl, Queer, The Room Next Door and Joker: Folie à Deux failed to impress the Academy while 5 September picked up only a solo screenplay nom and the Angelina Jolie vehicle Maria scored just one below-the-line nod. There were even fewer wins from Telluride, which takes place just after, with Conclave and Nickel Boys gaining Oscar recognition and only The Wild Robot could find nominations from Toronto.View image in fullscreenBong Joon Ho poses with his two Oscars for Parasite.Photograph: David Swanson/EPAThe swerve toward Cannes grew apparent back in 2020 when Parasite became the first Palme d’Or winner to take best picture since 1955’s Marty. As the first foreign language film to win that Oscar, it also became an emblem of a new, more global Academy. With changes made to the voter base in recent years, more than 75 countries are now represented with 20% living outside of the US. Since Parasite, foreign language Oscar contenders have been on the rise, many of them coming straight from Cannes.There’s an inherent risk in a Cannes premiere with audiences as likely to give you a standing ovation as they are to boo you out of the Palais and, for a film hoping to score with the Academy, a May launch can leave you with nine months of momentum to maintain. But recent years have shown that a longer runway can be a good thing, rubbishing the idea that Oscar films must premiere in the last quarter. Coda was at Sundance in January, Everything Everywhere All at Once was at SXSW in March and Oppenheimer was released in July, all showing the strength of getting into the conversation that bit earlier.For a film like Anora, its place as a frontrunner took a while to establish, given what an odd and for many, underwhelming, season it’s been. It had always been received well but was an unlikely choice for a number of reasons – sex, nudity, 479 uses of the word “fuck” – and felt like a safer bet for Critics Circle and Independent Spirit awards. But its early launch meant that it was allowed the time to slowly make its way around, from Toronto to San Sebastian to New York to London festivals, and as few competitors arrived to challenge, it emerged as one of the most universally acclaimed films of the year and its sharper edges started to soften. It didn’t seem like an Oscar movie on first glance but that very definition has shifted thanks again to a voter base more willing to take a risk. It also made for a notable return to the lower-budgeted new normal of theOscarsafter Oppenheimer made for a more traditional blockbuster winner last year.View image in fullscreenMikey Madison with her Oscar for Anora.Photograph: Burt Harris/PI/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockLast night also saw the Oscars, and host Conan O’Brien, poke fun at the streamers, rewarding films that were theatrically released and giving four awards toSean Baker, the most vocal proponent of the cinema experience outside of maybe Tom Cruise and Christopher Nolan. Cannes has similarly found itself at odds with streamers like Netflix, demanding all films have a theatrical release in order to feature, barring certain titles from a splashy premiere. It’s an alignment that pushes other festivals, without such restrictions, even further away.And the loser is … politics: why was this year’s Oscars so reluctant?Read moreThe big swings being taken by auteurs working on independently financed projects have become what the Academy now seems to reward and while these are still seen at other festivals (Sundance has seen A Real Pain, Past Lives and 20 Days in Mariupol impress the Academy recently), Cannes matches these films with a more glamorous and attention-securing kick-off (not a beanie hat or snow boots in sight). Venice has increasingly opted for bigger Hollywood stars and while Cannes is never immune to the charms of an A-lister in sunglasses, it remains a bit more director-led and it means that this year, all eyes will be on what or who the festival might have to offer.It’s too early to tell, but a recently announced May release for Wes Anderson’s espionage thriller The Phoenician Scheme would suggest a spot on the lineup (the director has previously presented films such as Moonrise Kingdom, Asteroid City and The French Dispatch there) and a summer bow for Spike Lee’s thriller remake Highest 2 Lowest could also see another reunion of director and place. New films from Jim Jarmusch, Lynne Ramsay, Richard Linklater, Terrence Malick and David Lowery may also be in the running but the unexpected nature of what broke out last year means we may not be quite as aware of what’s to follow. After a season when anything seemed possible, who knows what might come next.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAnoraCannes 2024Cannes film festivalSean BakerAwards and prizesFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They can also expect to live longer.“Seventy is a great time for somebody to try something new,” Stokes says. “There can be a lot of unseen benefits.”We spoke with experts about health in the 70s and how to achieve those benefits.What are normal signs of ageing in your 70s?Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, explains that certain medical conditions and functional problems – challenges like decreased mobility and impaired balance – become more common as people age. However, he also notes, there can be wide variability regarding health and appearance among people of the same age.“You can see 70-year-olds who look like they are 50 and 70-year-olds who look like they’re 90,” says Lachs. “It’s very individualized.”Genetics, lifestyle choices and the conditions in which a person lives can affect how they age. It’s also possible for your chronological age – how many years you’ve been alive – to differ from your biological age – how old your body appears – based on biomarkers and how well your body is functioning. Even your organs canage at different rates.How does the body change in your 70s?While there is no “normal” way to age, certain health challenges can be more common during your 70s. By age 75, people typically receive, on average, between two to three medical diagnoses, explains Lachs; these might include arthritis, hypertension and hearing loss.Lachs says that people in their 70s can remain independent and generally healthy, depending on factors such as economic background, genetics, psychosocial environment and motivation to commit to good habits.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The GuardianThe likelihood of hearing loss increases with age, says Lachs, though to what extent depends on the individual. Aboutone in threepeople between 65 and 74 and nearly half of people older than 75 have hearing loss.It’s also possible that your reaction time may slow down, says Lachs, but not to a concerning extent.Seventy is a great time for somebody to try something newJeffrey Stokes, University of Massachusetts BostonPeople in their 70s might also experience sleep issues. Researchsuggestssleep quality decreases as age increases;one studyfound adults older than 60 had a 70% loss of deep sleep compared with people between 18 and 25.However, compared with other decades, the 70s can be a pretty stable time for health, says Dr Deborah Kado, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Stanford Longevity Center. This is especially true for women, the majority of whom already experienced swings of change when they went throughmenopause. There will always be unforeseeable health hurdles, but these can happen at any age; what’s key, she says, is committing to healthy behaviors before you turn 70 and sticking with them after.Which health tests should you get regularly in your 70s?Many health screenings recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK for older adults are framed as guidance foradults aged 65 and older. The free NHShealth checkconcludes at age 74. In part, this lack of guidance explicitly aimed at older ages is due to limited research on the effectiveness of these tests, says Kado. A Harvard Medical Schoolarticleon screening after age 75 also observes that it can be difficult to provide general recommendations because individual needs at this stage can vary.Screenings become more complicated as we age, and knowing when to stop screening can be challenging, Lachs explains. If you have a family history of a disease, it can be helpful to speak with your doctor about what’s right for you and discuss the costs and benefits. For some, a screening could lead to preventative care that increases quality of life. For others, incidental findings may primarily cause anxiety and lead to invasive, minimally helpful procedures.One screening Lachs does recommend for people in their 70s is a bone mineral density test, which measures bone strength and thickness. This test is a tool forearly interventioninosteoporosis, which becomes more common as people age. While men typically lose bone density more slowly than women, both groups lose bone mass at about the same rate by age 65 to 70.Taking care of the grandchildren? No, thanks: ‘I love my obligation-free life’Read moreHe also supports screening for functional limitations, which often involve physical performance tests. If, for example, a screening like this suggests a person is at risk for falling, Lachs can recommend that they work with a physical therapist to decrease that risk.The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a volunteer group of national experts, doesrecommendmen and women be screened for colorectal cancer regularly from age 65 to 75 and for lung cancer between 50 and 80. The USPSTF alsoobservesthat mammograms “work best” at finding cancer in women aged 40 to 74, and it’s not clear how helpful these tests are for women 75 and older.The NHS offers bowel cancerscreeningsfor everyone aged 54 to 74. It​​ also provides lung cancerscreeningsto people who have smoked between the ages of 55 and 74. The NHS alsoinviteswomen aged 50 to 71 to have a breast cancer screening – though women over 71 can still make appointments to screen.Which vaccines should you get in your 70s?Lachs strongly recommends people stay up to date with their vaccines. He speaks with his patients about the increased importance of vaccinating as an older person; unvaccinated older adults are at a greater risk of experiencing severe illness; as we get older, it’s harder for theimmune systemto fight off infections.Several vaccines are recommended for older adults, though it’s important to speak with your care provider about what is right for you. In the US, the NIHrecommendsgetting vaccinated for Covid-19, flu, pneumonia and shingles, and getting the Tdap; the latter is the vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and all adults are advised to get one dose andthen a boosterevery 10 years. The CDCrecommendsRSV vaccines for adults 75 and older, as well as for 60- to 74-year-olds at an increased risk for severe RSV.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’In England, the NHSrecommendspeople over 65 be vaccinated for flu, shingles and pneumonia, and those between 75 and 79 for RSV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, any type of cardiovascular exercise at modest levels will do, including actions like dancing, walking and climbing the stairs. He’s especially a fan of yoga because it helps with balance and flexibility while providing a social outlet.Positive, enriching relationshipsalso strengthen physical and cognitive health, which promotes longevity, says Stokes.There’s no drug better than a good night’s sleepDr Mark Lachs, Weill Cornell MedicineAs people hit 70, they tend to put less effort into casual relationships and invest more into their already closest and most rewarding connections, he explains. Often retired, they focus more on their marriages, kids and grandkids. Being a grandparent who helps out can be especially rewarding because research suggestsstrong relationshipsthat provide asense of purposeare even likelier to imbue health benefits, Stokes explains.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The GuardianBut while people in their 70s are good at focusing on their most rewarding relationships and repairing the benefits, they’re less skilled at creating and fostering new relationships, Stokes says. Targeting this area “can go a long way in reducing some of the loneliness and isolation” that can affect people’s oldest years, he explains. Close ties are great, but it can be even better to have a rich and diverse social network that can support you – especially because bereavement can become more common as we get older.Lifespan can also be improved through diet – less meat and more plants, advises Lachs. A 2025studyfound a combination of consuming foods or supplements rich inomega-3 oilsand vitamin D, combined with exercise, is a recipe for slowing biological ageing.Sleep is important, too. The National Institute on Ageing (NIA) and theNHSrecommendthat older adults get seven to nine hours each night.“There’s no drug I could prescribe that is better than a good night’s sleep,” Lachs says.Is it too late to get fit after 70?Studies suggest that by adopting healthy lifestyle choices, you can “reverse a lot of damage and physiologically even appear younger than you did before you implemented those changes”, says Kado.“This is true for your 70s and beyond,” she says. “You can be in a nursing home in your 90s, start high-intensity interval training, and see over 170% increase in your thigh muscle.”According to the NIA,researchshows that exercises that support endurance, balance, strength and flexibility help older adults maintain muscle mass and stay healthy and independent for longer. The NIA also emphasizes that almost anyone at any age can exercise and offersrecommendationsfor people with chronic conditions. A 2009studypublished in JAMA Internal Medicine found that adults who started exercising between the ages of 70 and 78 were more likely to live longer and be less lonely than adults of the same age who did not.But the reverse is also true. If people don’t engage in behaviors like exercising, their health will likely decline, Kado says. Somestudiessuggest that about 30% of adults over 70 have trouble with walking, climbing stairs and getting out of a chair. These results can be mitigated by exercise.“If you don’t use your muscles, you’re going to lose more muscle and be more likely to lose your mobility,” she says. “This can impact your mood, independence and cognitive ability.”How do you stop worrying about getting older?Thoughts about ageing are often plagued by ageism, says Stokes. This viewpoint causes us to hyperfocus on the negative aspects of ageing, and incorrectly predict what getting older will be like.“There’s an overemphasis on decline,” he says. “People in their 70s often say that they don’t feel old, and the reason for it is that they don’t meet the definition of old we often use.”Further,researchsuggests people with more positive views of ageing are the ones who live longer. Kado describes a more positive view of ageing as a “type of resilience” that helps a person deal with life’s challenges.After being dumped at 58, I realized I was not equipped for the griefRead more“Generally, my older patients who are doing super well beyond their 70s have that resilience factor,” says Kado.We can also combat fears of getting older by embracing the positive aspects of ageing, says Stokes. For example, when it comes to mental and emotional health, people in their 70s tend to be happier and more satisfied than people in their 40s and 50s, he explains. The stress of child-rearing and work is likely gone, and they have a greater capacity to enjoy the good and ignore the bad.“The ultimate irony about ageism is you become the object of your discrimination,” says Lachs. “Find older role models, people in their 80s and 90s, and learn from them.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAgeingHealthGrandparents and grandparentingUS retirementMental healthFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they were also hugely popular – showing the power of ‘I get it’ artJack Vettriano: a life in picturesEddy FrankelMon 3 Mar 2025 11.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.17 ESTShareIn 1992, Jack Vettriano’s painting The Singing Butler was rejected by the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. Anyone who has seen some of the dross picked for display in the RA’s annual open submission collision of amateur artists and big stars in recent decades will be thinking: “Ouch, must’ve been a real dud.” But The Singing Butler not only wasn’t a dud, it went on to become one of the most ubiquitous and – whisper it – iconic British paintings since the second world war.And that tells you a lot about the Scottish artist,who has died at the age of 73. The art establishment has always despised him, but the rest of the world – if you can accept some awkward, problematic conception of “ordinary people” – absolutely lapped up his art. He wasn’t a household name like Tracey Emin or David Hockney. He wasn’t lauded by the art world. He sure wasn’t celebrated by critics. Vettriano was something else, something almost sinful – he was popular.View image in fullscreen‘Contemporary art wants more’ … The TemptressPhotograph: Jack VettrianoHis paintings aren’t classy, or clever, or conceptual. They’re lurid, chintzy, fusty, old-fashioned, conservative and often pretty sexist. He painted people dancing on the beach in 1930s outfits. He painted mobsters and tough guys in suits, “broads” in bras and men polishing muscle cars. They’re paintings commissioned by people who own multiple convertibles; rich, greasy men with three buttons too many unbuttoned.The main issue for snobby art types like me isn’t the work itself. It’s that he lacked a conceptual edge, a sense of irony and any postmodern self-awareness. He didn’t paint sexy midnight trysts between half-clothed women and Brylcreemed men as a comment on gendered power dynamics or as a riff on art historical depictions of the female nude. He painted them because they were sexy. Contemporary art wants more. It wants depth and nuance. It’s not enough to be nostalgic or sexy. But Vettriano’s answer to that is: “Yeah, but it’ssosexy.” And it’s a good argument.That simplicity, that directness that is totally unburdened by shame or embarrassment is the appeal. He sold countless thousands of prints of his paintings to “ordinary people” because the images so effectively communicate their ideas and emotions. These are works of nostalgia, lust, aspiration, love. You look at a Vettriano and you understand it. That’s a powerful thing, a good thing. And one of the problems with contemporary art is that it often requires you to be smart enough to “get it”, but all that does is push people away. Vettriano’s work pulls you in.I had a friend who considered himself a foodie. He was obsessed with ferments, micro-herbs, gels and gastriques, but he’d never, not even once, been to a McDonald’s. How can you love great food if you’ve never understood why so many other people love McDonald’s and everything else at the other end of the spectrum? It’s the same for art – and Vettriano’s paintings are like a double cheeseburger wrapped in greasy paper, precision-engineered to scratch a specific aesthetic itch. They’re not culturally enriching, but they have their place in your artistic diet.View image in fullscreen‘His works tell you what people are really into’ … The Singing ButlerPhotograph: Jack VettrianoThe thing is, you can’t constantly complain that people don’t like Proust and Brahms. Sometimes you just have to find the beauty, or at least the appeal, in Married at First Sight and Banksy. We can learn a lot more from looking for the aesthetic and cultural qualities in “lower” artforms than from outright rejecting them. And Vettriano’s work embodies a battle between “high” and “low” that should have ended long ago, but still tediously rages on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t appreciate these paintings as paintings. I actually think they’re pretty heinous and grim. But I appreciate them for their appeal, for their ability to transcend boundaries, and I like them because other people like them.

Then gangs in various parts of the country clashed outside cinemas – and they began pulling the film’Interviews by Simon BlandMon 3 Mar 2025 10.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.08 ESTShareWalter Hill, directorI thought Sol Yurik’s 1965 novel, The Warriors, would work well as a film but I told Larry Gordon [the producer]: “Nobody will ever let us make it. We’d have to shoot at night in New York, and it doesn’t lend itself to star casting.” I turned it down and went to do a western but the finance fell apart. Larry came back and asked if I was still interested.I didn’t get along with the people who ran Paramount and we got off to a poor start. They saw it as some kind of sequel to Saturday Night Fever. It’s pretty hard to imagine more disparate storylines. The Warriors operates in a dystopian, slightly futuristic, fantasy dream world. The studio never understood that but audiences got it instantly.I wanted Orson Welles to narrate an introduction. His speech was going to last 30 seconds and set up what we were about to see. He agreed to do it – he was broke. However, the studio didn’t want him. They felt an artistic frame would hurt the film’s commercial potential. I thought the audience wouldn’t get the movie without some explanation, but I was completely wrong.This is too dull. Do something!Originally, I proposed casting only racial minorities, like in the book, but the studio didn’t think that was a commercial idea. And, now, I think the fact that all of the gangs are interracial makes the movie more universal – it did well all over the world, much to everybody’s surprise.We shot at night in New York areas where gangs ran things. They’d say: “You’re on our turf and your trucks are fucking up our streets – so pay us.” They were always bribeable. It was $200 a night.The Baseball Furies were inspired by the Furies in Greek mythology. Bobbie [Mannix, costume designer] did some drawings and they were wearing the New York Yankees uniform. I thought it wasn’t quite enough. Somebody said, “Why don’t we paint their faces?” and I thought, “Now that’ll make it really different.”We had a scene where a car was looking for the Warriors who were hiding under a boardwalk. Luther [David Patrick Kelly, playing a rival gang leader] knows this, but there wasn’t anything in the script for him to say. I said: “This is too dull. Do something!” He ran under the boardwalk and got some beer bottles. When we were ready to shoot, he clinked the bottles and said: “Warriors … come out to play.” I said: “Don’t change anything!” That and “You dig it?” are probably the two lines everybody remembers.The film was attractive to gangs. They’d show up at the cinema, see a rival gang they had age-old animosity with and violence would ensue. There were several deaths and that’s always tragic, but it’s hard to blame the movie. We got a lot of criticism from political and religious leaders – almost none of them had seen it. I’m proud of the movie.Deborah Van Valkenburgh, played MercyI read the script and the story jumped off the page, like an action-packed matinee movie that takes you on a rollercoaster ride from bright daylight into a neon cityscape at midnight. Mercy resonated with me and I wanted to play her with all my heart.For my first audition, I remember wearing a pair of black, raw silk trousers and a pumpkin-coloured knit top that my Italian friend Pamela gave me. I thought wearing her garment would lend me some spice but I don’t think it particularly impressed Walter. Something I was doing did attract his attention though – he described me as the “unobvious choice”.View image in fullscreen‘We had chemistry’ … Michael Beck as Swan and Deborah Van Valkenburgh as Mercy in The Warriors.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyAs a kid, my brother had taught me to cluck like a chicken so when I saw Mercy’s first line was a cluck, it felt like destiny. I liked her sense of independence and adventure with an undercurrent of discontent. Her world was seemingly limited and she was perhaps at a crossroads when the Warriors arrived in front of her stoop. She taunted and challenged the Orphans and the Warriors gangs. Her vibe got under my skin.My connection to all the guys was pretty instantaneous and my fondness for everyone immediate. Michael [Beck, played Swan] and I already had a trusting connection before our characters hooked up and Walter assured us we had on-screen chemistry.I fractured my wrist during the shoot on the subway platform. It was harrowing, and the schedule got turned upside down. The scene where I’m suddenly wearing a blue jacket was just to conceal my broken wrist. It gave me more moxie to get the job done, come hell or high water. But it was a tough shoot and physically there were challenges all along the way. We embraced our collective “warrior” in that regard.Audiences would clack bottles together in time to Luther’s ominous call to ‘come out and play’When it opened, I recall being with Marcelino [Sánchez, who played Rembrandt] at someone’s apartment and hearing about queues wrapping around city blocks. It was so exciting. I took my friends to see it in Times Square and clucked for the theatre employees. Audiences would clack bottles together in time to Luther’s ominous call to “come out and play”.Sadly, violence cut our momentum short. It was on its way to becoming a smash hit when gangs in various parts of the country clashed outside theatres and cinemas began pulling the film. We found ourselves defending it in interviews: these altercations weren’t perpetrated by the film but by the energy collecting outside in long lines – the film attracted volatile people. But thinking about the graphic violence in films today, The Warriors is a cinematic dance in comparison, epic and romantic.Whenever I see The Warriors, it’s like watching a home movie. There are throngs of people who watch it routinely like The Wizard of Oz. I’m profoundly grateful.Explore more on these topicsFilmHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today the most glamorous discoveries are a Tesco shopping trolley and an empty can of Sprite – but spirits are still high.“I did once come across a full jar of pickled onions,” said Maureen Readle, a volunteer. “But that was a bit further up. Here it is mostly leaves.”Readle is not wrong. There seems to be tonnes of them lying in the murky water at the bottom of Tuel Lane lock in Sowerby Bridge,West Yorkshire.For the lock to properly function it needs to be cleared, and the only way that happens is for dozens of volunteers to don waders and hard hats and climb down into the freezing cold waters of the Rochdale canal. Once there, they push leaves and other debris for hours along the bottom in shifts.The spring clean began two years ago and is now an annual event, shining a light on the importance of volunteers in keepingthe canal networkgoing.View image in fullscreenDebris is cleared before the busy boating months.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“It is quite hard work actually,” said Andrew Shephard, a retired video game accessory company boss from Cliviger, near Burnley, who volunteers. “This is a complete change to my working life,” he agreed.Unlike many of the volunteers there, Shephard was never a boater. “My daughter got me involved in this about two years ago,” he said. “She said: ‘I’ve found the perfect thing for you. You’ve been in an office all your working life, it’s time to get outside, get some fresh air.’”A normal day volunteering might involve painting lock gates or general tidying and maintenance, so to be inside the UK’s deepest lock was a genuine thrill, he says.Tuel Lane lock opened in 1996, the last link in of the restoration of the Rochdale canal – sometimes known as the Everest of canals because of its steepness over the Pennines – which began in the 1970s after its closure in the 1950s.It is essentially a double-depth lock and is considered one of the most remarkable in the UK, lowering and raising boats by 6 metres (almost 20ft).“There is an absolute magic about it,” said Peter Burton, the lead volunteer. “When you come out of that tunnel it’s like seeing York Minster, it is a real experience. People will come this way just to say they’ve been in the deepest lock. We give them a certificate.View image in fullscreenThe spruce-up is an annual event.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“Because it’s a concrete base, it fills up with leaves and rubbish and debris; it just builds and builds and boats might struggle to get passage. We need to give it a good scrape.”Before the cleanup operation all the volunteers watch a confined-spaces awareness video that warns people: “If in doubt – stay out.” They are reassured that the Tuel lock cleanup is a low-risk venture. No one has been lost, yet.The Canal and River Trust, which looks after 2,000 miles of canals and rivers across England and Wales, said the nation’s canals are more popular than ever, with more boats using them than at the height of the Industrial Revolution. More volunteers are always needed, it says.The spring clean is hard work and it is freezing cold in the water but people are having fun. Readle said she had enjoyed lots of canal holidays over the years so volunteering was a way of giving something back. “When I took part the first time two years ago, I’d never worn a pair of waders before, let alone being waist high in water … but here I am.”Explore more on these topicsWaterWest YorkshireWater industryRiversEnglandWalesNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It made for his most startling music yet – with a surprise Four Tet collaboration still to comeMon 3 Mar 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.31 ESTShareWhen William Tyler put out Goes West in 2019, the album minted what the Nashville-born guitarist calls “an expansive, aspirational part of my life”. It was a prettier take on the crisp heartland Krautrock of his 2016 breakout ModernCountry. Both were released on renowned US indie label Merge, his home after starting out as sideman for Silver Jews and Lambchop in the early 2000s. “I was living in California,” says Tyler, 45. “I was travelling the world. My career was very much upwards.” He embraced it, for better or worse. “From 2017 to 2019, the years I was living in LA, I will fully admit that I was riding a kind of ego-type energy that was probably good for a while, but certainly was apathy for real personal growth.”Goes West was Tyler’s attempt to capitalise on Modern Country, seeing how commercial he could possibly make instrumental guitar music originally informed by Popol Vuh, Public Image Ltd and discordant label Siltbreeze. “But there’s a glass ceiling,” he says now, in his lovely southern accent, speaking from his parents’ house in Nashville. Declining record sales generally meant it only sold as much as Tyler’s second album, 2013’s Impossible Truth. Additionally, he says, “the way I was drinking was moving in a pretty negative direction. Being in your late 30s, your body and mind start not being as resilient to it.”Rehab wasn't One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest  – but it also wasn't The White LotusTyler turned 40 in December 2019. When the Covid pandemic hit the US two months later, he moved in with his parents and “doubled down” on drinking. “I call it a great regression,” he says. “I felt very childlike in a way that wasn’t comforting; I guess some would saychildish, which is true. There were complexes being triggered by substance use, but also the isolation and loneliness.” As a child, Tyler was treated for depression and OCD and diagnosed with Asperger’s. “I was a very isolated kid until I started playing music and joining bands in high school. I didn’t really have something that connected me with other kids my age. I was very insular in a way that wasn’t super confidence-inducing.”View image in fullscreen‘I was riding a kind of ego-type energy’ … Tyler (back row, second from right) in Lambchop in the early 2000s.Photograph: STUART CONWAYLast September, Tyler put out a brief statement saying he was cancelling an imminent UK tour owing to “a mental health crisis and alcoholism”. You don’t have to know all this to hear his forthcoming album, Time Indefinite, and immediately realise that he has been grappling with immense distress. Even as their knowing titles expressed scepticism about US decline, Modern Country and Goes West were bold, frontier-ward records full of giddy, complex playing. The few clear guitar refrains on Time Indefinite chime with nursery-rhyme simplicity, but generally Tyler’s trademark instrument is smeared and stretched through static and distant choral samples in a blasted-out signal-to-noise ratio.He has likened it to guitarist Fennesz meeting writer Eudora Welty; imagine, too, avant-garde composer William Basinski at the state fair. Haunting, beautiful and unsettlingly close, it’s hard not to hear as an obliteration of self. “I think you’re completely right,” says Tyler. “It is a reconfiguration of my identity because that’s what I’ve been feeling.”William Tyler: Time Indefinite Part 1 – videoDespite the heavy subjects, Tyler is endlessly warm and open, an ardent history buff fond of sweeping thoughts that relate the personal to the political. His friend and collaborator, Portland guitarist and friend Marisa Anderson, calls him “a symphonic thinker” and says his new music is “very William: vulnerable in a way you wouldn’t necessarily recognise right away”. You only had to see the support under his tour cancellation post – from Margo Price, Yasmin Williams and Six Organs of Admittance – to see how beloved he is within theAmericanacommunity. And outside it: later this year brings an album with British producer Four Tet (AKA Kieran Hebden), teased by the 2023 single Darkness, Darkness. “He can take an influence like country music, which is quite distant from what I do, but he has a way of combining that with drone music, minimalism, electronic,” says Hebden. “All these things connected with me.”‘There’s a hunger for the next frontier’: the new cosmic AmericanaRead moreYet Tyler says he had always felt like an untrained impostor. His parents are Nashville songwriters but he found his way to music through DIY culture. He seems to feel sheepish that in 2020, he didn’t “sit around playing guitar”, although he and Anderson made the rich, grave album Lost Futures. Otherwise, that first year at his parents’ house, Tyler only had a handheld recording device and his phone, which he used to record guitar parts while immersing himself in fading formats: cassettes, VHS and staticky late-night radio. “I loved the weird disconnectedness of all this,” he says. “It’s actually very comforting.”He preserved his lo-fi recordings as the mood of the album: transparently a harder listen than anything he’s made before, although its sense of decay feels proof of life in our increasingly AI-neutered culture. “I was trying to liberate myself from my expectations about where I was supposed to be going in a career,” says Tyler. “The arts are very aspirational, you have to have a lot of ambition, confidence, momentum, and that disappeared for me for a while. I was tired of this identity and it doesn’t reflect where I’m at, emotionally and creatively.”Time Indefinite borrows its title from a film by Ross McElwee, one of Tyler’s favourite documentarians and a fellow southerner. “That film is very personal but very meandering – it’s about him having a child but watching his father die, all these mixed-emotion, heavy life events happening on top of each other,” he says.” That’s Tyler’s experience of the past four years: pain and joy; growth and loss: “I wanted to convey that emotional reality is not linear.”View image in fullscreen‘A symphonic thinker’ … Tyler in 2013.Photograph: Jordi Vidal/Redferns/Getty ImagesFor Tyler, that stumbling path was “primarily based around alcohol”. Touring since age 20 didn’t help, though he is quick to point out that alcohol misuse is endemic to the normalised pressure we all live with. “I can’t really pinpoint the exact moment where it crossed a line, but it’s been hard for me to tour and not feel hemmed in by it.” Plus, he adds, “like a lot of people – I’m not trying to make an excuse – the 2020s have been very spiritually disorienting for me”, a combination of the pandemic and political upheaval leaving him feeling “very untethered”.Tyler went to rehab last summer, which he calls “a positive experience. It’s hard. It’s not One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” he laughs, “but it’s also not The White Lotus.” He took a class on grief and accepted that its different stages often happen simultaneously. Grieving his old Silver Jews bandmate David Berman, who killed himself in 2019, left him with “complicated feelings about how his legacy was almost instantly shifted into this mythical ‘tragic artist’ zone”; there was also grief for Tyler’s former identity, and “macro-tragic” global shifts.When Tyler was frustrated by his midlife challenges, he used to ask loved ones: “‘Why can’t I just wake up and be the person I was five years ago?’” he recalls. “I was operating in a way that was a little too eager, getting ahead of myself.” Despite his progress last year, when the UK tour was soon to start, he knew he wasn’t ready. “Right after I cancelled, my sister told me, ‘You have to confront why you have this sense of urgency about wanting to resolve things, running out of time. You’re setting yourself up for perpetual anxiety.’ And that really hit me.” Making a public statement about his issues was “to hold me to a better level of accountability. And I have to say it has. It’s why I feel good about moving forward this year.”This is the strangest time that I can remember for being an AmericanTyler says he has found forgiveness and empathy within group therapy, qualities apparently in short supply in Trump’s dark new America. Had he not become a musician, Tyler would have pursued history: he is obsessed with crumbling empires and perceives the US as one of them. He is voluble and precise about this being “the strangest time that I can remember being an American” as scary as it is ridiculous; about “chronic digital loneliness”, individualism, isolation, Republicans jettisoning social responsibility, the right’s weaponisation of counterculture: “It’s not an empathetic model.” (He would make a great professor, and sends links to relevant books after the interview.)Yasmin Williams, folk’s fantastical fingerpicker: ‘Guitar Hero shaped my experimental approach’Read moreTyler is noticeably prone to self-interrogation, conscious of being a middle-aged, white, southern man. He’s always been intellectually curious, he says, and never comfortable with traditional masculinity. While Trump symbolises one such crisis, “I think a lot of men my age feel very lost in whatever this paradigm is that’s changed,” says Tyler. He doesn’t trust anyone who doesn’t question their beliefs, and calls that instinct within himself a sign of optimism. “I’ve never been dogmatic about anything, and that’s anxiety-inducing at times. But while the world is certainly hierarchical, it’s not linear. People’s narratives need to change if you’re going to grow as a human being or a soul. And that can be painful.”Tyler came to realise that “grief outlives its usefulness as a primary emotion very quickly, at least when it comes to things one has no control over,” he says. “It’s painful to imagine a new future when your sense of self has been so shaken, or you’ve had tragic loss, but reclaiming that agency is crucial to a holistic self-actualisation.” He considers himself to be starting again: “There’s a degree of having to relearn how to do this.” He left Merge for the smaller, artist-run label Psychic Hotline and will tour more gently. “I don’t want to retreat any more,” he says. “I would like to re-enter this world that used to bring me a lot of joy, but I have to do it cautiously.”Kieran Hebden and William Tyler: Darkness, Darkness – videoHe calls the Four Tet collaboration a “hail Mary” that came out of asking Hebden to produce an album for him. “I think what intrigued him about working with me was actually some of the things that I might feel more self-conscious about, like my background in country music,” says Tyler. It turned out Hebden’s father loves the 80s country of Tyler’s youth; they’ve covered a Lyle Lovett song. Tyler likens Hebden to Fugazi and the Grateful Dead as “one of the more punk-rock people I’ve ever met in music. That’s a really inspiring model of how to live as an artist, especially when you’ve been doing it for 20 years.” The album is “not what people expect it to sound like, in a good way” – another fresh start.Tyler admits now that he “always fully accepted that none of us get to go back to being who we were – that is a childish sentiment. I don’t really know what’s in front of me. I hope there’s some good stuff, but it is probably going to look completely different from what I imagined.” He mentions Jung’s concept of the midlife crisis, “the transformational opportunity people have at that point where they can either implode, double down on the myth or be open to letting a new myth be born.” The latter, he says, “is where I’m at”.Time Indefinite is released via Psychic Hotline on 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsMusicIndieAmericanaCountryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She rose to international prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s with two albums, Black Diamond and Mahogany Soul, that spawned a pair of popular singles,No More Rainand Wish I Didn’t Miss You.Eight further solo albums displayed Stone’s command not just of soul but of gospel, R&B and funk, often in collaboration with other songwriters and artists, includingPrince(U Make My Sun Shine, 2001), Snoop Dog (I Wanna Thank Ya, 2004), Anthony Hamilton (Stay for a While, 2004) and Betty Wright (Baby, 2007).Stone had first come to light in the late 70s as a member of the Sequence, a pioneering hip-hop trio whose much sampled 1979 singleFunk You Upis generally cited as the first rap record released by an all-female group.Once the Sequence disbanded she spent a number of years struggling for a further breakthrough until she became a member of the R&B trio Vertical Hold in the early 90s and then released Black Diamond in 1999, after which she never had to fight for recognition again.Angie Stone performing Wish I Didn’t Miss YouStone’s rich vocal dexterity on Black Diamond drew comparisons withChaka KhanandGladys Knight, and the album made it to No 46 on the US charts, eventually selling close to 1m copies. Its standout track, No More Rain, which portrayed the defiant upswing in mood that often follows the emotional depths of a break up, reached No 1 on the US Adult R&B single charts and made a big splash in Europe, too.In similar but more vulnerable vein, Wish I Didn’t Miss You, from Mahogany Soul (2001), made an even greater impact in various parts of the world, including as a Top 30 hit in the UK. The album, which peaked at No 22 in the US, also generated four other singles and contained a version of Curtis Mayfield’sMakings of Youthat became a sublime staple of her many live shows.Stone was born Angela Brown in Columbia,South Carolina. An only child, she grew up with her mother, a nurse, and her father, a cab driver, in the city’s Saxon Homes housing project, where she sang in the local Baptist choir and was a keen cheerleader at CA Johnson high school. She was academically successful, a good athlete and a notable basketball player.View image in fullscreenAngie Stone, left, with Patti LaBelle on stage in New Orleans in 2008.Photograph: Lee Celano/ReutersWith two other members of the cheerleading squad, Gwendolyn Chisholm and Cheryl Cook, she had begun to write her own stock cheers, and in time their rap-like material took on a more musical direction, encouraging them to form the Sequence.Fans of the Sugarhill Gang, one of the early rap outfits that had emerged from the New York area in the late 70s, in 1979 they blagged their way into a Gang gig in Columbia, where they found themselves backstage singing their own compositions to the group’s manager,Sylvia Robinson.She was so impressed with Funk You Up that she had them in a recording studio within a few days, and the song swiftly became a landmark release in the first wave of “old school” hip-hop. According to Rolling Stone magazine, “in a 70s landscape where the few rap records that existed were chorus-free rhyme marathons, the Sequence seamlessly mixed singing and rapping, unwittingly paving a lane for artists such as Lauryn Hill, Drake and Future”.Over the next six years the Sequence toured widely alongside the Sugarhill Gang, making three albums and releasing 10 singles. But they were unable to recreate the success of Funk You Up, and in 1985 they split when Stone refused to renew what she saw as an exploitative contract. By that time she had married the rapper Rodney Stone from the group Funky 4 + 1, and had taken his surname.Earning money by writing songs for other artists, including Jill Jones, Mantronix andLenny Kravitz, she supplemented her income by working as a factotum at Kiss-FM radio station in New York, where she eventually met the musicians Willie Bruno and David Bright, with whom she formed Vertical Hold. Although the group disbanded in 1995 after two albums, they had a US R&B chart hit in 1993 withSeems You’re Much Too Busy, which was co-written by Stone and Kurtis Khaleel.By then divorced, in the second half of the 90s Stone co-wrote songs with the emerging R&B singer D’Angelo (Michael Archer), with whom she had started a long-term relationship, until the years of hard slog finally culminated in a solo recording contract that led to Black Diamond and much wider acclaim.View image in fullscreenAnthony Hamilton and Angie Stone at the Soul Train awards in Las Vegas, 2012.Photograph: Jeff Bottari/Invision/APStone’s most commercially successful albums were her third,Stone Love, in 2004, which reached No 14 on the US charts, and her fourth,The Art of Love, in 2007, which made it to No 11, after which she continued to release new collections of material at regular intervals until her final album, Love Language, in 2023.In the later part of her career, however, some of Stone’s attention had turned to acting, including onBroadwayas Mama Morton in the musical Chicago (2003) and with small roles in movies such as The Hot Chick (2002), The Fighting Temptations (2003), Pastor Brown (2009), Scary Movie V (2013) and Ride Along (2014).Apopular live artist, she was due to be touring the UK this year. The road collision that led to her death took place in Montgomery, Alabama, as she was returning from a concert in nearby Mobile.She is survived by a daughter, Diamond, from her marriage to Stone, a son, Michael, from her relationship with Archer, and two grandchildren.Angie Stone (Angela Laverne Brown), singer and songwriter, born 18 December 1961; died 1 March 2025Explore more on these topicsSoulPop and rockHip-hopSouth CarolinaRapNew YorkBroadwayobituariesShareReuse this content"

A camera that could detect your gestures and replicate them on-screen in a game, the Kinect allowed players to control video games with their bodies. It was initially a sensation, selling1m units in its first 10 days; it remainsthe fastest-selling gaming peripheral ever.However, a lack of games, unreliable performance and a motion-control market already monopolised by the Nintendo Wii caused enthusiasm for the Kinect to quickly cool. Microsoft released a new version of theKinect with the Xbox One in 2013, only for it to become an embarrassing flop; the Kinect line wasunceremoniously discontinued in 2017. The Guardian reached out to multiple people involved in the development of the peripheral, all of whom declined to comment or did not wish to go on record. Instead, the people keenest to discuss Microsoft’s motion-sensing camera never used it for gaming at all.Theo Watsonis the co-founder ofDesign I/O, a creative studio specialising in interactive installations – many of which use depth cameras, including the Kinect. “When the Kinect came out, it really was like a dream situation,” he recalls. “We probably have 10+ installations around the world that have Kinects tracking people right now … The gaming use of the Kinect was a blip.”View image in fullscreenAssistants demonstrate the game Kinect Adventures for Xbox 360 during a media briefing in 2010.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni / Reuters/ReutersWatson speaks about the Kinect, which turns 15 this year, with rare relish. (“I cannot stop talking about depth cameras,” he adds. “It’s my passion.”) As part of the collaborative effort OpenKinect, Watson contributed to making Microsoft’s gaming camera open-source, building on the work of Hector “Marcan” Martin. It quickly became apparent that the Kinect would not, as Microsoft had initially hoped, be the future of video games. Instead, it was a gamechanger in other ways: for artists, roboticists and … ghost-hunters.The Kinect functions on a structured light system, meaning it creates depth data by projecting an infrared dot cloud and reads the deformations in that matrix to discern depth. From this data, its machine learning core was trained to “see” the human body. In games such as Kinect Sports, this allowed the camera to transform the body into a controller. For people making interactive artwork, meanwhile, it cut out much of the programming and busywork necessitated by more basic infrared cameras.“The best analogy would be like going from black-and-white television to colour,” says Watson. “There was just this whole extra world that opened up for us.” Though high-powered depth cameras had existed before, retailing at about $6,000 (£4,740), Microsoft condensed that into a robust, lightweight device costing $150 (£118).Robotocists were also grateful for an accessible sensor to grant their creations vision and movement. “Before it, only planar 2D Lidar information was available to detect obstacles and map environments,” says Walter Lucetti, a senior software engineer atStereolabs, which is soon to release the latest version of its advanced depth-sensing cameras and software. The 2D Lidar detects objects by projecting a laser and measuring the time the light takes to reflect back; the Kinect, however, could create a detailed and accurate depth map that provided more information onwhatthe obstaclemay be and how to navigate it. “Before Kinect-like sensors,” Lucetti says, “a tuft of grass was not perceived differently from a rock, with all the consequences that entails for navigation.”This type of depth camera now powers a host of autonomous robotics, including2020’s Perseverance Mars Rover’s AutoNav system, and Apple’s facial identification tech. (Apple bought PrimeSense, the Israeli company behind the Kinect’s structured light system, in 2013.)View image in fullscreenNasa’s Mars Perseverance Rover in 2020.Photograph: Nasa/UPI/REX/ShutterstockThe Kinect’s technology was soon eclipsed by freely available open-source sensors and more advanced motion-sensing devices. But since Microsoft ceased manufacture of the Kinect line in 2017, the little camera has enjoyed a spirited and not entirely un-troubled afterlife. It haswatched over the Korean demilitarised zoneand worked on topography and patient alignmentin CT scanners; reports have emerged of it being used in airport baggage halls, as asecurity camera in Newark Liberty International airport’s Terminal C(United Airlines declined to comment on this), and even togamify training for the US military. It’s been attached to drones, rescue robots and even found a brief application in pornography.“I’m not sure anyone had a firm vision of what interactive sex involving the Kinect would be,” says Kyle Machulis, founder ofbuttplug.ioand another member of the OpenKinect team. The camera was deployed mostly as an over-complex controller for 3D sex games, fulfilling “more of a futurist marketing role than anything of actual consumer use,” Machulis says. In that role, it was successful: it attracted a flurry of attention, and threats from Microsoft to somehow ban porn involving Kinect. It was an interesting experiment, but it turned out that the addition of a novelty device was not a turn-on for many porn users. Besides, as Machulis says, when the camera malfunctions, “it looks pretty horrible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They deploy its body tracking to find figures the naked eye cannot see. Ghost hunters are thrilled by the Kinect’s habit of “seeing” bodies that aren’t really there, believing that these skeletal stick figures are representations of disembodied spirits.The paranormal investigation industry doesn’t care much about false positives, so long as those false positives can be perceived as paranormal – which is just as well, says Jon Wood,a freelance science performerwho has a show devoted to examining ghost hunting technology. “It’s quite normal for ghost hunters to be filming themselves in the dark, with infrared cameras and torches. You’re bathing the scene with IR light, while using a sensor that measures a specific pattern of infrared dots,” he says. Given that Kinect is designed specifically to recognise the human body in any data it receives, it would be stranger if the Kinectdidn’tpick up anomalous figures in this context.There’s a certain poetry in the Kinect living on among those searching for proof of life after death. In the right hands, the camera is still going strong. Theo Watson points me in the direction ofConnected Worlds, an exhibition that has run in the New York Hall of Science since 2015. Of the many Kinect devices that power the installations, only two have had to be replaced in the decade since it opened – and one of those was only a few weeks ago. Watson started stockpiling the device when Microsoft ceased production.“Half the projects on our website wouldn’t exist without the Kinect,” he says. “If we had this camera for another decade, we would still not run out of things to do with it.”Explore more on these topicsGamesSurveillancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

After a long-awaited review, ministers must put this rightMon 3 Mar 2025 09.19 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.47 ESTShareIf you’ve seen porn in recent years, you’ll know it’s grim out there these days. Incest and strangulation are rife, as is coercion, racism, and alsosexual violence. It’s front and centre on mainstream porn sites and many social media platforms, pushed by recommendation algorithms on a drive to maximise engagement and profit. It’s a world away from the days when “hardcore” porn meant an erect penis. But we might be on the brink of change.Last week thelong-awaited independent porn reviewled by the Conservative peer Gabby Bertin was published, marking the biggestreview of pornographyregulation in more than 40 years. Its findings amount to a clear indictment of what counts as porn today and the inaction of successive governments to do anything to fix it. It was a Labour government which first brought in the extreme porn law in 2009, recognising the need for a step-change in how we regulate pornography. It’s now time for the next great step forward, and it’s one that will be integral to the success of the government’s mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade.The public appetite for regulation has shifted. For a while, many believed that a hands-off approach to regulation would strengthen our sexual freedoms and protect our right to privacy. In reality, it’s done the opposite. Most pornography today suppresses our sexual freedom. What we watch is driven largely not by user choice and preference but profit-driven AI recommendation algorithms that have learned we are drawn to material that invokes disgust, shock and rage.Our privacy rights have been trampled by multinational porn conglomerates who have had free range to mine some of our most intimate data to feed these algorithms. Onestudy of over 22,000 porn sitesfound that 93% of them were sending user data to at least one third party, often without users knowing.We have started to recognise the impact of this across much of our other online activity. In 2020, a review intobias in algorithmic decision-makingcommissioned by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, found that racist and sexist attitudes are not just reproduced butproducedby recommendation algorithms. And the information commissioner has now launched an investigation into how social media platforms are using data generated by children’s online activity toserve them content.This is partly how we’ve got to a place where so much online porn promotes and perpetuates harmful, violent, misogynistic and racist tropes. The porn platforms themselves are implicated in producing these preferences, pushing men andincreasingly womenfurther than we would otherwise go.While Lady Bertin’s report doesn’t delve deep enough into algorithmic decision-making on porn sites and its impact on our freedom and privacy, it does provide a blueprint for what needs to change. Its most important recommendation is the establishment of parity between what is regulated offline and what is regulated online. It also suggests that platforms are mandated to adopt specific safety-by-design measures, via the development of a safe pornography code in the Online Safety Act, or a new publications offence. Alongside this, it recommends that pornographydepicting incestor strangulation should be made illegal under the extreme pornography act, and that the Home Office is the natural home for pornography policy, creating a clear route for oversight and accountability and ending the “pass the buck” approach to regulation that has dominated debate so far.The report also contains a passing mention of support for device-level age verification, if the measures to restrict children’s access to porn sites in the Online Safety Act prove ineffective. Far from a simple difference, this shift significantly alters who is responsible for keeping kids safe; from the platforms that profit from their access, on to parents and carers who would have to keep them away from any verified devices. It isn’t a better option, and it definitely isn’t a safer system; unsurprisingly, the porn platforms prefer it, because it would do less harm to their traffic.On publication of the report, the governmentannounced they will respondto each recommendation in due course. The review marks the kind of opportunity we would say comes once in a lifetime. Except it has come before. As prime minister in 2013, David Cameron announced that,when it comes to porn, “what you can’t get in a shop, you shouldn’t be able to get online”. Twelve years later, Lady Bertin’s first recommendation is the same: that pornographic content that is illegal to distribute in physical formats should also be treated as illegal content on online platforms. It’s taken us over a decade to end up in the same place. It’s not that we don’t know what needs to be done. We just need this government to finally step up and actually do it.Clare McGlynn also contributed to this articleFiona Vera-Gray is a professor of sexual violence at London Metropolitan University and co-director of the Child and Woman Abuse Studies UnitClare McGlynn is a professor of law at Durham University and expert on the legal regulation of pornographyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s not just aboutsaving Ukraine, or defeating Russia, or how to boost Europe’s security, or what to do about an America gone rogue. It’s about a world turned upside down – a dark, fretful, more dangerous place where treaties and laws are no longer respected, alliances are broken, trust is fungible, principles are negotiable and morality is a dirty word. It’s an ugly, disordered world of raw power, brute force, selfish arrogance, dodgy deals and brazen lies. It’s been coming for a while; the US president is its noisy harbinger.Take the issues one at a time. Trump is a toxic symptom of the wider malaise. For sure, he is an extraordinarily malign, unfeeling and irresponsible man. He cares nothing for the people he leads, seeing them merely as an audience for his vulgar showmanship. His undeserved humiliation of Ukraine’s valiant leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was, he crowed, “great television”. As president, Trump wields enormous power and influence. But Potus is not omnipotent. America’s vanquished Democrats are slowly finding their voice. Connecticut senator Chris Murphy shows how it should be done. Don’t bite your lip. Don’t play by rules Trump ignores. When Trump tried toblame diversity hiring policiesfor January’s deadly Potomac midair collision, Murphy hit back fiercely.“Everybody in this country should be outraged that Donald Trump is standing up on that podium and lying to you – deliberately lying to you,”Murphy fumed. Trump was at it again when he mugged Zelenskyy last week. But it is not passing unchallenged. Street protestsin Britainandthe USfollowed. A campaign gathers pace to block Trump’s plannedUK state visit. Opinion polls show growing opposition.It seems strange to talk about “resistance”, as if a Nazi-style wartime occupation is under way. Yet resisting Trump is what our leaders must do. The world’s most admired democracy is held hostage by a far-right clique of thugs and chancers. Its leadercalls himself “king”and talks of a presidency for life.Elon MuskandSteve Bannonraise stiff-armed salutes. European neofascists drool adulation from afar.As the US retreats, Europe must look out for itself – so is Macron’s nuclear offer the answer? | Simon TisdallRead moreTrump’s minions attack or subvert the agencies of government, the judiciary and free press, terrorising and intimidating those whose loyalty they impugn. Their propagandists, so-called tech barons, have a reach Joseph Goebbels would envy. And just like Vladimir Putin, Russia’s dictator, JD Vance, Trump’s loudmouth hitman, fights a regressive, anti-democratic culture war for “Christian values” and a narrow, bigoted orthodoxy.Ukraine, despite Trump’s betrayal, remains the epitome of resistance. The Ukrainian people are fighting for freedom, sovereignty and democratic self-determination. The issue is simple. Since the US cannot any longer be relied upon, Europe’s leaders know what they must do: supply more and better weapons for Kyiv, such as Taurus missiles; provide more humanitarian aid and finance, obtained by seizing$300bn in frozen Russian funds; and collectively raise their defence spending. From leaders such as Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, we need less polite subservience and morehonest defiance.To be effective, European leaders need to put concerted pressure on the US government to provide credible, long-term security guarantees forUkraineand a backstop for any force that the UK and Europe deploy to monitor the ceasefire. It’s reasonable to expect the US to support a European peace initiative. If it does not, an open rupture with Washington should not be dodged. Equally, they need to put more pressure on Russia, too, to halt its daily slaughter and bombing in Ukraine’s cities. Putin could stop this war today – after all, he alone started it. The fact he refuses to do so is proof, if it were needed, of Zelenskyy’s contention that he cannot be trusted in anything he says. He must be squeezed further.Right now, the opposite is happening. Military analysts warn that a gleeful Kremlin, encouraged by western discord, may step up its offensive in the east and try to capitalise on Ukraine’s demoralisation, perhaps even reinstating Putin’s original plan to seize the whole country. To deter such scenarios, EU leaders, meeting again in Brusselson Thursdayafter their London weekend talks, must finally bury their differences and draw a line.Starmer says that he and Macron are nowdeveloping a plan. Good. The leading European Nato powers should demand an immediate halt to all fighting in Ukraine and Kursk. They should launch a peace process inclusive of all interested parties, without preconditions or prior concessions. If Putin balks, they must withdraw their diplomats, close borders with Russia, move to interdict its exports, mobilise their armed forces – and set a deadline for providing defensive air cover for all unoccupied Ukrainian territory. Russia must be reminded that the west has teeth, too – and will, if forced, resist Putin’s unlawful aggression with everything it has got. Enough of Trump’s scaremongering nonsense about a third world war. Putin is a mass murderer, not a mad murderer. He’s also a coward.Given Trump’s treachery and threats to cut military aid, only a strong, united Europe stands a chance of preventing Ukraine’s defeat on the battlefield. Were Ukraine forced to capitulate to a Kremlin deal and lose its sovereignty, it would set a disastrous precedent for free people everywhere, from Taiwan and Tibet to Moldova, Estonia,Panamaand Greenland.Marco Rubio, Trump’s obsequious secretary of state, spoke revealingly last month about his vision of a 21st-century world dominated by the US, Russia and China, and divided into 19th-century geopoliticalspheres of influence. It was necessary to rebuild US relations with Moscow, Rubio argued, to maintain this imperious tripartite balance of power. This is the partitioned future that awaits if Trump’s surrender strategy prevails and he and Putin carve up Ukraine.Such a global catastrophe was foretold. In his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell describes a nightmare world divvied up between three great empires or superstates, Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, which deliberately stoke unceasing hostilities. Their shared characteristics: totalitarianism, mass surveillance, repression, immorality, gross inhumanity. Sound familiar? Annalena Baerbock, foreign minister of Germany, a country that knows much about fascism, past and present, recently said that a “new era of wickedness has begun”. Ukrainians, under occupation, are only too familiar with the evil that has descended upon their heads. This is the violent, lawless dystopia towards which the Americans in the Oval Office are leading us. Unless they are stopped. Unless we fight. Unless Europe resists.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationKeir StarmerVladimir PutinEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

It also sidesteps the safeguards we have to prevent calamitous decisionsMon 3 Mar 2025 10.49 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 13.09 ESTShareYour humble civil servants are watching with fascinated horror as our terrified prime minister tries to secure the guy ropes for a rapidly shrinking UK tent, in the hope that it can survive geopolitical storms from the east and west.Spare a thought, then, for the one government department that has repeatedly found itself politically outside that tent and does so again now – theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO).Since stumbling out of the ashes of theBoris Johnson-propelled mergerin 2020 between the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Foreign Office, the hits have just kept on coming for the FCDO’s diplomats and aid workers. There has been theabandonmentof the longstanding 0.7% aid target, a shambolic withdrawalfrom Afghanistan, Donald Trump’s gleefulevisceration of USAid, and last week’s savage and historic cutto the development budgetfrom 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, swiftly followed by theresignation of Annaliese Dodds, its well-regarded international development minister.And their reward for enduring all that? Being conscripted into last week’s “rather fraught” operation to help the PM to cosy up to Trump – the very leader who, according to Dodds, hasprovided the blueprintfor the gutting of their own department. Yet, the most heart-breaking bit for FCDO’s 17,000-odd staffmay be to come, according to the Institute for Government, as they decide how exactly to follow the instruction and axe myriad projects, many of which help deliver life-saving interventions in the world’s poorest countries.I’ve spoken to current and former FCDO employees about Keir Starmer’s decision, and their reaction to the speed and scale of the cut has been one of shock and disorientation. It’s not just that slashing aid in order to spend more on defence will prove to be wrong and self-defeatingmorally,diplomaticallyandeconomically. It’s not even that this decision is soul-destroying in its frightening implication – based on thegrim consensusshared with the likes of Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch – that the civil service must now get behind a national effort to beat ploughshares into swords. After all, civil servants are forbidden from publicly endorsing the recent boos and brickbats against the policy issued by Romilly Greenhill of theinternational development network Bond, David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee,Halima Begumof Oxfam and other prominent charity leaders. We are required by law to implement the policies of the government of the day. And we have no problem with that.What alarms civil servants ishowthis decision was made. First, its timing: there is no serious alternative to the idea that it was made – sweetened by the offer ofyet another state visit– primarily towin favour with Trumpahead of the PM’s visit to the Oval Office. This was a blood-offering, a libation, a lubricant offered to a petulant demigod in the hope that mirroring the orange genie’s recent decision to gut USAid would help get Sir Keir tofirst base with the Donald. As civil servants, the fawning, the grovelling, the coquettish simpering to power, was very hard to watch. What’s next, prime minister, an invitation to No 10 for apersonalised hydrotherapy session?More worryingly, the decision to reduce aid spendingdown to a 25-year lowseems to bypass the usual checks and balances that, in the British system, helps to mitigate the executive making terrible decisions. Judging by theconcerns raised by ministersand most of the parliamentary Labour party’s various factions,there was little cabinet discussionof the decision and no serious assessment of the impact of this particular decision. Combine that with a lack of parliamentary scrutiny and the PM’s side-stepping of the pesky inconveniences presented by thecomprehensive spending reviewlater this year and the politically troublesome prospect of revisiting tax and borrowing rules, and what we see is a riot of red flags. Or orange ones.View image in fullscreenBritish Army personnel load humanitarian aid on to military plane in Jordan, April 2024.Photograph: Cpl Tim Laurence Raf/ReutersThe extent to which aid spending is a Good Thing isn’t really the point – on this subject you will find a diversity of opinion among the UK’s half a million or so civil servants, the vast majority of whom work outside London and have never darkened the gilded stairways of King Charles Street.But most civil servants, reluctantly or not, have felt nothing but pride in #UKAid, even after –as I wrote back in 2019– the Conservative government decided to fold DfID into the Foreign Office like a Fabergé egg into a dusty satchel. The British public, too, haveshownthat they, like their American cousins, broadly support aid spending in the national interest, and don’t think we should follow the US lead to drastically reduce it. Starmer will need to be very careful that, in pursuing a “Trump, baby, Trump” strategy, he doesn’t widen analready growingdemocratic deficit.In the meantime, don’t be surprised if you see FCDO’s civil servants – with their admirablehistory of whistleblowing– follow the lead of their doughty USAid counterparts, who are alreadyfastidiously documentingthe domestic and international impact of the suspension of American aid spending. The truth is out there, and they’ll know where to look.The author works for the UK civil serviceExplore more on these topicsCivil serviceOpinionKeir StarmerForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But as I have changed, so has my algorithmMon 3 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 16.20 ESTShareFor almost my entire life I hated how I looked.I was by no means unhealthy but a youth spent playing video games and eating heaping mounds of white rice meant I was far from the models, superheroes and movie stars I looked up to.One day my doctor said that while I was still within acceptable levels of body fat, I could stand to lose some centimetres around the waist and drop a few kilos.Gym, eat, repeat: the shocking rise of muscle dysmorphiaRead moreTo say the motivation there was solely health-related would be a lie. I am after all a gay man and it’s no secret we have always idolised the kind of male body that spends five days a week in the gym. According to research,physique, apart from race and income, is one of the major sources of compare-and-despair anxietiesfor gay men. If my experience on Grindr has taught me anything, it rarely mattered what you had to say or even how handsome you were – the bigger the muscles and leaner the abs, the more attention you got.So it was on these fertile but perhaps not the most mentally healthy grounds I began my fitness journey. I tracked all my calories. I substituted chicken thigh for breast. I weighed every gram of rice I ate. I started hitting the gym five to six times a week. I lifted heavy and walked more.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAnd after a year or so I was seeing results. I had dropped kilos and put on muscle. For the first time, I didn’t hate what I saw in the mirror. I noticed my face was thinner and I filled out the top of my shirts instead of the bottom. Some of my pants were suddenly too big. A follow-up visit to the doctor’s two years after I started exercising confirmed I was now within the waist size I had aspired to.I felt like I had a new lens on life. I looked at all my meals in terms of their macro nutrients – the protein, carbohydrate and fat content. Food and drink that lacked any protein suddenly no longer appealed to me. I stopped having a snack break at work. I stopped drinking altogether.As I changed, so did my algorithm. While thirst traps and fitness influencers had always had a home on my FYP (for you page), the flood was yet to come. My new online reality informed my subconscious that this image of masculinity was what I wanted.Physique inflation has set in: think back more than two decades to 2002, when Tobey Maguire was Spider-Man. A fateful spider bite not only gave him the powers of a spider, it gave him muscles. A new chest, abs, arms and shoulders. He was ripped.Now, when I look at my socials feed, bodybuilders and fitness influencers could stand up to the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger in size and shape. Maguire’s transformation, considered remarkable for the early years of the 2000s, is now barely above average by today’s expectations.

And why do my chest insertions look like that?‘Why are my biceps so small?’ The boys and young men turning to steroidsRead moreIt’s no surprise to me then thatso many young men in Australia are dissatisfied with their bodiesand that thousands of students are hopping on performance- and image-enhancing drugs (PIEDs). There’s a whole category of slang that comes with it – gear or juice, as the kids call it. Some congregate on a Subreddit dedicated to discerning whether someone is on juice or is a natural athlete – or natty as they call it. But it’s almost impossible to tell who is on gear on social media. There’s every likelihood they are genetically gifted athletes – able to put on muscle and stay lean all year round – but it’s just as likely they turned to PIEDs for their step up.I sometimes stand in front of the mirror wondering if I will ever achieve the body I’ve always dreamed of.

How can a flawed reorganisation be a priority?Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.18 ESTShareWhy? That’s the mystery. Why go through the upheaval of amighty local government reorganisation, merging hundreds of district councils with the counties above them, when it will exhaust capacity in already overstretched and near-bankrupt councils? It wasn’t in Labour’s manifesto – and its electoral system for mayors will do Labour untold damage.It’s baffling to watch the government struggling with abolishing districts and reordering unitary councils, for no practical or political purpose. It looks like a displacement activity: everyone knows financially crippled councils need relief from the social care crisis, and reform of the hated council tax system in which Buckingham Palace pays less than an average house in Hartlepool. But this busy deckchair-shifting avoids those. Nor is there very much devolution in it.Former Tory local government minister Eric Pickles was George Osborne’s axe-wielder, who nitpicked officials over the cost of their biscuits at meetings. But he saidone wise thing: “I’ll have a pearl-handled revolver waiting in my drawer for the first civil servant who suggests another local government reorganisation.” Even so, abolition of district councils was begun by the Tories, with Labour completing it.For example, in 2018 Dorset shrank nine councils into two, and cut councillors from 333 to 158. I have no idea how many councillors there should be, or the right size of councils, but Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics, the great expert, says no one else does either, not even him. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.”England’s patchwork quilt of different-sized councils is untidy, but it hardly matters. Clumps of unitaries will be joined together to form combined authorities, mostly under directly elected mayors with more power over local transport, skills, housing and infrastructure, but no new money. Mayors are a good thing, identifiable champions of their region, with “king of the north” Andy Burnham the great exemplar. Tracy Brabin, Ben Houchen and Steve Rotheram are similar local galvanisers. But introducing more mayors never needed this reorganisation. A seasoned former Labour council leader and minister speaks for many when he tells me: “All this change won’t deliver a single new hospital ward, new affordable home, additional police officer or fill a pothole in the road.”Politics requires parties and parties need grassroots that bind people together through selecting and campaigning for local council candidates. Parties with few local councillors tend to wither away. With waning trust in politics, the local matters. In polls since time immemorial, people like their local councils and councillors better than their MPs: voters trustcouncillors twice as much(though they are lazy about actually voting for them).But Britain has relatively few elected representatives, “way out of line in councillors per head of population, with 19,000 councillors, while the French have 36,000 councils, yescouncils,” says Travers. Ours have been vanishing fast: “From 75,000 councillors in 1965, only 14,000 will be left after this.” The white paperactually boaststhere will be “fewer local politicians”, hardly encouraging political engagement. One aim is to save money but House of Commons libraryresearch finds: “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.”Each unitary must have a minimum population of 350,000, most to be 500,000. (That’s the size of Malta,which has 68 local councils.) Long lists of towns and cities with fewer than 350,000 people are being swept into larger areas of suburb and countryside. Look south of the Midlands and these include scores of Labour or Liberal Democrat councils, such as Reading, Oxford, Cambridge, Exeter, Ipswich and and more. Once subsumed into unitaries, then into clumps of counties, anxious Labour number-crunchers warn not a single southern mayor will be Labour or Lib Dem. Remember, these Tory/Reform mayors will control housing: what about Labour’s 1.5m homes? Brighton and Hove is typical: once swallowed into deep blue East and West Sussex, that mayor will be Tory/Reform.Almost half of England’s councils ‘could face bankruptcy over £4.6bn deficit’Read moreThe genius architects of all this haven’t (yet) reversed the Tories’ great gerrymander, when they imposed first-past-the-post elections for mayors and police and crime commissioners. If mayors were elected on the previous supplementary vote system, where you can mark your second choice, no mayor gets chosen without 50% of the vote. It obliges candidates to appeal beyond their own party, seeking second choices. Tories wanting that Sussex vote would need a candidate acceptable to Brighton’s second choices.This policy feels drafted by the type of heroic cartographers responsible for colonial-era maps, neat lines and population counts, regardless of people, places, politics or identity. Scores of towns will be swept into shires they share no identity with. It’s not too late to put a freeze on this. Leave districts in place while a royal commission considers the great multitude of real local government problems, including council tax. Introduce mayors, but elected on the original system so candidates appeal beyond their tribe.A government letter commands everywheresubmit unitary plans this month: they must “meet transition costs over time from existing budgets”. This is a puzzlingly bizarre waste of effort for a government confronting herculean tasks wherever it looks. Labour MPs are just waking up to all this, especially the voting fiasco: time to reach for that pearl-handled revolver.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But that’s exactly how capitalism worksBrett ChristophersCompanies will never solve the climate emergency alone. The impetus for change needs to come from governmentMon 3 Mar 2025 12.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 21.07 ESTShareIt would be very easy to be sharply critical of BP, given its sudden volte-face on its environmental commitments. Under pressure from a shareholder, Elliott Management, it hasabandoned the green ambitionsit announced in 2020 and pivoted squarely back to an overwhelming focus on oil and gas.While easy, it would arguably be unhelpful, and perhaps even misguided. Because viewed in the round, this isn’t really about BP: it’s about capitalism at large, and its inability to respond to the climate crisis in the manner we need.One thinker who would probably have been somewhat sympathetic to BP isKarl Marx, surprising though that may seem. Marx understood market competition as what he termed a “coercive law”, whereby individual companies are forced to act in certain ways because of their competitors’ behaviour. Competition, he said, compels companies to maximise profits on pain of succumbing to stronger rivals – or, as in the case of BP, to activist shareholders such as Elliott Management.It stands to reason that BP has refocused on fossil fuels: oil and gas production is simply muchmore profitablethan renewable energy. “No capitalist,”Marx wrote, “ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no matter how much more productive it may be … so long as it reduces the rate of profit.” He could just as well have been talking about the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. The CEOs of firms such as Exxon have been telling financial markets exactly the same thing for years.Like it or not, BP doesn’t have the luxury of saying: “Oh, we’ll do something less profitable but better for the planet.” Capitalism chews you up and spits you out if you do that. “Shareholder value” is not a consulting gimmick, or at least not only that; it is a very real disciplinary force.All of this, to be clear, is not to absolve BP of responsibility. Rather, it is to make a case about how we should understand the problems we face – that is,notas a problem of greedy individual firms, but a system rigged against positive change.“The problem,” the political economistGeoff Mann has written, “is not that capitalism is a conspiracy of greedy people. The problem is that capitalism, as a way of organising our collective life, does its best to force us to be greedy – and if that is true, then finger-pointing at nasty CEOs and investment bankers may be morally satisfying, but fails to address the problem.” Substitute “greedy firms” for Mann’s “greedy people”, and this was exactly Marx’s point about capitalism and its coercive powers. Private individuals do not make history under conditions of our own choosing, but neither do businesses.In short, the problem is not BP or indeed any other individual company. The problem is that BP and its fossil-fuel peers operate within a system thatrequiresthem to invest and operate in ways that are deleterious to the environment.In the half-decade after the 2015 UN climate change conference in Paris, European governments briefly talked a good game about taking actions – even up to thestranding of hydrocarbon assets– that might actually make fossil-fuel production less profitable in the medium and long term. Hence why BP, Shell and others then started making plans to transition into cleaner energy. They wanted to be ahead of the curve, or at any rate, not too far behind it.But since 2020, governments have shown that it was in fact just talk. Most notably, they have continued to issue licences for new oil and gas production at near-record rates, despitebeing toldby experts that such licences are fundamentally incompatible with plans for net zero emissions; Norway alone has issued more than 100new production licencessince then. It is this miserable government appeasement that has emboldened BP and the rest to abandon their transition plans. Elliott, the activist shareholder in BP’s case, merely forced the issue; putting Marx’s “coercive law” into practice.It is entirely within the power and purview of governments to change this situation for the better; either by making fossil fuels less profitable, or by making renewables more profitable, or both. For example, robust carbon taxes would hobble fossil fuels, or more generous electricity tariffs would inflate returns on renewables.But what is economically straightforward on paper is politically fraught in practice: either of those courses of action would result in the one thing that sitting governments will never actively countenance, especially given the electoral experiences of recent years: namely, inflation.And so, for now at least, we appear to be stuck. Because it is the crucible of fossil-fuel extraction and combustion, the energy system is at the heart of the climate problem. For as long as it remains beholden to the profit motive, it’s hard to see us resolving our predicament.In the summer of 2007, Citigroup’s chief executive, Chuck Prince, explained why he was investing in sub-prime mortgages (just prior to them blowing up the global financial system): the sub-prime business was still profitable, and all his competitors were still in the game. “As long as the music is playing,”Prince said, “you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.”Two decades on, the music of the hydrocarbons is still playing, and BP is still dancing.Brett Christophers is a professor in the Institute for Housing and Urban Research at Sweden’s Uppsala University and author of The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the PlanetDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hollywood is as scared of the world right now as you and I areEmma BrockesPerhaps the Ozempic was making people light-headed, or the stars felt they should stay silent. Either way, there was a notable lack of politicsMon 3 Mar 2025 11.48 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.27 ESTShareTheOscars ceremonyon Sunday night was long and boring, as it has been for a few years, but this year its shortcomings landed differently. Hollywood’s waning influence, which registered most glaringly last month in the large number of American nominees who showed up in London forthe Baftas– not something they were inclined to do in better times – gave the ceremony a sense of low-stakes irrelevance that was frankly a relief from the rest of the news cycle. Still, the question lingers as to why the actors and presenters largely, and mercifully in my view, stayed away from mention of Donald Trump.After thedevastating wildfiresin Los Angeles in January, the classy thing to have done this year would’ve been to cancel or at least radically downsize the Oscars ceremony, but of course no one involved was going to vote for that. Instead, audiences were treated to a muted spectacle celebrating movies with record-breakingly small box-office returns, includingThe Brutalist, in which Adrien Brody relived the US postwar construction boom in real time, andAnora, one of the lowest-grossing best pictures of all time, about an exotic dancer whomarries a rich Russian. (What could be behind the deep and abiding fascination of straight male directors – and novelists, and podcasters – with the “sex worker community”? That’s right, it’s altruism.)In 2017, in the wake of Trump’s first ascent to the presidency, there were many fiery speeches from the Oscars podium, among them Jimmy Kimmel’sopening monologue, which was dominated by Trump content; a defence of immigrants led by the actor Gael García Bernal; and the director Barry Jenkins entreating those in need of help toreach out to the ACLU. This year, by contrast, there was almost nothing: a decent Anora-related joke by the host, Conan O’Brien, about Americans being “excited to see somebodyfinally stand up to a powerful Russian”. The actor Zoe Saldaña referring pointedly to her immigrant parents. And some criticism of the US government by the Israeli-Palestinian team behind No Other Land, the winner of best documentary.If it’s cowardice, it’s not of the ordinary kind. At the 2017Oscars, there was a running gag about Meryl Streep and Trump premised on the then popular idea that Trump was a big dummy who fluked his way to the White House. That tone doesn’t work now. In fact, given the five-alarm fire of American politics, comic flippancy about Trump has to be calibrated more finely than the broad, bland platform of the Oscars is perhaps designed to accommodate.There is also the question of Hollywood’s role in the collapse of the Democratic vote. This is probably delusional thinking, but there may have been a grain of humility – or at least of self-interested awareness – in the decision by wave after wave of Oscar-winning actors on Sunday not to use the podium to make political points. Looking back at the Kamala Harris campaign, which relied heavily on A-list Hollywood support, the conviction that celebrities swing votes or win hearts has never been less popular or assured. Some in the auditorium on Sunday may even still be in recovery from the failure ofTime’s Up(remember that?), a dog’s breakfast of a movement in which Hollywood’s leading ladies leveraged their fame for an admirable cause that somehow ended up with Amy Schumer mugging for attentionon the Capitol steps.‘Don’t worry, I’m lawyered up!’: the best quotes of the 2025 OscarsRead moreI feel for public figures in a way: damned if they do, damned if they don’t. After Sunday night, the film industry looks craven and weak – on the other hand, as Ricky Gervais memorably pointed out when he hosted the Golden Globes in 2020: “You’re in no position tolecture the public about anything. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.” No one needs Adrien Brody’s thoughts on anything outside acting – and even that, let’s face it, is a drag.And yet, given the customary willingness of actors and directors to espouse political causes, the silence on Sunday has added to the clanging, baffling sense in the US of: where, exactly, is the dissent? Why aren’t people screaming? (JD Vance and his family did have to be moved to a secret location while on a skiing holiday in Vermont last week because of the numbers whocame out to protest.)Perhaps all the Ozempic in the room had made people light-headed. Perhaps the lack of politics was pregamed. Producers said ahead of the ceremony that the telecast would focus on the ways in which film-making requires “community and collaboration”, which sounds a bit like Jeff Bezos’scommitment to “personal liberties”on the op-ed pages of the Washington Post. Only the actor Daryl Hannah, who managed to throw a V-sign and say: “Slava Ukraine!” to cheers from the crowd, failed to get the memo.The takeaway is that, in Hollywood as elsewhere, people are scared, not only because Trump is petty and vindictive but also because the vast uncertainty of the world we’re suddenly in can make judicious silence seem more sensible than speeches. Where that tips into capitulation – and whether Hollywood, like the tech and media industries, will give us our era’s version ofLeni Riefenstahl– remains to be seen.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsOscarsOpinionAwards and prizesAnoraThe BrutalistDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Dr Dash is less zealous than she used to be, she said, and better at listening. But the doctor and management consultant, who has just been appointed chair of NHS England, has lost none of her determination to make the health service better and more productive.How this boost will be achieved is the multibillion-pound question. The upcoming10-year planis Wes Streeting’s chance to turn Labour’s manifesto pledges, and consistent poll lead on the NHS, into policies that could help his party win a second term.But the conditions in which he must do this are hugely challenging. The UK has anageing and increasingly ill population, and a health system which, while it performs reasonably well compared with other countries, has ingrained weaknesses. Some of these are to do with theworkforce, with shortages in some areas anddissatisfaction with paythat makes further strikes likely.Long-term underinvestment means technology and infrastructure are not what they should be. Thelack of social care provision, and failure by successive governments to tackle this, adds significantly to pressure on GPs and hospitals. Since health is devolved, most of Mr Streeting’s decisions affect only England directly, though many of the problems are the same – notably long waiting lists and population health issues, including obesity.In broad terms, Mr Streeting has already set out his reforms. These involve three shifts: from analogue to digital, from hospitals to community, and from treatment to prevention and public health. But conjuring up a vision of change is easier than delivering it, or persuading staff and the public to believe it can work.Technology is the easy bit, although plenty of things could still go wrong. Mr Streeting’s recent announcement that the new GP contract will includemore online booking, and the continued rollout of the NHS app, are modernisation measures that make obvious sense. Health tech businesses are eager partners, though campaigners are right to point to the risks of allowing them to access the NHS’s unique datasets.Moving healthcare from hospitals to neighbourhood and community settings is an even trickier proposition. It is one thing to endorse this as a concept. But with hospitals under huge pressure fromwaiting lists, restive staff and a lack of investment, there is certain to be conflict over the extent to which spending is redirected away from the acute trusts that now absorb themajority of health budgets(59% of the total in England in 2022-23).In an ideal world, new local services would be built up in parallel to existing ones. This is known as “double running”, but costs money that no one expects to be forthcoming. Hence the high hopes placed in efficiency savings, including recently announcedcuts to NHS England itself.Of course, clarity about who does what is desirable, and duplication of roles between civil servants should be avoided. Ambiguities about the remit of integrated care boards need to be ironed out. But how to allocate resources, and whether the NHS’s priorities are really going to be reoriented towards prevention, are political decisions that, in the end, will be taken by ministers. Change is far more likely to be incremental than sudden. The truest words Dr Dash spoke to MPs were when she said “this is hard”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago – and to keep doing so.”That this needed saying underlines the extent to which Donald Trump’s administration is laying waste to decades-old assumptions governing transatlantic relations. Appearing to prioritise a reset of the US relationship with Russia over international law and the unity of the west, Mr Trump ispursuinga peace deal with Moscow on Vladimir Putin’s terms. At the same time he is seeking to plunder Ukraine’snatural resources, while demanding obeisance and gratitude from Kyiv in return.For the sake of Ukraine, which has fought with such bravery forthree yearsto resist Mr Putin’s illegal invasion, and for the sake of its own future security interests, Europe’s response needs to be unified, robust and ambitious. In that respect, the Londondefence summitconvened by Sir Keir Starmer on Sunday was a useful start, but multiple uncertainties remain.The bullying and taunting of Mr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office meant the conference rightly became an occasion for a counter-display of emotional solidarity, embodied in the bear-hug the Ukrainian president received from Sir Keir in Downing Street. Substantively, however, Europe’s strategy for dealing with an unpredictable and ideologically hostile White House is a work in progress.Alongside much-needed commitments to boost military assistance to Ukraine, Sir Keirannouncedthat a “coalition of the willing” would be created to deter Russian violations of any future peace deal. By presenting their ownplansfor a ceasefire, significantly increasing defence spending, and pledging “boots on the ground” to police a peace agreement, European leaders aim to persuade Mr Trump to offer the US security guarantees that are indispensable if such a force is to be deployed.For this balancing act to have a chance of success, as yet unidentified Nato members will need to step up alongside Britain and France with substantial troop contributions, and relations between Kyiv and Washington will need to be patched up. Achieving the latter will be anything but easy. But Mr Zelenskyy’saffirmationon Sunday that he remained willing to sign a minerals deal with Mr Trump represented a recognition of this grim necessity.The prospect of Kyiv being bounced unwillingly into a ceasefire without guarantees, as Mr Trump licenses a territorial carve-up to reward Mr Putin’s murderous aggression, is intolerable. Through diplomacy in Washington, but also through military assistance on a scale that will require more flexiblefiscal rulesin Brussels and in national capitals, Europe must build on the London summit to give Ukraine agency and a voice in determining its own destiny.More broadly, the evidencemountsthat as Mr Trump seeks to forge a new understanding with Mr Putin’s revanchist regime, he is indifferent to the impact on European security and interests. As Sir Keir commented at the close of Sunday’s summit, Europe stands “at a crossroads”. Strategic autonomy, and far greater sovereign capability, will be needed to navigate the challenging route ahead.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As a former TV commissioner, I have been asked to conduct investigations into editorial misdemeanours. In every case it came down either to a member of the production team having not been straight with the producer, or the producer not being straight with the broadcaster.No matter how much small print is added to the contracts between broadcasters and producers, nothing works in factual programming without trust. Factual programmes throw up myriads of unforeseen problems that must be resolved between the film-makers and the broadcaster. But having resolved them and made the appropriate editorial changes, including adding missing information, these programmes were then broadcast without further issue.Unless there is some unresolvable issue with it,Gaza – How to Survive a War Zonemust be put back on BBC iPlayer, with appropriate changes, as soon as possible so we can all see it and judge it for ourselves.Peter GrimsdaleFormer commissioner, BBC and Channel 4Last summer I was Save the Children’s interim response team leader inGaza. I watched Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone when it was still on BBC iPlayer. In many respects, it accurately portrayed what it was like to be in Gaza during active hostilities. In 20 years of humanitarian work, it was the hardest response to which I have been deployed.The documentary centred on three children who were clearly affected by what they were experiencing, and who showed courage and resilience in the face of horror. But the film gave a misleading impression, as the situation depicted for two of them was more privileged than that of the great majority I met. It gave the impression that the lives children were facing in Gaza were better than they actually were.The controversy around the film distracts attention from the plight of hundreds of thousands of children suffering harm in Gaza.David SkinnerSevenoaks, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We must seek talent from a wide and diverse pool, and discussions on how to make the profession more accessible are important and welcomed. However, the headline of your recent article, which focused on class rather than socioeconomic status, is misleading (Only 5% of UK medical school entrants are working class, data shows, 27 February).The Sutton Trust study mentioned uses a simplifiednational statistics socioeconomic classificationmethod to determine an applicant’s class, based on their parents’ occupation. This approach places a social worker and barrister in the same category without any reference to the salary they receive. More context is needed, a fact recognised by Ucas, which stopped collecting household occupation data as an indicator of socioeconomic classification in 2021.While parental occupation undoubtedly affects an applicant’s ability to access resources for a successful medical school application, broad descriptors of class fail to capture the full picture. Such generalisations can harm a young person’s aspirations and ability to see themselves as a future doctor. A more accurate tool for understanding an applicant’s background isindices of multiple deprivation, which consider several factors that contribute to socioeconomic deprivation – for example, health, school performance and living conditions.Medical schools are working hard to increase the representation of disadvantaged students, with a goal of 33% of students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2032 – around 6,000 students annually. Achieving this target requires sector-wide collaboration, and it is crucial that the nuances of widening participation are properly communicated, both in efforts to address the issue and in the broader public discourse.Dr Katie Petty-SaphonCEO, Medical Schools CouncilI grew up in Knowsley, Merseyside, in a single-parent household, but despite a tough working-class start, I passed the 11-plus exam, which was to become the gateway to another world. Aged 16, with good O-level grades, I asked my then GP for advice on how to apply to medical school. He informed me that people from my environment didn’t go to university. This was in 1977, and it seems that attitudes in university selection panels have made little progress.I did go to university and became a reasonably good GP. I worked hard for an appreciative rural population and I was well liked. The current application system to, and the cost of, medical school means that I would have no chance of success if I were to apply now. The most important attribute I had from early on in my career was resilience, an essential quality for workers in the modernNHS.My concern is that medical schools in the 21st century fail to select candidates who show signs of such an attribute. Perhaps candidates from working-class backgrounds would be more likely to display these qualities and go some way to remedying the atrocious retention problem we have in the NHS. In large part this is due to the recruitment of high-graders, groomed by parents and schools for medical degrees, who don’t have and will never have the qualities required to tough it out in a very demanding career.Dr Carl DarbyStorth, CumbriaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We have to be fully prepared, then we have a good chance to beat them. It will be a tough game against a young team with a strong coach. But I believe in our team and we have to play at our best. When you hear the Champions League anthem, it gives something special.\"PSV have not kept a clean sheet in their last seven Eredivisie matches, conceding three against Go Ahead Eagles. However, Peter Bosz, the manager, said he has no plans to adapt his side's aggressive style which has helped them score in every home game this season.\"I already indicated last year that defending starts with attacking,\" he said. \"We immediately put pressure on the ball, which allowed us to win it back quickly and often did not have to defend at all. Football is a complex sport. You cannot point to one single aspect. It is a combination of many factors that have to come together well. It is often small details that prevent us from winning matches. We are working intensively to improve those details and I am responsible for that.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked how they could turn things around, Timber said: “I don’t see it as negative but we’ve been through a lot, especially the last couple of weeks, but it’s a challenge for us and we have to take it. We have to score tomorrow, we have to win and in the Champions League you only have two games so you don’t get second chances, so we have to go for it in this game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the end, only one moment truly mattered and that was Matz Sels’ penalty shootout save from Jack Taylor to sendNottingham Forestinto the FA Cup quarter-finals at Ipswich’s expense.George Hirst and Ryan Yates exchanged goals in the second half of normal time, when the game finally came to life, but no one could source a winner prior to the shootout after a forgettable extra time.Nottingham Forest v Ipswich: FA Cup fifth round – liveRead moreThe spot-kicks were exceptional from both teams until Taylor could not find the corner and the Belgian goalkeeper got behind it to set up a trip to Brighton, a sideForest recently beat 7-0, in the next round.“I am really, really happy,” said the Forest manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, who could not bear to watch the shootout. “We have so many hopes in theFA Cup, we want to go as far as we can. Winning on penalties puts you on a high. They were good penalties.“Matz was amazing for us. It is a good moment, it is important for the club to give it a go. We have to focus on the Premier League but the FA Cup will always be on our mind. We proceed on our journey together, the fans made a big noise for the penalties, it helped our penalties and distracted the Ipswich players.”View image in fullscreenThe England manager Thomas Tuchel (top row, second right) was in the stands at the City Ground but didn’t have many potential England players to monitor.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersIt is only the second time Forest have reached the final eight of the competition in the past 29 years. When Hirst headed home the opener after 53 minutes, the prospect of them doing so looked bleak, because by that stage the hosts had struggled to find their rhythm and test the Ipswich goalkeeper, Alex Palmer.The England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, was in the stands, although his viewing pleasure was somewhat diminished. Nuno and the Ipswich manager, Kieran McKenna, faced difficult selection choices with Forest enjoying an unlikely battle for a Champions League spot and Ipswich scrapping for survival at the other end being their main focus. The consequence of this was 14 changes between the two teams from their most recent outings and the disjointed opening 45 minutes was proof of the struggle.Forest came alive only after Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson were sent on to inject energy into the team and the crowd. It had been a quiet night at the City Ground with little to cheer, although they were treated to some drama as the full-time whistle approached.The upside to Hirst’s goal was that it highlighted that Forest needed to improve to avoid sleepwalking out of the FA Cup. The home side were stirred into life and were level soon after when Anthony Elanga swung in a cross for the captain Yates to head home. It gave the hosts not just an equaliser but the confidence to search for a winner.Forest now had the momentum and they were the only side with a chance of winning in the 90 minutes. Yates headed in again but it was rightly ruled offside, while Murillo forced Palmer into a stunning save and Callum Hudson-Odoi thwacked the bar with a shot from the edge of the area to ensure an additional half hour was required.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Really challenging night in so many aspects. It came down to a tiny margin.”Sels had gone the wrong way for the previous four penalties, but that is irrelevant and Forest are one step away from Wembley.Explore more on these topicsFA CupNottingham ForestIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Someone else wrote: “Give that girl a burger.”Liz responded in an ­Instagram post, saying: “We come in all shapes and sizes, they ­obviously do not understand that being an elite ­runner brings lower body fat but being an idiot and not fully ­understanding that your body needs to be fueled ­properly by eating or your body will not ­perform especially for marathons.”She said her 34-year-old ­daughter was “strong enough” to shrug off the negative comments, but added she was concerned for younger ­athletes. “Stop the jealousy and abuse of women athletes online by posting ridiculous and stupid comments as above. My concern as a parent is not for Eilish as she is of a strong enough character to deal with these people my concern is for other kids, athletes that are not so strong of character to deal with demeaning and abusive comments on their appearance.”Others were quick to back up ­Eilish when she reposted her mother’s message. “You are an inspiration,” one supporter wrote on Instagram.

Other than Amorim, the other three worked between 1914 and 1931. Sunday’s FA Cup exit against Fulham, admittedly, did not contribute to that. It was possible, even, in the aftermath of a penalty shootout defeat, to argue it had been one of United’s better recent performances. They’ve only lost two of their previous eight games. But it’s also just 3 March and United already have no chance of winning any domestic competition this season.Manchester City aside, the FA Cup is now pleasingly free of superclubs; any of the other seven quarter-finalists would relish a rare trip to Wembley in May. None of those other seven have won anything since Villa won the League Cup in 1996. This is a season in which the competition will have a real sense of meaning something, which might be a sign of the strength of the Premier League’s middle, or of the struggles of the elite, or a one-off caused by a combination of draw and calendar.Fulham’s sensible plan punishes a fading institution with stubborn tactics | John BrewinRead moreFor United, all that remains is the Europa League – and Real Sociedad will provide stiff opposition in the last 16 on Thursday. But to this United, so would anybody. The club now also has the task of closing a 10-point gap on Brighton and Bournemouth that might get them into at least the Europa Conference League for next season. Winning the Europa League, quite apart from the emotional boost of a trophy and a night of celebration in Bilbao in May, would also bring qualification for next season’s Champions League and an injection of about £160m, desperately needed for a club that lost £113.2m last year, and which over the last three years has lost almost three times the £105m permitted under Profit & Sustainability Regulations. Certain aspects of that can be discounted for PSR calculations which means United are unlikely to be in breach in this window, but the situation is far from healthy.A year after buying a quarter of the club and taking over management of the football side of the business, Jim Ratcliffe’s reign has been notable for job losses and penny-pinching that has devastated morale, removing minor perks from staff, upping ticket prices and withdrawing concessions, while at the same time indulging in costly reshuffles of the directorial classes. The executives get huge salaries and payoffs for turning the richest club in England into a laughingstock; the ordinary worker lives in fear of the sack and sees theirlunches turned into fruit or soup and breadwhile the office is being warned over its excessive use of tape. Welcome to modern capitalism.Manchester United consider early termination of lease on Kensington offices to save moneyRead moreAs United sank to eighth last season, their worst league finish since 1990, the FA Cup offered rare cheer. There was theabsurd 4-3 victory over Liverpoolin the sixth round, with Amad Diallo’s 120th-minute winner, and an almostequally ridiculous penalty shootout winagainst Coventry in the semi, losing a 3-0 lead and then seeing their opponents have a late winner ruled out for a marginal offside. Then there was a far better performance in the final, a controlled 2-1 win over Manchester City that offered enough apparent reason for optimism that, despite the club interviewing various potential replacements, kept Erik ten Hag in the job until October. That was also a decision that cost £14.5m in paying off his contract and the loss of the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, plus an additional £180m in transfer fees for players who may or may not – mostly not you’d have to say at this stage – fit how the new manager wants to play. But, you know, mind how much tape you’re using on that.At least any decision on Amorim’s future can be made without the emotional complications of a euphoric afternoon out at Wembley – although frankly it’s very hard to know what it can be based on. Sunday may not have been too bad by recent standards but it wasn’t good. United were reduced to playing on the counter at home againstFulham, while conceding from a corner for the 13th time this season. Chido Obi showed promise from the bench, but already there was the sense of the familiar United cycle beginning: an exciting 17-year-old burdened with the expectation to be overplayed and broken in the way so many possible messiahs have been over the past decade.FA Cup fifth round: talking points from the weekend’s matchesRead moreThere was a widespread acceptance that in learning an entirely new system under Amorim, United would have to get worse to get better. The first part of that, at least, has been achieved. But United are 14th in the league, which would be their worst finish since they were relegated in 1974. Is there any sign things are getting better? Is there any reason beyond blind faith and the lack of an alternative to think this will end well? And, perhaps most pertinently of all, would you trust Jim Ratcliffe and his politburo to be able to discern it if there were?On this day …View image in fullscreenGary Crosby used his head in an unusual way for a memorable goal.Photograph: ITVNottingham Forest v Manchester City, 3 March 1990. Gary Crosby, the Forest winger, made a run in from the left flank, hoping to get on the end of a cross from the right from Garry Parker. But Andy Dibble, the City goalkeeper, claimed the cross and Crosby’s run was for nothing. His momentum took him off the pitch and, crucially, out of Dibble’s eyeline. Dibble waited, letting everybody get up field before he launched a long kick into the Forest half. Thinking his box was empty, he relaxed, holding the ball on the palm of his right hand. But Crosby was still jogging back. As he passed Dibble, he leaned in, nodded the ball off his hand, and knocked it into the empty net.The referee Roger Gifford allowed the goal, determining that Dibble no longer had it under control. The convention was that, once a keeper had taken it in two hands, it was under his control until he had cleared it – essentially to prevent players trying to nick it off him as he tossed it up to drop-kick. Dibble’s act fell into a grey area – although it’s almost certain the goal would not be allowed today. Forest won 1-0, but both teams finished in midtable.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, said at the time: “To this date, we don’t have a global club competition for women. We need to give players an opportunity to perform on the global stage and to develop themselves in all the continents of the world.”A men’s club World Cup was launched in 2000, known then as the Fifa Club World ­Championship, and this summer, in the US, it becomes a 32-team quadrennial competition, with Manchester City and Chelsea the Premier League’s two representatives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The draft takes place next Wednesday, with a total of 37 places to be filled in the men’s side and 29 in the women’s squads.Anderson hinted at his interest shortly after swapping his England whites for a consulting role on the coaching staff, saying: “Watching the Hundred this year, seeing the ball swing around, it makes me feel like I could do a job there. There’s definitely a bit of intrigue with the shorter formats because I’ve not played any franchise stuff before.”When the competition first launched, Anderson was notionally affiliated in a non-playing capacity to Manchester Originals – whose home ground of Old Trafford boasts the James Anderson End – but that link was never formalised. The Originals have five spots open in the squad – ranging from the top £200,000 pay bracket to a spot at £63,000 – and space for a senior pace bowler in their ranks.A host of capped England players are up for grabs, including the likes of Jason Roy, Dawid Malan, Rehan Ahmed, Zak Crawley and Dan Lawrence, while there could be interest in rising stars like Rocky Flintoff, Archie Vaughan and Ben McKinney. For those registered in the draft but unsuccessful this time, there is another chance to be picked up as a wildcard signing later in the season.Explore more on these topicsJimmy AndersonThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Her Game Too, which launched in 2021, will take the lead on providing support to victims of abuse.The campaign comes after a significant increase in reports of sexism in recent seasons.Research from Kick it Outhas shown that more than half of all female fans (52%) have experienced or witnessed sexist behaviour or language on match-days, but a striking 85% of those people said they had not reported the incident, with many believing it would not make a difference.“We are delighted to be joining forces with Kick It Out officially,” said Caz May, the CEO of Her Game Too. “They have an extremely experienced team dedicated to handling reports, and with Her Game Too being run by volunteers, it makes sense to spread the workload across both organisations. Her Game Too will still be on hand to support victims, offering face-to-face or virtual meet ups with our ambassadors and advisers across the country.”Explore more on these topicsFootballKick It OutnewsShareReuse this content"

Delia Smith no longer on Norwich’s board after takeoverNorfolk Holdings completes majority takeoverSmith and husband Wynn Jones step down from boardPA MediaMon 3 Mar 2025 16.14 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 17.49 ESTShareNorfolk Holdings has completed its majority takeover ofNorwich City, with Delia Smith and her husband, Michael Wynn Jones, no longer part of the club’s board.It was announced in August that Norfolk Holdings, led by the Milwaukee Brewers owner, Mark Attanasio, was set to increase its shareholding to around 85%, which would result inSmith and Wynn Jones stepping downas directors and becoming honorary life presidents.A statement from Norwich on Monday evening confirmed the change in majority shareholder, with long-serving duo Smith and Wynn Jones now holding a 10% stake in theChampionshipclub.“Norwich City Football Club can confirm that Norfolk Holdings, the group led by Mark Attanasio, have completed the conversion of the entire D Preference Shares into Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis,” a statement read.“As a result, Norfolk Holdings now owns approximately 85% of the club’s ordinary share capital, withDelia Smithand Michael Wynn Jones holding 10%, and the remainder being held by the club’s other shareholders.“The club’s board of directors remains consisting of Mark Attanasio, Richard Ressler, Tom Smith and Zoe Webber.”‘A message to the best football supporters in the world ... we need a 12th man here. Where are you? Where are you? Let’s be having you. Come on!’ Delia’s half-time speech became legendary.Celebrity chef Smith and Wynn Jones have been shareholders at Norwich since 1996, but Attanasio bought a 15.9% stake in 2022. Last April it was increased to 40.4% and Attanasio’s Norfolk Holdings group now owns “approximately 85%” of Norwich, who are 11th in the Championship but still in the mix for the playoffs despite a run of one win in five.Smith’s rallying cry of “let’s be having you” and “where are you?” at half-time during Norwich’s clash with Manchester City in February 2005 remains one of the most famous speeches of the Premier League era.Norwich’s then majority shareholder took the field with a microphone after watching her side pegged back to 2-2 after taking a two-goal lead. Smith’s call to arms did not inspire a second-half winner for the Canaries, with City sealing a 3-2 win.Explore more on these topicsNorwich CityDelia SmithChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK has committed to plant 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of trees each year by 2025 and maintain the rate until 2050, the European Commission has pledged to plant 3bn trees across member states by 2030, and the US under the previous administration committed to planting 1bn trees by the same date.But the types of trees that are needed, and where to plant them, are decisions that have to be made now, though future conditions remain uncertain.The study suggests the risks of future tree planting and the economic risk of its failure could be mitigated by adopting the approach of financial investors, who spread risk across a portfolio of companies by choosing assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities to strike an efficient balance.Environmental economists at Exeter University say there are significant risks of converting farmland to forests in a future of climate change and economic uncertainty, such as large-scale tree planting displacing agriculture and affecting food security, depending on where it takes place.But an “investment portfolio approach” to tree planting, which combines climate risk with economic risk, is the best, most cost-effective way of removing carbon if careful choices are made about which trees to plant where, the researchers said.Frankie Cho, a PhD graduate from the University of Exeter and the lead author of the study, said: “One problem is that, because it is unclear what countries round the world will do to tackle climate change, we don’t know how challenging the climate will be in the future.“If climate change is extreme, broadleaf trees in the southern UK offer the best carbon removal – but that’s prime farmland and could be really costly under certain economic futures.“If climate change is milder, planting conifers on less productive land makes more sense, but those trees will not grow well if conditions are more extreme. The problem is that we don’t know what the future holds and can’t be certain which type of trees we need to plant and where.”Diversifying species and locations for tree planting would minimise the danger of betting on the wrong future, ensuring tree-planting decisions remain resilient in the face of uncertain future climatic and economic conditions, the study,published on Mondayin Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says.Cho said previous studies have examined the risks posed by either climate or economic variables in isolation, but the risks were inherently interdependent and correlated. The new studytook the UK as a model and examined economic risks and climate uncertainties to create a planting portfolio which took both uncertainties into consideration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

While tree-planting carries risks, our study shows that, if done strategically, it remains the best solution we have.”Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsClimate crisisRewildingGreenhouse gas emissionsShareReuse this content"

This is like putting the car in reverse while it’s already at full speed on the motorway,” he said.Carbonemissions from new passenger cars fell by 28%between 2019 and 2023, according to the European Environment Agency, driven by a surge in electric vehicles, which release fewer pollutants than those that burn fossil fuels. But EV sales slumped in 2024, raising the prospect of large fines on carmakers with dirty fleets.The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), the industry group that lobbied for looser targets, said the market for zero-emissions vehicles was not picking up fast enough and called for greater support to boost demand, improve charging infrastructure and reduce manufacturing costs.“The transition to zero-emission mobility and a thriving EU automotive industry must progress together – this is non-negotiable,” said Ola Källenius, the president of the ACEA and CEO of the carmaker Mercedes-Benz.The announcement, which is to be proposed in full later this month, would need to be agreed by EU governments and the European parliament. It comes a week after the commission revealed itsproposals to gut key green finance rules, which were agreed during its last term.Shares in European carmakers rose after the announcement.

That flow of fresh water changed the density variation in the ocean, a key driver of movement, causing the slowdown.“The ocean is extremely complex and finely balanced. If this current ‘engine’ breaks down, there could be severe consequences, including more climate variability, with greater extremes in certain regions, and accelerated global warming due to a reduction in the ocean’s capacity to act as a carbon sink,” Gayen said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailCo-author and climate scientist Dr Taimoor Sohail said the slowdown could lead to a “vicious cycle”, where more warm water reaches the Antarctic shelf accelerating ice melting and further weakening the current.This could also disrupt ecosystems and food webs, he said, as the oceanic current helps to prevent invasive species – such as rafts of southern bull kelp – from reaching the fragile continent, or redistributed them.“Concerted efforts to limit global warming – by reducing carbon emissions – will limit Antarctic ice melting, averting the projected slowdown,” Sohail said.Dr Edward Doddridge, a physical oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who was not involved with the study, said it was significant and surprising, given previous studies had indicated that the northern parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current were accelerating due to ocean warming.Doddridge said it was important to investigate the ways that ocean currents might change, given more than 90% of the extra heat trapped on Earth had been stored in the oceans, which then moved the heat around in ways that affected the climate and weather in different places around the world.Monash University climate scientist Dr Ariaan Purich, who was not involved with the paper, said dramatic changes were already under way in the oceans around Antarctica.Fresh water stored in Antarctic ice sheets and shelves was melting at an accelerating rate, she said, and every summer since 2022 – for the first time in recorded history – the extent of sea ice surrounding the continent had dropped below 2m square kilometres.“We need to know what the ocean is doing and how much heat and carbon the ocean is taking up so that we can better project the climate that we’re experiencing here on land in Australia, and that we can better adapt for that climate,” she said.Explore more on these topicsOceansAustralian climate and environment in focusAntarcticaClimate sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

The women and equalities select committee, which Owen chairs,concluded in a report in Januarythat the case for it was “overwhelming”.Although a growing number of employers already offer the leave as a discretionary extra benefit, the committee said this should become a universal right given the far-reaching physical andemotional impacts of baby loss.About 250,000 expectant mothers in the UK suffer a miscarriage every year. Between 10% and 20% of pregnancies end in an early miscarriage within 12 weeks of gestation.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has spoken of his own family’s experience of pregnancy loss. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain in January he was “sympathetic” to the campaign, saying: “I know how important it is. Like a lot of people I’ve had some experience of this myself, it’s very, very difficult.”The bill already gives the right to bereavement leave to parents whose partner has died in childbirth but whose baby survives.The Guardian understands the government will also strengthen ways for trade unions to access workplaces, according to sources briefed on amendments to the bill.It will mean a fast-track decision-making route and off-the-shelf access agreements – and tough fines for employers who ignore those regulations. Unions will be given the right to have digital access to employees, such as through work intranets. Unions had hoped this would help them better access gig-economy workers.Another amendment will ban employers from flooding the bargaining unit which can unfairly influence the recognition ballot process. The trade union GMB had argued that when it made its first application with Amazon, only 1,400 people were working at the warehouse and 750 signed up. But the union claimed the fulfilment centre then added another 1,400 workers on temporary contracts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At present, an employee has to be in post for two years in order to claim unfair dismissal through an employment tribunal, but the bill will introduce this right from day one.Keir Starmer criticised Nigel Farage and his Reform UK party over their opposition to the bill last month. He told the Scottish Labour conference: “They talk the language of workers’ rights online and on the doorstep … but they voted against banning fire-and-rehire.

He took part in the ventilator challenge.“By April, it was clear that his model would not be pursued due to clinical viability and functionality. Nevertheless, Lord Agnew, a minister, warned the government chief commercial officer, Gareth Rhys Williams, in the following terms: ‘We’re going to have to handle Dyson carefully. I suspect we’ll have to buy a few machines, get them into hospitals so that he can then market internationally, being able to say that they are being used in UK hospitals. We both need to accept that it will be a bigger decision than we can both make. Remember, he got a personal call from the PM. This can’t be ignored’.”Weatherby told the inquiry that the procurement expert Prof Albert Sanchez Graells had described the manner on which Dyson was treated as an “affront to the procurement rules”.A Dyson spokesperson said: “SirJames Dysonresponded to a personal call from the prime minister of the United Kingdom, to develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency.“Dyson had no intention of manufacturing ventilators for profit. Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson, which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects.“Mercifully, treatments changed, and mass use of ventilators was no longer seen as an effective remedy, the UK government cancelled the order it had placed, and none were ever sold overseas.“Uniquely among the many businesses involved, James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the £20m the company spent on the project – rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives. In addition, Dyson did not claim any furlough money, subsidy, or government loans related to the Covid-19 pandemic anywhere in the world.”How the Michelle Mone scandal unfolded: £200m of PPE contracts, denials and a government lawsuitRead moreEarlier in the day, the inquiry chair, Heather Hallett, a former court of appeal judge, said she would hold a special closed session about PPE Medpro, the firm linked toMichelle Moneand her husband, Doug Barrowman, to avoid prejudicing a criminal inquiry by the National Crime Agency.It also emerged that the company, along with Mone and Barrowman, had applied for “core participant” status at the inquiry alongside groups such as bereaved families and the British Medical Association, giving them special rights including disclosure of documents and ability to make statements.Lady Hallett said she had rejected the application, which came 468 days after the deadline. “I do not accept that applicants have a direct or significant role in the matters to be investigated by the inquiry,” she said.Mone and Barrowman both deny wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryDyson LtdJames DysonBoris JohnsonCoronavirusEnglandMichelle MonenewsShareReuse this content"

Sure, Vance and Trump bit back. But I think in diplomatic terms Zelenskyy played it very badly.”3:20'Make a deal or we are out': the worst of Trump and Zelenskyy’s clash – videoAsked if Trump and Vance had been right to treat Zelenskyy as they did, Farage replied: “I wouldn’t expect a guest to be rude to me in my own house, absolutely not. I would expect a guest to treat me with respect. Doesn’t mean for a minute that Vance and Trump – I’m not defending what they did.”Zelenskyy wore a black fatigue-style outfit in Washington, reflecting his role as leader of a nation at war after it was invaded byRussia. Farage said he sympathised with criticisms of this, with the US journalist Brian Glenn asking the Ukrainian president why he had not been in a suit. The outfit showed a lack of respect, Farage said.“You know what? If I turned up at the White House, I’d make sure I was wearing a suit and that my shoes were clean, absolutely,” Farage said.“Our prime minister was briefed and briefed and briefed as to how to deal with the visit to the White House. If Zelenskyy wants to bowl in and show no respect to a man who we all know is incredibly old fashioned about this stuff … if you are going in with a positive mindset, maybe Zelenskyy should have thought about that.”0:25'You're all dressed up today': Trump greets Zelenskyy at the White House – videoPriti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, compared Farage to Corbyn, saying that, like the former Labour leader, he had a “history [of] equivocating over Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”.A spokesperson for Corbyn said Patel’s words about him were misleading and that he hadconsistently opposed the Russian invasion.Patel said: “Nigel Farage is completely wrong. President Zelenskyy is a hero, who has stood up to Putin’s aggression, and led his country’s defence against their barbaric and illegal invasion over the last three years – and it is troubling to not hear the leader of Reform say that.“For Nigel Farage to sit there pointing the finger at Zelenskyy is both morally wrong and diplomatically counterproductive. At this uncertain and dangerous time, one would hope that MPs of all stripes would be putting our national interest first, rather than playing politics.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former appears constantly absent while the latter has fought not just for Ukraine’s future, but for ours here in the UK.”After one caller asked Farage if he regretted speaking at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland given that another speaker, the former Trump aide Steve Bannon,made a fascist-style salutefrom the podium, Farage said he did not.Bannon was, Farage argued, “taking the mickey” out of Elon Musk, a current Trump aide, whomade two similar salutesat Trump’s inauguration in January.“Are they Nazi salutes? I don’t think they are for a moment,” Farage said. Asked what they were, Farage called them “very unwise”. He added: “They’re not really Nazi salutes, because they’re out to the side and not in front … Do I think Musk’s a Nazi? No.”Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “Nigel Farage is once again showing his true colours as Trump’s own spokesman here in Britain.

At least 12 have forecast accumulated deficits of more than £100m, running as high as £312m, when the debts have to be settled in a year’s time.It is understood ministers are preparing a white paper due to be published in late spring setting out details of what one insider called a “complete recalibration” of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system.The government is believed to be considering changes to existing Send legislation that councils hope would ease the deficits, alongside a series of measures designed to prioritise state school provision and cut council spending in costly private specialist needs schools.There are frantic calls from English local authorities for ministers to write off a collective £5bn forecast deficit on Send budgets. The deficit – effectively kept off council books through a temporary credit-facility arrangement called an “override” since 2018 – is due to hit council balance sheets on 31 March 2026, a financial shock that could push more than 60 councils into insolvency.Council Send spending has accelerated in recent years, and the deficit – the gap between the money the government gives councils for Send and the amount they have been legally obliged to spend on provision – has become one of the biggest threats to the viability of many town halls, on a par with the social care crisis.Local authorities are lobbying for law changes to give them more control over Send costs by limiting parental rights to appeal over Send assessments, and reducing the powers of Send tribunals to direct how a child’s needs are provided for in the school system.Kate Foale, a Labour councillor and Send spokesperson for the County Councils Network, said law changes had to go hand in hand with reform and extra investment in special needs education. Foale said: “It [the Send system] is adversarial, and it doesn’t work for children and their families. We are in a really bad place.”Parents’ groups warned ministers would have a “massive fight on their hands” over any attempts to dilute children’s legal rights to Send support. “Reducing Send entitlement won’t make needs go away. You just end up with lots of children with needs but no support,” said Tania Tirraoro of the campaign groupSpecial Needs Jungle.The biggest forecast deficits by next March include Hampshire county council (£312m by March 2026), West Sussex (£222m), Norfolk (£186m), Cheshire East (£154m), Warwickshire (£151m), Wiltshire (£117m), Oxfordshire (£111m), Gloucestershire (£108m), Somerset (£100m), and Staffordshire (£100m).Guardian analysis of two-thirds of English upper-tier councils found at least 13 have forecast accumulated Send deficits of between £50m and £100m, including Sefton (£86m), Hertfordshire (£81m), Cornwall (£70m), Cambridgeshire (£70m), Leicestershire (£66m), Merton (£65m), Central Bedfordshire (£65m) and Wokingham (£61m).Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, whose deficit will reach £165m in a year’s time, said without the deficit override it would be technically bankrupt from next month because its Send deficit exceeds its available financial reserves. It described its position as “an impossible situation”.Many councils have had to take out huge loans to manage cash flow crises caused by Send spending. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy estimates the cost of these loans, including interest payments, amounts to around £600m a year, which could have been spent on frontline services.The Send deficit is also eating into other parts of council budgets, with many town halls reporting unsustainable increases in the cost of home-to-school transport as more children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) are sent to out-of-borough special schools.The deficits are driven by huge high-needs budget overspends, especially on EHCPs, which set out a council’s legal duty to meet a child’s educational support requirements.A rapid rise in pupils diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder, special emotional needs (including ADHD), and speech, language and communication needs has fuelled a 140% increase in EHCPs between 2015 and 2024, from 240,000 to 576,000.Although 2014 legislation clarified entitlement to Send support, critics say the previous government failed to anticipate, plan for, properly fund and manage the resulting explosion in need and demand. Guardian analysis indicates that EHCP demand continues to increase rapidly, with some councils reporting 50% rises in the past 12 months.Bradford, already on the edge of effective bankruptcy because of social care pressures, is one of tiny handful of councils currently in surplus on its Send budget. However, it says an expected surge in EHCPs will rapidly turn this into a £14m deficit by March 2026, rising to £54m in 2027.Experts say an extension may delay a local financial meltdown across local government but is unlikely to give councils enough time to tackle the underlying causes of the deficit, which if not mitigated could rise to as much as £8bn by 2029. A Guardian analysis of internal documents and budget reports in more than two-thirds of upper-tier English councils, also found:Some councils have raised concerns about profiteering amid frustration over huge fees from private specialist schools, which can charge between £50,000 and £100,000 per place, typically two to three times the cost of state provision.Tensions between headteachers and councils over attempts by the latter to shift millions of pounds from local school budgets to ease high needs deficits. Some schools have said such moves would force them to sack Send support staff.Attempts to rein in local Send demand and spending via “safety valve” initiatives at 42 councils have largely failed, with most failing to hit savings targets on time, despite receiving government grants running into tens of millions of pounds.A Department for Education spokesperson said the Send system had long been failing to meet the needs of children and families. They said: “Through our Plan for Change, we are determined to improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools, making sure special schools cater to children with the most complex needs and restoring parents’ trust that their child will get the right support.“We are already making progress by investing £1bn into Send, alongside £740m for councils to create more specialist places in mainstream schools, paving the way for significant, long-term reform.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsTeachingDisabilityLocal governmentEnglandChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

He admitted a charge of penetrative sexual activity with a child earlier this year.Houphouet, an Ivorian national of Burngreave in Sheffield, and Sigiyo, a Zimbabwean national of Catcliffe in Rotherham, would be sentenced on Wednesday, Judge Wright said as she remanded both in custody.Brzozowski, a Polish national of Rawmarsh, Rotherham, was bailed and will be sentenced on 14 April.When the trial opened last month, prosecutor Gordon Stables told a jury both the complainants were living in a children’s home when they were befriended by the defendants and “other associates”.Stables said these were “all older men in their 20s, or thereabouts, whose sole intention was to engage in penetrative sexual activity with them, knowing they were under the age of consent”.The prosecutor said: “The defendants gained the girls’ trust and confidence by plying them with alcohol and giving them cigarettes at house parties, and offering them flirtatious attention.“Both girls became conditioned to having regular sexual intercourse with the same male.”Stables said: “Psychologically, the girls were made to feel that sexual activity was how they repaid the debt they owed the defendants for the provision of alcohol and tobacco.“Once the males were sexually satisfied, however, the girls were treated as having served their purpose – at least temporarily – and they were often then ignored and expected to make their own way home. In this way, [the girls] were sexually groomed within an environment of dependency.”Stables explained how Houphouet befriended the two girls in Rotherham town centre one evening more than 10 years ago and raped one of them in an alley that night.He said Houphouet took both girls the short distance to a house and introduced them to Sigiyo “and other males who were undoubtedly present”.The convictions are the latest following the National Crime Agency’s investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, called Operation Stovewood.It was set up afterthe landmark Jay reportfound in 2014 that at least 1,400 girls were abused by gangs of men of mainly Pakistani heritage in Rotherham in that period.Explore more on these topicsRotherhamRape and sexual assaultSouth YorkshireChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The size of individual deficits and the velocity at which they have risen – a decade ago councils were in surplus – is startling. West Sussex county council papers, for example, reveal its cumulative Send deficit is about £131m. By March 2026, it is forecast to rise to £225m and on current trends could reach £459m three years later.Mass insolvency has been averted so far by keeping town hall Send deficits off balance sheets. This accounting fix, which is called an “override” and is in place for three years, ends in March 2026. At this point the deficits go back on the books, and many councils are clear that insolvency beckons: they do not have the means to meet their debts.Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council recently discussed options to clear its forecast £165m Send deficit such as suspending new EHCP assessments and withholding business rates from the Treasury. Both options, the council admitted, would be “unpalatable” and unlawful, but highlighted the need to fix a “broken and unsustainable” system.One of the biggest Send budget pressures is private specialist school fees, which are typically two to three times the cost of a state school place and have led to calls for measures to curtail profiteering. The private sector has grown rapidly in recent years to meet the “overflow” from a depleted state Send sector that is full to capacity.Warwickshire county council budgeted last March to place 470 children in independent special schools at an average cost of £55,000 a year for each place. A few months later it revised the forecast: it was now expecting to place 556 children at an average cost of £66,000. Its estimated annual overspend on private Send provision this year is £11m.Common problems for councils include construction delays on new specialist schools; rising costs of home-to-school Send transport (in Hampshire this has risen from £40m to £105m in two years); rows with headteachers over emergency transfers of school funds to high-needs budgets; and struggles to clear EHCP application backlogs. Local Send “cost containment” initiatives have largely failed to meet targets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There have been big rises inparental complaintsabout Send services to the local government and social care ombudsman. The latest figures showed councils spent£100m on tribunalsto try to block support for Send children in 2022-23, losing 99% of the 10,000 cases they contested.Send reform will be lengthy and costly, involving the clearing of existing deficits and upfront investment to create a more sustainable system. It may prove politically tricky to balance council demands for changes to the law to limit Send spending with parental determination to protect children’s legal rights to vital special educational needs services.Ministers says they are determined to push through fundamental, system-wide changes. “We are grasping a problem that has been ignored for years,” a Whitehall insider said. Fixing Send will be, they added, one of the government’s “defining challenges”.Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSend crisis: a system at breaking pointLocal governmentEnglandSchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In response, Keir Starmer saidUK defence spending would rise to 2.5%of national income by 2027 – three years earlier than planned, with an ambition to reach 3% – with overseas aid taking the hit.European defence stocks soar as arms makers expect orders boomRead moreBut with a domestic defence industry that has areputation for blown budgets and lengthy delays– includingduring the Ukraine conflict– can Starmer rely on UK players to step up to support Europe’s defence against an expansionist Russia?Investors eye gainsAll branches of the armed forces can expect to avoid the spending cuts many feared would be implemented over the rest of the parliament. Britain’s manufacturing industry also breathed a sigh of relief – a long term commitment to defence spending is seen as an essential building block for sustained investment.On Monday,shares in UK and European defence companies ralliedas investors anticipated significantly higher spending by government feeding through to company profits.For now, HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Queen Elizabeth are saved, despite the enormous cost of equipping and running them. Mechanical failures, the latest of which has kept the Queen Elizabeth in dock when it was supposed to be the main strike carrier heading east, are already proving a headache.There is no doubt, say experts, that the near £7bn construction cost of both ships will also be dwarfed over an expected 50-year lifespan by the maintenance costs, eating into a defence budget that has shrunk in real terms over the past three decades to £57bn this year compared with overall government spending of almost £1.3tn.The pair were built by the defence contractor Babcock at its shipyard in Rosyth, Scotland, with BAE Systems and the French company Thales.Babcock is building Type 31 frigates on the same site while looking after the navy’s submarines at the Faslane base west of Glasgow.The company employs about 75% of its 25,000 staff in defence-related jobs and says it is ready to be a beneficiary of any increase in the outlay for military equipment. The government is “creating an important opportunity for investment in the UK”, a spokesperson for Babcock said.Apart from yards in Scotland and the Royal Navy’s main maintenance yard at Devonport, Plymouth, the company has 100 sites across the UK.A chequered reputationMake UK, the manufacturers lobby group, said there are about 12,000 companies in the UK defence industry, though many are only on the periphery, making paint finishes or widgets that end up in military vehicles.At the core are a group of companies that collaborate to make the latest kit through a series of ongoing partnerships.A clutch of larger companies appear well placed to benefit from Starmer’s defence push, including BAE, Rolls-Royce, Babcock, Italy’s Leonardo and France’s Thales. Last month the Ministry of Defence (MoD)unveiledthe first British-made Boxer armoured fighting vehicle at the International Armoured Vehicle Conference in Farnborough. Due to number more than 600, the Boxer is a joint venture between Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land in Telford and the Franco-German KNDS in Stockport.View image in fullscreenThe British-made Boxer armoured fighting vehicle is a joint venture between Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land in Telford and the Franco-German KNDS in Stockport.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianThe Ajax “mini tank” is another foundation stone of the army’s investment along with the Challenger 2 tank. Ajax is being built by the US company General Dynamics at its factory in Merthyr Tydfil.

Taylor says there is a way for the defence secretary, John Healey, to avoid buying US-made kit.“When the government is looking at the purchase of a UK defence product it is tempting to ask whether it is as good as a model from the US, and if not, to buy from the US manufacturer.“But we only need to ask whether the British or European kit deters the Russians, and if it does, which I have every confidence it would, then to say the UK version is good enough to buy.”Seamus Nevin, Make UK’s defence specialist, says armed forces pensions would eat up a much of the spending, as would expected pay rises and attempts to increase the numbers of military personnel, which has decreased byalmost 16% to 132,360 as of 1 April 2024 from 156,970 in 2014.A Rusi report last year identified a large funding gap in the current financial year, and in 2025-26, on day-to-day spending.In December 2023, the National Audit Office highlighted adeficit in the equipment plan of £3bn for 2024/25 and a further deficit of £3.9bn in 2025/26.The extra £6bn should fill these gaps and keep current spending on track. Ramping up production has many hurdles to overcome.“One of the issues facing defence contractors is a skills shortage that affects the whole manufacturing sector,” Nevin says. “There has been a 40% drop in apprenticeship starts since Theresa May’s complicated and much-derided apprenticeship levy scheme came into effect in 2017.”Another barrier is a lack of financial backing that afflicts manufacturing in the UK more generally.View image in fullscreenThe UK defence secretary, John Healey, will need to prevent capital procurement budgets overrunning.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesNevin says more small and medium-sized firms should benefit from the extra funds for defence, but banks are reluctant to lend. “SMEs are often cash-dependent and need support to invest and grow,” he says.One of Healey’s roles will be to prevent capital procurement budgets from overrunning and the extra money being wasted. The MoD was approached for comment.A succession of parliamentary reports have called for an overhaul, citing the cost overruns managed by the agency Defence Equipment and Support, the arm’s length body that has overseen the majority of defence equipment and service purchases for the UK’s armed forces since 2007.Concerns over the cost of constructing HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Queen Elizabeth were highlighted in a defence committee report in 2023. A strike by tugboat crews even forced the Royal Navy to scramble to get HMS Prince of Wales out of Portsmouth early. Starmer will hope the industry can sail more calmly in the years ahead.Explore more on these topicsBusinessBabcock InternationalManufacturing sectorAerospace industryDefence policyMilitaryUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He made his way to the side of the bridge before he fell into the river and died in the Thames. He was later found to be holding a lighter, not a weapon.At the opening of an inquest into his death on Monday, numerous calls to 999 describing Omishore’s actions were played. One witness described an “obviously very, very unwell” man holding a knife or a screwdriver outside Lister hospital, a short distance from the bridge.Other callers made note of his poor mental state. One said: “He doesn’t look like he’s in the right frame of mind”, and another said: “I don’t think he’s actually threatening violence, I think he’s just ill.”Bodyworn footage showed one officer Tasering Omishore three times in quick succession moments after getting out of a police car on the bridge. At first, the officer says: “Drop the screwdriver or you will be Tasered,” before discharging his stun gun.The footage showed Omishore rolling on the floor and being told to “stay still” and “put your hands on the fucking floor” before being Tasered again. After the third time, Omishore ran to the edge of the bridge. One officer continued to point his Taser gun at Omishore while the other managed to get close to him before he appears to jump off the bridge.TheIndependent Office for Police Conduct(IOPC) opened an investigation after his death. The police watchdog expanded its investigation after the Metropolitan police released incorrect information about the incident.Bodyworn footage played on Monday showed an officer picking up a long gas lighter from the ground moments after Omishore fell from the bridge. Statements made by the force on the day of the incident and the day after made no mention of the item recovered being a firelighter rather than a screwdriver.The family of Omishore, who was known to them as Deji, also paid tribute to a “kind and gentle soul” who “had his struggles”. In a statement, his father said Deji left home at 19 or 20 and had been in and out of their lives until he was estranged from them for over a decade. In 2021, he said the family’s “years of prayer were finally answered” when Deji’s sister reconnected with him online.“Deji was especially fond of his new niece, whose photo he proudly kept as his phone wallpaper,” said his father. “One week before his death, on a visit to his flat by his sister and her husband, Oladeji held his baby niece in his arms, telling his sister after how he cherished this moment. None of us imagined that it would be his last time holding her.”Omishore had a history of drug addiction but had sought help. He was declared drug free in March 2022 after being successfully discharged from rehab, but a few days before his death, Demi told his sister that he didn’t want to see the family and failed to respond to further messages.“The pain of his loss is indescribable to our family, and the haunting manner of his death is a memory we cannot erase. As a family, we continue to seek justice and answers, knowing that while we cannot bring him back – we can do that,” his father said.The inquest continues.Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

But on Monday Conservative peers will make an effort to clog up the legislation as it goes through parliament, suggesting delays to allow abolished hereditaries more time to find a job, allowing some of them to stay, or even converting them to become life peers.As a detailed scrutiny of the bill gets under way, 116 amendments have been put forward, which are likely to be debated individually. Some propose progressive changes such as cutting numbers of peers, introducing attendance requirements and getting rid of bishops from the house, but many are aimed at watering down the abolition of hereditaries.The tactics, largely from Conservative peers, are aimed at holding up the government’s legislative programme and annoying the cabinet so much that ministers will appeal to No 10 to strike a deal and end up compromising.Labour insiders insist there will be no compromise over hereditaries. But the battle over such a minor element ofLords reformshows how far the party now is from its bullish position of 2022.Call for ban on lords being paid to offer political adviceRead moreKeir Starmer at that time memorably described the whole institution of the House of Lords as “indefensible”, as he set out ambitious plans to replace it with an elected second chamber within the first term of aLabourgovernment. Labour strategists were convinced it was best to cram the biggest changes into the first year of a first term.“We thought it was best to get it over and done with in a big package at that stage,” said one Labour adviser. “But when the scale of what the Tories had left us to deal with hit home, you suddenly have to question what do you have the bandwidth for in government. Do people care enough about Lords reform or do they care about you dealing with the cost of living, housing and all the other problems?”By June 2024, as the Labour manifesto took shape, a concrete first-term timetable to abolish the Lords had disappeared from the party’s list of priorities. Only one “immediate” promise remained: to do away with the 92 hereditary peers.Other plans became pledges with no clear schedule. These included the introduction of a mandatory retirement age of 80, as well as new participation requirements, strengthening ways of getting rid of disgraced peers, an overhaul of appointments and making the chamber more balanced between the nations and regions.Alongside that, there would be a consultation on replacing the Lords with an alternative second chamber that was more representative, seeking the input of the British public on how politics could best serve them. There was no doubt the original ambition had been watered down.A bill duly appeared in theking’s speech in July. Just five lines that would abolish the hereditaries, hardly a controversial piece of legislation, or so the government thought. But Labour had not bargained for the vehement opposition of many Conservatives who did not want to see an end to the centuries-old space for peers based on primogeniture. Half of those due to be expelled from the Lords sit on the Tory benches. Most of the others are crossbench and just four are Labour.In a second-reading debate in December, Tory peer after Tory peer lined up to criticise the legislation. Lord Strathclyde, a former Conservative leader of the Lords, called it a “thoroughly nasty little bill” and Lord Forsyth, a former cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, described it as a “partisan drive-by assassination dressed up as constitutional reform”.At a private briefing before Christmas, the complaints kept coming, with one hereditary peer even asking whether he may be entitled to a redundancy package.Labour insiders have said the hereditaries bill will pass regardless of opposition and filibustering. But they are less firm about the wider changes, including the introduction of an age limit and plans for participation requirements. The Guardianrevealedearlier this year that Labour was considering a cross-party deal to cut overall numbers of peers, so avoiding more wars of attrition on constitutional reform.Another consideration has been the practicality of an age limit of 80. Guardian calculations show 292 out of 714 life peers will be 80 by the end of the current parliament. The change would affect Labour peers vastly more than Conservatives. According to the research, 43% of Labour peers would be lost under a mandatory age limit. In contrast, the bigger Tory grouping of peers would lose about 30% of their numbers.“There was some special pleading by individual lords,” one Labour backbencher said. “But overall, people just looked at the peers we would lose and started to wonder if this was a good idea. The example always used is lovely Alf Dubs [the 92-year-old campaigner on refugees who was rescued as a child from the Nazis in the kindertransport].”With Labour already underpowered in the Lords, Starmer took the decision in January to appoint another 30 life peers, including his short-lived chief of staff Sue Gray. Like so many prime ministers before him, the list was a roll call of allies and ex-advisers, including the longtime Tony Blair staffer Anji Hunter, the former TUC head Brendan Barber, and Starmer’s former head of strategy Deborah Mattinson. Margaret Hodge, the respected former Labour MP and tax justice campaigner, who is 80, was also made a peer – a move that makes little sense if an age limit is to be enforced.Though it was hardly surprising that Labour was seeking to rebalance power in the Lords while in government, the move was a far cry from Starmer’s 2022 pronouncements that he wanted to strip politicians of the power to make appointments and the criticisms of the Tories for appointing “lackeys” to the chamber.Hannah White, the director of the Institute for Government, said the small scale of the initial legislation on removing hereditary peers may have deflated enthusiasm for the whole package.“My reading of it is that what’s happened is that people have come up with big plans for Lords reform and then done a small thing and that’s taken the wind out of the sails of the bigger things,” she said. “I think the government probably didn’t think through the reality of how time-consuming the Lords can make it when it comes to constitutional reform if they want to. It’s a classic situation of turkeys and Christmas.”She added: “I think what Labour should have done is put it to a citizens’ assembly, because the results of that would be more difficult for political opponents to stand against. It would be hard to politically push back against.”The idea of a citizens’ assembly could still be a way out of the problem for Labour, but as yet it has not launched any formal consultation on an elected second chamber.Peter Hain, a Labour peer who has always been in favour of reform, said time was of the essence for any possible further changes. “I always took the view that if it wasn’t in the first year then we wouldn’t do it. The last huge Lords reform was the abolition of 600 peers by Tony Blair in 1999. I think if you don’t do it in your first term then are you ever going to do it?”Explore more on these topicsLords reformThe Lords debateHouse of LordsLabourConstitutional reformnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the public sector operators we’ve inherited don’t function particularly well. There’s a huge amount of work going into Northern – I could say that Northern was in public ownership for several years and not much was done about it.“The railway as a whole has fundamental performance issues, one of which is that it doesn’t have enough drivers. And that will take far longer to fix than we would like – but it’s really important to start doing that.”He insisted that “after sixyears of torpor, there’s a huge amount going on”.Hendy said that he and the leader of the GBR transition team, the Network Rail boss Andrew Haines, had been “getting increasingly frustrated talking about reform while nothing happened”.“The most miserable thing was theintroduction of a draft billthat pretended the government was serious about reform – but it wasn’t and it didn’t happen,” Hendy said.He said that the creation of a shadow GBR team would mean that even this year, there would be “people in charge waking up knowing that they are going to be held accountable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rail minister defended the scale of the rise – only the second to outstrip inflation in 13 years – saying it was lower than average wage increases. He added that the government had to – as the Conservatives long maintained – drive down the cost of rail and put more of the burden on passengers rather than the taxpayer.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s doing it for personal reasons. He wants to stay in power.”In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 Israelis were freed – including the bodies of eight people who were killed in captivity or during the 7 October 2023 attack whenHamaskilled about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees during the first phase of the ceasefire in exchange for the hostages.The Israeli government is reportedly planning to ratchet up its blockade on Gaza as part of what it has called a “hell plan” to pressure Hamas into further hostage releases without having to withdraw troops.Hamas has rejected the proposal, saying it represents a violation of the original truce agreement in January.Cohen said he has been told by other hostages released in the first phase that his son, who was captured on 7 October, is alive.“He’s there, he’s alive, he’s well and the only thing left is to get him released,” he said.British-linked families told reporters of the horror of waiting for their relatives to be returned.Ayelet Kaufman, the sister of Hadar Goldin, has been waiting more than 10 years for the return of her brother’s body. Goldin, an Israeli soldier, was kidnapped and killed in 2014, she told reporters.British-Israeli citizen Ditza Or, mother of hostage Avinatan Or, said: “Before 7 October, I was Ditza Or, with a full life, a profession.“But since 7 October, I’m only the mother of Avinatan – 24 /7 I advocate for him.”Avinatan Or was kidnapped along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, at the Supernova music festival in southern Israel on 7 October. His girlfriend has since been returned, but was separated from Or.She added: “It’s important to bring the world to its peace and harmony, but first, bring all our children home, and then go on.”Israel said on Sunday that a new US proposal calls for extending the ceasefire’s first phase through Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday, which ends on 20 April.Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu said.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Thomas Strobl, the interior minister of Baden-Württemberg state, said the suspect was a 40-year-old German man from the south-western state of Rhineland-Palatinate who was believed to have acted alone.Investigators later said there were “concrete indications” that the man had mental health problems, and ruled out a “politically motivated act”.The victims were identified as an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man.Witnesses described people lying on the ground at the scene near the central pedestrianised Paradeplatz after the car ploughed into the crowd, heading in the direction of a water tower. Attempts were being made to resuscitate at least two people.German police and prosecutors said the driver intentionally rammed his car into the crowds celebrating carnival before the fasting season of Lent.He was then blocked by a taxi driver who witnessed the attack from a cafe where he was taking a break, jumped into his car and drove into the path of the Ford Fiesta, according to local media reports.The attacker shot at the taxi driver with what is believed to have been an alarm pistol, but did not injure him. He then fled on foot before he was caught by police, injuring himself with a shot from the alarm pistol.The man, a landscape gardener according to police, is being investigated for murder and attempted murder.The incident follows a string of violent attacks including two other car rammings, inMunich last monthand inMagdeburg in December. Mannheim was the scene of a stabbing in May 2024 in which a police officer was killed and five people wounded.All those attacks were carried out by migrants, fuelling a heated debate over the country’s immigration policy before Germany’s general election last month.The vote was won by the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, which campaigned on promises to tighten border controls, while the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland came second with its best ever result.Germany’s carnival season culminates inRosenmontag(Rose Monday), with crowds in fancy dress and parades of floats that typically feature comical and satirical displays of events dominating current affairs. Mannheim held its main parade on Sunday.Security forces had alerted carnival organisers and the public more than a week ago about warnings published on social media accounts connected to the militant group Islamic State, calling for followers to carry out attacks in the carnival strongholds of the Rhineland, to which Mannheim belongs, and areas in the south – both Catholic regions.Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, who had been due to attend a popular parade in Cologne on Monday, cancelled her attendance to travel to Mannheim instead, a spokesperson said.Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany’s next chancellor, wrote on X that “the incident – as well as the terrible acts of the past few months – is an urgent reminder that we must do everything we can to prevent such acts”. The outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, referred to the stabbing attack of last year, writing on X: “Once again we mourn with Mannheim. Once again we mourn with the families of the victims of a senseless act of violence.”Kasim Timur, 57, who runs a cafe on Paradeplatz, told Der Spiegel: “It breaks one’s heart.” He said one of his colleagues had reported seeing some of the seriously injured, including children. Another colleague, on her way to work at the cafe, had seen a dark-coloured Ford car racing towards Paradeplatz, he said.“Initially she thought it was someone who had caused an accident and fled the scene,” he said. “Only later did she understand what had happened.” Timur said the city had not yet got over the stabbing attack of less than a year ago. “Now the horror is back,” he told Spiegel. “That is very scary.”According to media reports, three people were receiving emergency treatment at University Hospital Mannheim, including two adults and a child. Eight medical trauma teams had been put on standby to treat adults and children, according to the hospital.Police urged people not to post videos from the attack, or to spread information that had not been officially confirmed, warning of numerous “false reports” that were circulating on social media.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement led to a sharp sell-off on Wall Street.All Mexican exports to the US are set to face a levy of 25% under the plans. Most Canadian exports will face a 25% tariff, with energy products facing a 10% duty.1:27No room left for negotiation with Canada and Mexico on tariffs, says Trump – videoA 10% levy on China – introduced last month – will be doubled to 20%, according to an executive order released by the White House.China’s commerce ministry on Tuesday vowed countermeasures that it said were aimed at safeguarding its rights and interests. The US had “shifted the blame” and is using its problems with the deadly drug fentanyl as an excuse to impose tariffs, the ministry said in a statement.The US has argued that China supplies chemicals used in fentanyl production. China has denied wrongdoing. China urges the US to “immediately withdraw” its unilateral tariff measures that are “unreasonable and groundless, harmful to others,” the ministry said.But at a news conference, Trump told reporters tariffs were a “very powerful weapon”.The actions are set to prompt swift retaliation. “We’re ready,” said the Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau issued astatementon Monday, calling the US tariffs “unjustified” and vowing to immediately respond with a 25% tariff of their own.“Our tariff will remain in place until the US trade action is withdrawn,” Trudeau said, while urging the US to reconsider the tariffs. “Tariffs will disrupt a very successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.”Wall Street fell sharply after Trump’s remarks, with the S&P 500 down 1.7%, the Dow Jones industrial average down 1.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping over 2.6%.The tariffs will affect $900bn in annual imports from Canada and Mexico. The Ford CEO, Jim Farley, has warned they threaten to “blow a hole” in US industry.Trump has reluctantly conceded in recent weeks that higher tariffs could lead to higher prices in the US, but suggested the impact would be worth the cost. He has brushed off calls to tread carefully, escalating threats to go further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheVaticansaid the episodes on Monday were caused by “significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and a consequent bronchospasm”.“Two bronchoscopies were therefore performed, requiring aspiration of abundant secretions,” the Vatican said. “In the afternoon, non-invasive mechanical ventilation was resumed.”The Vatican added that the pope “has always remained vigilant, oriented and collaborative”. Medics’ prognosis remains “guarded”, meaning the pope is not yet out of danger.Francis was admitted to hospital on 14 February with bronchitis, but his condition deteriorated into pneumonia in both lungs. On 22 February, he suffered a prolonged asthma-style attack and required blood transfusions for a low platelet count. After a few days last week of showing a “slight” improvement, the pope had an episode akin to an asthma attack on Friday that also caused him to inhale vomit.He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina. Medical experts have said that Francis’s age and the chronic respiratory disease from which he suffers mean a sustained recovery will take time.In a message shared on X on Sunday, the pope thanked well-wishers for their support after missing his Angelus blessing for a third week in a row. Nightly prayer vigils for the pope’s health are continuing to take place at St Peter’s Basilica as well as in towns and cities acrossItalyand abroad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A federal judge ordered the men, who themselves are in the country illegally, jailed without bond until their trial in April.The indictment names Renoj-Matul as the head of a vast human smuggling ring operating for at least a dozen years that primarily transports people to the US from Guatemala.The criminal network was responsible for the deaths of seven immigrants without legal status – including a four-year-old child – who were killed in a November 2023 vehicle crash in Oklahoma, prosecutors said.A driver who has been in custody in Oklahoma since that crash, Jose Paxtor-Oxlaj, was also charged in theCaliforniaindictment, according to the court documents. Another man, Helmer Obispo-Hernandez, a lieutenant in the organization and a supervisor of a team of drivers, faces charges as well. He is believed to be in Guatemala, officials said.Attorneys for the four men could not be located on Monday for comment.Renoj-Matual was assisted by associates in Guatemala who solicited people who each paid between $15,000 and $18,000 to be smuggled to the US through Mexico, prosecutors said.For an additional fee, the migrants were transported and moved to various destinations in the United States, including Los Angeles and Phoenix. Some of the migrants who were not able to pay the fees were held hostage in a stash house near downtown Los Angeles, according to prosecutors.“These smuggling organizations have no regard for human life and their conduct kills,” acting US attorney Joseph T McNally said in a statement. “The indictment and arrests here have dismantled one of the country’s largest and most dangerous smuggling organizations.”If convicted of all charges, the defendants could face a statutory maximum sentence of death or life imprisonment.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The longer it takes, the more likely you never see it again … It was all pure luck that everything fell into place.”The 17th-century painting had been hanging in the National Museum in Gdańsk,Poland, when on 24 April 1974, a cleaner knocked it from the wall, the frame broke, and she discovered the painting had been replaced with a photograph. A sketch by the Flemish artist Anthony van Dyck called The Crucifixion had also been switched with a copy.The two works went on Poland’s “most wanted” list until, last year, a Dutch art and antiques magazine calledVind(Find) wrote about a new show at the Gouda Museum, where the Brueghel was on loan from a private collector. Vind traced a black-and-white photograph of the painting in Poland and contacted Brand to inquire whether it could be the same one.After locating five similar paintings by Brueghel, contacting Dutch and Polish police and the museum, Brand made a match – and Poland has now officially requested the artworks’ return.“It is quite spectacular,” Brand said. “And the story behind it is quite spectacular too. It’s a great moment because of how much it means for Poland – it’s on their list of most-wanted paintings and they have waited 50 years probably thinking it would never come back.”The theft had been an expert job, said Brand. “First of all, not many people dared to steal something from a museum in a communist dictatorship. Second, not many people had the contacts to bring it abroad.“When the Polish police reopened the case in 2008, all the archives concerning this theft were destroyed and some former members of the secret service later declared that they were sure that somebody in their organisation was involved.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsPolandArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule.The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.What happened during the dictatorship?Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”.It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay.But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.How did it end?Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte.Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“This is a special moment for the country: the chance to give new meaning to so many things … and finally move forward through justice,” said Leo Alves Vieira, 47, whose grandfather Mário Alves de Souza Vieira was kidnapped, tortured and killed by the army in 1970. De Souza’s body was never found.“I’m Still Here is the most powerful tool we’ve had so far to fight for this memory,” he said.Federal prosecutor Eugênia Augusta Gonzaga said that “never before inBrazilhas there been such awareness of … the need to continue the work of searching for bodies, uncovering the truth, and holding those responsible to account.”Gonzaga, the current president of the Commission on Deaths and Disappearances – the government body responsible for establishing the actual cause of death of those killed by the regime – attributes this new interest to both the film and the attempted coup on 8 January 2023 when far-right supporters of former presidentJair Bolsonarostormed the seat of government in Brasília.View image in fullscreenPeople react to I’m Still Here winning the Oscar in a bar in Sāo Paulo.Photograph: Carla Carniel/ReutersThe film tells the story of Eunice Paiva’s search for her husband, Rubens, a 41-year-old politician who was taken from his home in 1971 by agents of the dictatorship.Eunice was a member of the commission when it was first set up in 1995.The following year, the Brazilian state finally acknowledged her husband’s death – a scene portrayed in the movie, which shows Eunice telling reporters that it is essential to investigate and prosecute all crimes committed during the dictatorship because, “if that does not happen, nothing will stop them from being carried out again with impunity”.Brazil’s recent past has given the film particular resonance: it was during the Oscars campaign that Bolsonaro – an outspoken admirer of the military – wasformally indicted for his role in the attempted coup.Among the 33 members of his government also implicated were generals and an admiral, marking the first time high-ranking military officers have been charged with attempting a coup in Brazil’s history.Due to an amnesty law introduced after the 1964–1985 dictatorship, no military personnel were held accountable for more than 400 deaths and disappearances.“There is a lack of punishment for the torturers,” said Diva Santana, 80, who has been fighting for nearly five decades for the memory of her sister, Dinaelza Santana Coqueiro, who was disappeared by the army in 1973, at the age of 20.In a move thatmany see as a direct result of the release of I’m Still Here, the Brazilian supreme court recently reopened the debate over whether the amnesty applies to crimes that persist to the present day, such as the concealment of bodies.The national justice council also decided that the death certificates of victims like Paiva, Vieira and Coqueiro should not only state that they are “disappeared”, but also identify them as victims of a “non-natural, violent [death] caused by the Brazilian state in the context of the systematic persecution of political dissidents during the dictatorship”.“The impact of the film and the events of 8 January have shifted the focus on accountability,” said prosecutor Gonzaga. “We’ve already wasted too much time and can’t afford to lose another second.”Santana said that, after so many years, many of the torturers had already died. But she hoped they, too, would be condemned. “Justice needs to recognise the responsibility of all of them. And those who are still alive need to go to prison and serve time, just like Black and poor people do in Brazil,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilI'm Still HereAmericasJair BolsonaroOscarsnewsShareReuse this content"

The deportations came despite a UN statement saying those being sent to China faced a “real risk of torture” on their return.Thailand ignored protests by the UN refugee agency, EU and US in deporting 40 Uyghurs who had been detained in the country for a decade, claiming they hadreturned voluntarily “to their normal lives”with their families.Q&AWho are Uyghurs and why are they at risk?ShowThe Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim Turkic-speaking ethnic group, primarily from China’s north-west region of Xinjiang.The Chinese authorities blamed a number ofviolent attacks in Xinjiangand elsewhere in China on militant Islamist groups.As a consequence, Uyghurs have been subject to religious and ethnic persecution by Chinese authorities, with human rights groups claiming that in recent years more than a million people have been held in detention camps.Some governments have labelled the crackdown as genocide and the UN human rights commissioner found that “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims may amount tocrimes against humanity. China denies the accusations.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.However, speaking to the Guardian, the family of one of those thought to have been deported said it was “impossible” that the men would want to be sent back toChina.View image in fullscreenMihriman Muhammed.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/Guardian“Who wants their family to be sent back to a place like that, with no freedoms and where everything is monitored by the government? It’s a lie.“Their families in China know what hardships they face,” said Mihriman Muhammed, 38, who fled the country in 2014.There has been exodus of Uyghurs from China’s Xinjiang region over the past decade, where China is accused ofcommitting human rights abusesincluding torture and the incarceration of an estimated 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. China denies the accusations.Muhammed said she and her then husband, Polat, 39, left Korla, the second-largest city inXinjiangafter she was arrested and forced by police to remove her hijab and Polat was banned from attending prayers at a mosque.While Muhammed, who was pregnant with their second child, and their son made it to Turkey, Polat was arrested and has been detained inThailandever since.View image in fullscreenPolat Muhammed, seen on Mihriman Muhammed’s phone.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The Guardian“We just wanted a peaceful life where we could raise our children and not be seen as a criminal,” said Muhammed, who shared one of the final exchanges of messages between her now 10-year-old daughter and Polat. Her daughter has never met her father.“Father, I am 10 years old now without you looking after me,” she wrote. “I promise to come and look after you,” Polat replies. “OK, don’t lie to me, father,” she says. After he insists he will, she replies: “Very well, dear father, I will wait for you. May Allah bring us together.”“There is no way Polat or his family still living in China would have wanted him to return there. He just wanted to see his children again,” said Muhammed.Since Polat’s arrest, Muhammed said she has had no information from either the Chinese, Thai or Turkish authorities about his fate. None of the people deported has yet been named, so she is still not certain if he has been sent back.“It’s shameful for Thailand to send these people to China, even though the family and whole world knows it is an unsafe place forUyghurs,” she said.“Everything China has done has been staged. The world should be more careful because after they are deported there is no way back.”Elderly Uyghur women imprisoned in China for decades-old religious ‘crimes’, leaked files revealRead moreIn handwritten letters shared with the Guardian apparently from three other Uyghurs being held in Thailand, the detainees also pleaded not to be sent back to China.They said they had been asked to sign a document consenting to be voluntarily repatriated but had refused to do so. Returning to China would mean imprisonment or death, one wrote.Thailand said it had received reassurances from China that the deported Uyghurs would be cared for and not mistreated.China’s embassy in Thailand said those who had been repatriated were illegal border crossers “not refugees”.It said those who had returned would be assisted with reintegration into their former lives “as soon as possible” and would be given “employment support and vocational training”. Vocational training is a term which has been associated with the Chinese authorities’ detention camps and forced labour transfer programmes.Explore more on these topicsUyghursRights and freedomXinjiangChinaAsia PacificHuman rightsThailandRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

He said it would also enable Europe to gauge Putin’s attitude to “real peace negotiations”.A day after European leaders rallied aroundUkraineat a summit in London, Barrot added: “Never has the risk of a war in Europe, in the EU, been so high … The threat keeps getting closer to us, the frontline keeps getting closer to us.”His comments picked up on those of the French president, who suggestedFranceand the UK had agreed on a plan for a short-term partial ceasefire that would not cover ground fighting, with troops to be deployed to Ukraine in a second phase.Ukraine’s president, Voldoymyr Zelenskyy, would not say whether he supported the proposal – though he did tell reporters at a press briefing that he was familiar with it. “I am aware of everything,” he said on Sunday night.Zelenskyy also emphasised that a ceasefire would mean little without Ukraine obtaining immediate security guarantees from allies. He saidRussiahad broken the ceasefire that ran between 2014 and early 2022 in Ukraine “25 times” and that it was likely to do so again without external intervention.The UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard said the French suggestion was not a plan Britain currently recognised and added that no agreement had been reached on what a truce might look like. “But we are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how … we create a lasting and durable peace,” he said.Peter Mandelson’s Ukraine comments ‘not government policy’, minister saysRead moreDonald Trump planned to convene top White House officials on Monday to discuss next steps, which included reviewing the European proposal but also considering a cutoff in aid to Ukraine, according to reports in the New York Times and other US media. Those set to join the briefing include the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth.Waltz briefly took questions on Ukraine while walking towards the West Wing. He declined to say whether the US would accept the European proposal but welcomed the efforts by Macron and the UK prime minister,Keir Starmer. “We welcome the Europeans taking a lead in European security,” Waltz said. “I mean, that’s been an underpinning. They have to invest in the capability to do that. They’re certainly showing a will.”Trump allies continued to pile pressure on Zelenskyy over the weekend, with several suggesting the Ukrainian president should consider resigning in order to provide a way forward for negotiations. Rubio and Waltz were considered to be the most hawkish of Trump’s cabinet on Russia, but have fallen in line with the criticism of Ukraine by Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance,, as tensions have escalated.Speaking to Fox on Monday morning, Waltz did not say Zelenskyy should resign, but when asked whether Zelenskyy was fit to lead Ukraine said: “What happened Friday really put that up in the air.”European leaders, the head of Nato, Mark Rutte, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, met in London on Sunday in the aftermath of anacrimonious exchangebetween Zelenskyy and Trump.Starmer, who convened the London talks, said afterwards that the leaders led by the UK and France hadagreed to draw up a Ukraine peace planthat would be presented to the Trump administration.Zelenskyy said on Sunday he expected a plan to emerge on paper “in the coming weeks”. He added that a growing number of countries were ready to support it, naming Turkey and the eight Baltic and Nordic states as being willing to help.Although he referenced a need for western backing, Zelenskyy said his best security guarantee was “a strong Ukrainian army” and notably did not repeat previous suggestions that a peacekeeping force of 100,000-150,000 would be desirable.European leaders have been told by the US that it will not participate, leaving Britain and France to propose creating a “reassurance force” of up to 30,000 that would secure Ukrainian airports and key infrastructure.But Zelenskyy said that to be credible, that force would need some support from the US, particularly in “air defence and intelligence”. He said he believed Washington would remain a partner, even if his personal relationship with Trump had collapsed after the White House row.Meanwhile, fighting continued on the battlefield in Ukraine. Ukraine has made some small-scale counterattacks around the western edge of Toretsk, a frontline city in Donetsk, while Russia pushed on with a long-running assault on the eastern city of Pokrovsk.Russia’s defence ministry has also claimed it killed 150 Ukrainian soldiers at a base near the city of Dnipro. The new commander of Ukraine’s land forces, Maj Gen Mykhailo Drapatyi, described the strike on Saturday as “terrible” and said he was launching an investigation into why so many service personnel gathered together in the open.A long-range Ukrainian drone overnight hit an old refinery in Ufa, more than 870 miles (1,400km) from Ukraine’s border. The Ufimsky refinery is one of the biggest in Russia and supplies fuel to the country’s armed forces.The Kremlin, which has rejected the idea of any western troops in Ukraine, said on Monday the results of the European summit would allow fighting to continue, adding that Zelenskyy must be forced to change his stance and seek peace.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The latter is not interesting for Europe.”Zelenskyy said on Monday that he would work with Europe on the terms for a possible peace deal to present to the US. The Ukrainian president said on Telegram: “In the near future, all of us in Europe will shape our common positions – the lines we must achieve and the lines we cannot compromise on. These positions will be presented to our partners in the United States.”In a video showing damage from Russian attacks on Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Kyiv needed “strong support from our partners”, with Moscow launching “more than 1,050 attack drones, nearly 1,300 aerial bombs, and more than 20 missiles” in the past week.Amid talk in Europe of the biggest US policy reversal since the second world war, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she would inform EU member states on Tuesday about plans to strengthen the the bloc’s defence industry and military capabilities.“We need a massive surge in defence, without any question. We want lasting peace, but lasting peace can only be built on strength, and strength begins with strengthening ourselves,” she said.With some leaders calling for EU countries to raise their defence budgets to 3-3.5% of gross domestic product, German coalition talks have raised the prospect of a huge boom in spending – including defence and infrastructure funds worth hundreds of billions of euros.Viktor Orbán,Hungary’s Moscow-friendly prime minister, criticised the London summit, saying European leaders “decided … they want to go on with the war instead of opting for peace” and describing their approach as “bad, dangerous and mistaken”.Orbán and Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico, are likely to challenge and may veto the conclusions of an extraordinary EU summit on Thursday to discuss support for Ukraine, European security guarantees and how to pay for European defence needs.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Zelenskyy’s office, said successive American presidents had tried to improve relations with Russia – without ever achieving any tangible results.“The list of American attempts to reach out to the Kremlin could go on indefinitely. Why were there so many? Because each previous attempt, unfortunately for the world but entirely predictably, ended in failure,” he posted on social media.Podolyak added: “Generations of American politicians come and go, yet Russia’s inability to adhere to the rules of civilised international coexistence remains constant.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineFranceRussiaEmmanuel MacronVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

His breakthrough came in 1998 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy’s annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist.A 2009 self-portrait was posted on his official Instagram page alongside a message announcing his death, which stated: “It is with great sadness that we share the news of Jack’s passing over the weekend.“He was not only an extraordinary artist but also a deeply private and humble man who was endlessly grateful for the support and admiration of those who loved his work. His paintings – capturing moments of intrigue, romance, and nostalgia –touched the hearts of so many around the world, and his legacy will live on through them.At this time, we ask for privacy as his loved ones come to terms with this loss. Thank you for all the kind messages and tributes already shared – your support means so much.”It is understood there are no suspicious circumstances around the 73-year-old’s death.View image in fullscreenVettriano’s The Singing Butler was sold at auction in 2004 for £744,500.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockHis works received international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities such as Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York.But Vettriano drew scorn from critics, many of whom considered his work derivative. Jonathan Jones called him “emotionally trite and technically drab”, while another writer said he was like “Hopper without the emotion, and sleazy to boot” and that “we should not make the mistake of classing him as a major – or even decent – artist” despite his commercial success.His 1992 painting theThe Singing Butleris among his most famed works and shows an elegant couple dancing on a storm-swept beach accompanied by their butler and maid. It became a bestselling image in Britain. Reproductions of the painting sold in their thousands but critics failed to be won over.In 2005, when Vettriano was compared to Dalí, Bacon and Picasso, Jonathan Jones wrote:“Those are all great artists. Vettriano is not even an artist. He just happens to be popular, with “ordinary people” who buy reproductions of his pseudo-1930s scenes of high-heeled women and monkey-suited men, and celebrities who fork out for the originals of these toneless, textureless, brainless slick corpses of paintings. I urge you to visit the National Gallery. Look at great paintings for a few hours. Now take a look at Vettriano. I’m not arguing with you; I’m telling you. I look at art every day and I know what I don’t like.”While some critics hated his work, Vettriano won over several celebrity fans, including Jack Nicholson, Alex Ferguson, Tim Rice and Robbie Coltrane.Three years ago, the artist revealed he had been addicted to cocaine, describing himself as living like “Jack Nicholson in The Shining”. “I never wanted to try anything else like heroin or ecstasy, because cocaine just hit the spot,” he told the Daily Mail. “It arouses your sexual appetite, but unfortunately it doesn’t give you the power to do anything about it.”He became depressed and abused alcohol when an injury to his shoulder in 2015 left himtemporarily unable to paint.His publicist said: “Jack Vettriano’s passing marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art. His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.”Explore more on these topicsArtPaintingScotlandFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As the Scots return, they relive disowning their debut album, blowing Top of the Pops – and getting shocks off their battery-powered illuminated suitsMon 3 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.55 ESTShareSteve Mason is remembering the day in 2004 he was told the Beta Band was over. “There was enough money in the bank account to pay each of us a month’s wages,” says the singer, seated in a busy London greasy spoon. “And by that point, we were only on a grand a month. Then that was it.”For the previous eight years, life in the band formed in the Scottish seaside town of St Andrews had been one of constant reinvention and innovation. They’d made fiercely original records and experimental films, while putting on visually stunning live extravaganzas. Their transatlantic fanbase included Oasis, Radiohead, Irvine Welsh and actor John Cusack, who’d recommended their song Dry the Rain for a now-famous scene in High Fidelity. Playing a record store assistant, Cusack announces: “I will now sell five copies of The Three EPs by the Beta Band.” He then puts the CD on and the shopppers nod their heads to Dry the Rain.I picked up a samurai sword – and did four grand's worth of damage to our kit in 60 secondsAlthough the Beta Band were popular, notching up top 20 albums and biggish shows, they should have become massive. Instead, they ended up owing their label Parlophone £1.2m, reflecting all the money spent on recording, touring, videos and more. They weren’t expected to pay it back – but the plug was pulled, and the band was over.“Something like that is so intense,” says Mason. “It’s a big part of your life that’s gone. At the same time, a relationship I had with a girl that had run concurrently with the band ended as well. I had a monumental breakdown. I had a plan to kill myself. Then I tried to get myself sectioned.”View image in fullscreen‘Our ambitions were solely artistic’ … the Beta Band in the 90s.Photograph: Katrin GeilhausenBut now, 21 years on, they’re back, with a reissue campaign and UK and US reunion tours to “celebrate the music”. Keyboards/samples man John Maclean says he came to regard the debt as a “badge of honour” and Mason, still only 49, certainly has no regrets. “We never wanted to be rock stars or make lots of money,” he says. “Our ambitions were solely artistic and we pushed ourselves until the last minute. Then we split up. But how many bands can say they spent £1.2m on art?”Mason was working as a mechanic when conversations with old pal Gordon Anderson and Maclean, who the latter had met at art school, gave him an epiphany. “I’d never heard people talk unashamedly about art and poetry before,” he explains. “I came from this toxic male culture where everyone tried to be tough and there was a lot of tabloid newspapers and talking about women in a certain way. But I suddenly realised the real bravery lies in art.”Anderson soon left, for reasons concerning his mental health, and the lineup became Mason, Maclean, drummer Robin Jones (another art school student) and bassist Richard Greentree. Pitting themselves entirely against the GB jingoism and posturing of the tail end of Britpop, they created music that was completely different: engrossing mixtures of guitars, house grooves, ambient drones, R&B, psychedelia and haunting, enigmatic lyrics.“We went clubbing and listened to the Stone Roses,” Maclean remembers. “But I’d sample a bird sound rather than someone in America going, ‘Wassup?’ It was very organic. We worked with tapes. Pre-computers. Technology was catching up with us. We were constantly making videos. Way before TikTok and YouTube.”View image in fullscreenQuite Spinal Tap … Steve Mason on stage with the band in 2004.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianChampion Versions EP, made for just £4,000 in 1997, was immediately playlisted on Radio 1. “Driving to our first gig,” says Mason, “we pulled up next to some builders and our song came on their radio. We all started cheering.” In the 1990s, major labels could lavish cash on artists, so the Betas told Parlophone: “All we want from you is the money to pursue our ideas, then to be left alone.”After early compilation The Three EPs reached No 35, further catapulting expectations, Mason felt “on a mission from God” when they were then given £300,000 to record their eponymous debut in four cities and one isolated hut in Scotland. “The original idea had been to record in three different continents with Indigenous musicians,” he sniggers. “But that would have cost a million.”However, they then disowned the album. “In those days,” says Maclean, “Oasis would release a new record and claim, ‘This is the greatest ever!’ So there was an element of us going the other way.” Mason now admits the album has flaws, but is not without its moments: “We were still finding a way of writing together. The best tracks are the ones we worked hardest on.” The album reached No 18 in 1999, but two years later the band were still dismissing it, not least in anotoriously grumpy interview with the Guardian in Atlanta. Mason says it was sprung on them just as they came off stage, tired and still jetlagged. “So it was a disaster.”Hot Shots II, made with R&B producer C-Swing, was released to rave reviews in 2001. The album reached No 13 in the UK and dented the US Billboard charts, but by then the band had acquired a reputation for being difficult. Mason says: “When we recorded the single Broke for Top of the Pops, I said, ‘We’re in the belly of the beast now boys!’ as the song started. So it was never broadcast.”Squares, the single that followed a year later, would surely have been a huge hit – had Sheffield electronic act I Monster not released a song containing an identical earworm sample of Daydream, Günter Kallmann Choir’s trippy 1970 single. “I’m still suspicious,” admits Mason. “What are the odds on that?” Radio 1 played I Monster and the Sheffield boys went Top 20.A joke about clubbing together to get a gun to shoot President Bush led to a deportation petition being sent to the FBISome of the Betas’ adventures are quite Spinal Tap. They spent £4,000 on Velcro suits which a roadie left on the tube. They got themselves stage outfits that lit up. “We’d hear the crew walking down corridors muttering, ‘The fucking suits’,” Mason laughs, “because they were always breaking down. They were only powered by nine-volt batteries but one night Richard threw his bass down and started ripping off his jacket. He’d been sweating so much he was being electrocuted by this little battery.”The band once turned up in a small US town only to discover that the venue was “a scout hut”. They had to halve the show’s capacity just to get their equipment in. “We put on a hundred-grand show for 150 people,” laughs Mason. “But I still get messages saying, ‘You changed our town!’”High Fidelity and tours with Radiohead boosted their American popularity enough for Mason to justifiably claim to have been “bigger in the US than Manic Street Preachers or Robbie Williams”. But then, as the singer has revealed in previous interviews, an onstage joke in Texas, about clubbing together to get a rifle to shoot President George Bush, led to a petition to deport him being sent to the FBI.Tornado review – windswept samurai western set in apocalyptic ScotlandRead moreToday, Mason insists such behaviour wasn’t self-sabotage, but was actually caused by his struggles with mental health. “I was suffering a monumental lack of confidence and other stuff. I was so disappointed with the debut album. I mostly used to smash up my own possessions. Then once in rehearsals, I read some comments in the music press slagging us off. I picked up a samurai sword and caused four grand’s worth of damage to our equipment in 60 seconds. I remember John saying, ‘Well, that’s the rehearsal over.’”Maclean thinks that rather than rush to record 2004’s Heroes to Zeros, their third album, they should have taken six months off to recharge their batteries and repair their relationships. “But there was never a plan,” he adds. “It was always, ‘Right, we’re all moving into one house.’ ‘Right, we’re splitting up!’”With hindsight, Mason thinks the biggest reason they didn’t become as successful as they should have was “a lack of effective management or guidance. So we made poor decisions, especially choosing the second manager because he had eyes like a great white shark.”The week after they found out they owed £1.2m, EMI signed Robbie Williams for £80m. A more pressing issue was the £120,000 the members collectively owed the tax office. Mason sighs: “It took me 12 years to pay my share off.”Still, things haven’t turned outtoobadly. They’ve all got families. Mason, much happier, has made five solo albums. Greentree pursued carpentry. Jones and Maclean became film directors, the latter after actor Michael Fassbender liked the Beta Band videos and suggested collaborating. This led to the acclaimed 2015 experimental film Slow West. Maclean reveals that his new movie, Tornado, is loosely based on the Beta Band video forTrouble. “A samurai comes to Britain, suffering nightmares. But instead of me in it, it’s a Japanese actor called Kōki – and instead of Robin’s dad, it’s got Tim Roth.”Meanwhile, it’s hard to argue with how Mason sums up these upcoming tours: “A chance to see one of the greatest British bands of the last 30 years – before they turn us into holograms.”The Beta Band’s UK tour starts at Barrowland, Glasgow, on 25 September. A deluxe reissue of The Three EPs is released at the same time, with more to follow.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not content with a skull as a memento mori, he acquired the stone sarcophagus of pharaoh Seti I, which gapes like the mouth to the Underworld in the shadow-filled basement ofhis museumat Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Two hundred years on, at his country house at Ealing, his fellow spirit, the painter Alison Watt, stares at the world with the kind of bleak thoughts he savoured.Watt’s exhibition starts with a painting of a broken plaster cast of a classical child’s head. Like all her still lifes, it is done with precision and craft. It is also totally eerie. The white plaster child’s eyes are blank, devoid of pupils. There is a blue-shadowed hole, where the hollow head has been broken off from its body, opening a lane to the land of the dead. Uneasy? Good, then the ghost story can begin.Meticulous but unsettling paintings of folded white linen follow. Watt depicts their sharp creases, enigmatic dimples and empty overhangs with precise, patient attention. Yet her pristine sheets and tablecloths look unerringly spectral in Soane’s spooky old place. She doesn’t do anything flashy, just sticks to the facts, with one exception – you can’t tell exactly what surfaces the linens rest on. They exist in a pale limbo yet still, disturbingly, cast shadows. Every manicured cloth made me think of my winding sheet.View image in fullscreenThe Day After (detail) by Alison Watt.Photograph: Alison WattWait, here are some nice pink flowers! The first of these four floral still lifes is perfect, with creamily exact pink petals casting cool shadows on a nondescript surface. But in the next painting they are yellowing, then in the next serious decay has taken over. In the final picture the flowers are just about surviving, like us all.Has Watt never heard of a cameraphone?Of course, it is not exactly original to put intimations of decay and entropy into a still life – 17th-century paintings do it religiously. But Watt does more than just emulate painters of the past. Watching a flower rot or staring at a sheet of linen until it seems alive was a more common pursuit for artists in a world without technological distraction. It means something different and positively strange to look this hard at things nowadays.And Watt really does look hard. A painting of a blue and white porcelain cup and saucer captures not just every detail of its antique pattern, but the sheen and depth of the glaze in a little wonder of observation. Has Watt never heard of a cameraphone? Doesn’t she know you can have it “see” something for you in an instant? Plainly she prefers to actually look. And look.This rigorously empirical method raises paradoxically metaphysical questions. A large depiction of a sheet pinned up to a wall sways in the light. It’s just white cloth. Is that all there is? Or does something inhabit it? In fact this hanging cloth echoes a haunting, or haunted, masterpiece of religious art. In Francisco de Zurbarán’s c1660 paintingThe Sudarium of St Veronica, a white sheet is similarly slung up and on it is the blood-brown, miraculously preserved imprint of Christ’s face.No face appears on Watt’s white cloth. Nothing. It is a religious painting without a God. She watches for so long, but nothing happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These are not paintings from life but studies from death. Watt has done three still lifes, from different vantage points, of a death mask that survives in Soane’s collection. He bought it, a wall text tells us, thinking it was the death mask of a naval mutineer called Richard Parker. We are not told why he wanted such a grisly memento of a sailor hanged from a ship’s yardarm in 1797, or why the seller who conned him didn’t just sell it for what it was. For what Soane bought was the death mask of someone far more famous, Oliver Cromwell.Watt ironically gives the dead lord protector the same triple portrait treatment that Anthony van Dyck lavished on Charles I, whose death warrant Cromwell procured and signed. Unearthly light falls on the dead face, deep shadows overhang its eyes. Is there a ghost here, she seems to ask as she paints the death mask from different angles. No. Not even that. Just a great nothingness.It might be too sad a thought even for Soane.Alison Watt: From Light is at Pitzhanger Manor and Gallery, London, 5 March to 15 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designSir John Soane's MuseumLondonInstallationArtMuseumsExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

So I read it and it was great – I had forgotten how funny Roth is.I also enjoyedSimple Passionby Annie Ernaux, a completely different vibe. The short autofictional work is about an affair between the narrator, a divorced mother, and a younger married man, and the obsession and longing and lust that occurs. In the era of Babygirl, the sexual desires of older women are having something of a cultural moment. Simple Passion helped me a lot with the fact that I’m passing into a stage of life at a time when a lot of mainstream culture doesn’t really think older women are sexually desirable.Another book I read recently that I really liked was Nicola Dinan’sDisappoint Me. It follows a trans character who I could identify with a lot, not just because she’s trans but because she decides to pursue quite a heteronormative relationship. As the title indicates, it explores the fundamental point that building a sustainable love for someone involves them disappointing you: eventually, the dreams and expectations that we attach to a person will be somewhat compromised. I think the novel explores that so amazingly.Love in Exile by Shon Fayeis published by Allen Lane (£18).To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.Andrew, Guardian readerTheory& Practiceby Michelle de Kretser starts off as a conventional narrative but then it is upended. We eventually settle in to the main story about a student studying for a MA in English in Melbourne concentrating on Virginia Woolf’s later novels. From hereon in, the novel provides a critique of post modernism and literary theory, wrapped in a story revolving around the lives of the narrator’s friends and the university faculty members. It is extremely well written and a very enjoyable read.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Anyone who can write a laugh-out-loud novel about lynching is a genius as far as I’m concerned. Everett’s smart and nuanced skewering of American racial politics forges such an original path, it’s virtually a genre unto itself.On the theme of originality,The Coinby Yasmin Zaher is Palestinian literature like you’ve never seen it before. In the novel a young Palestinian woman moves to New York and proceeds to have a breakdown, but in the most delightfully absurd, unhinged and oddly chic manner.I love it when writers upend the expectations placed on them by their identity, and for that reason Torrey Peters’Detransition, Babyis one of my all-time favourite novels. She writes with brutal honesty about the trans experience, refusing to shy away from the dark sides, creating full-formed characters rather than political mouthpieces, and in doing so, allows the reader a full empathic experience.

Back in 2017, Moonlight became the best picture winner with the smallest ever budget (about $1.5m) and since then, films like Coda ($10m), Parasite ($11m) and Nomadland ($5m) have continued to bring indie films back to the main stage. This year, blockbusters likeWickedandDune: Part Twomight have scored major nominations but they had to settle for below-the-line wins, typically where bigger budget films have now tended to remain. The films that won above the line such asAnora($6m),The Brutalist($10m) and A Real Pain ($3m) relied on campaigns that stressed the importance of making a lot from a little and it meant that the night was ultimately another success story for independent film-making.Benjamin LeeA Wicked shame! In 2025, blockbuster success spells Oscars failureRead moreBob Dylan might have been right to no-showAs Oscar night stretched into its third hour – and boy did we all feel it – there was a strange absence of a consensus pick. Of course Anora would eventually triumph in that regard, but until the ceremony’s final straight, the Academy seemed to be taking a leaf from one of its presenters, Oprah: you get a prize, you get a prize, you get a prize. The Brutalist, Wicked, Dune Part 2, Conclave, A Real Pain, The Substance, even poor oldEmilia Perez– the love was being shared among awards season’s many darlings. Except for the film that plenty of us had down as this year’s purest crowdpleaser:A Complete Unknown. Was it the Academy’s general apathy towards music biopics? Or maybe it was just that a likable, if workmanlike, film couldn’t really stand out in such a varied field, where body horror rubbed up against scrappy indie comedies and sugar-rush musicals? Either way, A Complete Unknown ended up bringing nothing back home, and Dylan’s no-show was perfectly judged.Gwilym MumfordThe Oscars still can’t escape WeinsteinView image in fullscreenAdrien Brody accepts the award for best performance by an actor.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APDonald Trump might not have been named, but the spectre of another Hollywood villain – Harvey Weinstein – did put in an appearance. Accepting his best actor award,Adrien Brodyshouted out his partner, Georgina Chapman – who is Weinstein’s ex-wife – and her two children. Their lives had been, he said, a “rollercoaster”, but he was thankful they had accepted him. “Popsie’s coming home a winner!” he said, addressing them. Letting the world know that Weinstein’s children call Brody “Popsie” feels quite a statement.Catherine Shoard... but managed to forget Tony ToddThe Oscars were silent on Trump, diverging from protests of past yearsRead moreThe Oscars’in memoriamsegment always makes for a strangely traumatic and tense few minutes as you’re reminded again about the deaths of people who have been gone some time (Donald Sutherland died in June), the deaths of people you thought were still alive, and you keep watching to check they’ve remembered this or that big star. This year, some big names didn’t make the cut, including Michelle Trachtenberg, maybe because she was primarily a TV star. But Tony Todd, who took the lead in Candyman, and was also a major part of Final Destination, The Crow and more? That’s a bad miss with some nasty optics.Catherine ShoardThe streaming revolution isn’t quite here yetView image in fullscreenSean Baker, winner of the awards for best original screenplay, best film editing, best director, and best picture for Anora.Photograph: John Locher/Invision/APThis was supposed to be the year of the democratised Oscars – as in, Oscars not just for linear television but also streaming for the first time on Hulu, and thus available to the lowly people who pay for a bunch of streaming services instead of traditional cable. The Oscars for all, they said. Well. Tech glitches dogged the Hulu broadcast, most egregiously when the livestream “expired” just before Mikey Madison’s best actress win, preventing anyone reliant on Hulu to either scramble for a provider login to the ABC app or miss the final two awards. (Maybe Adrien Brody’s speech made Hulu give up?) It was an embarrassing night for the streamers overall – Netflix’s Emilia Pérez only took home two awards (out of 13 nominations), Sean Baker pointedly shouted out both independent films and movietheatres, and Conan O’Brien had a hard-hitting bit on “cinemastream”. The radical pitch? A screen the size of a thousand phones, which you don’t have to hold. His next pitch should be a bunch of TV channels available with one bill and one button.Adrian HortonA 50-piece orchestra is no match for Adrien BrodyIn 1942, best actress winner Greer Garson set a new record with a six-minute acceptance speech, which led to the Academy introducing a new 45-second limit. But it turns out if you win best actor, you get to negotiate with the orchestra when they try to play you off: two minutes into his heartfelt, but rambling acceptance speech,Adrien Brodybegged the conductor for more time. “I’m wrapping up, please turn the music off,” he said. “I’ve done this before. Thank you. It’s not my first rodeo, but I will be brief.” He really wasn’t. Cue 1,000 jokes about needing an intermission. Other nominees got played off while trying to thank their wives. It is almost like this awards ceremony isn’t egalitarian or something.Sian CainMadcap doesn’t always equal funView image in fullscreenHost Conan O’Brien and Kieran Culkin embrace during the Oscars.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/AMPAS/Reuters​After four years of being in safe, if a bit boring hands (sorry Kimmel), the Oscars felt refreshingly madcap with “four-time Oscar viewer” Conan O’Brien at the helm. Yes, his brief musical number dedicated to wasting time didn’t really work, but can you feel unhappy while watching that mad ringmaster dance with a cane in his hand, while a Dune sandworm plays the piano behind him? No you cannot. Did shouting at Adam Sandler for wearing a hoodie work? Not really. But a lot of his jokes did land (“If you haven’t seenConclave, it’s a movie about the Catholic church, but don’t worry.”), in a ceremony that felt notably muted when compared to 2024’s ceremony. Last year,we got a clapping dog and Ryan Gosling singing I’m Just Ken.Thank God for the sandworm.Sian Cain‘Don’t worry, I’m lawyered up!’: the best quotes of the 2025 OscarsRead moreHorror can’t catch a breakIt had felt like a major breakthrough for horror, a historically maligned genre suddenly getting unprecedented recognition from awards bodies that had previously turned their noses up. But gory, gloopy body horrorThe Substancewent in with five Oscar nominations and came away with just one win, slithering away with makeup and hairstyling. With previous winners in that category including The Wolfman and Bram Stoker’s Dracula, it wasn’t quite the major moment some in the industry had hoped for. Star Demi Moore was seen as the lead actress frontrunner and writer-director Coralie Fargeat had been viewed as a major contender for original screenplay but they both lost out to Anora, a far from traditional choice yet one that was in safer genre territory. Even the far more serious period horror Nosferatu couldn’t win in any of its four craft categories, rounding out a rather scary night for scary movies.Benjamin LeeThe ingenue is back in fashionGoing into the night, it had felt like the best actress race would be one highlighted by the power of telling stories of neglected older women: The Substance’sDemi Mooreat 62 playing an actor cast aside by a youth-obsessed industry and I’m Still Here’s Fernanda Torres at 59 as a wife and mother protecting her family against barbaric forces. While younger men are famously rejected in the lead actor category (Adrien Brody was the youngest and only under-30 pick at 29 for The Pianist in 2003), the lead actress category was once known for crowning a parade of young female actors. There was Marlee Matlin at 21, Jennifer Lawrence at 22, Grace Kelly at 25, Audrey Hepburn at 24 and so on until recently where the ingenue rule had been thrown out of the window, allowing women including Michelle Yeoh, Frances McDormand and Jessica Chastain to win. But Mikey Madison has shown a return to an older way of voting, at 25, she’s the ninth-youngest and the first under-30 winner since Brie Larson in 2016.Benjamin LeeTwo best actress fairytales become Oscar nightmaresView image in fullscreenDemi Moore arrives at the awards.Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/Rex/ShutterstockMikey Madison’s performance in Anora is remarkable, but it was hard not to feel sad forDemi Moore, who has had a magical run this awards season. We can only hope that The Substance marks a career return for her, and that we’ll continue to see her in really exciting and meaty roles (and perhaps another go at the best actress Oscar?). And what was once a fairytale story – that of Karla Sofía Gascón, the first transgender actor to ever be nominated for an Oscar – was undone through her own actions years before the ceremony, when she posted a series of racist and xenophobic tweets. In a way she got off lightly – O’Brien only made one joke (“Karla if you are going to tweet about the Oscars tonight, my name is Jimmy Kimmel.”) but to see her cringing in the audience, having skipped the red carpet and being left unnamed in Zoe Saldaña’s acceptance speech, felt like an ignominious end.Sian CainKieran Culkin belabours his big momentOscar campaigners will surely study the masterful manner with which A Real Pain’s supporting player (who let’s be honest, was the film’s real lead) approached awards season. Every speech had a feeling of dashed-off brilliance that one suspected was really carefully honed: a couple of lines of irreverent, “these awards ceremonies are a bit daft, aren’t they” joshing, and then, bam, hit them with the feels. But right at the death, Culkin made his first misstep as he accepted his best supporting actor prize with a long anecdote about his wife, Jazz Charton, promising him a fourth child if he won an Oscar (this a year after he had delivered a similar line about a third child at another awards ceremony). It felt, at best like a (probably harmless) private joke that was being shared on far too big a platform, and at worst, a little creepy, with the repeated suggestion of Charton “owing” Culkin a kid.Gwilym MumfordThe British winners are classily low keyView image in fullscreenDaniel Blumberg poses with his Oscar for best original score.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersTrust the Brits to reliably be a no-nonsense palate cleanser within the Oscars award speech buffet. This year, they offered us a string of first-time winners with some lessons for the pros: Wicked production design team Noah Crawley and Lee Sandales keeping it simple (Do a goofy dance to the stage! Thank your kids and spouse! Thank your team!) and not at all slick; Brutalist composer Daniel Blumberg, humble and gentle and refreshingly unafraid to just read from a cue card;Conclavescreenwriter Peter Straughan, calling out his jumper-stealing daughter; and Brutalist cinematographer Lol Crawley winning the award for just getting the speech done efficiently and with minimal fuss, with a pre-written and perfectly timed note. Manners! We love to see them.Dee JeffersonConclave makes a cardinal sinIt’s been a strange old season with frontrunners never seeming quite firm enough and with films that felt like unusual, often radical choices. There was a musical about witches, a comedy about a sex worker, an opera about a trans cartel boss, a body horror about a magic drug – not exactly conventional Oscar fare. So Conclave, a sturdy, exquisitely made adaptation of a Robert Harris novel filled with familiar older faces, started to seem like it could maybe be the obvious winner we had all brushed past. It was one of the most universally liked films of the season devoid of any controversy and when it won both the Bafta for best film and then the Screen Actors Guild ensemble award, it felt like maybe it could go on to win best picture. But it left the night with just a solitary award for best adapted screenplay, a traditional pick that maybe felt a little too traditional for a voter base that’s younger and more diverse than ever before.Benjamin LeeMick Jagger, a sandworm and when Harry remet Sally: inside the 2025 Oscars ceremony – in picturesAnalysis: The Oscars were silent on Trump, diverging from protests of past yearsConan’s Karla cracks and Timothée’s beaut zoot suit: Oscars 2025 viral moments3:04Oscars 2025: Anora takes it all, Adrien Brody’s second and Wicked dresses to impress – videoExplore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesKieran CulkinBob DylanCannes film festivalHarvey WeinsteinDonald SutherlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, my diet is full of fruit and veg – and I’ve got my mojo backLizzie CernikMon 3 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTShareWhen I got a nasty case of indigestion just before the UK-wide Covid lockdown in March 2020, I assumed it would pass in an hour. A pizza was the initial culprit, molten with cheesy goo and drenched in garlic dip. A week later, though, it hadn’t gone away and I was struggling to swallow due to a lump-like feeling in my throat.Like any neurotic thirtysomething, I assumed I was dying, so I trotted off to the GP. After several fruitless trips to specialists and various medications and investigations, I was diagnosed with gallstones and “functional dyspepsia”, the catch-all term for acid reflux, bloating, heartburn and upper digestive tract problems with no obvious cause.With no medical treatments on offer, I turned to my diet. I have never been especially unhealthy, but before lockdown I had a fast-paced lifestyle and prioritised what I enjoyed over what my body needed. I liked cooking, but the sheer volume of ready meals, with their sultry pictures plastered across the front, made them too tempting. I chucked packet sauces into stir-fries and pastas during the week and spent the weekends gorging on ready-made lasagnes or gastropub-inspired fish pies.I wasn’t struggling with my weight, but my stomach was telling me that something needed to change. During lockdown, I made the switch to whole foods – and I have never looked back. Breakfast is now vegetable omelettes, flaxseed porridge and homemade granola with fruit – all surprisingly quick and easy to prepare. Crumpets and bagels are only an occasional treat. I have traded the tangy sauces I loved for slow-cooked casseroles. I have even built a suitably pretentious open larder full of nice ingredients. The meals I cook help me stay full for longer and I have more stamina for weight training at the gym.The fibre phenomenon: 30 easy ways to get your fill of this life-changing nutrientRead moreSince my “whole-food revolution”, there has been growing discussion about thepotential dangers of ultra-processed foods (UPFs). Despite what the wellness warriors of Instagram will tell you, giving them up isn’t a panacea, especially for serious illnesses. However, the switch has helped me to build a healthier lifestyle based on nutrition, rather than calories. I don’t bother with influencer “hacks” such as protein shakes, overpriced supplements, low-fat sprays or intermittent fasting. I just pack my meals with fruit and veg, focusing on fibre, and try to keep junk-food snacks for the weekend.My functional dyspepsia hasn’t been cured, but I have definitely felt an improvement in my energy levels and my immune system. That mid-afternoon zombie feeling has long gone and I am sleeping better. Even more importantly, I have rediscovered my passion for cooking. I will always love food; it’s nice to be able to do so in a healthier way.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe one change that workedNutritionUltra-processed foodsFoodHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I realised how much pleasure I could wring out of lifePaula CocozzaMon 3 Mar 2025 01.55 ESTShareAs part of her training to be a counsellor, Jill Le Jeune gave a presentation about sex. Her group had worked with people who had experienced trauma, low mood, suicidal ideation. “And everyone was very comfortable around these difficult subjects,” she says. But talking about sex made them squirm. “I thought: actually, I’d rather talk about sex than suicide.” She decided to specialise in the subject and, at the age of 60, started to practise as a sex therapist.But why? “There was a curiosity,” she says, sitting in her office in Clapham, south-west London.A decade earlier, Le Jeune’s marriage had ended. “We had a very contented marriage. Great kids, lovely house, great holidays. We had an active sex life … When he left, I thought: what? I need to understand that.”As a psychosexual and relationship therapist, one of the first things Le Jeune asks clients is: “How did you learn about the birds and the bees?” Some say from watchingSexand the City. Le Jeune herself learned from educational videos at school, near Exeter in Devon. “It was about putting you off, basically. How not to get pregnant, not to get STIs.”All around her, teenage friends were getting pregnant. “I thought: I can’t do that.” Although she had been streamed to sit CSEs in secondary school, instead of the more academic GCEs, she went on to take A-levels and, at 19, started a degree in psychology and women’s studies at Lancaster University.I’m almost grateful for what happened to me. I’m so much more because of that marriage endingShe was the first member of her family to go to university – but sometimes she still thinks of herself as “CSE Jill”. She recalls, to the word, the first question of her CSE maths exam. But, looking back, the satisfaction she felt at how easy she found it is tinged with displeasure – “that that’s the level you’ve been put at”. Le Jeune turns 62 this year, but still believes she has “some really big gaps” in her knowledge: “I look up and I don’t know the names of any stars … I don’t know any chemical compounds.”Throughout her 20s, 30s and 40s, she worked in local government, sales and marketing, as a primary school teacher and then in compliance, while co-parenting four children. “In my 40s, I was half-asleep,” she says. “I did wonder, embarking on a postgrad at 57, could I do it?” But she says: “I think I am in the best place now.”She loves to hear the traffic outside her therapy room, the bustle of shoppers, “because I feel I’ve made it”. She has the same sense of breaking out into the world as she had after graduating at 22.“I’m almost grateful for what happened to me. I’m so much more because of that marriage ending.”She spent the first year after her divorce in shock. “I didn’t think so at the time. I just thought: get the tea on the table, keep everything going.” She took refuge in gardening – “very soothing” – and busied herself while the children did their homework.“I had to go through therapy and then go on this journey,” she says. Now, she is able to “nurture the ability to focus on the here and now”.In many ways, Le Jeune was her own first client.“I operate as a feminist. I recognise and I regret that I didn’t keep my career up more. And I didn’t advocate for myself sexually, either,” she says. “When I was reading all this stuff about female arousal, I thought: why didn’t I insist on my own needs being met more?”She has supported her partner of five years through prostate cancer and navigated the impact of his illness on their intimate life, something she says “the NHS gives minimal support for. We worked it all out for ourselves. I had the knowledge.“I love my life,” Le Jeune says. “I’m amused by CSE Jill. I know how much I have grown and developed. I sit here and people think I can make a really significant impact on their lives. And what greater thing than that?”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60SexCounselling and therapyDivorcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We did not realise that our HSBC debit card had somehow been linked to heriPhoneand had no idea that she could spend so easily. She was not aware that the money she was spending was real money.She has been sending money toYouTubechannels and the YouTubers have then befriended her on Roblox in an attempt to make more moneyfrom our child. To me, this is financial grooming. HSBC did not once alert us to these suspicious transactions. Apple initially rejected our claim for a refund,then, on appeal, agreed to refund only two payments totalling £60 because they were unauthorised purchases by a minor, even though the others were made in the same circumstances. We are desperate.Name and location withheldThis is a staggering story on many levels. Your daughter managed to make 270 payments over three months without you noticing and without the bank orAppleflagging up suspicious activity. You told me she has her own iPhone and her own Apple ID, which allows her to log in to Apple services without you being notified. Children under 13 are not permitted to apply for a personal Apple ID. You say you have no idea how your debit card came to be linked to her account. Some of the money was spent on YouTube Super Chat and Super Stickers, which is how YouTubers can monetise their channels. Essentially, their viewers can pay for their live chat messages to be highlighted or pinned to the top of a chat feed.Roblox and other online gaming services, meanwhile, allow users to pay real money for virtual merch and privileges. On one day alone, your daughter made six payments of £49.99 to Apple and one of £6.99. You sent me a screenshot of a YouTuber pulling up your daughter’s online profile on a live video to see who was spending so much money. Her profile photo clearly showed a young child. In another video, a YouTuber offered to add her as a friend on Roblox if she paid out more.This virtual jungle is a mystery to many parents, including me, which is why it’s essential that parental controls are activated and in-app purchases supervised orturned offif children are given smartphones. In my view, an eight-year-old has no business having an iPhone, let alone their own Apple ID, and you have most painfully realised your mistake.While you acknowledge you bear much of the responsibility for this, HSBC and Apple have questions to answer. Juvenile spending sprees on apps are not as unusual as they should be and both companies should have flagged concerns about the series of transactions on the account. In 2014, the US Federal Trade Commissionordered Apple to pay out $32.3m(£24.6m) to reimburse American parents for unauthorised app purchases made by their children. Some children had run up bills of several thousand dollars, although I’ve never heard of a bill as large as yours.When I contacted the company it instantly decided, much to my surprise, to refund the entire amount. The money was paid the following day. It told me it does not comment on individual cases but assured me an adviser would call you and guide you through safeguards to prevent this happening again.HSBC said its controls are designed to balance security, convenience and consumer demand, and that your mobile banking app and mailed statements should have alerted you, which indeed they should. As for Roblox and YouTube, the former said that it does not impose spending limits on children’s accounts because it’s up to parents to supervise their on-screen activity, but it does have tools to help parents manage their child’s account remotely. It says it can’t refund payments made via third parties, such as Apple.YouTube said there were daily purchase limits on Super Chat and that a refund could be requested if the charge was unauthorised or accidental. If purchases are made through an Apple account or device, refunds have to be applied for through Apple.It went on to say that if it is discovered that an account holder is under 13 and using YouTube without parental supervision, the account is closed. There are three levels of controls which can be used by parents to limit what preteen and teen children can see.Hopefully, you can use this ordeal as an excuse to confiscate your daughter’s iPhone until she is older. But if and when she is allowed her own screen, it’s essential you­create an Apple IDfor her within your family group, rather than allow her to create her own or to use yours – which will be linked to your bank card. This will automatically triggerAsk to Buy,which notifies you when a download or purchase is attempted.Explore more on these topicsMoneyYour problems, with Anna TimsConsumer affairsConsumer rightsHSBCiPhoneYouTubeApplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Your first task is to decide on their replacements, and for that you have a few options. “I useaquafabaand whisk it with apple cider vinegar, rapeseed oil, dijon mustard, unsweetened soya milk and water,” she says. She then combines plain flour, chickpea flour, salt and turmeric (“for a bit of colour”), and whisks that into the wet mix to make a batter.Marc Joseph, ofE3 Vegan, meanwhile, prefers a combination of soya milk, baking powder and self-raising flour: “I’ve tried all sorts of things,” he says, “and baking powder gives the best results.” Once mixed with the flour and popped into a really hot oven, “they rise quickly like a cake at the start, so, by the time they’re cooked, you have really crisp edges”. That’s also Gaz Oakley’s preferred route. For 12 yorkshire puddings, the author ofPlant to Plate, published in May, combines 260g self-raising flour, one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt. “Add 480ml soya milk, whisk until smooth, then pour into a jug.” Just like the OG, vegan yorkies also benefit from a rest, Joseph says: “Make the batter at least 30 minutes before you want to use it.”On to the baking vessel, for which Davis favours a metal muffin tin: “This is thereallyimportant part,” she says, “otherwise your yorkshire puddings are going to come out like pancakes!” Both Oakley and Davis pour oil into each hole of the tin (about two teaspoons in total of vegetable oil for Oakley and 3-4mm rapeseed oil per hole for Davis), then whack it in a hot oven (210C-220C) until smoking. “As soon as you open the oven door, quickly take out the pan and pour in the batter,” Davis says. “Grab a spoon and make a small indent in the top of each yorkshire, so it has that natural collapse.” Oakley bakes his batter for 16 minutes “until golden brown and nicely risen”, Davis gives it about 30 minutes and Joseph opts for 45-50 minutes.Shaun Rankin, chef/patron ofShaun Rankin at Grantley Hallin North Yorkshire, has another tip: “Make a little well in the centre of the mix with an oiled spoon halfway through the cooking,” he says. “This allows the edges to rise further.”Oakley serves his yorkshires right away, but Davis recommends giving them a rest: “Vegan ones have more of a gooey texture than those made with egg, so you need to let them cool for at least 30 minutes on a rack,” she says. The proof, of course, is in the pudding, and Joseph ensures that his are “even better” by pouring onion gravy into the well just before serving. And as we all know,everythingis better with gravy.Got a culinary dilemma?

It was home to the Lefferts family, descendants of the Dutch settlers who had first arrived in 1624 in what would become New York.In late 2020, the landmark plaque presented a fairly innocuous narrative about the house, noting, that both “indentured white[s] and enslaved black[s]” built it and worked on the surrounding land. For the average passerby, the blurbs offered a chronology centered on settlement, conquest, and innovations in farming. For the discerning viewer, they were a mere summary of how Lenape lands were seized by Dutch colonists then British colonists, flattening the weight and presence of history at their feet.But a recent exhibit, Trace/s: Family History Research and the Legacy ofSlaveryin Brooklyn, underscores just how incomplete the record remains, and how it fails to account for the lives and humanity of the formerly enslaved.Looking back on landmarks of US Black history from an era of erasure – in picturesRead moreThe modest exhibition, at the Center for Brooklyn History through August, contains 10 archival documents: bills of sales, journals, manumissions, newspaper clippings, photographs and ledgers. These items are paired with striking oil portraits of two representative members of Brooklyn families whose legacies are inextricably bounded together by slavery: John A Lott and Mildred Jones, a Brooklyn-born descendant of Samuel Anderson, who was enslaved by the Lott family.Trace/s asks its viewers to examine the archive and to face unsettling truths about the United States, as well as to upend dominant and simplistic narratives about the voracity of antislavery forces of the industrial north, namelyNew YorkCity’s history with centuries of enslavement.View image in fullscreenMildred Jones.Photograph: Center for Brooklyn HistoryThe Lefferts House, preserved for posterity and listed in the US registry of historic places, once occupied the present-day intersection of Maple Street and Flatbush Avenue, and was moved to its permanent home in Prospect Park in 1918. At one point as many as 25 enslaved persons toiled the farmland during the era of the house’s construction from 1783 to 1827, the year that New York state formally abolished slavery.New York’s emancipation history was fraught with the demands of enslavers, who claimed that freedom for enslaved people was at odds with a 1799 law that facilitated gradual emancipation for certain enslaved children and promised their forced labor until their mid-20s. In practice, emancipation for the “formerly” enslaved in 1827 New York didn’t materially change their lot. Many remained in servitude through the 1830s and 1840s in the Brooklyn areas known today as Flatbush and Flatlands.Along with their southern counterparts, the planter class of wealthy families of Brooklyn profited greatly from slavery and built generational wealth through exploitation. Slave-owning families constituted 40% of Brooklyn households. As their wealth accrued, they consolidated civic and social power, and their names are known today because they are emblazoned on street signs and subway stops, landmarks and monuments throughout Brooklyn: Bergen, Nostrand, Stuyvesant, Vanderbilt, Van Brunt. To continue to describe the colonial era lands of Brooklyn as “farmland”, as the exhibit does, obfuscates the full story of New York City’s history and relationship to slavery. In the colonial era and throughout the 19th century, Brooklyn’s farmland was the second-largest producer of food for the rapidly expanding city. These farms were plantations.The evidence of enslaved Black people’s existence and subjugation – usually their names – are almost always found in the records white people kept. But what does one make of the absence of evidence? One of the documents on view includes Lefferts family papers of an 1814 bill of sale of Mercy, a nine-year-old girl. She was sold by Phebe Lefferts to Abraham Vanderveer, and the documents included a notable stipulation of the conditions of her servitude. Mercy would be taught to read and write, as well as have “sufficient meat and drink, washing, lodging, and apparel” until she turned 18. The magistrate was also instructed to add that Mercy should “behave herself”.View image in fullscreenJohn Lott.Photograph: Center for Brooklyn HistoryThese caveats outlined in the sale require discernment from historians and archivists to telegraph to viewers the intimate nature of relationships between enslavers and the enslaved. Could Mercy have been the child of the enslaver? With New York’s incremental moves toward abolition, was it Phebe Lefferts’ intention to ensure that Mercy was cared for under the servitude of her new enslaver? To insist, for instance, that an enslaved child was to be taught to read and write, which was illegal, might suggest as much. What happened to Mercy after the sale, especially when she turned 18 in 1832, five years after New York State abolition law took effect, remains unknown.Trace/s tries to address the absence of the enslaved and their stories within the archive through newspaper clippings from one of the largest local papers of the time, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. An 1898 profile of Samuel Anderson, under the headline, Born A Slave in Flatbush: Uncle Sammy’s Reminiscences of Slavery Days, aims to give the formerly enslaved some voice and agency. Still, the story of Anderson, who was 88 at the time of publication, was filtered through the lens of whiteness.While a remarkable document, the article is an example of what Toni Morrison wrote about in The Site of Memory, when, in slave narratives, the authors censor and shield the reader from the brutality of their bondage, saying: “Let us drop a veil over these proceedings too terrible to relate.” Morrison adds: “In shaping the experience to make it palatable to those who were in a position to alleviate it, they were silent about many things.” The exhibit elucidates this reality.An unassuming building in New York City educated Black leaders. What will become of it?Read moreTrace/s acknowledges the decades-long efforts of local activists and historians who have been working to recover the record of the formerly enslaved and their descendants. Groups such as the Afro American Historical and Genealogical Society, formed in 1977, have sought to address the complications of the traditional archives, underscoring how racism’s long reach impedes this kind of research for Black Americans.In her 1882 book, The Social History of Flatbush, and Manners and Customs of the Dutch Settlers in Kings County, Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt bemoaned the erasure of Dutch influences in a rapidly modernizing Brooklyn at the end of the 19th century, writing, “Nearly every trace of Dutch descent has been swept away; there only remain the reminiscences and traditions, while the old family names mark the localities still, as the projecting peaks mark the submerged rock. All that relates to home and kindred has its interest, especially when we know that the home is soon to be broken up and the ties of kindred sundered.”Vanderbilt’s lament in this volume seems melodramatic. Twenty-first century Brooklyn’s streets and neighborhoods are imprinted with the names of the settlers and their descendants, with busts and plaques aplomb to honor and acknowledge their lives. The evidence of their existence is everywhere. Their final resting place at the Flatbush Reformed Dutch church cemetery, at the intersection of Church and Flatbush, is preserved to this day.That fact stands in stark contrast to untold hundreds of formerly enslaved and free Blacks who walked the roads and paths of pre-civil war Brooklyn. In 2021, a grassroots campaign sought to draw attention to this history legacy hidden in plain sight by the residents of neighborhoods in Bedford Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and Flatbush. When excavation for a new housing development began, aburial groundfor enslaved Africans was uncovered. Local groups pushed city officials to pause construction and later secured a $4m commitment from New York City’s parks department for a memorial in 2022. But it’s unclear when those plans will be implemented.This is the powerful mark that Trace/s impresses upon its viewers. It is a call to all descendants to look backward in order to move forward.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkBrooklynRaceBlack US cultureSlaveryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She described one large specimen, measuring at least 1 metre long, found in sediments under shallow waters about 180km north of Sydney.The species was namedEunice dharastiiafter the fisheries scientist Dr Dave Harasti, who managed to entice the iridescent worm out of its underwater tube by dangling an offering of fish head over the burrow.View image in fullscreenThe sea wormEunice dharastii.Photograph: Dr Dave HarastiHutchings said another sea worm species, found in the Kimberley region of northern Australia, was long enough to be slung around her neck like a feather boa.Hutchings said even though worms might be gathered together as one group of animals, they were incredibly diverse in their forms, behaviour and reproductive strategies.“We’ve got this amazing biodiversity in Australia,” she said, including thousands of worm species.

It is also the name of asymbolthat represents the nature of life’s journey and the characteristics required to thrive in it.The museum is in Ada, about 100 miles (160km) east of the capital, Accra, and has become a place for people, mostly those of African descent, to confront the past through art and education. The 46-hectare (115-acre) site houses Akoto-Bamfo’s studio, features a visual archive of African history and culture, including models of Indigenous architecture, and pays homage to aspects of black history that are often overlooked – such as the contribution of soldiers from African countries in the first and second world wars. Visitors can choose to stay overnight at accommodation on site and take part in art workshops, pilgrimages, naming ceremonies and initiation rites.View image in fullscreenAbout 3,500 clay head sculptures are displayed in a clearing at the Nkyinkyim Museum. The aim is to complete 11,111 of themAkoto-Bamfo, 42, who made the first sculpture of a head in 2009, says he was compelled to start the project after years of feeling “a very strong desire to do something”.View image in fullscreenAkoto-Bamfo made his first sculpture of a head in 2009, and founded the Nkyinkyim Museum in 2019Growing up, he experienced the legacies of colonialism. Ghana achieved independence from the British in 1957. At school, teachers preferred people with European accents, he remembers; and a university education and spending time abroad were highly valued. “The closer you were to whiteness, the better for you in our societies. And even to a large extent, it’s the same now,” he says.But he knew it was wrong. “There’s always something innate that draws your attention to humanity and human rights and justice … You notice something needs to be addressed and that’s what happened for me.”He adds: “It was representation. It was telling our side of the story … I knew I wanted to address the anger and the pain and the frustrations.”Head sculptures are a way of documenting family portraits of the dead among the Akans, the largest and most prominent ethic group in Ghana, to which Akoto-Bamfo belongs. For generations, this practice served to commemorate African ancestors until colonialism misrepresented it as linked with evil, and pushed it to the sidelines.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAckah Komla Swanzy, an artist andgriot,stands amid some of the thousands of sculptures at the Nkyinkyim MuseumEach head takes Akoto-Bamfo up to three weeks to complete. He has a team of apprentices who help. Some, he says, are based on visions, but many are likenesses of real people. At first, he used family and friends as inspiration, but now he gets requests and photos from all over the world. The only requirement is that an individual should have a relative who is black.There are now more than 3,500 sculptures, but the aim is to make and display 11,111 heads, a number that symbolises unity for Akoto-Bamfo.Within the clearing are baobab and acacia trees, known for their medicinal properties. It is a sacred place where traditional priests and priestesses come to pray, and to conduct ceremonies and processions.View image in fullscreenThe heads surround baobab trees, which are known for their medicinal propertiesVisitors include school groups as well as many African Americans and others from the diaspora. Hollywood actor Samuel L Jackson featured the project inhis series Enslaved, the vice-president of Costa Rica has visited, and so has the US ambassador and the deputy British high commissioner in Ghana.Visits can be highly charged and emotional. Akoto-Bamfo has seen people cry, laugh as well as get angry. He has been at the receiving end of people’s grievances around slavery and other continuing human rights abuses. Some people have asked why he allows white people into the space.View image in fullscreenThe museum site also features a visual archive of African history and culture“Sometimes, when people vent to me, they forget I am also black and I’m also African,” he says. “They will pour their grievances into me like I was the other and, even though I know that is not their intention, that’s a lot to take in.”The psychological load has taken its toll on Akoto-Bamfo. In 2020, he started having panic attacks and has had to seek medical treatment on a few occasions.View image in fullscreenVisitors from Germany and the UK take part in an art workshop led by Akoto-BamfoHe began therapy and has learned to control what he takes on, though he admits, his is “a tough role to play”. One day, he would like to be able to rest, but for now he can’t see beyond his “sweet burden”, finishing the 11,111 sculptures he has committed to.The project is entirely funded by Akoto-Bamfo through art commissions and public appearances. “The bravest thing you can do as an artist is to pick up an uncomfortable human rights issue because people want to be happy with art,” he says. “People want to sip wine and feel good about themselves.”View image in fullscreenStatues of twins, meant to represent healing, stand at the entrance to the clearingExplore more on these topicsGhanaAfricaSlaveryMuseumsSculptureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The half-hour journey each way was especially treacherous when the rains came and Bhattarai, who was born without arms, sometimes had to ask classmates to help carry him, too.Now in his twenties, he is at college studying history and enjoys writing poetry and listening to rappers including Eminem and Nepal’s Yama Buddha. But his true passion is art, he says, as he shares a sketch of an open palm holding a butterfly, drawn with his feet.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBikram Bhattarai, a college student from Gangtok in Sikkim who was born without arms, loves art and has taught himself to draw with his feet“Seeing my big sister inspired me. Seeing how she used her hands, I started using my toes the same way,” says Bhattarai. His story is one of 100 collected in a new book by photographerVicky Roy,who has spent four years travelling across India’s 28 states and eight territories capturing the experiences of people living with the21 disabilitiesrecognisedby the Indian government.For the project, Roy spends a day with each subject and their stories are translated and published, one a week, by volunteers. “I focus on the person, not the disability; to show them not as objects of pity but as ordinary human beings pursuing their simple everyday dreams,” he says.View image in fullscreenPhotographer Vicky Roy collected 100 stories of people living with disabilities to include in the bookWith its title written in English and braille, the book is part of a 10-yearprojectof the same name, Everyone is Good at Something (EGS), launched in 2021. In February, Roy presented his work at theJaipur literature festivaland has also shown it at the UN in New York and Delhi, with exhibitions in Japan and elsewhere.EGS grew out of a mission by Roy and VR Ferose, founder of theIndia Inclusion Foundation(IIF), to spread awareness and combat taboos by sharing stories of disability over 10 years and beyond. The IIF aims to “make India inclusive” by 2030, the UN deadline for achieving the sustainable development goals.Stigma around disability in India is reflected by the fact that the census records only about2% of the populationas having disabilities, compared with a world average of about 15%. This suggests families are hiding issues, and many may not know about rights enshrined in India’s 2016Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, says Ferose.View image in fullscreenVicky Roy, right, with VR Ferose, founder of the India Inclusion Foundation“Attitudes have been slowly changing around disability in India,” says Ferose, an engineer based in California, who began working on disability rights after his son was born with autism. “I believe many respond [to the stories] because we’re helping invisible people be seen, especially in rural areas … others want to support them.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenManisha Kumari Mahto, who was born with cerebral palsy, is unable to speak but communicates using signIn Huppu village in eastern Jharkhand, Manisha Kumari Mahto’s parents Mahto and Savita Devi at first believed she could be cured when she was born with cerebral palsy. The little girl is unable to move about or speak, but communicates through signs. “I love listening to songs and I try to dance to them,” she says.Roy has travelled by plane, bus, bike, bullock cart and on foot, even during the pandemic, since he began the project in 2021. It was in remote rural areas that he often received the warmest welcome, he says, and would leave with parcels of food for the journey home. He estimates he has covered about 62,000 miles (100,000km) for EGS.View image in fullscreenChhotray Hembram lost his feet as a baby and uses his knees to walkIt took him three days to reach Chhotray Hembram, who lives in the tribal region of Ghatkuanri in Bangriposi Tehsil, in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha.

So not only did we write the stories but behind the scenes we also supported people, building a roof in a school, donating a laptop, buying a wheelchair or disability vehicle, giving cricket balls and more.”The book relates many encounters with those who have helped expand opportunities in education, sport or work.Satyavati Pandranki was five when she contracted polio in Mentada, in Andhra Pradesh, and says her parents wanted to give her “the best education possible” so that she could lead an independent life, after the disease limited her mobility.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSatyavati Pandranki has limited mobility after contracting polio as a child.

The original plan had been to meet in the capital but, unnerved by such a large number of women, the Chinese authorities had insisted they stay a safe distance from the city in the settlement of Huairou, much of which was still under construction.The government’s distrust ran deep: hotels were provided with extra blankets in case the women decided to stage an impromptu naked protest; movement between Beijing and Huairou was strictly controlled; and the unseasonal rain was blamed on a concentration of women menstruating.View image in fullscreenA volunteer hands out posters for the UN Women’s Conference in Beijing, August 1995.Photograph: Mike Fiala/APBut neither the weather nor the slights could dampen spirits at what proved to be an extraordinary event: the NGO Forum onWomen.Running parallel tothe UN’s Fourth World Conference on Womenat the Beijing International Convention Centre, the forum welcomed 30,000 feminist leaders, rights advocates, Indigenous activists, NGO representatives and academics from 180 countries.It was the largest international gathering of women the world had ever seen, and aseminal momentin the women’s rights movement. “Beijing was the culmination [of years of work]. As [feminist writer] bell hooks put it, we had been trying to move from the margins to the centre – and that’s what was so exciting,” says Charlotte Bunch, founding director of the Center for Women’s Global Leadership at Rutgers University in the US.Participants tramped through mud in the half-built town to attend networking and strategy events in tents; they got soaked riding open-top tourist buses to the official UN conference in Bejing. But it all heightened the sense of camaraderie.View image in fullscreenA sea of umbrellas surrounds the building where Hillary Clinton spoke on 5 September 1995.Photograph: Tao Chuan Yeh/AFP/Getty ImagesOver 11 days, issues such as affirming women’s rights as human rights; violence against women; reproductive rights; and the welfare of the girl child were discussed and debated. The result was the landmarkBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action– a document covering 12 critical areas that, 30 years on, remains the historic blueprint for gender equality.“It was amazing – women of every colour and age and disability and race all fighting for equality and doing things in a very organised and coordinated way. We had an advocacy strategy and all this energy that felt powerful – and we really managed to influence the agenda,” says Ana Cristina González, who was a 27-year-old newly qualified doctor specialising in reproductive health when she went to China as part of the Latin American delegation.“It made me feel [that] what I dreamed was possible. That meeting marked my entire career and my feminism,” she adds.View image in fullscreenThe Beijing conference in 1995 was the largest international gathering of women the world had ever seen.Photograph: undefined/UN PhotosThe sense that Beijing was transformative, personally and politically, is echoed by countless women, many of whom went on to become leaders in the women’s movement. “The atmosphere was incredible. I’d never sat with someone from Tibet or the Middle East – there was excitement and a feeling that we could achieve a lot,” says Lydia Alpízar Durán, co-executive director of IM-Defensoras, a Latin American network of female defenders. “We got a lot done in Beijing. Beyond the government agreement we built a global women’s movement. Beijing catalysed so many processes.”View image in fullscreenHillary Clinton spoke on 5 September 1995 in Beijing, delivering the line: ‘Human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all.’Photograph: Sharon Farmer/White House PhotographIt was far from easy. Months of preparation went into national and regional strategies to ensure the agenda reflected grassroot demands; debates were fierce and lengthy. The text of the declaration was pored over, word by word, until there was agreement. The Chinese authorities didn’t tolerate public protest but when women thought they were being ignored they found ways to show their disapproval – at one point the Latin American delegation blocked the escalators at the conference centre.Indian feminist Gita Sen, founder of Developing Alternatives with Women for a New Era (Dawn), says: “One of the big moments was when the [then] president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, came in.“Wolfensohn was viewed as more liberal [than previous presidents]; his wife was considered a feminist. I think he thought he would get congratulated but he got a shellacking – people screamed at him: ‘Do you know what you have done to our lives? You and the IMF are destroying us.’ I think he was genuinely shocked, but he went back and tried to soften some of the [bank’s] policies.”View image in fullscreenA plainclothes policeman ushers a woman with a megaphone to prevent her disrupting traffic.Photograph: Will Burgess/ReutersWhenHillary Clinton, wife of the then US president Bill Clinton, made her speechin Beijing declaring “women’s rights as human rights, once and for all”, the world listened – but the credit goes to the thousands of women who had worked tirelessly in the years before in their own countries and at key UN conferences, includingViennain 1993 andCairoin 1994.“Up until 1980 women’s events were on the sidelines – they were not viewed at the core of anything the UN was doing. And today we are in the backlash against all those things that we were moving forward,” says Bunch.Bunch was one of a group of women who came up with the16 days of activism campaign in 1991. Also among them was Everjoice Win, a Zimbabwean who had been working in women’s rights since 1989. Both women went to Beijing.“I have often described the early 1990s as the golden era of transnational organising: there were these spaces – Mexico, Cairo, Vienna, Beijing – some of us went to all four [UN conferences]. But it wasn’t just going, but having an agenda collectively to influence the advancement of women’s rights. Everyone had purpose and objectives,” says Win.View image in fullscreenEthiopian women talk during the NGO forum.

Once they understood what gender mainstreaming was we were able to influence the leadership of the organisation, making sure women were in senior roles.”Next week in New York, the UN’s commission on the status of women (CSW) will mark the 30th anniversary of the Beijing declaration.UN secretary general António Guterres will open the meeting on Monday with a declaration on the global state of gender equality. The statement will be based on aprogress report, informed by updates from 159 governmentsand acknowledges improvements. Today, 122.4 million girls are out of school, down from 124.7 million in 2015. Maternal mortality has declined from 339 to 223 deaths in every 100,000 live births between 2000 and 2020. Since 1995, the proportion of women in parliaments has more than doubled from 11% to 27%. Countries have also steadily continued to remove discriminatory laws.Such stocktakes on gender equality are made every five years, but this year the sense of urgency is greater, because, despite improvements in some areas, “cascading crises” including the climate disaster, economic shocks, rising conflict and declining democracy mean the vision of the Platform for Action – and the 2030 SDGs – remains a distant dream.In this unstable environment, anti-women sentiment and action has thrived, turbocharged by authoritarian governments and social media. “Growing backlash has been reinforced by the hollowing out of policy mechanisms, institutions and processes that the [Beijing] Platform for Action tasked with advancing gender equality,” the report says.We can’t forget we were the people who pushed back an unequal world – we were pushing back and transformingAna Cristina González, activistThe fact that the rightwing, anti-abortion Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam) is holding its own two-day conference in parallel with CSW at a venue opposite the UN headquarters, is evidence of a more strategic, better funded, smarter anti-rights movement. Like many anti-feminist organisations, it has co-opted the language of women’s development with its assertions that it is “empowering women” – while welcoming President Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid which will havedevastating effectson women and girls.View image in fullscreenHong Kong delegate Fong Siu Mei holds a one-woman demonstration outside her county’s delegation tent in Huairou, 30 August 1995.Photograph: Mike Fiala/AP“In my view, we are experiencing an epochal transformation,” says Brazilian academic Sonia Corrêa, co-chair of Sexuality Policy Watch. “There are no easy solutions. The state of the world is a very difficult problem, the conditions are being determined by neo-fascist forces in power in what is still one of the empires of the world.”It could mean there is no intergovernmental agreement at CSW this year if the US blocks, Corrêa believes. “I don’t need to elaborate how deeply the ultra right hate the UN.”What is gender apartheid – and can anything be done to stop it?Read more“It’s a worrying moment,” agrees Win. “The question is: are others going to mimic the orange tyrant – I refuse to use his name – by doing what he does or [are they going to] counter him?”But if the contemporary political landscape is very different from the 1990s “golden era” of trust in democracy, multilateralism and institutions, the lessons learned from Beijing are still relevant, say the women who were there.View image in fullscreenRigoberta Menchú (centre), a K’iche’ Guatemalan human rights activist and Nobel laureate, speaking in Huairou in 1995.Photograph: Claudia Ferreira/Getty Images“We can’t forget we were the people who pushed back an unequal world – we were pushing back and transforming. We spent years explaining and showing the world there were inequalities and that we wanted to be better. We are fighting for democracies, so we can not think only ‘howare we going to react?’ but ‘what are we going tocontinuedoing?’” says González, who now heads Causa Justa, the group that spearheaded the campaign to decriminalise abortion in Colombia – afight it won in 2022.There is some comfort, they say, in stepping back from the chaos and taking a longer view. Bunch says, “I grew up in the 50s and became part of the 60s’ explosion; yes, it is scary now, the power that Trump has but there are ups and downs and we are in a down period. People fighting McCarthyism had faith there would come another time. I don’t want to dampen the energy of the outrage – but in the down period you have to be preparing to move forward where you can. This is our moment, and we have to do the best we can.”Or as Win puts it: “Change is going to come. But we remind ourselves that change is not microwaveable – change has to be baked or roasted – microwaving ain’t going to do it.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen's rights and gender equalityWomenUnited NationsFeminismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hospitals have been attacked, medical supply lines disrupted and many doctors have been killed in the Israeli bombardment. Other physicians have been detained.Dr Khaled Serris a surgeon at Nasser hospital inGaza. He says he was arrested after his hospital was attacked by the Israeli military. Like other doctors in Gaza, he says he thinks he was held because of his job. He tells Hannah Moore he was beaten, humiliated and endured terrible conditions before he was released without charge.Annie Kellyis the editor of the Guardian’s Rights and Freedom series. Along withHoda Osmanfrom Arab Reporters for Investigative journalism, she spoke to eight doctors who say they were held and tortured in Israeli prisons. She explains that the IDF says it is operating to restore security to the citizens of Israel and that it arrested people suspected of terrorist activities, and that those who were not involved in terrorist activities were released back to Gaza as soon as possible.Annie tells Hannah what the effect of the doctors’ imprisonment has meant, not just for the medics themselves but for the healthcare system in Gaza.Composite: Ahmed MuhannaExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warToday in FocusGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaDoctors"

It made a call for $147m in donations to help some of those in need even beforeDonald Trumpstarted cutting US foreign aid.The WFP provides food assistance to more than 150 million people in 120 countries, it says. It won the Nobel peace prize in 2020 and its six leaders since 1992 have been Americans, including current executive director Cindy McCain, the widow of the former US senator John McCain.Few UN agencies have been specific about the impact of the US aid cuts.The UN’s International Organization for Migration reportedly has cut 3,000 jobs linked to resettlement in the US, and family planning agency UNFPA has estimated that a number of its operations will be affected.Many UN aid agencies have said they are still assessing the impact and remain unclear about whether some programmes or projects will benefit from waivers that could allow US donations to continue to flow.Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsAfricaDonald TrumpAidFood securityFood povertynewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement led to a sharp sell-off on Wall Street.All Mexican exports to the US are set to face a levy of 25% under the plans. Most Canadian exports will face a 25% tariff, with energy products facing a 10% duty.1:27No room left for negotiation with Canada and Mexico on tariffs, says Trump – videoA 10% levy on China – introduced last month – will be doubled to 20%, according to an executive order released by the White House.China’s commerce ministry on Tuesday vowed countermeasures that it said were aimed at safeguarding its rights and interests. The US had “shifted the blame” and is using its problems with the deadly drug fentanyl as an excuse to impose tariffs, the ministry said in a statement.The US has argued that China supplies chemicals used in fentanyl production. China has denied wrongdoing. China urges the US to “immediately withdraw” its unilateral tariff measures that are “unreasonable and groundless, harmful to others,” the ministry said.But at a news conference, Trump told reporters tariffs were a “very powerful weapon”.The actions are set to prompt swift retaliation. “We’re ready,” said the Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau issued astatementon Monday, calling the US tariffs “unjustified” and vowing to immediately respond with a 25% tariff of their own.“Our tariff will remain in place until the US trade action is withdrawn,” Trudeau said, while urging the US to reconsider the tariffs. “Tariffs will disrupt a very successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.”Wall Street fell sharply after Trump’s remarks, with the S&P 500 down 1.7%, the Dow Jones industrial average down 1.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping over 2.6%.The tariffs will affect $900bn in annual imports from Canada and Mexico. The Ford CEO, Jim Farley, has warned they threaten to “blow a hole” in US industry.Trump has reluctantly conceded in recent weeks that higher tariffs could lead to higher prices in the US, but suggested the impact would be worth the cost. He has brushed off calls to tread carefully, escalating threats to go further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He described the levies as a “a powerful weapon” that other presidents had not used because “they were dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form”.Trump even took a swipe at Republican hero and staunch free-trader president, Ronald Reagan. “I’m a huge fan of Ronald Reagan but he was very bad on trade,” said Trump.Tariffs are “an act of war, to some degree”, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett warned recently. “Over time, they are a tax on goods,” hetold CBS News. “I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ’em!”On Monday, Trump also pledgedto impose tariffs on overseas agricultural goods within weeks. He claimed his administration would introduce tariffs on farm products from 2 April.A string of such deadlines – including vows to hit Canada andMexicowith tariffs in January, and then February – have been delayed, however, as economists and business leaders urge caution.“To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social network, on Monday. “Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd.

General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule.The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.What happened during the dictatorship?Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”.It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay.But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.How did it end?Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte.Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“This is a special moment for the country: the chance to give new meaning to so many things … and finally move forward through justice,” said Leo Alves Vieira, 47, whose grandfather Mário Alves de Souza Vieira was kidnapped, tortured and killed by the army in 1970. De Souza’s body was never found.“I’m Still Here is the most powerful tool we’ve had so far to fight for this memory,” he said.Federal prosecutor Eugênia Augusta Gonzaga said that “never before inBrazilhas there been such awareness of … the need to continue the work of searching for bodies, uncovering the truth, and holding those responsible to account.”Gonzaga, the current president of the Commission on Deaths and Disappearances – the government body responsible for establishing the actual cause of death of those killed by the regime – attributes this new interest to both the film and the attempted coup on 8 January 2023 when far-right supporters of former presidentJair Bolsonarostormed the seat of government in Brasília.View image in fullscreenPeople react to I’m Still Here winning the Oscar in a bar in Sāo Paulo.Photograph: Carla Carniel/ReutersThe film tells the story of Eunice Paiva’s search for her husband, Rubens, a 41-year-old politician who was taken from his home in 1971 by agents of the dictatorship.Eunice was a member of the commission when it was first set up in 1995.The following year, the Brazilian state finally acknowledged her husband’s death – a scene portrayed in the movie, which shows Eunice telling reporters that it is essential to investigate and prosecute all crimes committed during the dictatorship because, “if that does not happen, nothing will stop them from being carried out again with impunity”.Brazil’s recent past has given the film particular resonance: it was during the Oscars campaign that Bolsonaro – an outspoken admirer of the military – wasformally indicted for his role in the attempted coup.Among the 33 members of his government also implicated were generals and an admiral, marking the first time high-ranking military officers have been charged with attempting a coup in Brazil’s history.Due to an amnesty law introduced after the 1964–1985 dictatorship, no military personnel were held accountable for more than 400 deaths and disappearances.“There is a lack of punishment for the torturers,” said Diva Santana, 80, who has been fighting for nearly five decades for the memory of her sister, Dinaelza Santana Coqueiro, who was disappeared by the army in 1973, at the age of 20.In a move thatmany see as a direct result of the release of I’m Still Here, the Brazilian supreme court recently reopened the debate over whether the amnesty applies to crimes that persist to the present day, such as the concealment of bodies.The national justice council also decided that the death certificates of victims like Paiva, Vieira and Coqueiro should not only state that they are “disappeared”, but also identify them as victims of a “non-natural, violent [death] caused by the Brazilian state in the context of the systematic persecution of political dissidents during the dictatorship”.“The impact of the film and the events of 8 January have shifted the focus on accountability,” said prosecutor Gonzaga. “We’ve already wasted too much time and can’t afford to lose another second.”Santana said that, after so many years, many of the torturers had already died. But she hoped they, too, would be condemned. “Justice needs to recognise the responsibility of all of them. And those who are still alive need to go to prison and serve time, just like Black and poor people do in Brazil,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilI'm Still HereAmericasJair BolsonaroOscarsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fast cars, impulsive decisions, and peak misery between the age of 40 and 50. But all that is changing, according to experts.In anew papercommissioned by the UN, the leading academicsJean TwengeandDavid Blanchflowerwarn that a burgeoning youth mental health crisis in six English-speaking countries worldwide is upending the traditional pattern of happiness across our lifetimes.Whereas happiness was once considered to follow a U-shape – with a relatively carefree youth, a tougher middle age and a more comfortable later life – the experts in wellbeing say our satisfaction now rises steadily with age instead.UK watchdog to investigate TikTok and Reddit over use of children’s dataRead more“The U-shape in wellbeing by age that used to exist in these countries is now gone, replaced by a crisis in wellbeing among the young,” according to the paper published by the US National Bureau of Economic Research.Analysing responses to surveys in the US, UK,Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the study found that life satisfaction and happiness had fallen among young people over the past decade, and particularly among young women.It highlighted the rise of smartphones and social media, suggesting the trend coincided with the growth of internet usage, with the impact on happiness visible in surveys across the six countries and in several other nations worldwide.Young people in despair chart“This may end up being a lost generation,” Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, told the Guardian in an interview. He said there had been a sharp drop in wellbeing in the US and the UK in particular, and pointed to the growth of social media, cyberbullying and body shaming online.“The young have become isolated. It’s also not so much that people are sitting there on the phone, it’s what they’re not doing. They’re not going out as much; playing with their friends, interacting with others, or having as much sex.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Young people are in deep disarray and trouble. And the question is what do we do about it? And we don’t know.”David Blanchflower“I don’t think there is any doubt you have an absolute global crisis.Young peopleare in deep disarray and trouble. And the question is what do we do about it? And we don’t know.”A leading British labour market economist now at the prestigious US Dartmouth College, Blanchflower had written a paper in 2020 looking across almost 150 advanced and developing countries and found the same U shape in happiness applied everywhere. However, he now says he missed the collapse in youth wellbeing from about 2013 in survey data, before starting to work with Twenge, who is a leading expert on the subject.“I looked and I thought, ‘Oh shit, she’s right.’ What had happened is a really big deal. It wasn’t Covid, it had started before that, but that extended it after 2020.”Other studies have drawn links between the youth mental health crisis andintergenerational inequality, unregulated social media, insecure employment and the climate crisis. Young people are also increasingly like to be outside the jobs market with mental health conditions.Blanchflower said the collapse in youth wellbeing could have vast social and economic consequences. “The economics of this are a really big deal. Potentially this relates to the kids withdrawing from school; then they go out of the labour force. Presumably it will affect your performance at school, it might well impact global productivity,” he added.He said the UN had commissioned further research to identify whether the phenomenon could be found elsewhere around the world. “The UN sees this as a huge global crisis,” he added.“We always thought that as life becomes more realistic, happiness declines because of pressures, then you realise life isn’t so bad. We’re having to rethink that entire thought.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthHappinessHealth & wellbeingWork & careersUnited NationsIrelandCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

It is the first Brazilian film to win the award.Directed by Walter Salles and starring Fernanda Torres, I’m Still Here is a political drama based on the true story of Eunice Paiva, whose husband Rubens was “disappeared” and murdered in 1970s Brazil. The film had to overcome a lineup including Danish true-crime storyThe Girl With the Needle, Iran-set legal dramaThe Seed of the Sacred Figand trans gangster musicalEmilia Pérez, which had been the hot favourite for the award.I’m Still Here review – wrenching true-life saga of a Brazilian family torn apart by military ruleRead moreSalles has previously been nominated in this category for his 1998 drama Central Station, but was passed over in favour of Italian Holocaust comedy Life Is Beautiful. I’m Still Here has picked up a string of awards, including best screenplay at the Venice film festival and the audience award at Rotterdam. Torres, who has been acclaimed on the awards circuit, is the daughter of Fernanda Montenegro, who was Oscar nominated for Central Station.Speaking on the podium, Salles dedicated the win to Paiva, and to the “two women who gave life to her”: Torres and Montenegro.I’m Still Here is likely to have benefited from the difficulties besetting Emilia Pérez – when the Oscar nominations were announced, the latter film led the field, but its awardscampaignwas rocked afterbigoted postswere discovered inKarla Sofía Gascón’ssocial media feed, along with complaints over the depiction of Mexico and its history.Read more about the 2025 Oscars:Anoratakes home best picture OscarAdrien BrodyandMikey Madisonwin best acting prizesKieran CulkinandZoe Saldañawin supporting awardsAnora’s Sean Baker wins fordirecting, editing andscreenplayThis article was amended on 3 March 2025.

He said the new investment brings TSMC’s total investment in chip manufacturing in the US to $165bn.“We are producing the most advanced chip on US soil,” Wei said. “Now the vision becomes reality.”Trump called Wei a “legend” and said the investment will create many thousands of jobs. The president claimed that bringing semiconductor manufacturing to the US is a matter of national security and would give the country a big share of the world market.‘They would not listen to us’: inside Arizona’s troubled chip plantRead moreLast April, Wei had agreed to expand TSMC’s planned spending in the US by $25bn to $65bn and to add two more factories to its site in Arizona by 2030.TSMC is the largest contract chipmaker in the world, and it first set up shop in Arizona in 2020, with production there beginning late last year. The company’s further expansion in the US would bring additional investment to semiconductor manufacturing at a time when much of the industry is consolidated in Asia.The chips that TSMC produces are used in most all parts of the tech sector – from smartphones and car consoles to the servers used to power artificial intelligence.Lutnick told lawmakers last month that the program was “an excellent down payment” to rebuild the sector, but he has declined to commit grants that have already been approved by the department, and said he wanted to “read them and analyze them and understand them”.On Monday, Lutnick repeatedly thanked Trump for bringing more chip production to the US. “Now you’re seeing the power of Donald Trump’s presidency,” he said.The US commerce department under then president Joe Biden finalized a $6.6bn government subsidy in November for TSMC’s US unit for semiconductor production in Arizona.Biden signed the Chips and Science Act legislation in 2022 to provide $52.7bn in subsidies for American semiconductor production and research to boost domestic production and make the United States less reliant on semiconductors made in Asia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology called “A16” in Arizona. The TSMC award included up to $5bn in low-cost government loans.While campaigning for president, Trump criticized the Chips Act and said that tariffs would be a better avenue to bring foreign manufacturing to the US.On Monday, Trump said that because TSMC is building in the US, it will not be obligated to pay the tariffs the president has promised. He added that reciprocal tariffs on Canada and Mexico will begin on 2 April and if businesses based in those countries don’t want to pay tariffs, they should build in the US.“That’s what Mr Wei is doing,” Trump said. “He’s way ahead of the game.”Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorDonald TrumpTaiwanTrump administrationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The deportations came despite a UN statement saying those being sent to China faced a “real risk of torture” on their return.Thailand ignored protests by the UN refugee agency, EU and US in deporting 40 Uyghurs who had been detained in the country for a decade, claiming they hadreturned voluntarily “to their normal lives”with their families.Q&AWho are Uyghurs and why are they at risk?ShowThe Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim Turkic-speaking ethnic group, primarily from China’s north-west region of Xinjiang.The Chinese authorities blamed a number ofviolent attacks in Xinjiangand elsewhere in China on militant Islamist groups.As a consequence, Uyghurs have been subject to religious and ethnic persecution by Chinese authorities, with human rights groups claiming that in recent years more than a million people have been held in detention camps.Some governments have labelled the crackdown as genocide and the UN human rights commissioner found that “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims may amount tocrimes against humanity. China denies the accusations.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.However, speaking to the Guardian, the family of one of those thought to have been deported said it was “impossible” that the men would want to be sent back toChina.View image in fullscreenMihriman Muhammed.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/Guardian“Who wants their family to be sent back to a place like that, with no freedoms and where everything is monitored by the government? It’s a lie.“Their families in China know what hardships they face,” said Mihriman Muhammed, 38, who fled the country in 2014.There has been exodus of Uyghurs from China’s Xinjiang region over the past decade, where China is accused ofcommitting human rights abusesincluding torture and the incarceration of an estimated 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. China denies the accusations.Muhammed said she and her then husband, Polat, 39, left Korla, the second-largest city inXinjiangafter she was arrested and forced by police to remove her hijab and Polat was banned from attending prayers at a mosque.While Muhammed, who was pregnant with their second child, and their son made it to Turkey, Polat was arrested and has been detained inThailandever since.View image in fullscreenPolat Muhammed, seen on Mihriman Muhammed’s phone.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The Guardian“We just wanted a peaceful life where we could raise our children and not be seen as a criminal,” said Muhammed, who shared one of the final exchanges of messages between her now 10-year-old daughter and Polat. Her daughter has never met her father.“Father, I am 10 years old now without you looking after me,” she wrote. “I promise to come and look after you,” Polat replies. “OK, don’t lie to me, father,” she says. After he insists he will, she replies: “Very well, dear father, I will wait for you. May Allah bring us together.”“There is no way Polat or his family still living in China would have wanted him to return there. He just wanted to see his children again,” said Muhammed.Since Polat’s arrest, Muhammed said she has had no information from either the Chinese, Thai or Turkish authorities about his fate. None of the people deported has yet been named, so she is still not certain if he has been sent back.“It’s shameful for Thailand to send these people to China, even though the family and whole world knows it is an unsafe place forUyghurs,” she said.“Everything China has done has been staged. The world should be more careful because after they are deported there is no way back.”Elderly Uyghur women imprisoned in China for decades-old religious ‘crimes’, leaked files revealRead moreIn handwritten letters shared with the Guardian apparently from three other Uyghurs being held in Thailand, the detainees also pleaded not to be sent back to China.They said they had been asked to sign a document consenting to be voluntarily repatriated but had refused to do so. Returning to China would mean imprisonment or death, one wrote.Thailand said it had received reassurances from China that the deported Uyghurs would be cared for and not mistreated.China’s embassy in Thailand said those who had been repatriated were illegal border crossers “not refugees”.It said those who had returned would be assisted with reintegration into their former lives “as soon as possible” and would be given “employment support and vocational training”. Vocational training is a term which has been associated with the Chinese authorities’ detention camps and forced labour transfer programmes.Explore more on these topicsUyghursRights and freedomXinjiangChinaAsia PacificHuman rightsThailandRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

The proposed extra levies also coincide with the start to China’s annual meeting of parliament, a political set-piece event at which Beijing is expected to roll out its 2025 economic priorities.US tariffs on Canada and Mexico coming Tuesday but may not be 25%, commerce chief saysRead moreAnalysts say Beijing still hopes to negotiate a truce with the Trump administration, but with no signs of any trade talks yet the prospect of a rapprochement is fading.“A China-US trade war is not inevitable, but Trump’s decision to impose tariffs now is a bad decision,” said Wang Dong, executive director of the Institute for Global Cooperation and Understanding at Peking University.“Trump and his advisers may think that imposing tariffs at this time is to put pressure on China, sending a signal, but this will backfire and China will inevitably respond strongly.”Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Smith was charged with cultivating, possessing for supply and selling cannabis – which could carry an eight-year jail sentence – and was summonsed to court.Medicinal cannabis has been legal in New Zealand since 2020, but patients are reliant on gaining a doctor’s prescription to access it for treatment. So-called “green fairies” provide cheaper, more readily available, hidden market products.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside Whangarei District Court where Gandalf (real name Paul Smith) faces his first court appearance.Photograph: Kelly Barnes/SuppliedMore than 50 protesters gathered outside Whangārei District Court on Monday where Smith pleaded not guilty to the charges.“This isn’t just an attack on one man, it’s an assault on hundreds of patients who rely on … affordable relief,” said protest organiser Pearl Schomburg, who is a patient of Gandalf’s and the convener of Auckland Patients Group – an advocacy group pushing for cannabis law reform.About a dozen police officers arrived at Gandalf’s property last week with sledgehammers and axes to destroy roughly 40 plants and greenhouses, Schomburg told the Guardian.“They ransacked his house and took away all of his … thank-you cards and letters.”Smith was “no criminal mastermind” she said. “He’s a compassionate, barefoot hippy with a battered truck and a heart of gold.”People wishing to access medicinal cannabis do not always succeed in obtaining a prescription or can feel discomfort asking their doctors for one, due to the stigma surrounding cannabis. For others, the up to $400 a month price-tag puts the legal products out of reach, Schomburg said.“The only people that can access legal cannabis currently in New Zealand are the wealthy – there is not equality of access to these products,” she said.Smith thanked his supporters in a short video shared to social media and adonations pageset up to help pay for his legal fees.View image in fullscreenGandalf (real name Paul Smith)Photograph: Tami Ludlow/Supplied“To all you lovely people out there, I give you a big hug, a heartfelt thanks for all your kind words and support … I’ve never experienced anything like this in all my life.”Cannabis is New Zealand’s most commonly used illicit drug, with over half a million adults having used it between 2023 and 2024, according to the NZ Health Survey. In 2020, the countrynarrowly voted against legalising cannabis.Green Party co-leader, Chlöe Swarbrick threw her support behind the protesters, saying the raid on Smith was “an absolutely abysmal waste of public resources”.The costly “war on drugs” had done little to reduce drug use or move addiction statistics, she said, adding that a new approach based in harm reduction and evidence was necessary.Swarbrick – who has long advocated for the legalisation of cannabis – pointed to arecent Massey University studyshowing two-thirds of New Zealand’s medicinal cannabis users still access it through the hidden market, mostly due to the expense of legal cannabis.“That should be a really clear sign that the rules that we have in place right now are not working, and that we should do something about [them]… instead of terrorising a 66-year-old man.”In a statement to the Guardian, the police said it would be inappropriate for them to comment on Smith’s case, as the matter was before the courts.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He said minimal repairs, maintenance and capital works had been done at the steelworks over an extended period.“The business is running on empty,” Hams told employees and creditors at the meeting in Whyalla, a port city located north-west ofAdelaide. “It is a really dangerous position to get into.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“We had $8m in the bank – for a business that turns over somewhere around over $1bn, that is just crazy. And the working capital position, by virtue of the creditor arrears, was really quite scary.”Gupta took over the project in 2017 and made promises to invest heavily in what is one of only two major integrated steel projects in Australia and the only local manufacturer of rail.But his leveraged portfolio of global steelmaking assets has been underhuge financial stressleading to a series of closures and disruptions at operations across Europe and the US.Problems with Whyalla’s blast furnace, which is central to steelmaking, exacerbated the problems at his Australian operations.While Gupta has lost control of the steelworks and accompanying mine, he has retained ownership of the port operations, potentially complicating the administration process.Entities linked to Gupta’s GFG Alliance have claimed creditor debts of $536m, which KordaMentha is yet to assess.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The state and federal governments haveprovided a support packageto ensure that the steelworks keep operating and workers are paid while administrators look for a new owner.GFG’s representatives, who did not attend the meeting on Monday, said they were pursuing financing options when administrators were appointed.“Our major suppliers across OSM were aware of the capital raising processes, which were delayed and impacted by heightened media speculation,” they said. “Unfortunately, the financing could not be completed before the administration.“While we are saddened by the decision of the South Australian government, we continue to believe in the strategic importance of Whyalla, and will fully support a viable long term solution for the future of the Whyalla steelworks.”The Guardian has contacted GFG for comment.Explore more on these topicsBusinessSanjeev GuptaSouth AustraliaAdelaidenewsShareReuse this content"

Updated tracking maps from the Bureau of Meteorology now forecast Alfred potentially making landfall just north ofBrisbaneovernight on Thursday.The forecast track would represent a nightmare scenario for authorities in theQueenslandcapital, a city with 2.5 million people and susceptible to severe flooding. The bureau says most of the intense rainfall will occur to the south of where Alfred makes landfall.But tracking maps may change again over the coming days as the forecast evolves.When and where is Tropical Cyclone Alfred likely to hit? Here’s what you need to knowRead moreMore than 4 million people – from Grafton in New South Wales to K’gari in Queensland – have been placed on a formal “warning” footing by the bureau.Early on Tuesday morning, Alfred was 560km east of Brisbane and moving away, to the south-east, about 6km/h.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut forecasters say with increasing confidence they expect the system to undergo a “recurvature” by mid Tuesday afternoon – a sudden change of direction – as it bumps up against another weather system to the south.“Models are in agreement that the strengthening mid-level ridge to the south to steer Alfred westwards from later today,” the bureau’s technical bulletin from Tuesday morning said.1:26Large surf, erosion and winds lash coast ahead of Tropical Cyclone Alfred – video“Landfall location could range from the Sunshine Coast to the Gold Coast, and there is also uncertainty in terms of the timing of coastal crossing between late Thursday and Friday morning.”The update says the nature of the cyclone means it is difficult to predict its intensity when it reaches landfall. The bureau says the strongest winds could be up to 100km/h and would occur to the south of the system.In the suburbs of south-east Queensland, residents have begun preparations.Brisbane has severely flooded three times in the past 15 years. Unlike parts of northern Queensland, locals do not typically prepare for the possibility of a cyclone.

For example, research after the 2022 floods in Queensland and New South Wales found that 50% of residents acknowledged that they could have been more prepared.”Gissing said the primary hazards associated with cyclones were flooding, strong winds and coastal erosion, and that these occurring in a densely populated area were of “significant concern”.“The damage that Alfred could lead to includes damages to homes, businesses and infrastructure; disruption to essential services and supply chains; agricultural losses; and injury and fatalities,” he said.“Significant coastal damage can occur without a cyclone making landfall because of abnormally high tides and damaging surf.”Gissing said homes older than 1980 might not be built to building codes and could be at particular risk to strong winds.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherBrisbaneExtreme weatherQueenslandTropical Cyclone AlfrednewsShareReuse this content"

But Australians believe his party would be better – or at least no worse – than the Coalition on some key issues.The Essential poll of 1,150 people conducted last week revealed almost one in two people don’t know who they will vote for or might change their mind.The poll also found the major parties split on the two-party-preferred voting metric, with the Coalition leading 48-47, and another 5% saying “don’t know”.Last month’s polldelivered a 48-48 result and a 4% “don’t know”.What’s the worst that can happen if Labor wins the election? Six-toed nightmares if online trends hold | The shadow campaignRead moreThe poll’s “primary+” measure found 29% of people would give their first-preference vote to Labor, down from last month’s 30%; 35% of people would give their vote to theCoalitionparties, 12% to the Greens and 19% to a minor party or independent.Albanese’s approval rating dropped two points to 41%, while his disapproval ticked up one point to 49%, for a net approval rating of minus eight. Dutton’s approval remained unchanged at 41%, while his disapproval decreased one point to 44%, for a net approval of minus three.Asked whether Australia was on the right direction or on the wrong track, 34% of voters said right direction (up three points) while 49% said wrong track (down two points).Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe federal election is due to be held by 17 May, and speculation is growing that Albanese could declare the start of the five-week official campaign period this Sunday or Monday.The Essential poll found 52% of people said they knew who they would vote for and wouldn’t change their mind. But another 35% said they might change their vote, and 13% said they hadn’t yet decided – for a total of 48% of voters who were either open to changing their vote or didn’t yet know how they would mark their ballot paper.Essential Media is among several research firms working with the Labor party’s election campaign, alongside Pyxis Polling and Insights, which is behind the Newspoll.Guardian Australia has reportedEssential is one of the companies running focus groups for the ALP.There had been speculation Albanese could call the election last week, off the back of the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting the official cash rate for the first time since 2020, as the governmenttouted its economic plan and credentials.Waiting for Australia’s election campaign to start? Behind the scenes, it already hasRead moreHowever, only 44% of people agreed with the statement that the interest rate cut was welcome relief and showed the government’s economic management was working, while 56% agreed with the statement that the cut was too little too late and showed the government’s economic approach was not working.But on separate questions about which party – Labor or the Coalition – voters trusted on key issues, the government was favoured on central economic questions, though even more voters believed there were no differences between the major parties.Labor was trusted more to support higher wages by 38% of voters, with the Coalition at 18%, and 44% saying “no difference”; 33% favoured Labor to address cost-of-living pressures, compared with 27% for the Coalition and 39% responding no difference. On who was best to manage the economy, the Coalition was slightly ahead of Labor, 30-29%, with 41% saying no difference.After a week dominated by the government’s $8.5bnMedicare bulk-billing pledge– quickly matched by the Coalition – Labor’s biggest lead among voter perceptions was on funding Medicare. On this issue, 40% of voters backed the government, 20% backed the Coalition and 40% responded no difference.Explore more on these topicsEssential pollThe Guardian Essential reportAustralian election 2025Australian politicsLabor partyAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonInterest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

For some, this was lowered to $3,000 in 2025, $5,000 in 2026 and $7,000 in 2027. While that was small change for large bookmakers, it was a significant hit for smaller operators that typically focus on horse racing.James Filgate, a Victorian bookmaker who runs the brand JimmyBet, said he had refrained from sending inducements to customers for many years. That will now change, he said, in response to the AFL’s plan to seize more gambling money.5:54Does community sport and free-to-air TV in Australia need gambling ads to survive? – video“The only way to increase my turnover would be to introduce and advertise an incentive program on the AFL product to increase my turnover by twentyfold, for viability,” Filgate said.“The reality is if we don’t offer the AFL product, our wagering business becomes less attractive to my clients who demand a selection of products. This will create less competition in the market, if businesses like mine don’t bet on the [AFL] or fold.”Guardian Australia has been told other small bookmakers are planning to use inducements to help replace the money sent to the AFL under a new deal.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailFilgate also warned the AFL may be in the midst of building an “irreversible” dependence on cash from gambling companies.Inducements, or “targeted generosities”, are promotions such as bonus bets or deposit matches that are designed to encourage people to gamble. These are often promoted to amateur gamblers, who are more likely to lose.Almost 18 months ago, a bipartisan federal inquiry led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy called for inducements to be banned “without delay”.The Wesley Mission general manager, Jim Wackett, said the threat of increased inducements demonstrated why federal government action in response to the Murphy inquiry was overdue.“If the AFL is going to squeeze bookmakers for more money to fix their broken integrity system, all that means is that the bookmakers will in turn squeeze punters more and more,” Wackett said.Samantha Thomas, a public health academic who specialises in gambling at Deakin University, said the dispute showed why a national gambling regulator “with the sole purpose of reducing harm” was required, as also recommended by the Murphy inquiry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has also raised concern about several “bottlenecks” and “blindspots” that have prevented it from quickly detecting if players, coaches and staff are betting on games or sharing sensitive information.In Australia,Gambling Help Onlineis available on 1800 858 858.

Thomas Strobl, the interior minister of Baden-Württemberg state, said the suspect was a 40-year-old German man from the south-western state of Rhineland-Palatinate who was believed to have acted alone.Investigators later said there were “concrete indications” that the man had mental health problems, and ruled out a “politically motivated act”.The victims were identified as an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man.Witnesses described people lying on the ground at the scene near the central pedestrianised Paradeplatz after the car ploughed into the crowd, heading in the direction of a water tower. Attempts were being made to resuscitate at least two people.German police and prosecutors said the driver intentionally rammed his car into the crowds celebrating carnival before the fasting season of Lent.He was then blocked by a taxi driver who witnessed the attack from a cafe where he was taking a break, jumped into his car and drove into the path of the Ford Fiesta, according to local media reports.The attacker shot at the taxi driver with what is believed to have been an alarm pistol, but did not injure him. He then fled on foot before he was caught by police, injuring himself with a shot from the alarm pistol.The man, a landscape gardener according to police, is being investigated for murder and attempted murder.The incident follows a string of violent attacks including two other car rammings, inMunich last monthand inMagdeburg in December. Mannheim was the scene of a stabbing in May 2024 in which a police officer was killed and five people wounded.All those attacks were carried out by migrants, fuelling a heated debate over the country’s immigration policy before Germany’s general election last month.The vote was won by the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, which campaigned on promises to tighten border controls, while the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland came second with its best ever result.Germany’s carnival season culminates inRosenmontag(Rose Monday), with crowds in fancy dress and parades of floats that typically feature comical and satirical displays of events dominating current affairs. Mannheim held its main parade on Sunday.Security forces had alerted carnival organisers and the public more than a week ago about warnings published on social media accounts connected to the militant group Islamic State, calling for followers to carry out attacks in the carnival strongholds of the Rhineland, to which Mannheim belongs, and areas in the south – both Catholic regions.Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, who had been due to attend a popular parade in Cologne on Monday, cancelled her attendance to travel to Mannheim instead, a spokesperson said.Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany’s next chancellor, wrote on X that “the incident – as well as the terrible acts of the past few months – is an urgent reminder that we must do everything we can to prevent such acts”. The outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, referred to the stabbing attack of last year, writing on X: “Once again we mourn with Mannheim. Once again we mourn with the families of the victims of a senseless act of violence.”Kasim Timur, 57, who runs a cafe on Paradeplatz, told Der Spiegel: “It breaks one’s heart.” He said one of his colleagues had reported seeing some of the seriously injured, including children. Another colleague, on her way to work at the cafe, had seen a dark-coloured Ford car racing towards Paradeplatz, he said.“Initially she thought it was someone who had caused an accident and fled the scene,” he said. “Only later did she understand what had happened.” Timur said the city had not yet got over the stabbing attack of less than a year ago. “Now the horror is back,” he told Spiegel. “That is very scary.”According to media reports, three people were receiving emergency treatment at University Hospital Mannheim, including two adults and a child. Eight medical trauma teams had been put on standby to treat adults and children, according to the hospital.Police urged people not to post videos from the attack, or to spread information that had not been officially confirmed, warning of numerous “false reports” that were circulating on social media.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That was the concise verdict of Eléonore Caroit, the vice-chair of the French national assembly’s foreign affairs committee. And the optics of Sunday’scrisis talks on Ukrainebore this out, with Keir Starmer at the very centre of the leaders’ joint photo.“You are back on the scene, of the leadership in Europe,” Caroit told the BBC on Monday morning. James MacClearly, the Liberal Democrat MP who speaks for the party on Europe, was equally adamant,praising the prime ministerfor taking this chance “to bring us back to the heart of Europe where we belong”.So is this a post-Brexit turning point? Is the UK, which since 2016 has become accustomed to watching from afar as European decisions are made, at the heart of the action once more?The slightly unsatisfactory answer is: it depends. There are, however, a few things that seem clear.The first is that Starmer, in his self-declared mission to be a“bridge” between Europe and Donald Trump’s tempestuous America, has made himself a significant player in efforts to ensure a fair and secure peace deal for Ukraine.While the UK prime minister arrived at the White House two days after Emmanuel Macron and was somewhat less ostentatious with thetactile “Trump whispering”than the French president, he was arguablyreceived with greater warmthby the US president.And after his attempts to draw Trump into backing a peace deal were derailed by Volodymyr Zelenskyy’sabrasive treatmenta day later, Starmer tried to mend the damage,receiving the Ukrainian president warmlyin London and speaking by phone to Trump on consecutive days.The other point of general agreement is that in trying to keep a peace plan involving the US on track while also pushing ahead with European efforts at Sunday’s conference in London, Starmer has shown the skills of a natural diplomat.Beyond general cross-party support for his plan, Starmer has been praised by the likes of the Conservative former defence secretaryBen Wallace, the Tory backbench grandeeRoger GaleandSimon Fraser, the former head of the Foreign Office, for, as the latter put it, having “played a blinder in recent days”.But whether this heralds anything more permanent, let alone if it could mark any softening of EU attitudes as Starmer embarks on the longer-term project of easing post-Brexit ties with Brussels, remains to be seen.“Starmer has done it all very well, but it’s partly a question of circumstance, in that the reason London could convene this event is that the EU clearly isn’t the optimal institution to handle all the things that are going on,” said Anand Menon, the director of the thinktankUK in a Changing Europeand professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London.“Brexit didn’t stop us collaborating very closely with the EU overUkraineanyway. The really interesting issue will be when it comes to the economics of defence – that is to say, the money the European Commission is pouring into joint procurement schemes and things like that, because at the moment they are limited to members of the single market.”Western countries must keep military aid flowing to Ukraine, Starmer warnsRead moreEven if the UK decided to take part in joint defence procurement with the EU, Menon added, it seemed unlikely the EU would be tempted to pull back on the red lines it had set out in terms of updating the UK’s post-Brexit relations.“If you’re fighting off populists [in other EU countries] who are saying, ‘We want a looser relationship with theEuropean Union, we don’t want all these rules and regulations,’ what you don’t want to provide them [with] is an economically successful Britain that seems to be getting the best of both worlds,” he said.There are also the domestic political considerations. Starmer has been very clear he hasno plans to relitigate Brexit, and the threat from Reform UK in many Labour seats will sharpen minds still further.But at the same time, it is fair to say that Sunday’s summit showed the definitive end to the immediate post-Brexit era under the likes of Boris Johnson, where, as Menon put it, it was “a politically good thing to be at loggerheads with Europe”.A whole series of international orthodoxies have been overturned by the Ukraine war and now the second Trump presidency. And one of them might be a UK edging further into the European spotlight. On those terms at least, Britain is back.Explore more on these topicsBrexitForeign policyKeir StarmerUkraineEuropeEuropean UnionDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A 56% majority of those Republican said they didn’t have a preference between the two, and 37% supportedUkraine.The polling found that – overall – 11% believed Trump’s actions and statements have favored Ukraine, and 46% saidRussia.Asked if they approved or disapproved ofthe way Trump was handling the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, 51% approved and 49% said they didn’t. The same percentages supported or opposed military aid to Ukraine.The CBS polling also revealed that 30% consider Russia “friendly but not an ally” of the US – while 61% considered countries of westernEurope, like the UK, France, Italy and Germany to be allies of the US.But 35% said they considered western European nations to be “friendly but not allies”; 3% said unfriendly; and 1% said they considered them an enemy.The most revealing aspect of the poll goes to the heart of the contentious Oval Office exchange between Trump and Zelenskyy, when the Ukrainian president attempted to persuade Trump and his cabinet that despite a “nice ocean” between the US and Europe, the US would in time feel “influenced” by Russia’s actions.Trump retorted: “You don’t know that. You don’t know that. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.”A separate pollconducted using online interviews after the confrontation found that 49% of those polled said that Trump and Vice-President JD Vance had a stronger argument over the value of diplomacy with Russia.The 2Way poll also found that 62% thought Zelenskyy’s remarks were offensive – and 55% said Ukraine needs to negotiate and end the war.On Monday, the US president hit out at Zelenksyy’s comments that a deal to end the war “is still very, very far away”.Trump postedthat the comment was “the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer! … this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing.”That post from Trump came after a New York Times report on Monday thatsaidthe president had planned to meet with top aides to discuss suspending or canceling US military aid to Ukraine.The CBS poll appeared to reflect a sense of insulation to the Russia-Ukraine war. Poll respondents were asked if what happens between Russia and Ukraine matters to the interests of the US. And 31% said it mattered “a lot”; 42% said “some”; 18% agreed with “not much”; and 9% “not at all”.Senior Republicans not directly involved in Russia-Ukraine peace talk efforts have continued to denounce Putin – even as they express support for how Trump handled his meeting with Zelenskyy.That included the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who told CNN on Sunday that Putin is “not to be trusted and he is dangerous”, adding that Russia and other countries like China are “not on America’s side”. Yet Johnson also said on NBC that someone other than Zelenskyy may need “to lead” Ukraine after failing to show gratitude over US aid.The Oklahoma senator James LankfordtoldNBC that Putin was “a murderous KGB thug” and a “dictator”, saying Zelenskyy was “rightfully concerned” that Putin “can’t be trusted” to respect a ceasefire agreement.And regardless of political support for the US president, 76% said they thought Trump was making major changes to the America’s relationships with other countries. Of those, 31% said the relationships were better, 42% said worse, and 26% said it was too soon to say.But there may be some optimistic signs for European countries hoping that the Nato will hold together through the current turmoil. Asked if the US should stay in the alliance or leave, 78% said it should remain – and 22% said it should leave.But broader support for the currentUS foreign policyappears more mixed. Sixteen per cent said the US should take a leading role in the world; 67% said it should work equally alongside other allies; and 17% said it should not get involved in the world’s issues.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyDonald TrumpUS politicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The longer it takes, the more likely you never see it again … It was all pure luck that everything fell into place.”The 17th-century painting had been hanging in the National Museum in Gdańsk,Poland, when on 24 April 1974, a cleaner knocked it from the wall, the frame broke, and she discovered the painting had been replaced with a photograph. A sketch by the Flemish artist Anthony van Dyck called The Crucifixion had also been switched with a copy.The two works went on Poland’s “most wanted” list until, last year, a Dutch art and antiques magazine calledVind(Find) wrote about a new show at the Gouda Museum, where the Brueghel was on loan from a private collector. Vind traced a black-and-white photograph of the painting in Poland and contacted Brand to inquire whether it could be the same one.After locating five similar paintings by Brueghel, contacting Dutch and Polish police and the museum, Brand made a match – and Poland has now officially requested the artworks’ return.“It is quite spectacular,” Brand said. “And the story behind it is quite spectacular too. It’s a great moment because of how much it means for Poland – it’s on their list of most-wanted paintings and they have waited 50 years probably thinking it would never come back.”The theft had been an expert job, said Brand. “First of all, not many people dared to steal something from a museum in a communist dictatorship. Second, not many people had the contacts to bring it abroad.“When the Polish police reopened the case in 2008, all the archives concerning this theft were destroyed and some former members of the secret service later declared that they were sure that somebody in their organisation was involved.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsPolandArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It could be made very fast,” Trump told reporters, referring to a ceasefire. “Now, maybe somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long.”The Trump administration was reported to bedrawing up a planon Monday to restore ties with Russia and lift sanctions on the Kremlin, in a sharp turn in US policy that would alarm European allies and service a broader rapprochement between Russia and the US.The state and treasury departments were said to be tasked with drawing up a list of sanctions that the US could lift as part of the administration’s broad talks with Moscow on improving diplomatic and economic relations, Reuters reported.The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that theTrump administrationhad stopped financing new weapons sales to Ukraine and is considering freezing weapons shipments from US stockpiles, in what would be a devastating blow to Ukraine’s ability to continue to defend against the Russian invasion.Trump denied that he had discussed halting military aid toUkraine, saying: “I haven’t even talked about that right now. I mean, right now, we’ll see what happens. A lot of things are happening right now, literally as we speak.”The flurry of activity followed a French proposal fora partial one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, as European efforts to bolster support for Kyiv accelerate in the face of uncertain US backing.The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said on Monday: “Such a truce – on air, sea and energy infrastructure – would allow us to determine whetherVladimir Putinis acting in good faith” and gauge his attitude to “real peace negotiations”.A day after European leaders rallied aroundUkraineat a summit in London, Barrot added: “Never has the risk of a war in Europe, in the EU, been so high … The threat keeps getting closer to us, the frontline keeps getting closer to us.”Zelenskyy had said that he believed a peace with Russia was far off in an interview in which he also expressed optimism about Ukraine’s partnership with the US, saying: “I think our relationship [with the US] will continue, because it’s more than an occasional relationship.”Those remarks followed a blow-up in the Oval Office where Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with” a third world war and told the Ukrainian president to come back “when he is ready for peace”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those set to join the briefing include the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth.Trump allies continued to pile pressure on Zelenskyy over the weekend, with several suggesting the Ukrainian president should consider resigning in order to provide a way forward for negotiations. Rubio and Waltz were considered to be the most hawkish of Trump’s cabinet on Russia, but have fallen in line with his and JD Vance’scriticisms of Ukraineas tensions have escalated.Speaking to Fox on Monday morning, Waltz did not say Zelenskyy should resign, but when asked whether Zelenskyy was fit to lead Ukraine said: “What happened Friday really put that up in the air.” Earlier, he told CNN: “We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war … If it becomes apparent that President Zelensky’s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands.”Germany has taken the lead in questioning the US leadership under the new Trump administration. Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany’s next chancellor, suggested the Oval Office spat was a trap set in advance for the Ukrainian leader. “It was not a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but obviously a manufactured escalation,” Merz said.Merz had earlier said that it appeared theTrump administrationwas indifferent to the fate of Europe. “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” he said in remarks last week as tensions rose between the US and Europe over a potential ceasefire negotiation with Russia.France’s prime minister, François Bayrou, also criticised Trump’s behaviour, telling parliament: “In the Oval Office … a staggering scene unfurled before the lenses of the entire world, marked by brutality, a desire to humiliate, with the goal of making Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyfold through threats. President Zelenskyy did not fold and I think we can show him our appreciation.”A senior European official who asked to remain anonymous said Trump now had to choose whether he wanted to call himself “a leader of the free world, or leader of an extortion gang. The latter is not interesting for Europe.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpRussiaUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

He’s doing it for personal reasons. He wants to stay in power.”In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, 33 Israelis were freed – including the bodies of eight people who were killed in captivity or during the 7 October 2023 attack whenHamaskilled about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees during the first phase of the ceasefire in exchange for the hostages.The Israeli government is reportedly planning to ratchet up its blockade on Gaza as part of what it has called a “hell plan” to pressure Hamas into further hostage releases without having to withdraw troops.Hamas has rejected the proposal, saying it represents a violation of the original truce agreement in January.Cohen said he has been told by other hostages released in the first phase that his son, who was captured on 7 October, is alive.“He’s there, he’s alive, he’s well and the only thing left is to get him released,” he said.British-linked families told reporters of the horror of waiting for their relatives to be returned.Ayelet Kaufman, the sister of Hadar Goldin, has been waiting more than 10 years for the return of her brother’s body. Goldin, an Israeli soldier, was kidnapped and killed in 2014, she told reporters.British-Israeli citizen Ditza Or, mother of hostage Avinatan Or, said: “Before 7 October, I was Ditza Or, with a full life, a profession.“But since 7 October, I’m only the mother of Avinatan – 24 /7 I advocate for him.”Avinatan Or was kidnapped along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, at the Supernova music festival in southern Israel on 7 October. His girlfriend has since been returned, but was separated from Or.She added: “It’s important to bring the world to its peace and harmony, but first, bring all our children home, and then go on.”Israel said on Sunday that a new US proposal calls for extending the ceasefire’s first phase through Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday, which ends on 20 April.Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu said.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

From Wednesday, they will be serving under a new chief of staff, Maj Gen Eyal Zamir, who has been an advocate of using overwhelming force aimed at achieving a quick, decisive victory over the remnants ofHamasin Gaza.Meanwhile, there were reports in the Arab press that Hamas was also getting ready for the resumption of fighting. Qatar’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that Hamas and other armed factions had gone back to a war footing, with those holding Israeli hostages to resume heightened security measures.Hamas is also said to have been extracting high explosives from unexploded Israeli weapons fired during the war, for use in roadside bombs if the fighting starts again.Talks on the ceasefire have stalled since Friday. The Israeli government is insisting on a proposal extending the first phase of the ceasefire during Ramadan and then Passover until 20 April, during which half the remaining hostages would be released in return for Palestinians in Israeli jails. The other half would be released once there was agreement on a lasting end to the war.There are still 59 Israeli hostages yet to return from Gaza, but Israeli authorities believe at least 34 are already dead.Netanyahu has attributed the proposal to the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, though Witkoff has so far not spoken about it.Israeli block on aid raises health fears for Gaza’s undernourished populationRead moreHamas has rejected the proposal, saying it represents a violation of the original truce agreement in January that envisaged the ceasefire moving into a second phase this week, in which hostage releases would be coupled with Israeli troop withdrawals from strategic points in Gaza, starting with the Philadelphi corridor, a buffer strip between Gaza and Egypt.A diplomat from an Arab country was quoted by Kan on Monday as saying that Hamas might agree to a shorter extension to the first phase with the release of a handful of hostages.During the six weeks of the first phase of the ceasefire, about 600 trucks of aid, mostly food and fuel, crossed into Gaza each day, about the level of the prewar average. The Israeli government has argued that aid deliveries are commandeered by Hamas and that there were already substantial stockpiles of basic necessities in the territory.“There is plenty of food and supplies in Gaza – 4,200 trucks a week have gone in during this ceasefire, enough for many, many months,” said a government spokesperson, David Mencer.Mencer claimed that Hamas had “enough food to fuel an obesity epidemic”, adding that “the supplies are there, but Hamas don’t share”.However, theannouncement of the blockadecaused an immediate impact on the affordability of food inside Gaza. Prices of staples that had steadily declined during the ceasefire quickly increased. A bag of flour that was about 50 shekels (£11) on Saturday rose to 100 shekels in a matter of hours after Netanyahu’s announcement on Sunday, while a kilogram of sugar rose from six shekels to 10.Hikmat al-Masri, a 44-year-old university lecturer from Beit Lahiya, said the price increases had been “sudden and extreme”, forcing him to cut back on essentials. He was displaced four times during the war and had been hoping he would be able to start work rebuilding his house.“Often, I find myself weighing up whether I should buy food items or buy blankets for sleeping,” he said. “Both options are difficult and expensive.”Hassan Musa, a father of eight from northern Gaza who is still living in temporary shelter in Khan Younis in the south, said: “To subject innocent people to the deprivation of aid and to threaten them with cutting off water and food supplies is the height of injustice and criminality.“Prices are rising without logic, making financial planning for the family nearly impossible. Even the aid we used to receive has stopped, which increases the fears of a return of famine to the north, after we thought we had overcome it.“The situation in northern Gaza is much worse. When I spoke with my brother there, he told me that prices have skyrocketed.”Against the background of a diplomatic impasse and a looming humanitarian crisis, the member states of the Arab League are due to meet in Cairo on Tuesday to approve an Egyptian-drafted blueprint for Gaza’s future, intended to be an alternative to Donald Trump’s shock declaration last month that US could take over the strip, which would be depopulated and then turned into a “riviera on the Mediterranean.”The Egyptian plan, according to a version seen by the Reuters news agency, would establish a “governance assistance mission” to replace Hamas as the governing authority in Gaza, and the mission would be responsible for humanitarian aid and reconstruction work. The plan did not make clear who would pay for the reconstruction, or how Hamas would be shouldered aside.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Zarif has been a lightning rod for criticism of the reformist government led by those who lost the presidential election.The then-foreign minister became known on the international stage during lengthy negotiations for the 2015 nuclear accord formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The agreement led to the lifting of western sanctions in return for independent UN-led inspections to ensure Iran’s nuclear programme was purely for civilian use.The deal was torpedoed three years later when, during Trump’s first term as president, the US pulled out of the deal andreimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump holds up a signed executive order to increase sanctions on Iran in June 2019.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APBut, in his resignation note, Zarif implied his latest departure from government was not voluntary. It was said a high-ranking official had instructed Pezeshkian to return him to university. Pezeshkian refused, instead asking the official to directly relay the instruction to Zarif.After a meeting with the official in question, the vice-president for strategic affairs reluctantly agreed to submit his resignation.Zarif has always been seen as the most articulate exponent of Iranian foreign policy to western audiences. A career diplomat, he has repeatedly called for the foreign ministry to be given clearer authority over international relations, and not to be contradicted by the independent foreign policy led by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Earlier on Saturday, the Iranian parliament had voted by 182 votes to dismiss Hemmati, who was also previously governor of the Iranian central bank. He had been in office for only six months and 12 days, the fastest impeachment in the history of the Iranian revolution dating to 1979.Despite the presence of Pezeshkian in the parliament in a display of solidarity, Hemmati failed to fend off the vote of no confidence and was dismissed from his position. The Iranian parliament is dominated by hardliners mainly elected in 2024, and has never reconciled itself to the surprise election of Pezeshkian to the presidency later in the summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Referring to the country’s conditions, he recommended that I return to university to prevent further pressure on the government, and I immediately accepted.”The resignation brought no relief to the Iranian stock market, which plunged further in the red.Zarif expressed his resentment at his treatment. He said: “Although I faced the most ridiculous insults, slanders and threats against myself and my family in the past six months, and even within the government, I spent the most bitter 40 years of service, I persevered in the hope of serving.“I have not been and will not be one to run away from hardships and difficulties in the path of serving this land and country, and in the past 40 or so years, I have endured so many insults and slanders for the small role I have played in advancing national interests, from ending the Iran-Iraq war to finalising the nuclear file, and I have held my breath to prevent the interests of the country from being damaged by a flood of lies and distortions.”He added: “I hope that by stepping aside, the excuses for obstructing the will of the people and the success of the government will be removed.”Azar Mansouri, the head of the Reformists Front, an alliance of smaller parties, said she did not know of any way Iran’s economic problems could be lifted without ending economic sanctions, and taking the steps necessary to be removed from the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the body that oversees global transparency in financial transactions.Conservatives have pointed to thehumiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy by Trump in his recent Oval Office encounteras a warning to those in Iran who believe it is possible to negotiate with the US president.8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – videoOpponents of Hemmati, led by the conservative Front of Islamic Revolution Stability, admit his dismissal is part of a wider campaign against the government, including Hemmati’s efforts toreconnect the Iranian economy to the westby removing Iran from the FATF blacklist.Abolfazl Abu Torabi, the MP for Najafabad, told an Iranian newspaper recently: “I believe that the problems of the foreign exchange market in the country will not be solved by impeaching the minister of economic affairs and finance. This is a fact. It is the government’s approach that needs to be reformed, because according to a report by the parliamentary research centre, economic growth has decreased by 1% over the past six months.” He claimed Hemmati’s attitude had led to inflationary expectations.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIran's nuclear programmeNuclear weaponsUS politicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

That is up from 731 million and 198 million respectively in 1990.Without urgent policy reform and action, the report says, more than half of those aged 25 or above worldwide (3.8 billion) and about a third of all children and young people (746 million) are forecast to be affected by 2050.Graph showing the number of adults aged 25 and above, and the number of children and young people, living with obesity from 1990 to 2050The research predicts a particularly alarming rise (121%) in obesity among children and younger people, with the number predicted to be living with obesity predicted to hit 360 million by 2050.“The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,” said lead author Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the University of Washington.The numbers affected vary across the globe, the study shows. More than half of the adults classified as overweight or obese live in just eight countries: China (402 million), India (180 million), the US (172 million), Brazil (88 million), Russia (71 million), Mexico (58 million), Indonesia (52 million) and Egypt (41 million).Chart showing the number of people with obesity in each of the eight countriesBy 2050, about one in three children and young people living with obesity (130 million) are forecast to be in just two regions – north Africa and the Middle East and Latin America and the Caribbean – with seismic health, economic and societal consequences,the report says.The researchers warned that children everywhere are gaining weight faster than previous generations and obesity is occurring earlier, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer occurring at a younger age.For example, in high-income countries, about 7% of men born in the 1960s were obese by the time they were 25. But this increased to 16% for men born in the 1990s, and is predicted to reach 25% for men born in 2015.In the UK,the Lancet reportpredicted that among children aged five to 14, obesity will rise from 12% of girls in 2021 to 18.4% in 2050, and from 9.9% to 15.5% in boys over the same period.Nearly a quarter of the world’s obese adult population in 2050 are forecast to be aged 65 or above, intensifying the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and wreaking havoc on services in low-resource countries.A second study also published on Monday, by the World Obesity Federation, warned in particular of the impact of obesity in poorer countries.“By far the greatest number of premature deaths attributable to high BMI are in lower- and upper-middle-income countries – indicating poor levels of treatment available,” its authors wrote.Johanna Ralston, the chief executive of the WorldObesityForum, said: “Obesity has significant health, economic and societal impacts that are likely to be more challenging for lower-resourced countries to address.”The researchers behind the Lancet study noted some limitations, including that while they used the best available data, predictions were constrained by the quantity and quality of past data. The potential impact of emerging interventions, such as weight-loss drugs, were also not considered.Writing in a linked comment, Thorkild Sørensen of the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved with the research, said the scale of the obesity crisis was now so significant that there would have to be public health interventions worldwide.Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Not because he peddles conspiracy theories and makes Nazi salutes, but because of the huge damage he is doing to scientific institutions in the US. Now let’s see if he really believes in free speech,” he wrote.Muskresponded: “Only craven, insecure fools care about awards and memberships. History is the actual judge, always and forever. Your comments above are carelessly ignorant, cruel and false. That said, what specific actions require correction? I will make mistakes, but endeavor to fix them.”Concerns include Musk’s incendiary comments – such as calling the British MP Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, a “rape genocide apologist”.“I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires fellows to have ‘due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by [the Royal] Society’,” Curry wrote in the letter.Scientists have also raised concerns over Musk’s actions within the Trump administration, where he oversees the US “department of government efficiency”. The cost-cutting operation has threatened the funding of scientific and medical communities, among other areas.The meeting of the fellowship of the Royal Society, which began at 6pm on Monday, was arranged to discuss the principles around public pronouncements and behaviour of fellows.The Royal Society’scode of conduct and disciplinary regulationsstate: “Fellowship and foreign membership of the society is a privilege predicated on adherence to particular standards of conduct.”Among other points, the document says: “When speaking or publicising statements in a personal capacity, fellows and foreign members must still strive to uphold the reputation of the society and those who work in it, and be mindful that what is said or stated in a personal capacity could still impact the society.”After the meeting, the Royal Society released a statement saying the fellows agreed on the need to stand up for science and for scientists around the world in the face of the growing challenges science faces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although this is difficult to quantify, it warned that actions being taken by businesses and individuals to avoid being a victim of crime – such as not visiting the high street, or deferring investment – could take the total cost to as much as £250bn, or 10% of GDP.With the government under pressure to find money for public services and defence spending, Policy Exchange said Labour needed to invest an additional £5bn a year into tackling a crisis in prison capacity, the size of the policing workforce and clearing backlogs in the courts.Alongside highlighting austerity, the thinktank recommended reforms to sentencing, including automatic tougher sentences for prolific offenders and deportation of foreign offenders.The report, which was also backed by the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, urged the government to increase public spending on policing and the criminal justice system to help underpin the economy.Official figures show a steady increase in levels of crime over recent years, while Britain’s largest retailers have warned of arise in shopliftingwith huge costs for the industry. Last year, Sharon White, the former chair of the John Lewis Partnership, described the increase as an “epidemic”.Police-recorded shoplifting has increased by 51% relative to 2015 and is at its highest level in 20 years. Police-recorded robberies and knife crime offences are up 64% and 89% respectively over the same period.Javid, who was home secretary between 2018 and 2019, before briefly serving as chancellor until early 2020, wrote in the foreword to the report that he was proud of his record in government for tackling crime, but added: “that said, there’s clearly more to do.”“History teaches us that economic activity flourishes in societies that value law and order. When consumers and businesses know that contracts will be honoured, and that the fruits of their labour will be protected from theft and the threat of violence, they have the confidence to work, to earn and to build something of value. Without this confidence we all suffer.”Labour has sought to crack down on crime, with Keir Starmer having said in opposition years of cuts to police funding and changes to sentencing rules were a “Tory shoplifter’s charter” for the rise in crime rates across the UK.However, there are concerns that a tight position in the public finances and the government pushing to increase defence spending could lead to funding restraint for public services in chancellor Rachel Reeves’s spring spending review later this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This however would complicate Labour’s promises not to return to austerity, as well as campaign pledges to fix battered public services.Haldane, who is now the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, said: “We are approaching what will almost certainly be a brutal, and what could be an electorally defining, public spending review.“In an era of acute anxiety, this report is an arresting clarion – and wake-up – call to all political parties on the true and rising economic costs of crime and the societal consequences of continuing malign neglect of that most foundational of government responsibilities – the security of citizens.”Diana Johnson, the minister for crime and policing, said: “In the next decade, this government plans to halve violence against women and girls and knife crime, and restore public confidence in policing and the criminal justice system, as part of the Safer Streets Mission.“Through the Plan for Change, we will also bring visible policing back to communities, with 13,000 extra neighbourhood police officers, PCSOs and specials. Alongside this, the government will build 14,000 more prison places by 2031 to lock up dangerous offenders.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsCrimePolicePrisons and probationUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

We and others see it as something deeply troubling on the horizon,” the co-directors of the Archival Producers Alliance, Rachel Antell, Stephanie Jenkins and Jennifer Petrucelli,wrote on 1 March.Published over the Academy Awards weekend, their comment piece focused on the specific dangers of AI-generated footage within documentary film, and the possibility that unregulated use of AI could shatter viewers’ “faith in the veracity of visuals”.On Monday, the Los Angeles Times’sjust-debuted AI tool, “Insight”, labeled this argument as politically “center-left” and provided four “different views on the topic” underneath.These new AI-generated responses, which arenot reviewed by Los Angeles Times journalistsbefore they are published, are designed to provide “voice and perspective from all sides,” the paper’s billionaire owner, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong,wrote on Xon Monday. “No more echo chamber.”Now, a published criticism of AI on the LA Times’s website is followed by an artificially generated defense of AI – in this case, a lengthy one,running more than 150 words.Responding to the human writers, the AI tool argued not only that AI “democratizes historical storytelling”, but also that “technological advancements can coexist with safeguards” and that “regulation risks stifling innovation”.LA Times to display AI-generated political rating on opinion piecesRead more“Proponents argue AI’s potential for artistic expression and education outweighs its misuse risks, provided users maintain critical awareness,” the generated text reads.Antell, Jenkins and Petrucell declined to comment on the AI response to their opinion piece.The “different views” on LA Times opinion pieces are AI-generated in partnership with Perplexity, an AI company, according to the LA Times, while the “viewpoint analysis” of the piece as “Left, Center Left, Center, Center Right or Right”is generated in partnership with Particle News,the Los Angeles Times said.While Soon-Shiongargued on Mondaythat the AI-generated content beneath Los Angeles Times’s opinion pieces “supports our journalistic mission and will help readers navigate the issues facing this nation”, the union that represents his paper’s journalists take a different view.While the paper’s journalists support efforts to improve news literacy and to distinguish news from opinion, “we don’t think this approach – AI-generated analysis unvetted by editorial staff – will do much to enhance trust in the media,” Matt Hamilton, the vice-chair of LA Times Guild, said in a statement on Monday. “Quite the contrary, this tool risks further eroding confidence in the news.”The AI tool is only providing its extra commentary ona range of opinion pieces, not on the paper’s news reporting, the Los Angeles Times said.Most of the time, of course, the newspaper’s AI tool will not provide an AI’s response to arguments about artificial intelligence. Instead, as inseveral recent opinion pieces, the AI “Insights” button provides pro-Trump responses to opinion pieces critical of Donald Trump.Explore more on these topicsUS newsLos Angeles TimesUS press and publishingArtificial intelligence (AI)NewspapersLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

McMahon, who previously led the small business administration during Trump’s first term, now faces the paradoxical task of running an agency while simultaneously working toward its potential elimination.McMahon’s ascension comes amid reports that Trump is preparing an executive order instructing her to slash the department’s operations to the legal minimum while pushing Congress for its complete closure. During the confirmation process, she explicitly endorsed this vision, saying in her opening statement that she “wholeheartedly” supports Trump’s mission to “return education to the states, where it belongs”.Tracking Trump – updates on the presidency’s first 100 daysRead moreCritics have questioned McMahon’s qualifications, pointing to her limited educational background – a one-year stint on Connecticut’s state board of education and service as a trustee at Sacred Heart University – and lack of traditional experience in education policy or administration.But the incoming education secretary currently chairs theAmerica First Policy Institute, a Trump-aligned thinktank home to many of the education department’snominees for senior-level positions– an indication that McMahon will have idealogical allies that will position her to implement sweeping changes with minimal internal resistance.At her confirmation hearing, McMahon attempted to soften the administration’s hard-line stances, promising to maintain critical programs like Title I funding and Pell grants while acknowledging that only Congress holds the authority to eliminate the department entirely.The new education secretary takes office as schools and colleges nationwide scrambled to meeta 28 February deadlineto eliminate diversity programs or risk losing federal funding. A guidance document from the education departmentreleased over the weekendindicates they are not backing down from their strongly held anti-DEI positioning. It also comes days after the department launched aDEI reporting portalto catch diversity initiatives in public schools nationwide.The education department, created by Congress under former president Jimmy Carter in 1979, distributes billions of dollars annually to K-12 schools and oversees a roughly $1.6tn federal student loan portfolio.

A federal judge ordered the men, who themselves are in the country illegally, jailed without bond until their trial in April.The indictment names Renoj-Matul as the head of a vast human smuggling ring operating for at least a dozen years that primarily transports people to the US from Guatemala.The criminal network was responsible for the deaths of seven immigrants without legal status – including a four-year-old child – who were killed in a November 2023 vehicle crash in Oklahoma, prosecutors said.A driver who has been in custody in Oklahoma since that crash, Jose Paxtor-Oxlaj, was also charged in theCaliforniaindictment, according to the court documents. Another man, Helmer Obispo-Hernandez, a lieutenant in the organization and a supervisor of a team of drivers, faces charges as well. He is believed to be in Guatemala, officials said.Attorneys for the four men could not be located on Monday for comment.Renoj-Matual was assisted by associates in Guatemala who solicited people who each paid between $15,000 and $18,000 to be smuggled to the US through Mexico, prosecutors said.For an additional fee, the migrants were transported and moved to various destinations in the United States, including Los Angeles and Phoenix. Some of the migrants who were not able to pay the fees were held hostage in a stash house near downtown Los Angeles, according to prosecutors.“These smuggling organizations have no regard for human life and their conduct kills,” acting US attorney Joseph T McNally said in a statement. “The indictment and arrests here have dismantled one of the country’s largest and most dangerous smuggling organizations.”If convicted of all charges, the defendants could face a statutory maximum sentence of death or life imprisonment.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement led to a sharp sell-off on Wall Street.All Mexican exports to the US are set to face a levy of 25% under the plans. Most Canadian exports will face a 25% tariff, with energy products facing a 10% duty.1:27No room left for negotiation with Canada and Mexico on tariffs, says Trump – videoA 10% levy on China – introduced last month – will be doubled to 20%, according to an executive order released by the White House.China’s commerce ministry on Tuesday vowed countermeasures that it said were aimed at safeguarding its rights and interests. The US had “shifted the blame” and is using its problems with the deadly drug fentanyl as an excuse to impose tariffs, the ministry said in a statement.The US has argued that China supplies chemicals used in fentanyl production. China has denied wrongdoing. China urges the US to “immediately withdraw” its unilateral tariff measures that are “unreasonable and groundless, harmful to others,” the ministry said.But at a news conference, Trump told reporters tariffs were a “very powerful weapon”.The actions are set to prompt swift retaliation. “We’re ready,” said the Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau issued astatementon Monday, calling the US tariffs “unjustified” and vowing to immediately respond with a 25% tariff of their own.“Our tariff will remain in place until the US trade action is withdrawn,” Trudeau said, while urging the US to reconsider the tariffs. “Tariffs will disrupt a very successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.”Wall Street fell sharply after Trump’s remarks, with the S&P 500 down 1.7%, the Dow Jones industrial average down 1.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping over 2.6%.The tariffs will affect $900bn in annual imports from Canada and Mexico. The Ford CEO, Jim Farley, has warned they threaten to “blow a hole” in US industry.Trump has reluctantly conceded in recent weeks that higher tariffs could lead to higher prices in the US, but suggested the impact would be worth the cost. He has brushed off calls to tread carefully, escalating threats to go further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He described the levies as a “a powerful weapon” that other presidents had not used because “they were dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form”.Trump even took a swipe at Republican hero and staunch free-trader president, Ronald Reagan. “I’m a huge fan of Ronald Reagan but he was very bad on trade,” said Trump.Tariffs are “an act of war, to some degree”, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett warned recently. “Over time, they are a tax on goods,” hetold CBS News. “I mean, the Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ’em!”On Monday, Trump also pledgedto impose tariffs on overseas agricultural goods within weeks. He claimed his administration would introduce tariffs on farm products from 2 April.A string of such deadlines – including vows to hit Canada andMexicowith tariffs in January, and then February – have been delayed, however, as economists and business leaders urge caution.“To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social network, on Monday. “Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd.

He is one of more than 400 probationary employees fired at the agency this month.“Without my position filled, these species will be neglected for years to come,” Gladstone said. He said his firing left these species, among the most at risk under the Endangered Species Act, in particular danger due to the difficulty in finding and protecting them as their habitats face threats from development.“These are classic ‘canary in the coalmine’ species,” said Gladstone, who noted their condition was an indicator of the relative integrity of subterranean systems connected to the Edwards Aquifer, the sole water source for more than 2 million Texans. “I’m deeply disheartened and worried that future conservation efforts for these animals will cease.”Staffers in charge of recovery for the endangered black-footed ferret havealso been firedby the Trump administration, among other scientists, and funds for recovery have been frozen.Project 2025, the rightwing manifesto published ahead of last year’s election, argued the Endangered Species Act had a “dismal” record and claimed it impeded economic development, calling for the delisting of the gray wolf and grizzly bear.View image in fullscreenFerrets peek out of a hole at the Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center near Wellington, Colorado.Photograph: Will Singleton/APWhile a termination letter claimed that Gladstone’s “knowledge, skills and abilities” did not meet the department’s needs, his supervisor stated at a recent performance review that they had “never experienced a new employee completing what Nick accomplished in his first few months on the job”. He had worked for the service since May 2024.“There is an enormous amount that needs to be done in order to adequately protect these species, and even my role was insufficient in keeping up with it all,” said Gladstone.His story is not unique. A wildlife biologist at the US Fish andWildlifeService in Washington DC, whose role included improving efficiency for environmental reviews related to endangered species, said most of their department was fired as probationary employees. They lost their job, too.“We’ve been understaffed. We don’t have the funding to get the work done we need,” the biologist said. “And then, when we try to improve and get species to a recovery species so they are no longer listed [as endangered], it feels like all those efforts to get to recovery have been halted and set back.”The situation “feels really hopeless”, they added. “It is baffling to me, because so many people literally take these jobs because they care about the mission, they want to serve people, the land we live on, we want to protect, especially in my agency, species and natural resources.”Scientists working to address the climate crisis and protect US food systems have also had their work halted with firings.“The work I do in particular is really indispensable,” said a climate adaptation scientist with the US Geological Survey, who was fired as a probationary employee earlier this month. “We’re not in a time where we can slow-roll climate research. We were focused on how the climate is changing and conducting scenario planning and forecasting to better use our resources.“None of the work they have done here in cutting positions left and right, with no considerations whether these people can adapt to the policies of this administration, or to the amount of effort it took to hire these people, and likely for some to get rehired, it is just promoting more government waste.”The federal government’s scientific operation was “just being gutted”, the scientist said. “We are going to fall behind other countries. This isn’t the sort of thing you can pause or cut … It’s not something that can be privatized. It’s a wildly inefficient endeavor to do that requires consistent investment over decades, building teams and knowledge. It’s essentially washing away any of the incentives for people to devote their careers and lives for the betterment of society.”The office of special counsel hasdeterminedsome of the firings of probationary employees carried out by the Trump administration are unlawful and has requested some employees be reinstated with backpay, turning over enforcement to the Merit Systems Protection Board and requesting a 45-day stay of the firings.“TheTrump administrationhas interfered with life-saving medical research and meetings on cancer, vaccines, antibiotic resistance and more,” said Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “They have pulled funding for job-boosting technology initiatives and are working hard to fire civil servants who, for example, enforce laws that protect us from air and water pollution.“In addition, the Trump administration is burying information that the US public has paid for and demolishing government functions we all depend on.”US Fish and Wildlife, the US Geological Survey and US Department of Agriculture did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationEndangered speciesUS politicsClimate crisisConservationWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

He has worked in several roles at the grocery chain across stores, sales, marketing, manufacturing and strategy. Sargent is also the former chair and CEO of Staples.Ten thousand Kroger-owned grocery store workers strike in ColoradoRead moreMcMullen, 64, began his career with Kroger in 1978 as a part-time stock clerk and bagger at a store in Lexington, Kentucky. He worked his way up through the company, becoming the chief financial officer in 1995 and chief operating officer in 2009. McMullen was named Kroger’s CEO in 2014 and became the company’s chair the following year.Cincinnati-based Kroger said its board was made aware of the situation on 21 February and immediately hired an outside independent counsel to conduct an investigation, overseen by a special board committee.The company said that McMullen’s conduct was not related to its financial performance, operations or reporting, and did not involve any Kroger associates.Kroger will conduct a search for its next CEO, with Sargent agreeing to remain as interim CEO until someone is appointed to the role permanently.Kroger shares fell more than 3.5% ahead of the opening bell on Monday.McMullen’s departure comes as Kroger is regrouping from itsfailed effort to merge with Albertsons. The two companies proposed what would have been the largest supermarket merger in US history in 2022, saying they needed to combine forces to better compete with rivals such as Walmart.But two judges halted the $24.6bn deal in December, saying it was likely to lessen competition and raise prices. Albertsons later sued Kroger, saying it had failed to make every effort to ensure that the merger would win regulatory approval.Explore more on these topicsUS newsFoodRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

So I’m going to separate those two and make it transparent.”Doing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the US economy’s health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can affect the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists.Musk’s efforts to downsize federal agencies could result in the layoffs of tens of thousands of federal workers, whose lost income could potentially reduce their spending, affecting businesses and the economy at large.The commerce secretary’s remarks echoed Musk’s arguments made on Friday on X that government spending doesn’t create value for the economy.“A more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending,” Musk wrote on his social media platform. “Otherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don’t make people’s lives better.”The argument as articulated so far byTrump administrationofficials appears to play down the economic benefits created by some forms of government spending that can shape an economy’s trajectory.“If the government buys a tank, that’s GDP,” Lutnick said on Sunday. “But paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That is wasted inefficiency, wasted money. And cutting that, while it shows in GDP, we’re going to get rid of that.”The US commerce department’s bureau of economic analysis published its most recent GDP report on Thursday, showing that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final three months of last year.The report makes it possible to measure the forces driving the economy, showing that the gains at the end of last year were largely driven by greater consumer spending and an upward revision to federal government spending related to defense. Still, the federal government’s component of the GDP report for all of 2024 increased at 2.6%, slightly lower than overall economic growth last year of 2.8%.In the GDP report, government spending accounts for almost one-fifth of people’s personal income, which totaled more than $24.6tn last year. This includes social security payments, benefits for military veterans, Medicare and Medicaid and other programs. But the report also measures the amount of people’s personal incomes that are paid in taxes to the government.The government is not always a contributor to GDP growth and can subtract from it, which is what happened in 2022 as pandemic-related aid expired.Lutnick said that theTrump administrationwould balance the federal budget with spending cuts, saying that would help growth and reduce the interest rates paid by consumers.He also predicted that the US would have “the best economy anybody’s ever seen”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsElon MuskUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

Epsteindied in August 2019in prison while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex.One of Staley’s lawyers, Robert Smith KC, told a courtroom on Monday that while the FCA case relied on hundreds of email chains between the pair, some of their correspondence required additional context.That, Smith said, included two emails with photos of women attached. “The two women depicted in the images were mature women. The images were innocuous.”“One of them was a lady in an evening gown,” Smith added “That image should be read in the context of a comment by Mr Epstein that Mr Staley had chosen to spend his time with a man who was the former secretary to the US Treasury and who was now the head of the University of Harvard while Mr Epstein had been obliged to spend his time with the lady in question.”“None of the correspondence attaching the images involved any response by Mr Staley in relation to the appearance of either of the two women,” Smith added.The two-week hearing at the upper tribunal in London, which started on Monday, centres around a letter sent byBarclaysto the FCA in October 2019, which said “Jes has confirmed to us that he did not have a close relationship with Mr Epstein” and that his “last contact with Mr Epstein was well before he joined Barclays in 2015”.The FCA is arguing that the relationship between the pair was “indeed close” and it “went beyond one that was professional in nature”.Its own formal investigation, launched in December 2019 after the watchdog received further information from Staley’s former employer JP Morgan, also found Staley was in contact with Epstein in thedays leading up to his appointment being announced in autumn 2015.The regulator is alleging that the pair laterused Staley’s eldest daughter as an “intermediary”to stay in touch long after he became Barclays’ chief executive, until at least February 2017.Staley’s lawyers do not dispute that his daughter spoke to Staley about emails from Epstein, but says he does not remember the conversations.The FCA’s barrister, Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC, told the tribunal that Staley had a “motive to downplay his relationship” with Epstein, particularly afterEpstein was arrested in 2019for trafficking underage girls for sex.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wearing a dark grey suit and blue tie, the former executive sat with members of his legal team as opening arguments were delivered to a tribunal panel led by Judge Tim Herrington.Staley’s legal team is disputing the true purpose of a letter that Barclays sent to the FCA in October 2019, as well as claiming that members of the bank’s board had been briefed on the extent of his ties with the late financier.Staley’s lawyers will argue that the FCA had only asked for assurances around whether Staley or Barclays “had any knowledge of, or involvement in, Mr Epstein’s unlawful conduct”, rather than the extent and nature of their relationship. The lawyers claim that the letter would otherwise have “been drafted and approved in very different terms”.“Barclays knew that Mr Staley had had a ‘close’ professional relationship with Mr Epstein which had extended over many years … [and] that there were aspects of that relationship which were not confined to business,” the opening statement said.The FCA’s case will outline the depth of their alleged relationship, including claims that Epstein messaged Staley about sex, women and foreign holidays, while working behind the scenes to bolster Staley’s career by liaising with government officials, business leaders and royalty.The hearing is due to continue until at least 14 March.Explore more on these topicsBarclaysFinancial Conduct AuthorityJeffrey EpsteinBankingRegulatorsFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this content"

In London the surge in defence related shares helped to push the FTSE 100 to a new record high. It closed up 0.7% at 8871.31.The moves continued a steep rally in defence stocks as investors expected big increases in defence budgets by European countries, stoked by fears that Washington would withdraw security guarantees.Donald Trump has shocked longtime allies around the world by claiming that Ukraine is not “ready for peace”, three years after Russia launched a full-scale invasion. He has threatened to withdraw US support for the country after apublic meeting with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, descended into acrimony.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said on SundayEurope was “at a crossroads in history”as he hosted a summit in London with Zelenskyy and 18 other leaders, including France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to try to form a peace deal to support Ukraine.Defence bosses in Europe have long argued that weapons spending should be higher, and the prospect of the US removing its support has made politicians pay attention.A line graph showing the changes in share price of five leading European defence firmsShares in aerospace companies with significant defence revenues also rose on Monday. Airbus, the European passenger jet maker, rose by 5%, France’s Safran gained 3%, while the rally added to Rolls-Royce’s momentum after the British jet-engine manufacturersent investors into raptures last week with strong results. Its shares gained 4% on Monday, hitting a record high.The British defence technology company QinetiQ rose by 12%, while France’s Dassault Aviation gained 15%.BAE, Britain’s biggest weapons maker,reported record orderslast month as its annual profits topped £3bn for the first time in 2024. Its stock has more than doubled since the start of the war and the company is valued at £48bn.Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg investment bank, said: “Europe andGermanyin particular must – and very likely will – raise defence spending for themselves as well as for Ukraine well beyond recent plans. The UK and Norway have already pledged additional support for Ukraine. Germany will probably do so shortly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The increase in weapons spending will be funded through adeeply controversial cut in international aid spending.Macron called on Europeans to increase annual defence spending to more than 3% of GDP to counter the threat fromRussia. Germany’s likely new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is also in talks to push through higher defence spending.Analysts at JPMorgan said the events of the past two weeks had “turbocharged” their thesis of a European rearmament cycle, with leaders seeking to make more of their military equipment and import less from the US.“There are 30 European countries in Nato and we expect many of them will soon commit to much higher defence spending,” they said in a note, Reuters reported.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsAerospace industryBAE SystemsArms tradeEuropeUkraineEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Capri was formerly known as Michael Kors but was renamed after the US fashion brandtook over the shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2017, and then Versace in 2018.A sale at $1.5bn would represent a loss for Capri. Michael Korsbought Versace for $2.1bnbut the Italian brand has struggled in recent years.Capri this month reported revenues of $193m for Versace in the final three months of 2024, down 15% compared with the same period a year earlier. It is expected to be lossmaking this financial year, and then to break even in the next.Versace does not produce items such as luggage that remain resilient sellers for the likes of Louis Vuitton during slower periods. It is also facing questions over whether it willremain under the leadership of Donatella Versace, its designer since the death of her brother, Gianni, in 1997.At Milan fashion week, the Prada design boss, Miuccia Prada, said the Versace deal was “on everyone’s table”.Prada has been given access to Versace’s latest financial and sales figures after completing initial due diligence, Bloomberg reported.Capri had said it was optimistic about Versace’s long-term growth potential, but its forecasts show sales falling from $810m in the current financial year to $800m in the next year. However, the company forecast that sales would increase to $900m by 2028 and $1.5bn in the longer term.The agency S&P Global Ratings downgraded Capri’s debt in February, saying performance pressures and high borrowing could pose problems in repaying its debts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At age 30, he’s an elite fighter with a fervent fanbase that includes 7.6m followers on Instagram. He has yet to permeate the consciousness of mainstream sports fans. But for his admirers, everyGervonta Davisfight is a happening. Davis v Roach set the all-time event attendance record in the history of Barclays Center. The sold-out crowd of 19,250 engendered the arena’s second-largest gross ever, eclipsed only by the Rolling Stones.In the ring, Davis conducts himself like a champion. He’s a disciplined fighter who rarely makes foolish choices. Outside the ring, too often, he acts like a thug. Time and again, Gervonta has been involved with the criminal justice system. Several of these occurrences centered on the physical abuse of women. The most serious in terms of legal consequences to Davis resulted in his being incarcerated in 2023 after pleading guilty to charges related to a hit-and-run accident in which four people were injured.Gervonta Davis blames shock draw on hair product and missing ring girlsRead moreFormer Showtime Sports president Stephen Espinoza saw Davis as a cornerstone of Showtime’s boxing program before the network went out of the boxing business. Trying to put a positive spin on Gervonta’s troubles with the law, Espinoza declared, “What you get is authentic and raw. It’s an undeniable part of culture and media today, and perhaps more now than ever before. The saying ‘all publicity is good publicity’ is probably more true. I’m not saying it’s a good thing to have legal problems, and certainly not the kind of legal issues that Tank [Davis’s nickname] has had. But in a grander scheme, that media world we live in, where people are talking about you, it’s generally a good thing for your business or future.”That’s a cynical approach. Moreover, while Davis had synergy with Espinoza, Gervonta has had a lesser relationship with boxing’s new power broker - Turki Alalshikh (chairman of the Saudi Arabian General Entertainment Authority).In January, Alalshikh declared, “I want him [Davis] and I send message now [for] you to [PBC impresario] Haymon: Let’s do job, brother. Davis, of course we want him in our country.”In response, Davis posted on X, “They made me mad. If they want me, they gotta send me something to my front door .. like 2 Ferraris. Like before I even think about going over there.”Understandably offended, Alalshikh replied, “I heard in the media, Davis said, ‘Send to me two Ferraris to play in Saudi Arabia.’ I said to him, ‘We will send you two gloves if you want to play in Saudi Arabia; that’s it.’”Davis habitually blows off promotional obligations and has been known to arrive hours late for important media events. The kick-off press conference for Davis v Roach was scheduled to begin at Barclays Center on 3 December at 1pm. Late that morning, the media was advised by email that it had been rescheduled for 3pm. Later in the day, the time was pushed back another hour. The press conference finally started at 5.30pm.Roach had won the WBA 130lb title by split-decision over Hector Luis Garcia in 2023 and was stepping up in weight to fight Gervonta. Most observers saw Lamont as a sacrificial lamb, which he acknowledged at the press conference, complaining, “People talking shit about the fight.”During fight week, Davis’s contempt for his promotional obligations was on display again. On Wednesday, he arrived at Gleason’s Gym 45 minutes late for a promised “media workout,” spoke with PBC host Miguel Flores for several minutes, and left the gym without throwing a punch or answering questions from the assembled media.When fight night came, the eight-bout undercard was a mix of faded former champions, champions with alphabet-soup belts, young prospects, and club fighters without a future. Most of the fights were mismatches. But the night was about Gervonta. Every other fighter on the card, including Roach, was fungible.View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis, left, lands a punch on Lamont Roach during the ninth round of Saturday’s fight at Barclays Center.Photograph: Frank Franklin II/APThe crowds at Davis’s fights have a hard edge. Gervonta is an explosive fighter. When he fights, the arena pulsates with excitement. He’s skilled defensively, counterpunches well, and sets up his power punches particularly well. He’s also a southpaw, which makes the puzzle even more difficult for opponents to solve.Roach (who came into the fight with a 25-1-1, 10 KOs record) is a solid fighter. But he isn’t a puncher and wasn’t thought of as being on Davis’s level. Gervonta was a 12-to-1 betting favorite.The fight started slowly. Davis typically waits for his opponent to make a mistake and counters with power. But Roach fought with equal caution and didn’t give Gervonta much to counter. There was virtually no action in the early going. Lamont landed a meager seven punches in the first two rounds and Gervonta four. Only the sense of anticipation that accompanies a Gervonta Davis fight gave the proceedings drama.Gervonta Davis barely keeps title after disputed draw with Lamont Roach JrRead moreAs the rounds passed, both fighters opened up a bit with Roach holding his own in exchanges. The crowd kept waiting for something big to happen. In round nine, it did. But it wasn’t what anyone expected.Fifty seconds into round nine, Roach landed a jab followed by a solid right hand that landed flush up top. Davis took a knee. And referee Steve Willis blew the call.Despite starting a count, Willis allowed Davis to go to his corner where a cornerman wiped his face with a towel. Then, without calling a knockdown or otherwise penalizing Gervonta, Willis allowed the action to continue.That was a horrible mistake. A fighter cannot call a time-out in boxing. At the very least, Willis should have ruled that Gervonta taking a knee was a “knockdown.” Further on the spectrum, he could have penalized Davis another point for corner interference or even (and this would have been going too far) disqualified him.Compounding the blunder; the New York State Athletic Commission has a video-replay review official on site who is charged with reviewing incidents of this nature. But the erroneous call was not corrected because the PBC-Amazon production team failed to provide a replay to the commission for review within the requisite one minute before the next round began.Eric Marlinski scored the fight 115-113 for Davis. Steve Weisfeld and Glenn Feldman had it even at 114-114. Two of the judges - Marlinski and Feldman - scored round nine for Davis, making Steve Willis’s blunder a three-point swing on their scorecards.Had Willis properly called a knockdown, Roach would have won a 115 -112, 114-113, 114-113 decision.When the draw was announced, the pro-Davis crowd booed loudly. At first, it seemed possible that fans were unhappy because Gervonta hadn’t been awarded the decision. But that possibility was erased when the crowd booed Gervonta during a post-fight interview as he explained that he’d taken a knee because, “I just got my hair done two days ago and she put grease in my shit. So, the grease, when you sweat, it was coming into my face.”New York boxing fans have a sense of fairness even if some referees don’t.What’s next for Davis? For starters, Gervonta lost some of his lustre as a fighter on Saturday night. One also has to question. his state of mind.Ten years ago, at the dawn of his boxing career, Gervonta told David Greisman, “I come from a dark background. I was in foster care and group homes and stuff because my mom was on drugs and stuff like that. [Then] my grandma got me back from foster care. I started school. I was in a new neighborhood. So I was a new kid on the block and I was light-skinned and I was short, so I had to fight a lot.”From those origins, a personality was forged and a fighter born. Now, after myriad troubles, Davis has been talking recently like a man who is reevaluating his life:“Being betrayed, everything I’ve been through. That’s me now just trying to separate myself from it. I’m trying to move further and further away from where I come from. I feel as if I can become a better person but it’s not there yet. The person I can become, I can see it, but this [boxing] is holding me up from getting that. I still got to build myself up and be angry to fight. That’s like contradicting myself.”“It’s stuff that I catch myself doing. I would do it and then I’d be like, ‘If I didn’t have this in me, it wouldn’t have happened. I wouldn’t have snapped if I wouldn’t have had the mean side in me. Or I could handle it in a better way than the way I went about it.’ I got kids now. I don’t wanna snap on my daughters. I feel as if I can remove everything and work on myself, like going back to school, getting therapy and moving on; I feel like as though that would change me as a man.”“I want to do therapy, right? But I feel as though, if I do therapy, it would lose the fire that I have inside of me. I want everything out of me where so I don’t think about even getting angry. I want to be much softer, be more humble and things like that. I don’t want to box no more. After the second fight [in 2025], I’m out of the sport.”But first things first. Davis has unfinished business with Lamont Roach. In all likelihood, they’ll fight again. But for now, the bloom is off the Gervonta Davis rose.Thomas Hauser’s email address isthomashauserwriter@gmail.com. His most recent book – a memoir titledMy Mother and Me– is now available in stores.

I am excited to partner with Larry and all of Canada in creating this new WNBA franchise and legacy.”Williams, one of the greatest tennis players in history, will play an active role in future jersey designs.She made her professional tennis debut at age 14 at a tournament in Canada in 1995, and her last event was the 2022 US Open. Williams won 23 grand slam singles titles – the most by a woman in the sport’s open era – plus another 14 major trophies in women’s doubles alongside her older sister, Venus.“Serena is a champion,” said Tempo president Teresa Resch. “She’s the greatest athlete of all time, and her impact on this team and this country is going to be incredible. She’s set the bar for women in sport, business and the world – and her commitment to using that success to create opportunities for other women is inspiring – we’re thrilled to be marking the lead-up to International Women’s Day with this announcement.”Williams is the latest former pro athlete to join a WNBA ownership group. Magic Johnson, Tom Brady, Dwyane Wade and Renee Montgomery already are owners.This isn’t the first ownership venture for Williams. She has a stake in the Angel City FC women’s soccer team. She also holds minority stakes in the Miami Dolphins as well as TGL’s Los Angeles Golf Club, the virtual golf league headed by PGA stars Tiger Williams and Rory McIlroy.Williams’ husband, Alexis Ohanian, donated millions of dollars to Virginia’s women’s basketball program last year.

Johnson, 81, made the announcement during an appearance on The Herd with Colin Cowherd.“As you know, probably the most fun I’ve had in my career, and that’s counting Super Bowls and national championships, was at Fox Sports,” Johnson told Cowherd. “I have an absolute ball with my friends on the set. The best friends I’ve ever had are at Fox.“But I’ve made an extremely difficult decision,” he continued. “I’ve been thinking about it for the last four or five years, and I’ve decided to retire from Fox. I’m going to miss it. I’m going to miss all the guys. I’ll see them occasionally. It has been a great run, starting back 31 years ago.”Johnson also told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in a story Monday that he is leaving broadcasting to focus more on outside business interests.Initially planning to work at Fox for a short time, Johnson left the network to coach the Miami Dolphins starting in 1996 and returned in 2002.The original crew in 1994 also included former NFL star players Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long, who remain with the group.

In the end, only one moment truly mattered and that was Matz Sels’ penalty shootout save from Jack Taylor to sendNottingham Forestinto the FA Cup quarter-finals at Ipswich’s expense.George Hirst and Ryan Yates exchanged goals in the second half of normal time, when the game finally came to life, but no one could source a winner prior to the shootout after a forgettable extra time.Nottingham Forest v Ipswich: FA Cup fifth round – liveRead moreThe spot-kicks were exceptional from both teams until Taylor could not find the corner and the Belgian goalkeeper got behind it to set up a trip to Brighton, a sideForest recently beat 7-0, in the next round.“I am really, really happy,” said the Forest manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, who could not bear to watch the shootout. “We have so many hopes in theFA Cup, we want to go as far as we can. Winning on penalties puts you on a high. They were good penalties.“Matz was amazing for us. It is a good moment, it is important for the club to give it a go. We have to focus on the Premier League but the FA Cup will always be on our mind. We proceed on our journey together, the fans made a big noise for the penalties, it helped our penalties and distracted the Ipswich players.”View image in fullscreenThe England manager Thomas Tuchel (top row, second right) was in the stands at the City Ground but didn’t have many potential England players to monitor.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersIt is only the second time Forest have reached the final eight of the competition in the past 29 years. When Hirst headed home the opener after 53 minutes, the prospect of them doing so looked bleak, because by that stage the hosts had struggled to find their rhythm and test the Ipswich goalkeeper, Alex Palmer.The England head coach, Thomas Tuchel, was in the stands, although his viewing pleasure was somewhat diminished. Nuno and the Ipswich manager, Kieran McKenna, faced difficult selection choices with Forest enjoying an unlikely battle for a Champions League spot and Ipswich scrapping for survival at the other end being their main focus. The consequence of this was 14 changes between the two teams from their most recent outings and the disjointed opening 45 minutes was proof of the struggle.Forest came alive only after Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson were sent on to inject energy into the team and the crowd. It had been a quiet night at the City Ground with little to cheer, although they were treated to some drama as the full-time whistle approached.The upside to Hirst’s goal was that it highlighted that Forest needed to improve to avoid sleepwalking out of the FA Cup. The home side were stirred into life and were level soon after when Anthony Elanga swung in a cross for the captain Yates to head home. It gave the hosts not just an equaliser but the confidence to search for a winner.Forest now had the momentum and they were the only side with a chance of winning in the 90 minutes. Yates headed in again but it was rightly ruled offside, while Murillo forced Palmer into a stunning save and Callum Hudson-Odoi thwacked the bar with a shot from the edge of the area to ensure an additional half hour was required.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, though, the track and field equivalent of landing on Mars is apparently just 3min 59.37sec away.That was thestartling conclusion of a studyin the Royal Society Open Science journal last week, which predicted that a woman could shatter the four-minute mile barrier with the help of aerodynamics. Not just any woman but Faith Kipyegon, the Kenyan Olympic 1500m champion and the greatest female middle distance runner in history.The reports were breathless, the coverage sympathetic. Naturally, Sir Roger Bannister’s mythical 3:59:4 mile in May 1954 was evoked. All that was missing was detailed scrutiny or analysis.The first thing to say? The study, led by Prof Rodger Kram, a physiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, is a serious piece of work – according to Dr Michael Joyner, an expert in human performance at the Mayo Clinic.In 1991 Joyner wrote a paper stating that it was physiologically possible to run a marathon in under two hours. At that point the world record was 2hr 06min 50sec. Nearly three decades later, Kipchoge proved him right by running 1:59.40 in Vienna in 2019, thanks to a quantum leap in super shoe technology and the help of 40 elite pacemakers, who subbed in and out of the run and adopted an arrow formation to help him draft and reduce wind resistance.View image in fullscreenRoger Bannister hits the tape to become the first person to break the four-minute mile, on 6 May 1954 in Oxford.Photograph: APKram was part of Kipchoge’s team for that run – which did not count as the official record – and in his latest paper he scrutinises the race in Monaco where Kipyegon obliterated the women’s mile world record by almost 5sec. As he points out, her time of 4:07.64 was achieved despite poor drafting, and for being alone for the last 600m.Multiple equations follow. But essentially Kram’s thesis is that if Kipyegon had teams of pacemakers in front and behind – something that wouldn’t be allowed in an official world record attempt – she could have cut the level of wind resistance she faced by 72%.“Our calculations suggest that with greatly improved (but reasonable) aerodynamic drafting, Kipyegon could break the four-minute mile barrier,” the paper concludes. “We find that she could feasibly run 3:59.37 with two teams of female pacers (one 1.2m in front and one 1.2m in the back) who change out at 800m.”The experts do note, however, that there is “considerable variability among the drafting effectiveness values reported in the literature”. And this is where every coach I speak to starts to wince, before stressing the vast gap between theory and reality.Steve Magness, a renowned coach and the author of The Science of Running, reckons that in practice “you’re looking at a second and a half, maybe slightly more” from better drafting in that race. Not the nearly 8sec needed.But the study does raise an interesting question. What will it take for a woman to shatter the four‑minute mile barrier?Crucially, says Magness, someone would need to be capable of running a 4x400m relay leg in about 50sec, and an 800m in around 1:53 – something no woman except Jarmila Kratochvilova and Nadezhda Olizarenko in the dark days of the 1980s has ever achieved.“Women are a little bit more aerobic than men,” Magness says. “But the demands to run a four minute mile are the demands to run a four-minute mile. And we have a good idea historically of what it takes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joyner owns a book, How They Train, written by Fred Wilt in the 50s, which he says still contains many of the methods used by top athletes today. Magness points out that milers have been employing the legendary British coach Frank Horwill’s Five Pace Training Theory for decades.So that leaves us with further advances in super‑shoe technology. And according to Trevor Painter, coach of the Olympic 800m gold medallist Keely Hodgkinson, considerable help is on its way. “Nike’s tech team came out to South Africa earlier this year to show us samples of what’s to come,” he told me. “Next year there’s a new shoe coming out which is like: ‘Wow, this is a bit of space age.’ It will shave tenths off track times, no doubt.”What does Painter make of Kipyegon’s chances? “She has run 1:57 high for 800m but in the right race can probably go 1:55. Can she go sub-four with shoe improvements and with the help of a male pacemaker? Possibly. She often runs the latter half of the race alone at the front, so you never know.”Armand Duplantis hits high notes before soaring to 11th pole vault world recordRead moreAnother way to get closer, Joyner says, would be to attempt a record on the banked and ridiculously quick indoor track in Boston in the US, where Grant Fisher recently set the indoor 5,000m world record. But even with all these incremental gains, there is still some way to go.“I’ve learned my lesson from the sub‑two marathon attempt to never say never,” Magness says. “But we’re still too far out. The shoe tech will get us closer. Pacing will help a little bit. Using Maurten’s bicarb system [which allows athletes to legally push harder and faster doing high-intensity exercise] will make a slight but significant difference. But I don’t think it makes up that gap. Seven seconds is still seven seconds, which is a lot in a mile. When someone gets to 4:02-4:03, then it would be like: ‘OK, we’ve got a shot.’”Joyner agrees, but still wants to see Kipyegon give it a whirl. “I hope she tries it,” he says. “And if she runs 4:03 or 4:04, that’s hardly a failure, is it?”Explore more on these topicsAthleticscommentShareReuse this content"

Just like Chicago Fire and Vancouver Whitecaps did in similar Messi-less situations, the team apologized to their ticketholders, then bargained with them.“Unfortunately, we have no control over who plays for our opponent,” the team said in a statement, before offering a free ticket to a subsequent Dynamo game to every fan in attendance.It’s a move that can be read a couple ways. The more cynical among us may see it as cloying, unlikely to appease the fans that bought that ticket for a specific reason. Some may also see it as a little weak. A certain amount of risk is inherent to just about any ticket purchase for live sports – admission does not guarantee a win for the home team, nor does not guarantee that you’ll see everyone you thought you’d see. Is it unfortunate that Messi was withheld? Sure, but them’s the breaks, and outside of askingInter Miamito telegraph their best player’s availability to all teams in advance of each game (not gonna happen), there really isn’t a way to avoid this type of situation.Messi no-show prompts Houston Dynamo to issue apology and free ticketsRead moreThen there’s the more charitable view. More than likely, the fans that flooded Shell Energy Stadium did so at great cost to their time, and perhaps their wallet as well (tickets for the match were going for over $200 on resale sites as of Friday). There’s no denying that Messi is the league’s main attraction for people that haven’t engaged deeply withMLSor its teams before. By giving away tickets, the Dynamo at least give themselves a chance to turn a potentially negative fan experience into a positive one – and maybe gain a few repeat attendees in a market that sorely needs more of them (Not that the team gave fans much reason to return, having been smacked 4-1 by an Inter Miami squad who was better in every way on the night).Wherever you fall on that spectrum, the fact that MLS teams now seemingly have a “sorry Messi isn’t here” playbook speaks not just to Messi’s immense fame and popularity, but also to the fact that many MLS teams’ local fanbases are still developing any sort of strong connection to their clubs. If you feel compelled to give away your team’s games for free based on a competitor’s decision, then that doesn’t say much about your team, does it?AAView image in fullscreenWilfriend Zaha was given the Man of the Match crown for his performance.Photograph: Jacob Kupferman/Getty ImagesWilfried Zaha’s uneven and irresistible debutInWilfried Zaha, Charlotte FC has a new king. Actually, he may be the club’sfirstking. Liel Abada is capable of great moments while forward Patrick Agyemang continues to develop, but do either of them have the game-breaking ability of the former Crystal Palace winger? No, not on the evidence of Saturday’s statement win over Atlanta United.MLS Year 30: A league at a philosophical crossroads as World Cups loomRead moreFor the first 45 minutes of his MLS debut, though, Zaha did very little game-breaking. The match was titled towards Atlanta who controlled possession and restricted the Ivorian. Then, after halftime, Zaha showed why so many believe he could be a gamechanging addition to Dean Smith’s side, creating the opening goal before scoring one himself.Smith will want even more out of Zaha. The winger had just 20 touches of the ball in the first half. The home team struggled to get him the ball quick enough to unsettle Atlanta who also found it too easy to move through the channel between Stian Gregersen and Miguel Almirón down Zaha’s side. On another day, Charlotte would have been behind at the half.But on this particular day, Zaha made the difference andCharlotte FC, with their best-in-the-East defense, now have a player who can decide a match in an instant.Heavy is the head that wears the crown, but Zaha can handle it.GRView image in fullscreenHirving “Chucky” Lozano will presumably miss some time with a non-contact injury suffered on Saturday.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APChucky Lozano’s injury was both significant and predictableHirving “Chucky” Lozano istheguy for San Diego FC. Brought in to be the face of the expansion franchise, Lozano is undoubtedly the most famous and most decorated player to show up for year one in a city that borders his native Mexico.While Andres Dreyer, Jasper Loffelsend and CJ Dos Santos may prove to be savvy acquisitions who win over the hearts of fans in America’s Finest City, they’re mostly unknowns for now. San Diego brought Lozano in to be the star and, just maybe, to replicate a bit of the magic Carlos Vela did when he arrived at Los Angeles FC as their own double-threat – an El Tri star that can both win games and sell tickets.To win games or sell tickets, though, you need Lozano to stay on the field. So it was concerning when he left San Diego’s home opener – a 0-0 draw against St Louis – after just half an hour of play, thanks to what appeared to be a non-contact injury suffered while running down a loose ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lozano always has played in a way that leads to him taking a beating. He was consistently the most fouled player in Liga MX when he started his career with Pachuca and regularly topped fouls received charts at later stops in the Netherlands and Italy. He’s paid the price as well, missing matches in December 2023 and January 2024 with a hamstring issue, an entire Gold Cup with Mexico after being victim of a bruising tackle in the opening match against Trinidad and Tobago in 2021, and other similar absences throughout his career. He’d hoped to return to the national team in March, but a call-up for the Nations League now could be at risk.Other than the injury, which SDFC said it would evaluate Sunday but as of writing is yet to provide a public update, the team has had a good start, beating the defending champion LA Galaxy on the road the week before Saturday’s home opener.SDFC general manager Tyler Heaps was asked several times in preseason about Lozano’s injury history and said the team was confident it would get a huge minutes load out of its star but also hoped to build depth to cover potential absences. That depth may have to show up far sooner than SDFC hoped.JAView image in fullscreenMurrell celebrated with a home run swing, for some reason.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesGreat goal, confusing celebrationWhenDC Unitedneeded a hero, Christian Benteke stepped up.Wait, hold on a second, I’m getting new information.When DC United needed a hero … Jacob Murrell stepped up?In the 91st minute of DC’s clash with the Chicago Fire, a Benteke penalty miss looked to be the final twist in a contest featuring no shortage of unstable moments. There was DC’s inability to defend on set pieces, something that saw them hand two goals to big-money striker Hugo Cuypers. There was the injury to Fire defender Carlos Teran in warmups, which forced Gregg Berhalter to start Sam Rogers at center back, where he proceeded to look a half-step behind the pace for the entire match. Space, chances, and chaos abounded at Soldier Field. Defense (rest, set piece, or otherwise) was optional.Given that, maybe it shouldn’t have been surprising that a 20-year-old with more appearances for Georgetown University than DC United managed to clean up Benteke’s mess with a miraculous 96th minute equalizing bicycle kick. But maybe Ishouldhave been surprised when he followed up that bike with a … home run celebration?I still don’t get it. It’s Soldier Field, not Wrigley. But I sure do get one thing: Benteke should be buying Murrell a nice steak dinner the next chance he gets.JLExplore more on these topicsMLSInter MiamiUS sportsHouston DynamoCharlotte FCLionel MessiWilfried ZahafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other than Amorim, the other three worked between 1914 and 1931. Sunday’s FA Cup exit against Fulham, admittedly, did not contribute to that. It was possible, even, in the aftermath of a penalty shootout defeat, to argue it had been one of United’s better recent performances. They’ve only lost two of their previous eight games. But it’s also just 3 March and United already have no chance of winning any domestic competition this season.Manchester City aside, the FA Cup is now pleasingly free of superclubs; any of the other seven quarter-finalists would relish a rare trip to Wembley in May. None of those other seven have won anything since Villa won the League Cup in 1996. This is a season in which the competition will have a real sense of meaning something, which might be a sign of the strength of the Premier League’s middle, or of the struggles of the elite, or a one-off caused by a combination of draw and calendar.Fulham’s sensible plan punishes a fading institution with stubborn tactics | John BrewinRead moreFor United, all that remains is the Europa League – and Real Sociedad will provide stiff opposition in the last 16 on Thursday. But to this United, so would anybody. The club now also has the task of closing a 10-point gap on Brighton and Bournemouth that might get them into at least the Europa Conference League for next season. Winning the Europa League, quite apart from the emotional boost of a trophy and a night of celebration in Bilbao in May, would also bring qualification for next season’s Champions League and an injection of about £160m, desperately needed for a club that lost £113.2m last year, and which over the last three years has lost almost three times the £105m permitted under Profit & Sustainability Regulations. Certain aspects of that can be discounted for PSR calculations which means United are unlikely to be in breach in this window, but the situation is far from healthy.A year after buying a quarter of the club and taking over management of the football side of the business, Jim Ratcliffe’s reign has been notable for job losses and penny-pinching that has devastated morale, removing minor perks from staff, upping ticket prices and withdrawing concessions, while at the same time indulging in costly reshuffles of the directorial classes. The executives get huge salaries and payoffs for turning the richest club in England into a laughingstock; the ordinary worker lives in fear of the sack and sees theirlunches turned into fruit or soup and breadwhile the office is being warned over its excessive use of tape. Welcome to modern capitalism.Manchester United consider early termination of lease on Kensington offices to save moneyRead moreAs United sank to eighth last season, their worst league finish since 1990, the FA Cup offered rare cheer. There was theabsurd 4-3 victory over Liverpoolin the sixth round, with Amad Diallo’s 120th-minute winner, and an almostequally ridiculous penalty shootout winagainst Coventry in the semi, losing a 3-0 lead and then seeing their opponents have a late winner ruled out for a marginal offside. Then there was a far better performance in the final, a controlled 2-1 win over Manchester City that offered enough apparent reason for optimism that, despite the club interviewing various potential replacements, kept Erik ten Hag in the job until October. That was also a decision that cost £14.5m in paying off his contract and the loss of the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, plus an additional £180m in transfer fees for players who may or may not – mostly not you’d have to say at this stage – fit how the new manager wants to play. But, you know, mind how much tape you’re using on that.At least any decision on Amorim’s future can be made without the emotional complications of a euphoric afternoon out at Wembley – although frankly it’s very hard to know what it can be based on. Sunday may not have been too bad by recent standards but it wasn’t good. United were reduced to playing on the counter at home againstFulham, while conceding from a corner for the 13th time this season. Chido Obi showed promise from the bench, but already there was the sense of the familiar United cycle beginning: an exciting 17-year-old burdened with the expectation to be overplayed and broken in the way so many possible messiahs have been over the past decade.FA Cup fifth round: talking points from the weekend’s matchesRead moreThere was a widespread acceptance that in learning an entirely new system under Amorim, United would have to get worse to get better. The first part of that, at least, has been achieved. But United are 14th in the league, which would be their worst finish since they were relegated in 1974. Is there any sign things are getting better? Is there any reason beyond blind faith and the lack of an alternative to think this will end well? And, perhaps most pertinently of all, would you trust Jim Ratcliffe and his politburo to be able to discern it if there were?On this day …View image in fullscreenGary Crosby used his head in an unusual way for a memorable goal.Photograph: ITVNottingham Forest v Manchester City, 3 March 1990. Gary Crosby, the Forest winger, made a run in from the left flank, hoping to get on the end of a cross from the right from Garry Parker. But Andy Dibble, the City goalkeeper, claimed the cross and Crosby’s run was for nothing. His momentum took him off the pitch and, crucially, out of Dibble’s eyeline. Dibble waited, letting everybody get up field before he launched a long kick into the Forest half. Thinking his box was empty, he relaxed, holding the ball on the palm of his right hand. But Crosby was still jogging back. As he passed Dibble, he leaned in, nodded the ball off his hand, and knocked it into the empty net.The referee Roger Gifford allowed the goal, determining that Dibble no longer had it under control. The convention was that, once a keeper had taken it in two hands, it was under his control until he had cleared it – essentially to prevent players trying to nick it off him as he tossed it up to drop-kick. Dibble’s act fell into a grey area – although it’s almost certain the goal would not be allowed today. Forest won 1-0, but both teams finished in midtable.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

We have to be fully prepared, then we have a good chance to beat them. It will be a tough game against a young team with a strong coach. But I believe in our team and we have to play at our best. When you hear the Champions League anthem, it gives something special.\"PSV have not kept a clean sheet in their last seven Eredivisie matches, conceding three against Go Ahead Eagles. However, Peter Bosz, the manager, said he has no plans to adapt his side's aggressive style which has helped them score in every home game this season.\"I already indicated last year that defending starts with attacking,\" he said. \"We immediately put pressure on the ball, which allowed us to win it back quickly and often did not have to defend at all. Football is a complex sport. You cannot point to one single aspect. It is a combination of many factors that have to come together well. It is often small details that prevent us from winning matches. We are working intensively to improve those details and I am responsible for that.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked how they could turn things around, Timber said: “I don’t see it as negative but we’ve been through a lot, especially the last couple of weeks, but it’s a challenge for us and we have to take it.

Unai Emery conceded things are ­delicately balanced with this a ­significant moment in Villa’s season.Villa slipped to ashock defeat at the Belgian championsin November, their first on their return to Europe’s premier club competition. Brugge scored the only goal from the spot after Tyrone Mings was penalised for bizarrely picking the ball up inside the box.Champions League last 16: tie-by-tie analysis and predictionsRead moreMcGinn said the Villa squad went through clips of their defeat before training on Monday. “We need to play a lot, lot better than the last time we played here,” the Villa captain said.“We know we need to be at our best to get a result. We analysed the game this morning [on Monday], so we know the parts of the game which we were poor at, so we are well set for tomorrow.”McGinn said the arrivals of Marco Asensio andMarcus Rashford on loanhave boosted Villa. “They come with a huge reputation. They are hungry and want to succeed, they work hard and that’s all you want as a teammate. There are no big egos … we haven’t seen that yet if there is. They have both fitted in well,Marco had a couple of goalsat the weekend and I’m hoping one of them falls to the feet of Rashford so he can get off the mark. Obviously they are two brilliant players and I’m delighted they are here.”Villa have been erratic in the ­Premier League but continue to fight on three fronts after advancing to the FA Cup quarter-finals on Friday. But, aside from a blip in Bruges anddefeat in Monaco, their European form has been impressive.“We’ve got an opportunity to make some history, but [there is] a long, long way to go in each competition,” McGinn said. “I think the exciting thing for us is we know we’ve not had top form yet. We’ve still got a lot more to give. There’s been a big ­inconsistency about us this season, so hopefully towards the end of the season we start to click more consistently, and we can do something special.“Competing in the elite competition in Europe has taken its toll domestically and we know we’ve got it in us to put a run together. We’ve proved that over the last few seasons. We’re excited to get some players back, there’s a little bit more of a spark and a buzz, the squad is going to get healthier towards the end of the season.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ancelotti and Simeone share a long acquaintance, considering both remember facing each other in Italy’s Serie A.“My first memory of him is as a footballer with Lazio, when he scored against Juventus. I was a coach in a game that was for the league title. Lazio won and they took the championship, I think it was 2000,” Ancelotti told a press conference on Monday.“Now, as a coach, I respect him a lot. He’s a great manager. He has done very well at Atlético, taken them to the highest level in Europe. I like the way he reads the games, how he gets the team on the pitch, the strategy, the commitment his team has defensively. I like all of these aspects a lot.”Ancelotti said that Real will not fall into the trap of overconfidence from previous results as the holders push for a record-extending 16th European Cup and seventh title in 12 seasons. “It’s going to be a close tie that will to be decided in the second leg. The objective tomorrow is to play well and take an advantage,” Ancelotti said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, said at the time: “To this date, we don’t have a global club competition for women. We need to give players an opportunity to perform on the global stage and to develop themselves in all the continents of the world.”A men’s club World Cup was launched in 2000, known then as the Fifa Club World ­Championship, and this summer, in the US, it becomes a 32-team quadrennial competition, with Manchester City and Chelsea the Premier League’s two representatives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Delia Smith no longer on Norwich’s board after takeoverNorfolk Holdings completes majority takeoverSmith and husband Wynn Jones step down from boardPA MediaMon 3 Mar 2025 16.14 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 17.49 ESTShareNorfolk Holdings has completed its majority takeover ofNorwich City, with Delia Smith and her husband, Michael Wynn Jones, no longer part of the club’s board.It was announced in August that Norfolk Holdings, led by the Milwaukee Brewers owner, Mark Attanasio, was set to increase its shareholding to around 85%, which would result inSmith and Wynn Jones stepping downas directors and becoming honorary life presidents.A statement from Norwich on Monday evening confirmed the change in majority shareholder, with long-serving duo Smith and Wynn Jones now holding a 10% stake in theChampionshipclub.“Norwich City Football Club can confirm that Norfolk Holdings, the group led by Mark Attanasio, have completed the conversion of the entire D Preference Shares into Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis,” a statement read.“As a result, Norfolk Holdings now owns approximately 85% of the club’s ordinary share capital, withDelia Smithand Michael Wynn Jones holding 10%, and the remainder being held by the club’s other shareholders.“The club’s board of directors remains consisting of Mark Attanasio, Richard Ressler, Tom Smith and Zoe Webber.”‘A message to the best football supporters in the world ... we need a 12th man here. Where are you? Where are you? Let’s be having you. Come on!’ Delia’s half-time speech became legendary.Celebrity chef Smith and Wynn Jones have been shareholders at Norwich since 1996, but Attanasio bought a 15.9% stake in 2022. Last April it was increased to 40.4% and Attanasio’s Norfolk Holdings group now owns “approximately 85%” of Norwich, who are 11th in the Championship but still in the mix for the playoffs despite a run of one win in five.Smith’s rallying cry of “let’s be having you” and “where are you?” at half-time during Norwich’s clash with Manchester City in February 2005 remains one of the most famous speeches of the Premier League era.Norwich’s then majority shareholder took the field with a microphone after watching her side pegged back to 2-2 after taking a two-goal lead. Smith’s call to arms did not inspire a second-half winner for the Canaries, with City sealing a 3-2 win.Explore more on these topicsNorwich CityDelia SmithChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

While downsizing at their current office is also being considered, it is understood that moving out entirely two years into a 10-year agreement is viewed as the most likely course of action. United’s offices in Kensington are located less than a mile from Ineos headquarters in Knightsbridge, but this convenience is unlikely to influence Ratcliffe’s thinking, which is based on making the club as financially efficient as possible.Ratcliffe has often preferred to use his Ineos offices for United business since buying a 28% stake in the club 15 months ago, with Erik ten Hag’s fate as manager effectively sealed at a Knightsbridge summit in October involving the 72-year-old co-owner, the chief executive, Omar Berrada, the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and the technical director, Jason Wilcox. The Dutchman was sacked two weeks later, withRuben Amorin appointed as his replacementshortly afterwards.United set a trend for big northern clubs when opening a London office 15 years ago, a move since followed by Manchester City, Liverpool, Everton and Leeds, which played a part in transforming them into a commercial juggernaut. Under the leadership of the former executive chair Ed Woodward, most of United’s senior staff were based in London, including the club’s senior transfer negotiator, Matt Judge, with the offices also used to entertain corporate clients and leading agents from around the world.Under Woodward’s successor, Richard Arnold, United’s centre of gravity moved back towards Old Trafford and the Carrington training ground, a change of emphasis that has accelerated following Ratcliffe’s £1.25bn investment in the club. United signed a 10-year lease to rent the entire top floor of the Kensington Building, which covers 16,000 sq ft, plus a 7,000 sqft roof terrace, before Ratcliffe bought into the club in May 2023, so some renegotiation will be required.Ineos have made a habit of such renegotiations in recent months, with Ratcliffe’s parent company also looking to reduce their cost base amid rising debts. In addition to the cuts at United, which last week included the revelation that the staff canteen at Old Trafford will close withfree lunches replaced by fruit, Ineos have severed ties with Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup team, served notice toNew Zealand Rugby over a sponsorship dealwith the All Blacks and entered into discussions with Tottenham over an early termination of Ineos Grenadiers’ partnership agreement with the club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The latest changes also follow earlier alterations to working patterns at United implemented by Ratcliffe, including a ban on working from home, which led to some corporate hospitality boxes at Old Trafford being repurposed as temporary offices on non-match days due to limited space.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffenewsShareReuse this content"

Her Game Too, which launched in 2021, will take the lead on providing support to victims of abuse.The campaign comes after a significant increase in reports of sexism in recent seasons.Research from Kick it Outhas shown that more than half of all female fans (52%) have experienced or witnessed sexist behaviour or language on match-days, but a striking 85% of those people said they had not reported the incident, with many believing it would not make a difference.“We are delighted to be joining forces with Kick It Out officially,” said Caz May, the CEO of Her Game Too. “They have an extremely experienced team dedicated to handling reports, and with Her Game Too being run by volunteers, it makes sense to spread the workload across both organisations. Her Game Too will still be on hand to support victims, offering face-to-face or virtual meet ups with our ambassadors and advisers across the country.”Explore more on these topicsFootballKick It OutnewsShareReuse this content"

But Millwall have hit out against the widespread criticism directed at Roberts, and commentators who suggested the player set out to harm Mateta.In a statement released on Monday afternoon,Millwallsaid: “The club are disgusted by abuse directed towards goalkeeper Liam Roberts following Saturday’s unfortunate collision with Jean‑Philippe Mateta.“The reporting on the matter, as well as disgraceful suggestions made by certain news organisations and high-profile figures within the sport that Liam intended to harm Jean-Philippe, has contributed to the unwarranted character assassination of Liam and fuelled abhorrent online abuse towards him.“No player at Millwall Football Club steps on to the pitch with the intent to harm another, and the club will continue to support Liam, who reached out to Jean-Philippe personally on Saturday evening with an apology which was accepted immediately. The club are pleased to hear positive updates from Jean-Philippe and wish him the best in his recovery.”Roberts is facing a three-match ban for his tackle, but the FA has the power to request an extended punishment by submitting a claim that the challenge was “truly exceptional” and the sanction “clearly insufficient”.The FAwas in discussions on Monday over how to proceed, with any request needing to be formally made before a deadline of 1pm on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dave King, the largest shareholder atRangers, would be expected to sell his stake in any arrangement, but a number of other investors are also reported as being interested in selling up.49ers Enterprises also include Leeds United in the ownership portfolio, with its president, Paraag Marathe, serving as chair at Elland Road. Marathe is said to be working alongside Andrew Cavenagh, the executive chair of health insurance company ParetoHealth, to finance the deal.Speaking last week at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit, Marathe did not comment on any Rangers acquisition but acknowledged 49ers Enterprises were looking at further investments.“I can’t really comment on whatever rumours might be out there,” Marathe said. “But we are looking at other opportunities. It is doable to replicate the passion [of Leeds United]. What we are looking for is clubs with the right bones, history of success and potential for growth.”Concerns have been raised over the possibility of Rangers becoming a feeder club for Leeds if the deal went through. Parathe said such an arrangement would not be considered by his group.“Leeds United stands alone, if we were to look at another club that would stand alone,” he insisted. “What you can share and do on the sporting side, we haven’t looked at one club as a feeder club. Just like there is to love all of your children, there’s enough room in your heart to love all your sports properties.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also put his name forward forthe most recent Indian Premier League auction, despite playing his last competitive T20 match more than a decade ago. He was not picked up but has now opted to put his name in the hat for the Hundred, a format the fast bowler has only ever previously been involved with as a pundit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The draft takes place next Wednesday, with a total of 37 places to be filled in the men’s side and 29 in the women’s squads.Anderson hinted at his interest shortly after swapping his England whites for a consulting role on the coaching staff, saying: “Watching the Hundred this year, seeing the ball swing around, it makes me feel like I could do a job there. There’s definitely a bit of intrigue with the shorter formats because I’ve not played any franchise stuff before.”When the competition first launched, Anderson was notionally affiliated in a non-playing capacity to Manchester Originals – whose home ground of Old Trafford boasts the James Anderson End – but that link was never formalised. The Originals have five spots open in the squad – ranging from the top £200,000 pay bracket to a spot at £63,000 – and space for a senior pace bowler in their ranks.A host of capped England players are up for grabs, including the likes of Jason Roy, Dawid Malan, Rehan Ahmed, Zak Crawley and Dan Lawrence, while there could be interest in rising stars like Rocky Flintoff, Archie Vaughan and Ben McKinney. For those registered in the draft but unsuccessful this time, there is another chance to be picked up as a wildcard signing later in the season.Explore more on these topicsJimmy AndersonThe HundredCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The Swiss federal prosecutor has appealed against that decision, leading to a new hearing at the extraordinary appeals chamber of the Swiss criminal court in Muttenz, near Basel. The prosecutor asked for the judgment to be set aside in full.Fifa’s Gianni Infantino defends ‘crucial’ relationship with Donald TrumpRead moreBlatter told the court on Monday he was not guilty of fraud. “When you talk about falsehoods, lies and deception, that’s not me. That didn’t exist in my whole life,” he said. “We had principles in my family – we take only money we have earned. I am innocent.”Blatter, who was Fifa president for 17 years,resigning in 2015following a separate corruption scandal, said before the hearing that he felt he was the subject of a witch-hunt. “I am very positive,” the 88-year-old told reporters outside the court. “Today is a very sunny day and I’m going into this with positive energy.”Platini told the court that he had a contract agreed to work for four years as an adviser to Blatter between 1998 and 2002. He was not paid immediately because Blatter saidFifalacked the funds to pay him at that time. Platini invoiced Fifa for the payment in 2011. “I knew that Fifa would pay me what it owed sooner or later,” the three-time European footballer of the year said. “When Fifa asked me to make an invoice, for me it was simple. It was 500,000 multiplied by four years; that’s two million. I made an invoice and 10 days later I was remunerated, and I paid my taxes on it.”The 2022 indictment accused Blatter and Platini of deceiving Fifa staff in 2010 and 2011 about an obligation for world football’s governing body to pay Platini in his capacity asUefapresident. “They falsely claimed that Fifa owed Platini, or that Platini was entitled to, the sum of two million Swiss francs for advisory work,” the indictment read. “This deception was achieved through repeated untruthful claims made by both accused parties”.View image in fullscreenMichel Platini speaks to the media.Photograph: Urs Flüeler/APBlatter and Platiniwere suspended from football in 2015by Fifa for ethics breaches, originally for eight years, although their exclusions were later reduced. The pair were cleared in the 2022 case after a judge accepted that their account of a “gentlemen’s agreement” for the payment was credible. The judge also said serious doubts existed about the prosecution’s allegation that it was fraudulent.The Swiss federal prosecutor is seeking a sentence of 20 months, suspended for two years, against Blatter and Platini. A verdict is expected on 25 March.Explore more on these topicsFootballFifaMichel PlatiniSepp BlatterUefaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Someone else wrote: “Give that girl a burger.”Liz responded in an ­Instagram post, saying: “We come in all shapes and sizes, they ­obviously do not understand that being an elite ­runner brings lower body fat but being an idiot and not fully ­understanding that your body needs to be fueled ­properly by eating or your body will not ­perform especially for marathons.”She said her 34-year-old ­daughter was “strong enough” to shrug off the negative comments, but added she was concerned for younger ­athletes. “Stop the jealousy and abuse of women athletes online by posting ridiculous and stupid comments as above. My concern as a parent is not for Eilish as she is of a strong enough character to deal with these people my concern is for other kids, athletes that are not so strong of character to deal with demeaning and abusive comments on their appearance.”Others were quick to back up ­Eilish when she reposted her mother’s message. “You are an inspiration,” one supporter wrote on Instagram. Another wrote: “So sorry. Keep going. Remember – social media isn’t real.”Eilish is aiming for a fast time in London next month, and hopes to one day eclipse Paula ­Radcliffe’s ­British record of 2hr 15min 25sec.“It’s so unrealistic to think I’m going to go in and break Paula ­Radcliffe’s record on my first attempt,” she said.“That’s nonsense.

I want us to be better.”There’s not much evidence that’s going to happen.Phoenix lost for the 11th time in 14 games and fell to 28-33 for the season. The team is four games behind the Dallas Mavericks for the final spot in the Western Conference play-in tournament and will need a minor miracle over the last 21 games of the season just to have a chance at the postseason.It’s far from the situation that the Suns expected back in October. They started the year with championship aspirations with a highly-paid and accomplished roster that includes Durant, four-time All-Star Devin Booker and three-time All-Star Bradley Beal.But after an encouraging 8-1 start to the season, the Suns have a 20-31 record since 13 November. Injuries haven’t helped, but the Suns were at full strength Sunday night and still got routed in their own building.The Trade™, three weeks on: Dončić, Davis and the art of the NBA breakupRead more“We’ve got to go on a run, but it’s got to start,” coach Mike Budenholzer said. “There’s no doubt that the standings, the circumstances that we’re in, there’s an awareness and we’ve got to do something to change it.”Phoenix actually led 51-49 at halftime Sunday, but Minnesota rallied for an 83-72 lead heading into the fourth.That’s when things really went south for the Suns, who didn’t appear to be giving much effort in the final minutes. They had nine turnovers in the fourth quarter including several that led directly to easy Minnesota baskets. Beal was called for a Flagrant 1 foul when he pushed Anthony Edwards on a dunk attempt.Scattered boos were heard from the home crowd in the final minutes.The Timberwolves – led by Edwards’ 44 points – were the far superior team. Julius Randle returned after missing more than a month with a groin injury and had 20 points. Donte DiVincenzo torched the Suns for eight three-pointers and the Phoenix defense appeared to have little interest in guarding him at times.Minnesota was the team that swept the Suns out of the playoffs last season in the first round. The Timberwolves have won all three regular-season meetings this year.“When adversity hits, we start floating a little as a team,” Durant said. “That’s tough to deal with it.”Phoenix tied a season high with 22 turnovers and gave up a season-high 40 points off those turnovers. Durant, Booker and Beal combined for 14 of the turnovers.“That’s why we lost,” Durant said. “Forty points off turnovers, tough to overcome that. They didn’t overpower us on the glass, we just gave them the ball.”Explore more on these topicsPhoenix SunsNBAMinnesota TimberwolvesBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

I’m genuinely concerned about their use of data, linked to the ownership model.”The ICO introduced a children’s code for online privacy in 2021, which requires companies to take steps to protect children’s personal information online.The information commissioner, John Edwards, told the PA news agency that the regulator expected to find plenty of positive safety elements in place across the sites during its investigation, but wanted to ensure their processes were robust.“It’s what they’re collecting, it’s how they work,” he told PA. “I will expect to find that there will be many benign and positive uses of children’s data in their recommender systems. I would expect to find there will be elements that are designed to keep children safe and to make sure they only get appropriate things, and that’s all for the good.“What I am concerned about is whether they are sufficiently robust to prevent children being exposed to harm, either from addictive practices on the device or the platform, or from content that they see, or from other unhealthy practices.”The ICO said its investigations would look into whether there had been any infringements of data protection legislation. If any evidence of potential breaches is found, the regulator said it would put it to the platforms and obtain their representations before reaching a final conclusion.Edwards said the regulator was “not picking on TikTok” by making it the subject of an investigation on a topic common across social media, and hoped to understand more about the wider social media landscape through the investigation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sector is a jewel in the crown of our economy and vital for growth.“The clock is ticking. Without proper guardrails put in place, rapacious tech bosses will continue to cash in on creatives’ work without their consent.”Paul Fleming, the Equity union’s general secretary, said: “The industrial-scale theft of performers’ and artists’ work by big tech must stop.“Equity’s groundbreaking TV and film negotiations show that empowering workers can help deal with the challenges of AI.“The government’s proposals undermine an entire industry – bosses and workers alike – and threaten the efficacy of bargained solutions through unquestioning support of big tech.UK ministers consider changing AI plans to protect creative industriesRead more“The government should embrace this AI manifesto in place of their misguided proposals and recognise that it is people who make our creative industries successful.”Emma Reeves, the chair of the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain, said: “Writers’ work is already being stolen on an industrial scale to train AI systems, without permission or payment – infringing 300-year-old copyright protections.“Without stronger protections for writers, big tech could be allowed to take what they like, when they like, without any requirement to share the profits with writers or other creators.“This will not only harm creators themselves, but will likely deal a serious blow to the emerging AI market and harm the creative industries too. Alternatively, the voluntary licensing of work for AI training offers a potential for growth.”Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for science, innovation, and technology, said: “Securing Britain’s future as an AI leader and safeguarding the rights and rewards of people at work must go hand in hand as we navigate the complex and challenging technological revolution facing us all.“Our consultation into AI and copyright closed this week and we are now considering the full range of the thousands of responses we have received.“Let me be absolutely clear – no changes will be considered unless I am completely satisfied that we are delivering a solution which works for creators. That is my firm red line.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Trade unionsTUCEmployment lawIntellectual propertyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

We and others see it as something deeply troubling on the horizon,” the co-directors of the Archival Producers Alliance, Rachel Antell, Stephanie Jenkins and Jennifer Petrucelli,wrote on 1 March.Published over the Academy Awards weekend, their comment piece focused on the specific dangers of AI-generated footage within documentary film, and the possibility that unregulated use of AI could shatter viewers’ “faith in the veracity of visuals”.On Monday, the Los Angeles Times’sjust-debuted AI tool, “Insight”, labeled this argument as politically “center-left” and provided four “different views on the topic” underneath.These new AI-generated responses, which arenot reviewed by Los Angeles Times journalistsbefore they are published, are designed to provide “voice and perspective from all sides,” the paper’s billionaire owner, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong,wrote on Xon Monday. “No more echo chamber.”Now, a published criticism of AI on the LA Times’s website is followed by an artificially generated defense of AI – in this case, a lengthy one,running more than 150 words.Responding to the human writers, the AI tool argued not only that AI “democratizes historical storytelling”, but also that “technological advancements can coexist with safeguards” and that “regulation risks stifling innovation”.LA Times to display AI-generated political rating on opinion piecesRead more“Proponents argue AI’s potential for artistic expression and education outweighs its misuse risks, provided users maintain critical awareness,” the generated text reads.Antell, Jenkins and Petrucell declined to comment on the AI response to their opinion piece.The “different views” on LA Times opinion pieces are AI-generated in partnership with Perplexity, an AI company, according to the LA Times, while the “viewpoint analysis” of the piece as “Left, Center Left, Center, Center Right or Right”is generated in partnership with Particle News,the Los Angeles Times said.While Soon-Shiongargued on Mondaythat the AI-generated content beneath Los Angeles Times’s opinion pieces “supports our journalistic mission and will help readers navigate the issues facing this nation”, the union that represents his paper’s journalists take a different view.While the paper’s journalists support efforts to improve news literacy and to distinguish news from opinion, “we don’t think this approach – AI-generated analysis unvetted by editorial staff – will do much to enhance trust in the media,” Matt Hamilton, the vice-chair of LA Times Guild, said in a statement on Monday. “Quite the contrary, this tool risks further eroding confidence in the news.”The AI tool is only providing its extra commentary ona range of opinion pieces, not on the paper’s news reporting, the Los Angeles Times said.Most of the time, of course, the newspaper’s AI tool will not provide an AI’s response to arguments about artificial intelligence. Instead, as inseveral recent opinion pieces, the AI “Insights” button provides pro-Trump responses to opinion pieces critical of Donald Trump.Explore more on these topicsUS newsLos Angeles TimesUS press and publishingArtificial intelligence (AI)NewspapersLos AngelesnewsShareReuse this content"

A camera that could detect your gestures and replicate them on-screen in a game, the Kinect allowed players to control video games with their bodies. It was initially a sensation, selling1m units in its first 10 days; it remainsthe fastest-selling gaming peripheral ever.However, a lack of games, unreliable performance and a motion-control market already monopolised by the Nintendo Wii caused enthusiasm for the Kinect to quickly cool. Microsoft released a new version of theKinect with the Xbox One in 2013, only for it to become an embarrassing flop; the Kinect line wasunceremoniously discontinued in 2017. The Guardian reached out to multiple people involved in the development of the peripheral, all of whom declined to comment or did not wish to go on record. Instead, the people keenest to discuss Microsoft’s motion-sensing camera never used it for gaming at all.Theo Watsonis the co-founder ofDesign I/O, a creative studio specialising in interactive installations – many of which use depth cameras, including the Kinect. “When the Kinect came out, it really was like a dream situation,” he recalls. “We probably have 10+ installations around the world that have Kinects tracking people right now … The gaming use of the Kinect was a blip.”View image in fullscreenAssistants demonstrate the game Kinect Adventures for Xbox 360 during a media briefing in 2010.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni / Reuters/ReutersWatson speaks about the Kinect, which turns 15 this year, with rare relish. (“I cannot stop talking about depth cameras,” he adds. “It’s my passion.”) As part of the collaborative effort OpenKinect, Watson contributed to making Microsoft’s gaming camera open-source, building on the work of Hector “Marcan” Martin. It quickly became apparent that the Kinect would not, as Microsoft had initially hoped, be the future of video games. Instead, it was a gamechanger in other ways: for artists, roboticists and … ghost-hunters.The Kinect functions on a structured light system, meaning it creates depth data by projecting an infrared dot cloud and reads the deformations in that matrix to discern depth. From this data, its machine learning core was trained to “see” the human body. In games such as Kinect Sports, this allowed the camera to transform the body into a controller. For people making interactive artwork, meanwhile, it cut out much of the programming and busywork necessitated by more basic infrared cameras.“The best analogy would be like going from black-and-white television to colour,” says Watson. “There was just this whole extra world that opened up for us.” Though high-powered depth cameras had existed before, retailing at about $6,000 (£4,740), Microsoft condensed that into a robust, lightweight device costing $150 (£118).Robotocists were also grateful for an accessible sensor to grant their creations vision and movement. “Before it, only planar 2D Lidar information was available to detect obstacles and map environments,” says Walter Lucetti, a senior software engineer atStereolabs, which is soon to release the latest version of its advanced depth-sensing cameras and software. The 2D Lidar detects objects by projecting a laser and measuring the time the light takes to reflect back; the Kinect, however, could create a detailed and accurate depth map that provided more information onwhatthe obstaclemay be and how to navigate it. “Before Kinect-like sensors,” Lucetti says, “a tuft of grass was not perceived differently from a rock, with all the consequences that entails for navigation.”This type of depth camera now powers a host of autonomous robotics, including2020’s Perseverance Mars Rover’s AutoNav system, and Apple’s facial identification tech. (Apple bought PrimeSense, the Israeli company behind the Kinect’s structured light system, in 2013.)View image in fullscreenNasa’s Mars Perseverance Rover in 2020.Photograph: Nasa/UPI/REX/ShutterstockThe Kinect’s technology was soon eclipsed by freely available open-source sensors and more advanced motion-sensing devices. But since Microsoft ceased manufacture of the Kinect line in 2017, the little camera has enjoyed a spirited and not entirely un-troubled afterlife. It haswatched over the Korean demilitarised zoneand worked on topography and patient alignmentin CT scanners; reports have emerged of it being used in airport baggage halls, as asecurity camera in Newark Liberty International airport’s Terminal C(United Airlines declined to comment on this), and even togamify training for the US military. It’s been attached to drones, rescue robots and even found a brief application in pornography.“I’m not sure anyone had a firm vision of what interactive sex involving the Kinect would be,” says Kyle Machulis, founder ofbuttplug.ioand another member of the OpenKinect team. The camera was deployed mostly as an over-complex controller for 3D sex games, fulfilling “more of a futurist marketing role than anything of actual consumer use,” Machulis says. In that role, it was successful: it attracted a flurry of attention, and threats from Microsoft to somehow ban porn involving Kinect. It was an interesting experiment, but it turned out that the addition of a novelty device was not a turn-on for many porn users. Besides, as Machulis says, when the camera malfunctions, “it looks pretty horrible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They deploy its body tracking to find figures the naked eye cannot see. Ghost hunters are thrilled by the Kinect’s habit of “seeing” bodies that aren’t really there, believing that these skeletal stick figures are representations of disembodied spirits.The paranormal investigation industry doesn’t care much about false positives, so long as those false positives can be perceived as paranormal – which is just as well, says Jon Wood,a freelance science performerwho has a show devoted to examining ghost hunting technology. “It’s quite normal for ghost hunters to be filming themselves in the dark, with infrared cameras and torches. You’re bathing the scene with IR light, while using a sensor that measures a specific pattern of infrared dots,” he says. Given that Kinect is designed specifically to recognise the human body in any data it receives, it would be stranger if the Kinectdidn’tpick up anomalous figures in this context.There’s a certain poetry in the Kinect living on among those searching for proof of life after death. In the right hands, the camera is still going strong. Theo Watson points me in the direction ofConnected Worlds, an exhibition that has run in the New York Hall of Science since 2015. Of the many Kinect devices that power the installations, only two have had to be replaced in the decade since it opened – and one of those was only a few weeks ago. Watson started stockpiling the device when Microsoft ceased production.“Half the projects on our website wouldn’t exist without the Kinect,” he says. “If we had this camera for another decade, we would still not run out of things to do with it.”Explore more on these topicsGamesSurveillancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fast cars, impulsive decisions, and peak misery between the age of 40 and 50. But all that is changing, according to experts.In anew papercommissioned by the UN, the leading academicsJean TwengeandDavid Blanchflowerwarn that a burgeoning youth mental health crisis in six English-speaking countries worldwide is upending the traditional pattern of happiness across our lifetimes.Whereas happiness was once considered to follow a U-shape – with a relatively carefree youth, a tougher middle age and a more comfortable later life – the experts in wellbeing say our satisfaction now rises steadily with age instead.UK watchdog to investigate TikTok and Reddit over use of children’s dataRead more“The U-shape in wellbeing by age that used to exist in these countries is now gone, replaced by a crisis in wellbeing among the young,” according to the paper published by the US National Bureau of Economic Research.Analysing responses to surveys in the US, UK,Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the study found that life satisfaction and happiness had fallen among young people over the past decade, and particularly among young women.It highlighted the rise of smartphones and social media, suggesting the trend coincided with the growth of internet usage, with the impact on happiness visible in surveys across the six countries and in several other nations worldwide.Young people in despair chart“This may end up being a lost generation,” Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, told the Guardian in an interview. He said there had been a sharp drop in wellbeing in the US and the UK in particular, and pointed to the growth of social media, cyberbullying and body shaming online.“The young have become isolated. It’s also not so much that people are sitting there on the phone, it’s what they’re not doing. They’re not going out as much; playing with their friends, interacting with others, or having as much sex.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Young people are in deep disarray and trouble. And the question is what do we do about it? And we don’t know.”David Blanchflower“I don’t think there is any doubt you have an absolute global crisis.Young peopleare in deep disarray and trouble. And the question is what do we do about it? And we don’t know.”A leading British labour market economist now at the prestigious US Dartmouth College, Blanchflower had written a paper in 2020 looking across almost 150 advanced and developing countries and found the same U shape in happiness applied everywhere. However, he now says he missed the collapse in youth wellbeing from about 2013 in survey data, before starting to work with Twenge, who is a leading expert on the subject.“I looked and I thought, ‘Oh shit, she’s right.’ What had happened is a really big deal. It wasn’t Covid, it had started before that, but that extended it after 2020.”Other studies have drawn links between the youth mental health crisis andintergenerational inequality, unregulated social media, insecure employment and the climate crisis. Young people are also increasingly like to be outside the jobs market with mental health conditions.Blanchflower said the collapse in youth wellbeing could have vast social and economic consequences. “The economics of this are a really big deal. Potentially this relates to the kids withdrawing from school; then they go out of the labour force. Presumably it will affect your performance at school, it might well impact global productivity,” he added.He said the UN had commissioned further research to identify whether the phenomenon could be found elsewhere around the world. “The UN sees this as a huge global crisis,” he added.“We always thought that as life becomes more realistic, happiness declines because of pressures, then you realise life isn’t so bad. We’re having to rethink that entire thought.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthHappinessHealth & wellbeingWork & careersUnited NationsIrelandCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago – and to keep doing so.”That this needed saying underlines the extent to which Donald Trump’s administration is laying waste to decades-old assumptions governing transatlantic relations. Appearing to prioritise a reset of the US relationship with Russia over international law and the unity of the west, Mr Trump ispursuinga peace deal with Moscow on Vladimir Putin’s terms. At the same time he is seeking to plunder Ukraine’snatural resources, while demanding obeisance and gratitude from Kyiv in return.For the sake of Ukraine, which has fought with such bravery forthree yearsto resist Mr Putin’s illegal invasion, and for the sake of its own future security interests, Europe’s response needs to be unified, robust and ambitious. In that respect, the Londondefence summitconvened by Sir Keir Starmer on Sunday was a useful start, but multiple uncertainties remain.The bullying and taunting of Mr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office meant the conference rightly became an occasion for a counter-display of emotional solidarity, embodied in the bear-hug the Ukrainian president received from Sir Keir in Downing Street. Substantively, however, Europe’s strategy for dealing with an unpredictable and ideologically hostile White House is a work in progress.Alongside much-needed commitments to boost military assistance to Ukraine, Sir Keirannouncedthat a “coalition of the willing” would be created to deter Russian violations of any future peace deal. By presenting their ownplansfor a ceasefire, significantly increasing defence spending, and pledging “boots on the ground” to police a peace agreement, European leaders aim to persuade Mr Trump to offer the US security guarantees that are indispensable if such a force is to be deployed.For this balancing act to have a chance of success, as yet unidentified Nato members will need to step up alongside Britain and France with substantial troop contributions, and relations between Kyiv and Washington will need to be patched up. Achieving the latter will be anything but easy. But Mr Zelenskyy’saffirmationon Sunday that he remained willing to sign a minerals deal with Mr Trump represented a recognition of this grim necessity.The prospect of Kyiv being bounced unwillingly into a ceasefire without guarantees, as Mr Trump licenses a territorial carve-up to reward Mr Putin’s murderous aggression, is intolerable. Through diplomacy in Washington, but also through military assistance on a scale that will require more flexiblefiscal rulesin Brussels and in national capitals, Europe must build on the London summit to give Ukraine agency and a voice in determining its own destiny.More broadly, the evidencemountsthat as Mr Trump seeks to forge a new understanding with Mr Putin’s revanchist regime, he is indifferent to the impact on European security and interests. As Sir Keir commented at the close of Sunday’s summit, Europe stands “at a crossroads”. Strategic autonomy, and far greater sovereign capability, will be needed to navigate the challenging route ahead.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hollywood is as scared of the world right now as you and I areEmma BrockesPerhaps the Ozempic was making people light-headed, or the stars felt they should stay silent. Either way, there was a notable lack of politicsMon 3 Mar 2025 11.48 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.27 ESTShareTheOscars ceremonyon Sunday night was long and boring, as it has been for a few years, but this year its shortcomings landed differently. Hollywood’s waning influence, which registered most glaringly last month in the large number of American nominees who showed up in London forthe Baftas– not something they were inclined to do in better times – gave the ceremony a sense of low-stakes irrelevance that was frankly a relief from the rest of the news cycle. Still, the question lingers as to why the actors and presenters largely, and mercifully in my view, stayed away from mention of Donald Trump.After thedevastating wildfiresin Los Angeles in January, the classy thing to have done this year would’ve been to cancel or at least radically downsize the Oscars ceremony, but of course no one involved was going to vote for that. Instead, audiences were treated to a muted spectacle celebrating movies with record-breakingly small box-office returns, includingThe Brutalist, in which Adrien Brody relived the US postwar construction boom in real time, andAnora, one of the lowest-grossing best pictures of all time, about an exotic dancer whomarries a rich Russian. (What could be behind the deep and abiding fascination of straight male directors – and novelists, and podcasters – with the “sex worker community”? That’s right, it’s altruism.)In 2017, in the wake of Trump’s first ascent to the presidency, there were many fiery speeches from the Oscars podium, among them Jimmy Kimmel’sopening monologue, which was dominated by Trump content; a defence of immigrants led by the actor Gael García Bernal; and the director Barry Jenkins entreating those in need of help toreach out to the ACLU. This year, by contrast, there was almost nothing: a decent Anora-related joke by the host, Conan O’Brien, about Americans being “excited to see somebodyfinally stand up to a powerful Russian”. The actor Zoe Saldaña referring pointedly to her immigrant parents. And some criticism of the US government by the Israeli-Palestinian team behind No Other Land, the winner of best documentary.If it’s cowardice, it’s not of the ordinary kind. At the 2017Oscars, there was a running gag about Meryl Streep and Trump premised on the then popular idea that Trump was a big dummy who fluked his way to the White House. That tone doesn’t work now. In fact, given the five-alarm fire of American politics, comic flippancy about Trump has to be calibrated more finely than the broad, bland platform of the Oscars is perhaps designed to accommodate.There is also the question of Hollywood’s role in the collapse of the Democratic vote. This is probably delusional thinking, but there may have been a grain of humility – or at least of self-interested awareness – in the decision by wave after wave of Oscar-winning actors on Sunday not to use the podium to make political points. Looking back at the Kamala Harris campaign, which relied heavily on A-list Hollywood support, the conviction that celebrities swing votes or win hearts has never been less popular or assured. Some in the auditorium on Sunday may even still be in recovery from the failure ofTime’s Up(remember that?), a dog’s breakfast of a movement in which Hollywood’s leading ladies leveraged their fame for an admirable cause that somehow ended up with Amy Schumer mugging for attentionon the Capitol steps.‘Don’t worry, I’m lawyered up!’: the best quotes of the 2025 OscarsRead moreI feel for public figures in a way: damned if they do, damned if they don’t. After Sunday night, the film industry looks craven and weak – on the other hand, as Ricky Gervais memorably pointed out when he hosted the Golden Globes in 2020: “You’re in no position tolecture the public about anything. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.” No one needs Adrien Brody’s thoughts on anything outside acting – and even that, let’s face it, is a drag.And yet, given the customary willingness of actors and directors to espouse political causes, the silence on Sunday has added to the clanging, baffling sense in the US of: where, exactly, is the dissent? Why aren’t people screaming? (JD Vance and his family did have to be moved to a secret location while on a skiing holiday in Vermont last week because of the numbers whocame out to protest.)Perhaps all the Ozempic in the room had made people light-headed. Perhaps the lack of politics was pregamed. Producers said ahead of the ceremony that the telecast would focus on the ways in which film-making requires “community and collaboration”, which sounds a bit like Jeff Bezos’scommitment to “personal liberties”on the op-ed pages of the Washington Post. Only the actor Daryl Hannah, who managed to throw a V-sign and say: “Slava Ukraine!” to cheers from the crowd, failed to get the memo.The takeaway is that, in Hollywood as elsewhere, people are scared, not only because Trump is petty and vindictive but also because the vast uncertainty of the world we’re suddenly in can make judicious silence seem more sensible than speeches. Where that tips into capitulation – and whether Hollywood, like the tech and media industries, will give us our era’s version ofLeni Riefenstahl– remains to be seen.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsOscarsOpinionAwards and prizesAnoraThe BrutalistDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, another petition,started by the online campaign group 38Degrees, was nudging towards 150,000, while the Mail on Sunday was demanding exactly the same thing. Robert De Niro was pithier at the Oscars (“Fuck Trump!”), as he had beenat the Tony awardsin 2018, but finding allies in Hollywood has never been that difficult.The Stop Trump Coalition has been around since his first term, protesting against his Muslim travel ban and the insult to feminism that they felt his ascent to high office represented.

Oh yeah, they were trashing the UK’s trade relationships with the EU and then, when it all went wrong, blaming the remainers for not giving in fast enough.A lot of the arguments on both sides were quite convincing, which was dispiriting. On the one hand, thewomen’s marches that happened simultaneously-ishacross the world, time zones allowing, were an incredible and galvanising display of solidarity. On the other hand, authoritarians love protest marches: if they’re peaceful and disperse naturally, they simply prove that a mob, even if it’s a million strong, doesn’t add up to a hill of beans democratically speaking, and can be forgotten as fast it was conjured; if they they kick off, they simply deliver the excuse a state needs to flex its power. Petitions generate the same splits on the left, between those who think that it’s important to say something rather than nothing, and those who think that any collective action that yields no result can only result in disillusionment.This time round, there are side arguments specific to Trump’s state visit and the wisdom of wanting it to be cancelled, which is funny, because there is no imaginable world in which King Charles pays attention to an e-petition, but unfunny, because the people who query almost any form of protest will have a point. It is nearly 15 years since the coalition launched the government’s official e-petition website, with the rule that if a petition gets 100,000 signatures, it will automatically be debated in parliament. One of the biggest petitions since then was in 2021, when more than 1 million people called for an end to child food poverty. Over three years later,food insecurity in households with childrenwas still escalating. Whatever the obstacle was to finding a solution, it turned out not to be that politicians were unaware of the problem, nor that they didn’t realise so many people were sickened by it.There is a lot about our current situation that is familiar, in other words – that sense of trying to meet a mounting horror with tactics that caused quite a stir in the 17th century but seem to have lost some of their power since. Also, that feeling that it will always, in the face of a giant political foe, be more comfortable to pass the time squabbling about whether it’s better to confront him or trick him or ignore him. That way we can pretend that nothing has really changed: we’ve been arguing with each other for centuries.But there’s also something unfamiliar about this moment: revulsion for Trump now spans everyone from what you could happily call the hard left, to what we may tactfully call … not the hard right but the deep right. Everyone has Trump’s number: from his meetings with the Russian president, he appears to have chosen the side of Putin; he cannot be appeased. The issue with petitions and demonstrations is not one of immediate efficacy any more. It’s that, when confronted with necropolitics, you rear away in disgust because you must, as you would if you saw a dead badger.That said, there is a demonstration in support ofUkraineoutside the US embassy in London on Wednesday. And the fact is that, the more people show up, the bigger the impact will be.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It would be a mistake to placate themMon 3 Mar 2025 06.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 09.09 ESTShareIt’s not only about Donald Trump. It’s not just aboutsaving Ukraine, or defeating Russia, or how to boost Europe’s security, or what to do about an America gone rogue. It’s about a world turned upside down – a dark, fretful, more dangerous place where treaties and laws are no longer respected, alliances are broken, trust is fungible, principles are negotiable and morality is a dirty word. It’s an ugly, disordered world of raw power, brute force, selfish arrogance, dodgy deals and brazen lies. It’s been coming for a while; the US president is its noisy harbinger.Take the issues one at a time. Trump is a toxic symptom of the wider malaise. For sure, he is an extraordinarily malign, unfeeling and irresponsible man. He cares nothing for the people he leads, seeing them merely as an audience for his vulgar showmanship. His undeserved humiliation of Ukraine’s valiant leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was, he crowed, “great television”. As president, Trump wields enormous power and influence. But Potus is not omnipotent. America’s vanquished Democrats are slowly finding their voice. Connecticut senator Chris Murphy shows how it should be done. Don’t bite your lip. Don’t play by rules Trump ignores. When Trump tried toblame diversity hiring policiesfor January’s deadly Potomac midair collision, Murphy hit back fiercely.“Everybody in this country should be outraged that Donald Trump is standing up on that podium and lying to you – deliberately lying to you,”Murphy fumed. Trump was at it again when he mugged Zelenskyy last week. But it is not passing unchallenged. Street protestsin Britainandthe USfollowed. A campaign gathers pace to block Trump’s plannedUK state visit. Opinion polls show growing opposition.It seems strange to talk about “resistance”, as if a Nazi-style wartime occupation is under way. Yet resisting Trump is what our leaders must do. The world’s most admired democracy is held hostage by a far-right clique of thugs and chancers. Its leadercalls himself “king”and talks of a presidency for life.Elon MuskandSteve Bannonraise stiff-armed salutes. European neofascists drool adulation from afar.As the US retreats, Europe must look out for itself – so is Macron’s nuclear offer the answer? | Simon TisdallRead moreTrump’s minions attack or subvert the agencies of government, the judiciary and free press, terrorising and intimidating those whose loyalty they impugn. Their propagandists, so-called tech barons, have a reach Joseph Goebbels would envy. And just like Vladimir Putin, Russia’s dictator, JD Vance, Trump’s loudmouth hitman, fights a regressive, anti-democratic culture war for “Christian values” and a narrow, bigoted orthodoxy.Ukraine, despite Trump’s betrayal, remains the epitome of resistance. The Ukrainian people are fighting for freedom, sovereignty and democratic self-determination. The issue is simple. Since the US cannot any longer be relied upon, Europe’s leaders know what they must do: supply more and better weapons for Kyiv, such as Taurus missiles; provide more humanitarian aid and finance, obtained by seizing$300bn in frozen Russian funds; and collectively raise their defence spending. From leaders such as Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, we need less polite subservience and morehonest defiance.To be effective, European leaders need to put concerted pressure on the US government to provide credible, long-term security guarantees forUkraineand a backstop for any force that the UK and Europe deploy to monitor the ceasefire. It’s reasonable to expect the US to support a European peace initiative. If it does not, an open rupture with Washington should not be dodged. Equally, they need to put more pressure on Russia, too, to halt its daily slaughter and bombing in Ukraine’s cities. Putin could stop this war today – after all, he alone started it. The fact he refuses to do so is proof, if it were needed, of Zelenskyy’s contention that he cannot be trusted in anything he says. He must be squeezed further.Right now, the opposite is happening. Military analysts warn that a gleeful Kremlin, encouraged by western discord, may step up its offensive in the east and try to capitalise on Ukraine’s demoralisation, perhaps even reinstating Putin’s original plan to seize the whole country. To deter such scenarios, EU leaders, meeting again in Brusselson Thursdayafter their London weekend talks, must finally bury their differences and draw a line.Starmer says that he and Macron are nowdeveloping a plan. Good. The leading European Nato powers should demand an immediate halt to all fighting in Ukraine and Kursk. They should launch a peace process inclusive of all interested parties, without preconditions or prior concessions. If Putin balks, they must withdraw their diplomats, close borders with Russia, move to interdict its exports, mobilise their armed forces – and set a deadline for providing defensive air cover for all unoccupied Ukrainian territory. Russia must be reminded that the west has teeth, too – and will, if forced, resist Putin’s unlawful aggression with everything it has got. Enough of Trump’s scaremongering nonsense about a third world war. Putin is a mass murderer, not a mad murderer. He’s also a coward.Given Trump’s treachery and threats to cut military aid, only a strong, united Europe stands a chance of preventing Ukraine’s defeat on the battlefield. Were Ukraine forced to capitulate to a Kremlin deal and lose its sovereignty, it would set a disastrous precedent for free people everywhere, from Taiwan and Tibet to Moldova, Estonia,Panamaand Greenland.Marco Rubio, Trump’s obsequious secretary of state, spoke revealingly last month about his vision of a 21st-century world dominated by the US, Russia and China, and divided into 19th-century geopoliticalspheres of influence. It was necessary to rebuild US relations with Moscow, Rubio argued, to maintain this imperious tripartite balance of power. This is the partitioned future that awaits if Trump’s surrender strategy prevails and he and Putin carve up Ukraine.Such a global catastrophe was foretold. In his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell describes a nightmare world divvied up between three great empires or superstates, Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, which deliberately stoke unceasing hostilities. Their shared characteristics: totalitarianism, mass surveillance, repression, immorality, gross inhumanity. Sound familiar? Annalena Baerbock, foreign minister of Germany, a country that knows much about fascism, past and present, recently said that a “new era of wickedness has begun”. Ukrainians, under occupation, are only too familiar with the evil that has descended upon their heads. This is the violent, lawless dystopia towards which the Americans in the Oval Office are leading us. Unless they are stopped. Unless we fight. Unless Europe resists.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationKeir StarmerVladimir PutinEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

But who would have thought that the whole thing would come crashing down with Trump saying these words: “All right, I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? This is going to be great television. I will say that.”I’m referring, of course, to the debacle at the Oval Office between two showmen-turned-statesmen, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The meeting began cordially. After the Ukrainian president was challenged for not wearing a suit, the US presidentsaid: “I think he’s dressed beautifully.” Trump praised a reporter from One American News for asking an obsequious question (“What gave you the moral courage and conviction to step forward and lead?”) and then, several minutes later, claimed that “I’ve stopped wars. I’ve stopped many wars. My people will tell you. I’ve stopped wars that nobody ever heard about.”But after JD Vance stepped in to the conversation to lecture Zelenskyy on diplomacy, what began as a mostly convivial meeting quickly turned into an ambush. The US vice-president reprimanded Zelenskyy for not accepting diplomacy as a means to end the war in Ukraine, to which Zelenskyy responded that diplomacy had been tried many times before, but previous agreements had repeatedly been broken by Russia. Vance responded by saying: “I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.” Then Trump entered the argument.“You gotta be more thankful,” Trump told Zelenskyy hectoringly. He repeatedly pointed his finger accusingly at the Ukrainian leader as tensions rose between the men in the room. “The problem is I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States,” he said. “Once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position, but you’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest. That’s not a nice thing.”This is Trump’s power politics on full display, a style of domination that demands subservience from every mortal or nation determined by Trump to be of a lesser order. Trump and Vance will tell you that they are only interested in pursuing such high-minded goals as diplomacy, cooperation and negotiation, but their version of these pursuits turns diplomacy into capitulation, cooperation into coercion, and negotiation into surrender.This is not the exercise of power merely for the sake of power either. This is plunder, a very public shakedown of the weak for the pecuniary benefit of the United States. It’s true that in an attempt to keep the United States on its side, Ukrainians began making offers to the United States on the country’s rare earth minerals in 2024 (thoughreportsindicate that Ukraine delayed announcing these deals until after Trump took office, so that Trump could take the credit).But these were far from done deals. Trump claims that the United States has sunk over $350bn into Ukraine’s war effort, money which mostly supports the American arms industry, and was now demanding rights to $500bn worth of Ukraine’s natural resources. “The American taxpayer now is going to get their money back, plus,” Trumpsaid.In reality, the American contribution to the Ukraine war effort is probably closer to $124bnaccordingto the Kiel Institute, a German thinktank that has been tracking wartime aid to Ukraine. Days earlier, Zelenskyy had also said that Washington was now demanding Kyiv pay back $2 for every dollar of future military aid delivered to Ukraine, an interest rate of 100%, Zelenskyy noted. (There are interest rates floated by banks, and there are interest rates floated by mobsters. It’s clear which side Trump is on.) “I’m not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians are going to pay later,” Zelenskyysaid.Zelenskyy left the White House early and without signing a deal on Ukraine’s minerals. Trumpwroteon Truth Social that Zelenskyy “can come back when he is ready for Peace”, and the White House staff helped themselves to the food that had beenpreparedfor the official lunch between Ukrainian and American presidents.The whole exchange is about something larger than even the Ukraine war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and continues unabated. This exchange reveals howDonald Trumpreserves his respect only for leaders of powerful nations, views the world not as made up of different nations and peoples but solely of transactions and deals, and holds in contempt those lesser nations populated by, as he sees it, disposable people.Which brings us necessarily to Gaza. The week that this Oval Office fiasco took place was the same week that Trump reposted a garish, outlandish and deeply offensive AI-generated video displaying “Trump Gaza”, a place depopulated of its Palestinian population and repopulated by casinos, nightclubs, bearded belly dancers, a gold statue of Trump himself, and Trump and the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, lying shirtless by a pool sipping drinks.What Trump has been signaling loudly and clearly is that he gladly accepts and even encourages the acquisition of territory by force, a foundational prohibition in international law. The entire edifice of the liberal world order that was created out of the ashes of the second world war was built on the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force. And while there certainly have been military movements against this principle – one thinks immediately of Israel’s occupied territories, for example, or Indonesia’s 1975 invasion of East Timor – the basis of international peace has long been predicated on mutual agreement on the inadmissibility of the use of force to grab land.All that seems to be gone now. The rule of the powerful is all that remains. And in such a world, what’s to stop Russia from annexing more of Ukraine’s territory? Who will stop Israel from annexing not only the West Bank but southern Syria? Will a future Chinese invasion of Taiwan simply be bartered away for a favorable trade agreement to the United States and some gaudy resorts called Trump Shanghai?Of course, the United States – with its oversized military, wealth and influence – is a central pillar of any international order, but it must not be allowed to dictate and direct this impending international disorder. Facing such prospects, every one of us will lose. As the postwar western liberal order unravels, what’s becoming clear is that new arrangements – beyond the United States, and beyond Europe – are necessary.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Discerning the signal in the noise isn’t easy, but amid the zigs, zags and bombast, the new administration appears to be taking a position that Ukrainian and European leaders aren’t hearing – or are trying to alter.The crux of the message seems to be this: the US will either broker an end to the war in Ukraine in short order or remove itself from the conflict, unless perhaps it deems Russia to have obstructed a ceasefire. (AsTrump told Zelenskyyon Friday: “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out.”) Washington will also refuse to make any commitment to Ukraine’s postwar security, such as Nato membership, that would run a major risk of drawing the US into direct war with Russia – “world war three,” as Trump sees it – if Russia invades Ukraine again.The US has the sovereign right to adopt this stance, for the sake of its own interests, which include limiting the costs and risks the US is bearing for European defense. So Europe cannot dissuade the US, but it can work with Washington to achieve US goals while finding the best possible arrangement to protectUkraine, secure Europe, and preserve Nato.European leaders, however, are hearing a different message – or two, to be precise. One version is maximally pessimistic: Europeans fear that Trump is aligning with Vladimir Putin and preparing to abandon Ukraine and perhaps several more countries besides. Such an outcome remains possible. So far, however, it has not come to pass. An initial meeting to reopen diplomatic relations withRussia, and a disturbingly staunch unwillingness to condemn Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, are significant moves but are a long way from effectuating a grand geopolitical shift.The other version is far more optimistic: European leaders still hope to convince Trump to make a major US security guarantee to Ukraine. This effort drove British, French and Ukrainian leaders to visit the White House last week. In public remarks, all three attempted to sell Trump on providing a US “backstop” for a European military force, involving perhaps some 30,000 troops, to be placed in Ukraine once the fighting stops. Trump did not rule out some sort of US support for a European military contingent, but he indicated little willingness to put much American muscle behind it. “I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much,” Trumpsaid. “We’re going to have Europe do that.”On Friday, in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy contested Trump’s stance. The Ukrainian presidentstated flatly: “We will never accept just [a] ceasefire. It will not work without security guarantees.” Zelenskyy maintained that strong security guarantees had to come from the US, not just Europe. A European military force, he said, would not work unless the US provided a significant backstop: “They need USA.”In short, Zelenskyy insisted he would not agree to a ceasefire, because Russia would not honor it, unless the US provided precisely what Trump had seemingly already ruled out. As the conversation devolved, Trump eventually threatened to withdraw US aid to Ukraine altogether if Zelenskyy’s position did not change.Since then, Zelenskyy hasn’t budged. To the contrary, he doubled down. “If we cannot be accepted to Nato,” Zelenskyy wrote in astatement, “we need some clear structure of security guarantees from our allies in the US.” Only after such guarantees were on offer would Ukraine proceed with diplomacy to settle the war.European leaders promptly affirmed Zelenskyy’s view. Following a meeting of 18 leaders on Sunday, Keir Starmerannouncedthat a European “coalition of the willing” was prepared to station a military force in Ukraine to guarantee the peace. He pledged to put British “boots on the ground and planes in the air” – on one condition: “this effort must have strong US backing”.For years now, officials and experts across the Atlantic have debated the merits of providing security guarantees to Ukraine. But the practical reality is that the Trump administration is not inclined to do so, not if it would obligate, de jure or de facto, the US to go to war on Ukraine’s behalf in the future. That this is the position of the president of the United States should be understandable.None of Trump’s predecessors ever made a commitment to fight for Ukraine. Joe Biden explicitly ruled out sending US troops when he saw Russia’s full-scale invasion coming. Nor have anyNatoallies come to Ukraine’s direct defense. The reason is obvious: it would mean war with Russia, a prospect that Nato allies can still deter regardless of what happens in Ukraine.If Ukraine and Europe continue to push for strong US security guarantees, they have a small chance of succeeding and a larger chance of creating a permanent rupture with Trump. The president could conclude that his allies refuse to listen and, worse, keep trying to entrap him. Throwing up his hands, he could take the very actions that Ukraine and Europe most want to avoid: cutting off all US support for Ukraine and making a dirty deal with Putin. The damage could extend throughout Europe if Trump removes US military forces and assets from the region.Can this worst-case scenario be avoided? A route is still available. The sooner Ukraine and Europe stop fixating on a US security guarantee, the sooner they can coalesce – with the United States – around a viable plan that contains two main provisions.First, postwar Ukraine would maintain a large and technologically advanced military, trained and supplied by its western partners. Second, the US and Europe would commit to arm Ukraine heavily if Russia invaded again. Because they are doing so now, this commitment would be highly credible, unlike a heroic pledge to wage war on Ukraine’s behalf. Nato allies could also sign a legally binding document and stockpile specific weapons systems that could be surged to Ukraine in case of a renewed attack.This formula may fall short of what Ukrainians want, but it may provide what they need. After all, Ukraine’s own forces have protected the country in the current conflict, preserving 80% of Ukrainian territory and forcing Russia into a costly war of attrition. If those forces remain strong, it would hardly be a foregone conclusion that Putin or his successor will make another attempt – not because the Kremlin can be trusted to keep its word but because it would suffer enormous losses for little gain.Ukraine, Europe and the US must use their leverage at the negotiating table to get Russia to stop fighting without requiring Ukraine to disarm. Russia might acquiesce, having kept Ukraine out of Nato and Nato, and its members’ forces, out of Ukraine. To reach a deal, however, the transatlantic community should come together, post haste, and throw its weight behind a common demand.To do otherwise is to court disaster not only for Ukraine but for European security as a whole.Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author ofTomorrow, the World: The Birth of US Global SupremacyExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionEuropeDonald TrumpNatoUkraineRussiaUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

We need a new mindsetSupported byAbout this contentMon 3 Mar 2025 01.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 10.01 ESTShareAbout 35 years ago, the radio news announced that the then president ofKenya, Daniel arap Moi, had broken diplomatic ties with Norway. The embassy, with about 100 foreign and a few local staff, had one week to clear out of the country.I was one of a few staff there at the time who worked for the Norwegian development agency, Norad, and our jobs disappeared with that radio broadcast. An estimated $30m annual budget, largely targeted at the arid and semi-arid parts of Kenya, also disappeared. Obviously that did not matter much to Kenya’s leadership, who felt that the independence of the country and the ability for them to decide what was good for Kenya, was more important.The drama was triggered because the Norwegian ambassador decided to appear in a court in Nakuru, where thehuman rights activist Koigi Wamwerewas being tried for treason, hence showing solidarity with a so-called dissident who had been in exile in Norway.I was in a state of disbelief, as all my hopes of enjoying what looked like a progressive career were dashed overnight, barely 10 months after joining the embassy. I had been comfortable, having sole access to a desktop computer, rare in those days, but had not even practised my computer skills as it was a privilege I took for granted.Developing other resources requires a different mindset … it’s a courageous long-term journey, not for the faint-heartedThere are close parallels between my story and what happened to many non-profit organisations in Kenya and globally after 20 January, whenDonald Trumptook over as US president and cancelled most of the traditional work of the government’s development agency, USAid, throwing many charities into a spin of confusion and unanswered questions.How could he do that so suddenly, they asked. Now, the UK is also cutting back on its own aid budget.For me, in 1990, the abrupt end of my job was a wake-up call. I never looked back. When I got my next role, three months later, I embraced my secondhand laptop and quickly perfected my ability not only to produce monitoring and evaluation reports supported by case studies, but also project proposals and budgets that I needed to submit to my supervisor for consideration.I embraced the fact that my job was never guaranteed. There were many factors at play that I had no control over. I needed the skills to be able to survive with any “sound” employer, anywhere in the world, so developing myself was not a choice. I have since managed to have a flourishing career in the not-for-profit sector, in and outside the country.Even after leaving full-time work, I continue to offer my knowledge to a variety of groups locally and globally, simply because I woke up and practised self-determination. I remain a strong advocate for independence from donor dependency throughout my career.Trump’s actions just re-energised my commitment to continue to use every single opportunity to support global majority actors to embrace the right mindset in their effort to explore alternative resources for their work. Funders, on the other hand, definitely need to embrace genuine and practical shifting of power in their approaches to supporting development work, so that what they initiate can outlast them, and be driven by local organisations, especially those from the global majority.We need to accept the fact that these acts will continue to repeat themselves in our unpredictable worldIn the past couple of weeks, I have become alert to various reflections that speak to this from colleagues in the sector. I continue to be astonished by how hard it is for us to learn important life lessons. One statement I like is byThomas Sankara, who said: “He who feeds you, also controls you.”I consider the spirit behind this wisdom a key takeaway for us in the not-for-profit sector. It reminds us how much power we surrender to those who fund our work, especially when we act and behave comfortably, when this is happening over many years, and without us riding on that wave to slowly grow alternative resources, however small they may be. Developing other resources requires a different mindset and the recognition that it’s a courageous long-term journey, not for the faint-hearted.US shutdown of HIV/Aids funding ‘could lead to 500,000 deaths in South Africa’Read moreIt is working against the tide. What happened to Kenya when our president froze a bilateral relationship with Norway overnight, has some parallel with USAid ending with a stroke of President Trump’s pen. It looks as if we need to accept that these acts will repeat themselves in our unpredictable world, in one way or other.And so, for us in the majority world, it’s time to shape our destiny; not to blindly follow those who “feed” us; to start saying no to any money that does not meet the community needs we exist to support.It’s time to rise up and be counted, as true believers, in the interests of the people we claim to represent when negotiating for funds, and be ready to walk away with our heads held high if it’s not working. It’s time to organise, not agonise.Janet Mawiyoois a development consultant and founder ofGalvanising AfricaExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionAidAfricaKenyaDonald TrumpInequality and developmentInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

But that’s exactly how capitalism worksBrett ChristophersCompanies will never solve the climate emergency alone. The impetus for change needs to come from governmentMon 3 Mar 2025 12.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 21.07 ESTShareIt would be very easy to be sharply critical of BP, given its sudden volte-face on its environmental commitments. Under pressure from a shareholder, Elliott Management, it hasabandoned the green ambitionsit announced in 2020 and pivoted squarely back to an overwhelming focus on oil and gas.While easy, it would arguably be unhelpful, and perhaps even misguided. Because viewed in the round, this isn’t really about BP: it’s about capitalism at large, and its inability to respond to the climate crisis in the manner we need.One thinker who would probably have been somewhat sympathetic to BP isKarl Marx, surprising though that may seem. Marx understood market competition as what he termed a “coercive law”, whereby individual companies are forced to act in certain ways because of their competitors’ behaviour. Competition, he said, compels companies to maximise profits on pain of succumbing to stronger rivals – or, as in the case of BP, to activist shareholders such as Elliott Management.It stands to reason that BP has refocused on fossil fuels: oil and gas production is simply muchmore profitablethan renewable energy. “No capitalist,”Marx wrote, “ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no matter how much more productive it may be … so long as it reduces the rate of profit.” He could just as well have been talking about the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. The CEOs of firms such as Exxon have been telling financial markets exactly the same thing for years.Like it or not, BP doesn’t have the luxury of saying: “Oh, we’ll do something less profitable but better for the planet.” Capitalism chews you up and spits you out if you do that. “Shareholder value” is not a consulting gimmick, or at least not only that; it is a very real disciplinary force.All of this, to be clear, is not to absolve BP of responsibility. Rather, it is to make a case about how we should understand the problems we face – that is,notas a problem of greedy individual firms, but a system rigged against positive change.“The problem,” the political economistGeoff Mann has written, “is not that capitalism is a conspiracy of greedy people. The problem is that capitalism, as a way of organising our collective life, does its best to force us to be greedy – and if that is true, then finger-pointing at nasty CEOs and investment bankers may be morally satisfying, but fails to address the problem.” Substitute “greedy firms” for Mann’s “greedy people”, and this was exactly Marx’s point about capitalism and its coercive powers. Private individuals do not make history under conditions of our own choosing, but neither do businesses.In short, the problem is not BP or indeed any other individual company. The problem is that BP and its fossil-fuel peers operate within a system thatrequiresthem to invest and operate in ways that are deleterious to the environment.In the half-decade after the 2015 UN climate change conference in Paris, European governments briefly talked a good game about taking actions – even up to thestranding of hydrocarbon assets– that might actually make fossil-fuel production less profitable in the medium and long term. Hence why BP, Shell and others then started making plans to transition into cleaner energy. They wanted to be ahead of the curve, or at any rate, not too far behind it.But since 2020, governments have shown that it was in fact just talk. Most notably, they have continued to issue licences for new oil and gas production at near-record rates, despitebeing toldby experts that such licences are fundamentally incompatible with plans for net zero emissions; Norway alone has issued more than 100new production licencessince then. It is this miserable government appeasement that has emboldened BP and the rest to abandon their transition plans. Elliott, the activist shareholder in BP’s case, merely forced the issue; putting Marx’s “coercive law” into practice.It is entirely within the power and purview of governments to change this situation for the better; either by making fossil fuels less profitable, or by making renewables more profitable, or both. For example, robust carbon taxes would hobble fossil fuels, or more generous electricity tariffs would inflate returns on renewables.But what is economically straightforward on paper is politically fraught in practice: either of those courses of action would result in the one thing that sitting governments will never actively countenance, especially given the electoral experiences of recent years: namely, inflation.And so, for now at least, we appear to be stuck. Because it is the crucible of fossil-fuel extraction and combustion, the energy system is at the heart of the climate problem. For as long as it remains beholden to the profit motive, it’s hard to see us resolving our predicament.In the summer of 2007, Citigroup’s chief executive, Chuck Prince, explained why he was investing in sub-prime mortgages (just prior to them blowing up the global financial system): the sub-prime business was still profitable, and all his competitors were still in the game. “As long as the music is playing,”Prince said, “you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.”Two decades on, the music of the hydrocarbons is still playing, and BP is still dancing.Brett Christophers is a professor in the Institute for Housing and Urban Research at Sweden’s Uppsala University and author of The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the PlanetDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How can a flawed reorganisation be a priority?Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.18 ESTShareWhy? That’s the mystery. Why go through the upheaval of amighty local government reorganisation, merging hundreds of district councils with the counties above them, when it will exhaust capacity in already overstretched and near-bankrupt councils? It wasn’t in Labour’s manifesto – and its electoral system for mayors will do Labour untold damage.It’s baffling to watch the government struggling with abolishing districts and reordering unitary councils, for no practical or political purpose. It looks like a displacement activity: everyone knows financially crippled councils need relief from the social care crisis, and reform of the hated council tax system in which Buckingham Palace pays less than an average house in Hartlepool. But this busy deckchair-shifting avoids those. Nor is there very much devolution in it.Former Tory local government minister Eric Pickles was George Osborne’s axe-wielder, who nitpicked officials over the cost of their biscuits at meetings. But he saidone wise thing: “I’ll have a pearl-handled revolver waiting in my drawer for the first civil servant who suggests another local government reorganisation.” Even so, abolition of district councils was begun by the Tories, with Labour completing it.For example, in 2018 Dorset shrank nine councils into two, and cut councillors from 333 to 158. I have no idea how many councillors there should be, or the right size of councils, but Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics, the great expert, says no one else does either, not even him. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.”England’s patchwork quilt of different-sized councils is untidy, but it hardly matters. Clumps of unitaries will be joined together to form combined authorities, mostly under directly elected mayors with more power over local transport, skills, housing and infrastructure, but no new money. Mayors are a good thing, identifiable champions of their region, with “king of the north” Andy Burnham the great exemplar. Tracy Brabin, Ben Houchen and Steve Rotheram are similar local galvanisers. But introducing more mayors never needed this reorganisation. A seasoned former Labour council leader and minister speaks for many when he tells me: “All this change won’t deliver a single new hospital ward, new affordable home, additional police officer or fill a pothole in the road.”Politics requires parties and parties need grassroots that bind people together through selecting and campaigning for local council candidates. Parties with few local councillors tend to wither away. With waning trust in politics, the local matters. In polls since time immemorial, people like their local councils and councillors better than their MPs: voters trustcouncillors twice as much(though they are lazy about actually voting for them).But Britain has relatively few elected representatives, “way out of line in councillors per head of population, with 19,000 councillors, while the French have 36,000 councils, yescouncils,” says Travers. Ours have been vanishing fast: “From 75,000 councillors in 1965, only 14,000 will be left after this.” The white paperactually boaststhere will be “fewer local politicians”, hardly encouraging political engagement. One aim is to save money but House of Commons libraryresearch finds: “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.”Each unitary must have a minimum population of 350,000, most to be 500,000. (That’s the size of Malta,which has 68 local councils.) Long lists of towns and cities with fewer than 350,000 people are being swept into larger areas of suburb and countryside. Look south of the Midlands and these include scores of Labour or Liberal Democrat councils, such as Reading, Oxford, Cambridge, Exeter, Ipswich and and more. Once subsumed into unitaries, then into clumps of counties, anxious Labour number-crunchers warn not a single southern mayor will be Labour or Lib Dem. Remember, these Tory/Reform mayors will control housing: what about Labour’s 1.5m homes? Brighton and Hove is typical: once swallowed into deep blue East and West Sussex, that mayor will be Tory/Reform.Almost half of England’s councils ‘could face bankruptcy over £4.6bn deficit’Read moreThe genius architects of all this haven’t (yet) reversed the Tories’ great gerrymander, when they imposed first-past-the-post elections for mayors and police and crime commissioners. If mayors were elected on the previous supplementary vote system, where you can mark your second choice, no mayor gets chosen without 50% of the vote. It obliges candidates to appeal beyond their own party, seeking second choices. Tories wanting that Sussex vote would need a candidate acceptable to Brighton’s second choices.This policy feels drafted by the type of heroic cartographers responsible for colonial-era maps, neat lines and population counts, regardless of people, places, politics or identity. Scores of towns will be swept into shires they share no identity with. It’s not too late to put a freeze on this. Leave districts in place while a royal commission considers the great multitude of real local government problems, including council tax. Introduce mayors, but elected on the original system so candidates appeal beyond their tribe.A government letter commands everywheresubmit unitary plans this month: they must “meet transition costs over time from existing budgets”. This is a puzzlingly bizarre waste of effort for a government confronting herculean tasks wherever it looks. Labour MPs are just waking up to all this, especially the voting fiasco: time to reach for that pearl-handled revolver.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But when people die, we’ll make sure everyone knows itThe civil servantIt’s not just that Starmer’s policy is immoral and will be ineffective. It also sidesteps the safeguards we have to prevent calamitous decisionsMon 3 Mar 2025 10.49 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 13.09 ESTShareYour humble civil servants are watching with fascinated horror as our terrified prime minister tries to secure the guy ropes for a rapidly shrinking UK tent, in the hope that it can survive geopolitical storms from the east and west.Spare a thought, then, for the one government department that has repeatedly found itself politically outside that tent and does so again now – theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO).Since stumbling out of the ashes of theBoris Johnson-propelled mergerin 2020 between the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Foreign Office, the hits have just kept on coming for the FCDO’s diplomats and aid workers. There has been theabandonmentof the longstanding 0.7% aid target, a shambolic withdrawalfrom Afghanistan, Donald Trump’s gleefulevisceration of USAid, and last week’s savage and historic cutto the development budgetfrom 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, swiftly followed by theresignation of Annaliese Dodds, its well-regarded international development minister.And their reward for enduring all that? Being conscripted into last week’s “rather fraught” operation to help the PM to cosy up to Trump – the very leader who, according to Dodds, hasprovided the blueprintfor the gutting of their own department. Yet, the most heart-breaking bit for FCDO’s 17,000-odd staffmay be to come, according to the Institute for Government, as they decide how exactly to follow the instruction and axe myriad projects, many of which help deliver life-saving interventions in the world’s poorest countries.I’ve spoken to current and former FCDO employees about Keir Starmer’s decision, and their reaction to the speed and scale of the cut has been one of shock and disorientation. It’s not just that slashing aid in order to spend more on defence will prove to be wrong and self-defeatingmorally,diplomaticallyandeconomically. It’s not even that this decision is soul-destroying in its frightening implication – based on thegrim consensusshared with the likes of Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch – that the civil service must now get behind a national effort to beat ploughshares into swords. After all, civil servants are forbidden from publicly endorsing the recent boos and brickbats against the policy issued by Romilly Greenhill of theinternational development network Bond, David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee,Halima Begumof Oxfam and other prominent charity leaders. We are required by law to implement the policies of the government of the day. And we have no problem with that.What alarms civil servants ishowthis decision was made. First, its timing: there is no serious alternative to the idea that it was made – sweetened by the offer ofyet another state visit– primarily towin favour with Trumpahead of the PM’s visit to the Oval Office. This was a blood-offering, a libation, a lubricant offered to a petulant demigod in the hope that mirroring the orange genie’s recent decision to gut USAid would help get Sir Keir tofirst base with the Donald. As civil servants, the fawning, the grovelling, the coquettish simpering to power, was very hard to watch. What’s next, prime minister, an invitation to No 10 for apersonalised hydrotherapy session?More worryingly, the decision to reduce aid spendingdown to a 25-year lowseems to bypass the usual checks and balances that, in the British system, helps to mitigate the executive making terrible decisions. Judging by theconcerns raised by ministersand most of the parliamentary Labour party’s various factions,there was little cabinet discussionof the decision and no serious assessment of the impact of this particular decision. Combine that with a lack of parliamentary scrutiny and the PM’s side-stepping of the pesky inconveniences presented by thecomprehensive spending reviewlater this year and the politically troublesome prospect of revisiting tax and borrowing rules, and what we see is a riot of red flags. Or orange ones.View image in fullscreenBritish Army personnel load humanitarian aid on to military plane in Jordan, April 2024.Photograph: Cpl Tim Laurence Raf/ReutersThe extent to which aid spending is a Good Thing isn’t really the point – on this subject you will find a diversity of opinion among the UK’s half a million or so civil servants, the vast majority of whom work outside London and have never darkened the gilded stairways of King Charles Street.But most civil servants, reluctantly or not, have felt nothing but pride in #UKAid, even after –as I wrote back in 2019– the Conservative government decided to fold DfID into the Foreign Office like a Fabergé egg into a dusty satchel. The British public, too, haveshownthat they, like their American cousins, broadly support aid spending in the national interest, and don’t think we should follow the US lead to drastically reduce it. Starmer will need to be very careful that, in pursuing a “Trump, baby, Trump” strategy, he doesn’t widen analready growingdemocratic deficit.In the meantime, don’t be surprised if you see FCDO’s civil servants – with their admirablehistory of whistleblowing– follow the lead of their doughty USAid counterparts, who are alreadyfastidiously documentingthe domestic and international impact of the suspension of American aid spending. The truth is out there, and they’ll know where to look.The author works for the UK civil serviceExplore more on these topicsCivil serviceOpinionKeir StarmerForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

After a long-awaited review, ministers must put this rightMon 3 Mar 2025 09.19 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.47 ESTShareIf you’ve seen porn in recent years, you’ll know it’s grim out there these days. Incest and strangulation are rife, as is coercion, racism, and alsosexual violence. It’s front and centre on mainstream porn sites and many social media platforms, pushed by recommendation algorithms on a drive to maximise engagement and profit. It’s a world away from the days when “hardcore” porn meant an erect penis. But we might be on the brink of change.Last week thelong-awaited independent porn reviewled by the Conservative peer Gabby Bertin was published, marking the biggestreview of pornographyregulation in more than 40 years. Its findings amount to a clear indictment of what counts as porn today and the inaction of successive governments to do anything to fix it. It was a Labour government which first brought in the extreme porn law in 2009, recognising the need for a step-change in how we regulate pornography. It’s now time for the next great step forward, and it’s one that will be integral to the success of the government’s mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade.The public appetite for regulation has shifted. For a while, many believed that a hands-off approach to regulation would strengthen our sexual freedoms and protect our right to privacy. In reality, it’s done the opposite. Most pornography today suppresses our sexual freedom. What we watch is driven largely not by user choice and preference but profit-driven AI recommendation algorithms that have learned we are drawn to material that invokes disgust, shock and rage.Our privacy rights have been trampled by multinational porn conglomerates who have had free range to mine some of our most intimate data to feed these algorithms. Onestudy of over 22,000 porn sitesfound that 93% of them were sending user data to at least one third party, often without users knowing.We have started to recognise the impact of this across much of our other online activity. In 2020, a review intobias in algorithmic decision-makingcommissioned by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, found that racist and sexist attitudes are not just reproduced butproducedby recommendation algorithms. And the information commissioner has now launched an investigation into how social media platforms are using data generated by children’s online activity toserve them content.This is partly how we’ve got to a place where so much online porn promotes and perpetuates harmful, violent, misogynistic and racist tropes. The porn platforms themselves are implicated in producing these preferences, pushing men andincreasingly womenfurther than we would otherwise go.While Lady Bertin’s report doesn’t delve deep enough into algorithmic decision-making on porn sites and its impact on our freedom and privacy, it does provide a blueprint for what needs to change. Its most important recommendation is the establishment of parity between what is regulated offline and what is regulated online. It also suggests that platforms are mandated to adopt specific safety-by-design measures, via the development of a safe pornography code in the Online Safety Act, or a new publications offence. Alongside this, it recommends that pornographydepicting incestor strangulation should be made illegal under the extreme pornography act, and that the Home Office is the natural home for pornography policy, creating a clear route for oversight and accountability and ending the “pass the buck” approach to regulation that has dominated debate so far.The report also contains a passing mention of support for device-level age verification, if the measures to restrict children’s access to porn sites in the Online Safety Act prove ineffective. Far from a simple difference, this shift significantly alters who is responsible for keeping kids safe; from the platforms that profit from their access, on to parents and carers who would have to keep them away from any verified devices. It isn’t a better option, and it definitely isn’t a safer system; unsurprisingly, the porn platforms prefer it, because it would do less harm to their traffic.On publication of the report, the governmentannounced they will respondto each recommendation in due course. The review marks the kind of opportunity we would say comes once in a lifetime. Except it has come before. As prime minister in 2013, David Cameron announced that,when it comes to porn, “what you can’t get in a shop, you shouldn’t be able to get online”. Twelve years later, Lady Bertin’s first recommendation is the same: that pornographic content that is illegal to distribute in physical formats should also be treated as illegal content on online platforms. It’s taken us over a decade to end up in the same place. It’s not that we don’t know what needs to be done. We just need this government to finally step up and actually do it.Clare McGlynn also contributed to this articleFiona Vera-Gray is a professor of sexual violence at London Metropolitan University and co-director of the Child and Woman Abuse Studies UnitClare McGlynn is a professor of law at Durham University and expert on the legal regulation of pornographyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I am after all a gay man and it’s no secret we have always idolised the kind of male body that spends five days a week in the gym. According to research,physique, apart from race and income, is one of the major sources of compare-and-despair anxietiesfor gay men. If my experience on Grindr has taught me anything, it rarely mattered what you had to say or even how handsome you were – the bigger the muscles and leaner the abs, the more attention you got.So it was on these fertile but perhaps not the most mentally healthy grounds I began my fitness journey. I tracked all my calories. I substituted chicken thigh for breast. I weighed every gram of rice I ate. I started hitting the gym five to six times a week. I lifted heavy and walked more.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAnd after a year or so I was seeing results. I had dropped kilos and put on muscle. For the first time, I didn’t hate what I saw in the mirror. I noticed my face was thinner and I filled out the top of my shirts instead of the bottom. Some of my pants were suddenly too big. A follow-up visit to the doctor’s two years after I started exercising confirmed I was now within the waist size I had aspired to.I felt like I had a new lens on life.

My new online reality informed my subconscious that this image of masculinity was what I wanted.Physique inflation has set in: think back more than two decades to 2002, when Tobey Maguire was Spider-Man. A fateful spider bite not only gave him the powers of a spider, it gave him muscles. A new chest, abs, arms and shoulders. He was ripped.Now, when I look at my socials feed, bodybuilders and fitness influencers could stand up to the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger in size and shape. Maguire’s transformation, considered remarkable for the early years of the 2000s, is now barely above average by today’s expectations. Teenagers with enough lean mass to mog (gen Z for outclass) even the most elite professional athlete in the aesthetic department are a dime a dozen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s a whole category of slang that comes with it – gear or juice, as the kids call it. Some congregate on a Subreddit dedicated to discerning whether someone is on juice or is a natural athlete – or natty as they call it. But it’s almost impossible to tell who is on gear on social media. There’s every likelihood they are genetically gifted athletes – able to put on muscle and stay lean all year round – but it’s just as likely they turned to PIEDs for their step up.I sometimes stand in front of the mirror wondering if I will ever achieve the body I’ve always dreamed of. Regardless, I will keep going to the gym diligently because training gives me so much more than just the physique I want.

But, selfishly, the most important thing he’s done is take my spot of being yelled at on the internet. In arecent interviewwith the Sunday Times, Fender took aim at the prominence of identity politics compared to class.“We are very good at talking about privileges – white, male or straight privilege. We rarely talk about class, though,” he said. “And that’s a lot of the reason that all the young lads are seduced by demagogues and psychos like Andrew Tate … People preach to some kid in a pit town in Durham who’s got fuck all and tell him he’s privileged? Then Tate tells him he’s worth something? It’s seductive.”Why, for some people, has this proved controversial? Online backlash has included accusations that Fender is wrongly pitting minorities against the working class, that he’s justifying misogyny as a response to deprivation, and that he’s arguing against a phantom – no one is actually preaching to kids in pit towns that they’ve got white privilege. Some of these criticisms are fair: it’s not just white working-class boys from the north who are drawn to Tate, but kids of colour in inner-city London as well. But Fender has identified something true. We’ve witnessed the rise of a kind of identity politics that sidelines class. And the far right is benefiting from it.Though the working class is not homogenous (shocker – it includes all kinds of ethnic and gender minorities!), identity politics has somehow been peeled off as a separate concern. Representing the interests of one is often seen as in conflict with doing the same for the other. The polling is stark – research fromthe Financial Timesshows that at the same time that there was an increase in people thinking that the Democrats stand up for marginalised people (ie identity minorities), there was a plummet in those who thought they stand up for the working class.Take it from me (and Keir Starmer) – you should never pretend to be more working class than you are | Polly ToynbeeRead moreIn no small part, this is down to the right mobilising a kind of identity politics of their own: in talking about the white working class, anger about economic inequalities is redirected into racial grievance. It’s not wealth taxes, investment in education, or strengthening collective bargaining that will help the white working class: it’s getting minorities to shut up about injustice. But it’s also the case that the language of straight/white/male/cisgender privilege makes little room for the experiences of white men from working-class backgrounds. It sometimes seems like the only visibility for those who happen to be white, male and straight in the world of modern identity politics is as villains (see, the “men are trash” brand of Instagram feminism), or “allies” in political movements led by identity minorities. It’s not like these discourses come with an asterisk to signal that they don’t mean working-class men.It’s worth pointing out that you’re much less likely to encounter privilege preaching, of the kind Fender identifies, in trade unions, housing and renters’ campaigns or the Palestine solidarity movement – where people are a) organised, b) focused on material harms, and c) not interacting with each other through the distorting prism of social media. But we live in a time when membership ofpolitical partiesandtrade unionshas been in decline for decades. What we encounter on the internet is, for most people, the main way we engage with politics. The weakening of collective politics is no accident; it’s by design.AsMargaret Thatcher once said: “Economics are the method; the object is to change the heart and soul.” Our economic circumstances profoundly alter how we think and feel about ourselves. Tories never had a problem with class inequality. It was class consciousness that they wanted to destroy. Forty five years of aggressive neoliberal policymaking – breaking the back of the trade union movement, selling off council housing, and smashing industrial labour to bits – was intended to take a sledgehammer to the societal engines of collective action and solidarity. What’s been left behind is a patchwork of disconnected identities, unmoored from any sense of shared material conditions.These disconnected groups now compete for validation of their struggles, which is often expressed through online animosity.Attention has always been a psychological wage; to be recognised by other people is to be told that you matter. But social media has turned that natural, human need for attention into a trap. Silicon Valley created a literal attention economy, whereby eyeballs are converted into ad revenue and delicious data ripe for harvesting. Feeling insecure and lonely drives us on to Instagram, TikTok and dating apps; such platforms intensify those emotions to keep us there for as long as possible.Other users are our rivals. We’re competing with each other for followers, clout, status and a central position in the public conversation. What does this mean for politics? It means that, rather than looking at people who aren’t like us as potential opportunities for coalition-building, we perceive them as threats.There has been a tendency to spend too much time ruminating on our own feelings. Whether it’s claiming all-white yoga classes are“traumatising” for people of colour, or insisting that a climate activist doing achoice bit of swearingbrings “violence” into a space, or David Baddiel accusing an Arab-Australian poet of having erased and trampled on Jesus’ Jewishnessfor saying he looks like family, modern identity politics has set a comically low threshold for harm.Competing in the attention economy incentivises us to turn molehills into mountains, and the cult of lived experience makes it hard to question proclamations of victimhood. The “I” has taken over identity politics: instead of striving for liberation from discrimination and material oppression, we just want to inflate the visibility value that’s attached to suffering. The retreat into subjective experience primes us for the politics of resentment, competitive grievance and weaponised victimhood. While the personal is political, the self is a dead-end if what you want is social change. It’s worth remembering the lesson of Narcissus: being too interested in your own reflection will kill you.Ash Sarkar is the author of Minority Rule: Adventures in the Culture WarDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But in Berlin, I found a new, young left rising against themOwen JonesOn election night, as the far right rose nationwide, Die Linke made crucial gains in the capital. But its supporters see the hard road aheadMon 3 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 09.33 ESTShareWill democracy still prevail in the west in a decade? It was certainly a question weighing on the minds of the hundreds of Die Linke supporters crammed into a former film studio overlooking Berlin’s Tempelhof airport last weekend. They were gathered to listen to theresults of Germany’s election– and their reactions were mixed. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) had just doubled its support in federal elections, securing a fifth of the vote, yet Die Linke came top in the capital, albeit with 21% of the vote. They cheered, hugged, kissed and cried.We were in Neukölln, a diverse neighbourhood of south-eastern Berlin, and the triumphantcandidate was Ferat Koçak, a charismatic Kurdish-German leftist. His grassroots campaign knocked on every door in the district – not unusual in the UK and US, but a novelty in Germany. “For several years, the left has been in a kind of shocked paralysis about what to do with the rising right,” explained 30-year-old activist Isabelle: grassroots campaigning, she believes, brought the left out of its bubble.A few months ago, Die Linke seemed sunk, its former co-leaderSahra Wagenknechtsplitting away to forge a new alliance blending leftwing economics with social conservatism. But the alliance failed to win seats. “Young people are more attracted to connecting leftwing economics with antiracism and feminism, and not putting them against each other,” said fellow activist Johanna.Die Linke’s support was once concentrated in a generation that grew up in the former East Germany, battered by deindustrialisation and nostalgia –ostalgie– for the security of Stalinism. But as that generation drifted to the far right, the West German youthshifted leftwards. The party also prospered with women, withmore than a thirdvoting for them. A quarter of men opted for the far right.Even though Koçak stormed to victory in Neukölln with 30%, his mood is sombre. “Dark times are upon us,” he tells me in a cramped room away from the crowd, pointing to how “everyone was talking about deportation and migration”. When I ask why the AfD has suddenly surged, his answer is clear: “They’re gaining strength in a social environment where people can no longer afford to live.” When he knocked on doors, one woman pointed to her single shopping bag. It cost €50, she said: that would once have filled two bags.Germany was onceEurope’s powerhouse, benefiting from a euro that made its exports to eurozone countries much cheaper than the old deutschmark. In the past three years, inflation as a result of the energy shock produced by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has hit people’s pockets. More than half of Germans say they worry about increasing prices meaning they can’t pay bills, rising to75% of AfD supporters.There are long-term issues, too. “In the last 20 years, neither the state nor private sector did enough investment,” Carolina Ortega Guttack, an economist at the thinktank FiscalFuture, tells me. A “debt brake” – introduced in 2009 by the then chancellor, Angela Merkel, to commit to limit borrowing – helped deter investment. In real terms, the German economy is smaller than it wasfive years ago. Germany brims with discontent:83% of Germanssay the economic situation is bad – compared with 39% in 2022 – rising to 96% with AfD voters.Without migrants filling vacancies left by an ageing population, its economy would probably be worse, but, encouraged by the AfD, politicians of different flavours have willingly made them scapegoats. Under Merkel, the centre-right CDU brought in more than 1 million refugees: but it has since swerved rightwards on migration. A few weeks ago, the CDU – now set to lead the government – passed a parliamentary motion clamping down on asylum seekers with the support of the AfD,violating the “firewall”against the far right that has persisted since the second world war.Friedrich Merz was the most pro-US politician in Germany – his shift could be historic for Europe | Jörg Lau for Europe |Read moreHelena Marschall, a young activist who helped organise protests against the firewall desecration, said all parties played with fire. “My deportation plans are better than your deportation plans” is how she sums up the mainstream parties’ campaigns. AcrossEurope, these parties attempted to defuse far-right surges by raiding their rhetoric and policies, only succeeding in legitimising them.Here’s the fear. The AfD co-leader Alice Weidel sees Hungary’s far-right Viktor Orbán as a “great role model”. Orbán has gradually dismantled democracy by rigging the game against opponents in politics and media. It is a playbook comparable to Vladimir Putin’s strategy in Russia, a repressive autocracy that still allows opposition parties for appearance’s sake.Across the west, economic discontent fused with anti-migrant scapegoating has driven a far-right insurgency. In power, all are likely to adopt this strategy: see how Donald Trump and Elon Musk are wearing down US democracy by attrition. Germany’s past, you would think, may help immunise the country from this threat: but the stigma of that nightmare has diminished with time.“I think our collective memory is very short,” warned Jamil, a 31-year-old Syrian-German citizen who fled Bashar al-Assad’s regime and came to Germany in 2015 as a refugee. Then, he and his fellow arrivals were welcomed at train stations by volunteers giving out food and donations. The mood has since darkened, and with a new grand coalition of centre-right and centre-left set to assume office, the AfD are circling like vultures, waiting to feast on the disillusionment to come.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionEuropeThe far rightAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)Friedrich MerzcommentShareReuse this content"

Then I learned I have a rare type of hearing lossRachael GroesslerThe diagnosis blindsided me but it explains why I feel the need to shout to be heard over background noiseSun 2 Mar 2025 22.21 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 13.41 ESTShareYes, I frequently asked people to repeat themselves. Yes, I had trouble hearing dialogue on TV. And I often wondered if people were aware that they mumbled. That wasn’t the impetus to get my hearing checked though. What got me to the doctor was that I was having trouble eavesdropping at work. I was sure there had been a time when I could hear conversations that didn’t concern me.Even though I had made the appointment, I figured it was sinus trouble or perhaps my ears needed syringing. But my GP said my ears were clear and didn’t even mention my sinuses. Instead she did a simple hearing test that involved rustling some paper in one ear while whispering in another. She asked me to repeat what she had whispered and I think I replied: “Did you say something?” I left with a referral to an audiologist.As medical tests go, hearing checks are kind of fun. I was given headphones to put on, through which were played a series of words at loud, medium and whispery volumes. I had to repeat the words as I heard them. Another test involved pressing a button every time I heard a beep, also at different volumes and pitches and which seemed to come from different directions. There’s some stuff with a tuning fork and the audiologist checked if I could hear through my skull.‘Any embarrassment is in your head!’: How hearing aids boost your health and happinessRead moreAt the end of the test, which I was sure I had aced, the audiologist announced the results: mild to moderate mid-frequency hearing loss. Mid-frequency is where people speak so it explained why I wanted to shout at people, “For God’s sake, enunciate!”Believe it or not, even though I had got to the point of getting a hearing test, the result blindsided me. I thought the diagnosis would be something temporary and easily treated. Although I was stunned, I managed to ask a few questions: What causes it? (It is congenital.) How much of my hearing have I lost? (About 30%.) Will it get worse? (Deterioration is slow.) Do I need hearing aids? (They would help but aren’t essential at this stage.)I left the audiologist’s clinic in a bit of a daze as I absorbed this unexpected news about myself. I Googled it when I got home and discovered I have one of the rarest types of hearing loss. It also has a cute nickname – “cookie bite” hearing loss (because the test results resemble a cookie with a bite taken out of it). It is there from birth but deteriorates noticeably in adulthood, with the average age of diagnosis being late 30s. I was 40. Hearing loss doesn’t run in my family, so how I got it is a mystery.I thought being an introvert was why I have never been that sociable. But the news of hearing loss made me realise introversion wasn’t the only reason. When I went to pubs or nightclubs, I wondered how everyone else chatted so easily. I couldn’t hear conversation unless people shouted at me and I thought I had to shout back, which isn’t at all enjoyable. If I’m somewhere with background noise, or the din of chatter, I have to concentrate hard to hear.I missed bits of dialogue in movies and TV, and I put that down to drama schools not teaching actors to speak clearly any more. Subtitles have been a revelation. I have been genuinely surprised at how much dialogue I have been missing (although these days people with perfectly good hearing also complain about inaudible dialogue because sound mixing isn’t what it used to be).So the big question:hearing aids and do I need them? My GP says it is something to consider in the future. Audiologists advise it would help now because I wouldn’t have to work so hard to hear. I did trial some and immediately understood what the audiologists meant. Talking to people was easier. I have got used to the effort needed to hear people and the mental fatigue is real.Then there’s the cost of hearing aids to factor into my decision. I had assumed the price might be about the same as a laptop or a mobile phone, maybe.I got an email advertising an exclusive offer on premium hearing aids. The regular price was discounted by $3,000. The new “bargain” price? $5,995. Yes, there are less expensive models but the type of hearing aid is partially determined by the type of hearing loss. Medicare subsidies are available only for pension recipients. So I’ll be taking the advice of my GP and getting them later. Much later.Until then, please enunciate.Rachael Groessler is a freelance content and copywriter from BrisbaneExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

He introduces the nominees and trails the potential stories. He says: “Conclave won six awards tonight, including best picture,” and then pauses a moment to allow this momentous result to sink in. Upstairs at the Dolby theatre in Hollywood, the early arrivals have barely had time to get a drink in their hands. Now, all at once, they look stricken and cast nervous glances back and forth. Is Offerman joking, or has he just emitted white smoke by electing Edward Berger’s papal thriller? The Oscars don’t even start for another two hours and they worry they might already know how it ends.Los Angeles has burnedandthe planet is in uproar, but the Oscars show must go on, for better or worse. For years, I reported on this event from afar, simultaneously loving it and hating it from my desk in London. But this felt like the right moment to view the gaudy circus up close, when its very existence hung in the balance briefly and at times the awards race threatened to veer into the ditch. Do the Oscars still matter? Should they have even happened at all? Where supporters see a beacon of hope, critics observe an unseemly bonfire of vanities.View image in fullscreenSoaking up the atmosphere … Xan Brooks at the Oscars.Photograph: undefined/Supplied image“There have been some interesting pivots along the way,” admits Bill Kramer, the CEO of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in what surely counts as a contender for this year’s “no shit, Sherlock” award. The contest delivered extended Squid Game carnage, with the early favourites hobbled or scuppered by self-inflicted controversies.Themost conspicuous casualtywas Emilia Pérez, Jacques Audiard’s acclaimed crime-cartel musical, which sped off in pole position only to be totalled by a stash of inflammatory tweets by its star Karla Sofía Gascón, the first out transgender performer to be nominated for the best actress award. Gascón was yanked from promotional duties in the furore, airbrushed from the posters and effectively declared persona non grata.But credit where it’s due: she hasn’t gone down without a fight. She rocks up at the Dolby like Sleeping Beauty’s bad fairy, smiling and defiant, here to gatecrash the christening. The applause she receives suggests that she is only partly forgiven.View image in fullscreen‘Like Sleeping Beauty’s bad fairy’ … Karla Sofía Gascón at the Oscars.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/AMPAS/AFP/Getty ImagesOutside the Oscars bubble, the situation has been more perilous. January’s wildfires destroyed 18,000 homes, torched 23,000 hectares (57,000 acres) and prompted calls for this year’s event to be cancelled. It feels like “fiddling while Rome burns”,wrote the bestselling author Stephen King. You can see his point, except that fiddling – frivolity – is part of LA’s DNA. This is an industry town, its economy sustained by film production and tourism, with Oscars night serving as its centrepiece and barometer. The organisers, therefore, are keen to frame the event as a show of fortitude and resistance. Ideally, its presence proves healing, too.‘A benign, smiling shark’ … Jeff Goldblum, as captured by Xan.Photograph: Xan Brooks“Just for a second, after the actual fires, people were thinking: ‘Oh my God, can we even think about something like this, something joyous?’” says the Academy’s president, Janet Yang. “But over time, talking to our members, the message was clear: ‘No, we need this.’ We’ve had several [Academy] governors who’ve lost their homes and they told us: ‘Please do it.’ One, because it preserves the tradition of theOscars. Secondly, because it brings joy and empowerment and a sense of normalcy to those who desperately need it. LA has been hurting. So people have been looking forward to the Oscars as a way to feel that life goes on.”In Hollywood, it seems, hope springs eternal. The fires have been doused, but their effects are there for all to see. “There is a sense of trauma here,” the Australian animator Adam Elliot says. “But people are saying hello to one another on the street, which is something I’ve never noticed before. One of the cab drivers was telling me: ‘Everyone is a little bit kinder to each other at the moment.’”Officially speaking, Elliot is one of the night’s main players, Oscar-nominated for his spiky stop-motion featureMemoir of a Snail, but the man remains low-profile enough to wander the Dolby theatre unhindered. Instead, the big splash is caused by the arrival of Jeff Goldblum. He cuts through the crowds like a benign, smiling shark.Viewed at close quarters, the Oscars is simultaneously more glamorous and more humdrum than it appears on TV, rather like an annual works do with prettier faces and better dresses. As with most works dos, it’s a gently hierarchical affair, with the stars steered in one direction and the hoi polloi in another. The staff are helpful and welcoming; the event feels inclusive. But the mechanics exist to remind everyone of their place in the great scheme of things. In my case, it’s up on mezzanine two.View image in fullscreenPaying respects … the Oscars’ host, Conan O’Brien(second right), applauds during a tribute to Los Angeles’ firefighters.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersBelow, on the stage, Conan O’Brien hosts the event with a loose, easy swing. Nodding out to the wider community, he salutes the unsung foot soldiers of the local film industry and the firefighters who battled the blazes. He also finds time for a veiled dig at Donald Trump and celebrates cinema as an inherently progressive medium: dogged, decent and a force for good in the world. “Even in the face of terrible wildfires and divisive politics, the work continues,” he says, before turning back to the business of handing out shiny prizes.I ask Yang and Kramer where the organisation stands on political speeches. Does the Academy have a policy of policing its speakers, or does it give them the stage and allow them to say what they like? “We give them the stage,” Yang says. “But briefly.” Kramer elaborates. “Our show is a celebration of global cinema and the people who create movies,” he says. “So we want everybody, regardless of their political persuasion, to enjoy the show and participate. But we definitely advise our nominees on keeping their speeches short and relevant. And they almost always do.”View image in fullscreenLife imitating art … Mikey Madison edged out The Substance’s Demi Moore to win best actress.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Rex/ShutterstockIt’s no secret that the film industry skews left. Jon Stewart once joked that the Oscars was the only place where you could mingle with famous stars without first making a donation to the Democratic party. This year’s awards, crucially, take place against the wider metaphorical bonfire of American politics. It’s only days since Trump’s and JD Vance’smugging of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. The western world may have fractured. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is running amok. The conditions are perfect for a full-throated protest Oscars, a fiery demonstration of artistic resistance. All O’Brien has to do is light the touch paper.In the event,politics doesn’t quite make it on stage. Perhaps it has been steered upstairs instead, forced to sit tight on mezzanine two or three. Daryl Hannah briefly voices support for Ukraine;Zoe Saldaña does the samefor the US’s immigrant communities. The makers of No Other Land, which wins best documentary feature, describe the US’s foreign policy asblocking the path to a political solutionin the Middle East. “I pray for a healthier and a happier and a more inclusive world,” says Adrien Brody, whowins the best actor prizefor his turn as a Hungarian postwar architect in The Brutalist. “If the past can teach us anything, it’s a reminder to not let hate go unchecked.” All of these speeches are impassioned and convincing. All, though, seem at pains not to mention Trump by name.Mezzanine two turns out to be a good vantage point. By peering over the parapet, it is possible to see which nominees are seated in the aisle seats below: a sure sign that they are about to be called for a prize. I try to keep track of the awards that Conclave has picked up, mindful of Offerman’s earlier dry-run announcement, but suspect that it may be lagging.The Brutalistand Anora lead the field.View image in fullscreen‘Slava Ukraine!’ Daryl Hannah shows her support.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the audience has split into silos, warring camps; I become aware of breakaway dramas within the wider Oscars-night production. Few of these guests are simply spectators. Almost everyone has a dog in this fight. Up in row D, I twig belatedly that I am sitting next to the French production team behind Emilia Pérez. The crew members erupt like sports fans when the film’s name is read out. They slap their knees in frustration each time it falls short and shout “Allez!” ecstatically when it finally picks up some gongs. I am not convinced bythe film, as it goes, but their enthusiasm is infectious; I catch myself joining in.On stage, O’Brien reminds us that we need to pick up the pace. There are 23 awards to dole out, plus a number of sidebars to plough through. We are whisked in a blur through a medley of James Bond themes toan extended in memoriam sectionthat bids farewell toGene HackmanandDavid Lynch,Maggie SmithandGena Rowlands. The woman in the row behind appears to have somehow missed the news thatDonald Sutherlanddied in June. The sight of his face on the screen goes through her like a knife.0:59Zoe Saldana accepts best supporting actress Oscar for Emilia Perez – videoEven in death, it is clear that the Hollywood hierarchy holds fast. While some stars merit not much more than a brief wave goodbye, others are lavished with stand-alone spectaculars. I am particularly taken bythe Quincy Jones tribute, in which Queen Latifah corrals about two dozen dancers through a fevered rendition of Ease on Down the Road, a song from the 1974 musical The Wiz. The stage isn’t huge, so the dancers have to be choreographed to perfection. A studio director might have been able to cover a mistake with canny cuts and closeups. But this is a performance best appreciated from higher up, where you can view the ensemble expertise from a distance. One misstep or rogue elbow and the entire acrobats’ circus would come crashing down.View image in fullscreenImpassioned and convincing … Adrien Brody with his new best actor statuette.Photograph: Chad Salvador/WWD/Getty ImagesOfferman, of course, was only punking us. Peter Straughan picks up the award forbest adapted screenplay, but otherwise Conclave is left in the dust. Anora,Sean Baker’s screwball Cinderella taleabout a combative New York sex worker, breaks away during the final stretch. It takes best film, best director, best editing and best original screenplay. Demi Moore had been tipped to win this year’s best actress Oscar, for her turn as a fading middle-aged celebrity inthe body-horror The Substance. Instead, she winds up losing out to Anora’s 25-year-oldMikey Madison, just as her character in the film is usurped by an ambitious younger model. Life imitates art and is often just as brutal.View image in fullscreenGolden boy … Anora’s Sean Baker is the first person to win four individual gongs since Walt Disney in 1954.Photograph: Al Seib/AMPAS/Rex/ShutterstockAs for the show, it has been convivial, smooth-running and not at all brutal. In an average year, that might almost count as a black mark against it. But the stakes were too high, the noises-off too alarming and the organisers determined not to spin any more drama out of crises. The Academy bosses longed for a safe, friendly Oscars: a reassuring hat-tip to LA and to those who live and work in the city. I suspect that it played out exactly as they wished.Oscars 2025: the complete list of winnersRead moreImmediately after the ceremony wraps, the guests are herded upstairs to the Governors Ball. I am informed that this is a highly exclusive affair, for the creme de la creme – and no doubt it is, but the place is thronged and you have to move edgewise. I pause for a few minutes to chat with the producers of No Other Land and say a fly-by hello to The Brutalist’s director,Brady Corbet. By this point of the night, everyone seems to be in the grip of hunger and exhaustion; the food trays are emptied the instant they appear. In pursuing an elusive platter of vol-au-vents across the dancefloor, I almost mow downCynthia Erivo, the star of Wicked. Fortunately, she is perfectly gracious about it.From outside the ballroom comes the faint sound of machinery. On the red carpet, the construction crews are already at work, manoeuvring cranes and forklifts to dismantle the lighting rigs. This is probably how the circus wraps up every year, with its behind-the-scenes workers putting everything back in boxes; as much a part of Oscars tradition as the victory speeches and the dance routines. The party is over and the work continues. It’s time to make like Quincy Jones and ease on down the road.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesAnoraThe BrutalistConclaveEmilia PérezKarla Sofía GascónfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s a long path to glory, and a fairly untrodden one.Parasitemade it five years ago; the previous film to do so was Marty in 1955. (In fact, Billy Wilder’s The Lost Weekend achieved a similar feat 10 years before that, but then the top prize at Cannes was the Grand Prix, and it was shared.)View image in fullscreenKarren Karagulian, Alex Coco, Mikey Madison, Sean Baker, Samantha Quan and Vache Tovmasyan pose with the Palme d’Or at Cannes.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesAnyway: a small number. Acquired by Neon for the US before Cannes, Anora opened there last October in an effective rollout. Half of its earnings were made stateside, with the rest predominantly in Europe, and France – which takes Cannes seriously – proving the major market. It has also done brisk trade in Russia ($3m so far), which can’t be said for a lot of the other nominees, and says something interesting about the accuracy and flattery of film-makerSean Baker’s take on Little Odessa in New York, where Anora is set.So far, globally, it’s on about six times its $6m budget and, despite being widely available on streaming, will doubtless enjoy a lucrative theatrical rerelease.For a long time, though, the film was not assumed to be a shoo-in for major silverware. From Hollywood, the Palme indicates uber arty, and Baker – whose previous films include the trans sex worker iPhone Christmas eve caperTangerine, and child prankster comedyThe Florida Project– is a faintly outre figure for the academy to entirely embrace (in our interview, he admits to still taking drugs).View image in fullscreenMikey Madison, Sean Baker, Mark Eydelshteyn, Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Luna Sofia Miranda and Lindsey Normington, along with the cast and crew, at Anora’s New York premiere last October.Photograph: Thenews2/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockBut as the fates of its rivals ebbed and flowed, and the foundations of The Brutalist’s dominance appeared a bit more crumbly, soAnoraemerged as the favourite – particularly after scooping up three guild awards (other than the one voted for by actors). No film has taken the trio and then gone on to miss out on the main prize since Brokeback Mountain, in 2006, which lost to Paul Haggis’s Crash.The Independent Spirit awards were always going to lap it up, but it also proved, more unexpectedly,Baftascatnip, taking the casting prize, as well as best actress for Mikey Madison. After all that, the Hollywood Reporter gave it a 52% chance of winning, effectively meaning no white smoke forThe Brutalistand poor oldConclavepuffing in the shadows.It’s perhaps Parasite, also distributed by Neon, which provides the clearest explanation for howAnorawon. The distributor ran a similar playbook for both films: that early Cannes debut that allowed critical buzz to slowly build across the summer, followed by a slow rollout that built audience word of mouth across the autumn. Both films had a breathless, genre-skipping style that audiences thrilled to, and both films felt firmly rooted in the present in best picture fields that otherwise seemed preoccupied with the past. (Parasite’s biggest rival, after all, was the rather plodding first world war drama 1917.)View image in fullscreenBong Joon-ho with two of Parasite’s four Oscars.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/APStill, also like Parasite, there was a dollop of good fortune atop the careful planning: Anora didn’t assume frontrunner status until it was too late for a genuine backlash to build. In Anora’s case, the film managed to stay largely clean – bar a fleeting hoo-ha around the lack of intimacy coordinators on set – while other films had to reckon with controversies around AI (The Brutalist, Emilia Pérez) and stars’ disastrous past tweets (again, Emilia Pérez).‘I find myself getting in a little too deep’: Sean Baker on his Palme d’Or-winning lapdance filmRead moreBut maybe we’re overthinking things: perhaps the answer was more simple, and Anora was the film enjoyed by the biggest number of that strange, wide cross-section of Academy members – from traditionalists to international-facing arthouse lovers. After all, it regularly came near the top of voters’ anonymous ballots, in contrast to the forbidding, monolithic The Brutalist, or Conclave with its divisive twist ending. Anora might have just been the film, of those best picture nominees, that audience members came out of the cinema most excited about.That feels fitting: Baker was at pains to underscore the importance of the communal cinematic experience in his (many) awards-season speeches, almost suggesting that a vote for Anora was a vote for the big screen itself, at a time when that tradition was being lost. (A similar trick was tried by The Brutalist, though it was somewhat undermined by its director, Brady Corbet, using his biggest platform – his Golden Globe speech – to drone on about the decidedly insider issue of “final cut tie-break” instead.) With Anora Baker built a powerful movement, of cinema-lovers backing the underdog – and the medium itself.Follow your heart, went the film’s savvy tagline. It seemed that the Academy did just that.Read more about the 2025 Oscars:Anoratakes home best picture OscarAdrien BrodyandMikey Madisonwin best acting prizesKieran CulkinandZoe Saldañawin supporting awardsAnora’s Sean Baker wins fordirecting, editing andscreenplay3:04Oscars 2025: Anora takes it all, Adrien Brody’s second and Wicked dresses to impress – videoExplore more on these topicsOscarsAnoraAwards and prizesSean BakerMikey MadisonCannes film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It made for his most startling music yet – with a surprise Four Tet collaboration still to comeMon 3 Mar 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.31 ESTShareWhen William Tyler put out Goes West in 2019, the album minted what the Nashville-born guitarist calls “an expansive, aspirational part of my life”. It was a prettier take on the crisp heartland Krautrock of his 2016 breakout ModernCountry. Both were released on renowned US indie label Merge, his home after starting out as sideman for Silver Jews and Lambchop in the early 2000s. “I was living in California,” says Tyler, 45. “I was travelling the world. My career was very much upwards.” He embraced it, for better or worse. “From 2017 to 2019, the years I was living in LA, I will fully admit that I was riding a kind of ego-type energy that was probably good for a while, but certainly was apathy for real personal growth.”Goes West was Tyler’s attempt to capitalise on Modern Country, seeing how commercial he could possibly make instrumental guitar music originally informed by Popol Vuh, Public Image Ltd and discordant label Siltbreeze. “But there’s a glass ceiling,” he says now, in his lovely southern accent, speaking from his parents’ house in Nashville. Declining record sales generally meant it only sold as much as Tyler’s second album, 2013’s Impossible Truth. Additionally, he says, “the way I was drinking was moving in a pretty negative direction. Being in your late 30s, your body and mind start not being as resilient to it.”Rehab wasn't One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest  – but it also wasn't The White LotusTyler turned 40 in December 2019. When the Covid pandemic hit the US two months later, he moved in with his parents and “doubled down” on drinking. “I call it a great regression,” he says. “I felt very childlike in a way that wasn’t comforting; I guess some would saychildish, which is true. There were complexes being triggered by substance use, but also the isolation and loneliness.” As a child, Tyler was treated for depression and OCD and diagnosed with Asperger’s. “I was a very isolated kid until I started playing music and joining bands in high school. I didn’t really have something that connected me with other kids my age. I was very insular in a way that wasn’t super confidence-inducing.”View image in fullscreen‘I was riding a kind of ego-type energy’ … Tyler (back row, second from right) in Lambchop in the early 2000s.Photograph: STUART CONWAYLast September, Tyler put out a brief statement saying he was cancelling an imminent UK tour owing to “a mental health crisis and alcoholism”. You don’t have to know all this to hear his forthcoming album, Time Indefinite, and immediately realise that he has been grappling with immense distress. Even as their knowing titles expressed scepticism about US decline, Modern Country and Goes West were bold, frontier-ward records full of giddy, complex playing. The few clear guitar refrains on Time Indefinite chime with nursery-rhyme simplicity, but generally Tyler’s trademark instrument is smeared and stretched through static and distant choral samples in a blasted-out signal-to-noise ratio.He has likened it to guitarist Fennesz meeting writer Eudora Welty; imagine, too, avant-garde composer William Basinski at the state fair. Haunting, beautiful and unsettlingly close, it’s hard not to hear as an obliteration of self. “I think you’re completely right,” says Tyler. “It is a reconfiguration of my identity because that’s what I’ve been feeling.”William Tyler: Time Indefinite Part 1 – videoDespite the heavy subjects, Tyler is endlessly warm and open, an ardent history buff fond of sweeping thoughts that relate the personal to the political. His friend and collaborator, Portland guitarist and friend Marisa Anderson, calls him “a symphonic thinker” and says his new music is “very William: vulnerable in a way you wouldn’t necessarily recognise right away”. You only had to see the support under his tour cancellation post – from Margo Price, Yasmin Williams and Six Organs of Admittance – to see how beloved he is within theAmericanacommunity. And outside it: later this year brings an album with British producer Four Tet (AKA Kieran Hebden), teased by the 2023 single Darkness, Darkness. “He can take an influence like country music, which is quite distant from what I do, but he has a way of combining that with drone music, minimalism, electronic,” says Hebden. “All these things connected with me.”‘There’s a hunger for the next frontier’: the new cosmic AmericanaRead moreYet Tyler says he had always felt like an untrained impostor. His parents are Nashville songwriters but he found his way to music through DIY culture. He seems to feel sheepish that in 2020, he didn’t “sit around playing guitar”, although he and Anderson made the rich, grave album Lost Futures. Otherwise, that first year at his parents’ house, Tyler only had a handheld recording device and his phone, which he used to record guitar parts while immersing himself in fading formats: cassettes, VHS and staticky late-night radio. “I loved the weird disconnectedness of all this,” he says. “It’s actually very comforting.”He preserved his lo-fi recordings as the mood of the album: transparently a harder listen than anything he’s made before, although its sense of decay feels proof of life in our increasingly AI-neutered culture. “I was trying to liberate myself from my expectations about where I was supposed to be going in a career,” says Tyler. “The arts are very aspirational, you have to have a lot of ambition, confidence, momentum, and that disappeared for me for a while. I was tired of this identity and it doesn’t reflect where I’m at, emotionally and creatively.”Time Indefinite borrows its title from a film by Ross McElwee, one of Tyler’s favourite documentarians and a fellow southerner. “That film is very personal but very meandering – it’s about him having a child but watching his father die, all these mixed-emotion, heavy life events happening on top of each other,” he says.” That’s Tyler’s experience of the past four years: pain and joy; growth and loss: “I wanted to convey that emotional reality is not linear.”View image in fullscreen‘A symphonic thinker’ … Tyler in 2013.Photograph: Jordi Vidal/Redferns/Getty ImagesFor Tyler, that stumbling path was “primarily based around alcohol”. Touring since age 20 didn’t help, though he is quick to point out that alcohol misuse is endemic to the normalised pressure we all live with. “I can’t really pinpoint the exact moment where it crossed a line, but it’s been hard for me to tour and not feel hemmed in by it.” Plus, he adds, “like a lot of people – I’m not trying to make an excuse – the 2020s have been very spiritually disorienting for me”, a combination of the pandemic and political upheaval leaving him feeling “very untethered”.Tyler went to rehab last summer, which he calls “a positive experience. It’s hard. It’s not One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” he laughs, “but it’s also not The White Lotus.” He took a class on grief and accepted that its different stages often happen simultaneously. Grieving his old Silver Jews bandmate David Berman, who killed himself in 2019, left him with “complicated feelings about how his legacy was almost instantly shifted into this mythical ‘tragic artist’ zone”; there was also grief for Tyler’s former identity, and “macro-tragic” global shifts.When Tyler was frustrated by his midlife challenges, he used to ask loved ones: “‘Why can’t I just wake up and be the person I was five years ago?’” he recalls. “I was operating in a way that was a little too eager, getting ahead of myself.” Despite his progress last year, when the UK tour was soon to start, he knew he wasn’t ready. “Right after I cancelled, my sister told me, ‘You have to confront why you have this sense of urgency about wanting to resolve things, running out of time. You’re setting yourself up for perpetual anxiety.’ And that really hit me.” Making a public statement about his issues was “to hold me to a better level of accountability. And I have to say it has. It’s why I feel good about moving forward this year.”This is the strangest time that I can remember for being an AmericanTyler says he has found forgiveness and empathy within group therapy, qualities apparently in short supply in Trump’s dark new America. Had he not become a musician, Tyler would have pursued history: he is obsessed with crumbling empires and perceives the US as one of them. He is voluble and precise about this being “the strangest time that I can remember being an American” as scary as it is ridiculous; about “chronic digital loneliness”, individualism, isolation, Republicans jettisoning social responsibility, the right’s weaponisation of counterculture: “It’s not an empathetic model.” (He would make a great professor, and sends links to relevant books after the interview.)Yasmin Williams, folk’s fantastical fingerpicker: ‘Guitar Hero shaped my experimental approach’Read moreTyler is noticeably prone to self-interrogation, conscious of being a middle-aged, white, southern man. He’s always been intellectually curious, he says, and never comfortable with traditional masculinity. While Trump symbolises one such crisis, “I think a lot of men my age feel very lost in whatever this paradigm is that’s changed,” says Tyler. He doesn’t trust anyone who doesn’t question their beliefs, and calls that instinct within himself a sign of optimism. “I’ve never been dogmatic about anything, and that’s anxiety-inducing at times. But while the world is certainly hierarchical, it’s not linear. People’s narratives need to change if you’re going to grow as a human being or a soul. And that can be painful.”Tyler came to realise that “grief outlives its usefulness as a primary emotion very quickly, at least when it comes to things one has no control over,” he says. “It’s painful to imagine a new future when your sense of self has been so shaken, or you’ve had tragic loss, but reclaiming that agency is crucial to a holistic self-actualisation.” He considers himself to be starting again: “There’s a degree of having to relearn how to do this.” He left Merge for the smaller, artist-run label Psychic Hotline and will tour more gently. “I don’t want to retreat any more,” he says. “I would like to re-enter this world that used to bring me a lot of joy, but I have to do it cautiously.”Kieran Hebden and William Tyler: Darkness, Darkness – videoHe calls the Four Tet collaboration a “hail Mary” that came out of asking Hebden to produce an album for him. “I think what intrigued him about working with me was actually some of the things that I might feel more self-conscious about, like my background in country music,” says Tyler. It turned out Hebden’s father loves the 80s country of Tyler’s youth; they’ve covered a Lyle Lovett song. Tyler likens Hebden to Fugazi and the Grateful Dead as “one of the more punk-rock people I’ve ever met in music. That’s a really inspiring model of how to live as an artist, especially when you’ve been doing it for 20 years.” The album is “not what people expect it to sound like, in a good way” – another fresh start.Tyler admits now that he “always fully accepted that none of us get to go back to being who we were – that is a childish sentiment. I don’t really know what’s in front of me. I hope there’s some good stuff, but it is probably going to look completely different from what I imagined.” He mentions Jung’s concept of the midlife crisis, “the transformational opportunity people have at that point where they can either implode, double down on the myth or be open to letting a new myth be born.” The latter, he says, “is where I’m at”.Time Indefinite is released via Psychic Hotline on 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsMusicIndieAmericanaCountryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they were also hugely popular – showing the power of ‘I get it’ artJack Vettriano: a life in picturesEddy FrankelMon 3 Mar 2025 11.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 12.17 ESTShareIn 1992, Jack Vettriano’s painting The Singing Butler was rejected by the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. Anyone who has seen some of the dross picked for display in the RA’s annual open submission collision of amateur artists and big stars in recent decades will be thinking: “Ouch, must’ve been a real dud.” But The Singing Butler not only wasn’t a dud, it went on to become one of the most ubiquitous and – whisper it – iconic British paintings since the second world war.And that tells you a lot about the Scottish artist,who has died at the age of 73. The art establishment has always despised him, but the rest of the world – if you can accept some awkward, problematic conception of “ordinary people” – absolutely lapped up his art. He wasn’t a household name like Tracey Emin or David Hockney. He wasn’t lauded by the art world. He sure wasn’t celebrated by critics. Vettriano was something else, something almost sinful – he was popular.View image in fullscreen‘Contemporary art wants more’ … The TemptressPhotograph: Jack VettrianoHis paintings aren’t classy, or clever, or conceptual. They’re lurid, chintzy, fusty, old-fashioned, conservative and often pretty sexist. He painted people dancing on the beach in 1930s outfits. He painted mobsters and tough guys in suits, “broads” in bras and men polishing muscle cars. They’re paintings commissioned by people who own multiple convertibles; rich, greasy men with three buttons too many unbuttoned.The main issue for snobby art types like me isn’t the work itself. It’s that he lacked a conceptual edge, a sense of irony and any postmodern self-awareness. He didn’t paint sexy midnight trysts between half-clothed women and Brylcreemed men as a comment on gendered power dynamics or as a riff on art historical depictions of the female nude. He painted them because they were sexy. Contemporary art wants more. It wants depth and nuance. It’s not enough to be nostalgic or sexy. But Vettriano’s answer to that is: “Yeah, but it’ssosexy.” And it’s a good argument.That simplicity, that directness that is totally unburdened by shame or embarrassment is the appeal. He sold countless thousands of prints of his paintings to “ordinary people” because the images so effectively communicate their ideas and emotions. These are works of nostalgia, lust, aspiration, love. You look at a Vettriano and you understand it. That’s a powerful thing, a good thing. And one of the problems with contemporary art is that it often requires you to be smart enough to “get it”, but all that does is push people away. Vettriano’s work pulls you in.I had a friend who considered himself a foodie. He was obsessed with ferments, micro-herbs, gels and gastriques, but he’d never, not even once, been to a McDonald’s. How can you love great food if you’ve never understood why so many other people love McDonald’s and everything else at the other end of the spectrum? It’s the same for art – and Vettriano’s paintings are like a double cheeseburger wrapped in greasy paper, precision-engineered to scratch a specific aesthetic itch. They’re not culturally enriching, but they have their place in your artistic diet.View image in fullscreen‘His works tell you what people are really into’ … The Singing ButlerPhotograph: Jack VettrianoThe thing is, you can’t constantly complain that people don’t like Proust and Brahms. Sometimes you just have to find the beauty, or at least the appeal, in Married at First Sight and Banksy. We can learn a lot more from looking for the aesthetic and cultural qualities in “lower” artforms than from outright rejecting them. And Vettriano’s work embodies a battle between “high” and “low” that should have ended long ago, but still tediously rages on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t appreciate these paintings as paintings. I actually think they’re pretty heinous and grim. But I appreciate them for their appeal, for their ability to transcend boundaries, and I like them because other people like them. I like them because they tell you what people are really into – and that’s dancing on the beach, looking sharp and having sex.Explore more on these topicsPaintingArtRoyal Academy of ArtsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then gangs in various parts of the country clashed outside cinemas – and they began pulling the film’Interviews by Simon BlandMon 3 Mar 2025 10.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.08 ESTShareWalter Hill, directorI thought Sol Yurik’s 1965 novel, The Warriors, would work well as a film but I told Larry Gordon [the producer]: “Nobody will ever let us make it. We’d have to shoot at night in New York, and it doesn’t lend itself to star casting.” I turned it down and went to do a western but the finance fell apart. Larry came back and asked if I was still interested.I didn’t get along with the people who ran Paramount and we got off to a poor start. They saw it as some kind of sequel to Saturday Night Fever. It’s pretty hard to imagine more disparate storylines. The Warriors operates in a dystopian, slightly futuristic, fantasy dream world. The studio never understood that but audiences got it instantly.I wanted Orson Welles to narrate an introduction. His speech was going to last 30 seconds and set up what we were about to see. He agreed to do it – he was broke. However, the studio didn’t want him. They felt an artistic frame would hurt the film’s commercial potential. I thought the audience wouldn’t get the movie without some explanation, but I was completely wrong.This is too dull. Do something!Originally, I proposed casting only racial minorities, like in the book, but the studio didn’t think that was a commercial idea. And, now, I think the fact that all of the gangs are interracial makes the movie more universal – it did well all over the world, much to everybody’s surprise.We shot at night in New York areas where gangs ran things. They’d say: “You’re on our turf and your trucks are fucking up our streets – so pay us.” They were always bribeable. It was $200 a night.The Baseball Furies were inspired by the Furies in Greek mythology. Bobbie [Mannix, costume designer] did some drawings and they were wearing the New York Yankees uniform. I thought it wasn’t quite enough. Somebody said, “Why don’t we paint their faces?” and I thought, “Now that’ll make it really different.”We had a scene where a car was looking for the Warriors who were hiding under a boardwalk. Luther [David Patrick Kelly, playing a rival gang leader] knows this, but there wasn’t anything in the script for him to say. I said: “This is too dull. Do something!” He ran under the boardwalk and got some beer bottles. When we were ready to shoot, he clinked the bottles and said: “Warriors … come out to play.” I said: “Don’t change anything!” That and “You dig it?” are probably the two lines everybody remembers.The film was attractive to gangs. They’d show up at the cinema, see a rival gang they had age-old animosity with and violence would ensue. There were several deaths and that’s always tragic, but it’s hard to blame the movie. We got a lot of criticism from political and religious leaders – almost none of them had seen it. I’m proud of the movie.Deborah Van Valkenburgh, played MercyI read the script and the story jumped off the page, like an action-packed matinee movie that takes you on a rollercoaster ride from bright daylight into a neon cityscape at midnight. Mercy resonated with me and I wanted to play her with all my heart.For my first audition, I remember wearing a pair of black, raw silk trousers and a pumpkin-coloured knit top that my Italian friend Pamela gave me. I thought wearing her garment would lend me some spice but I don’t think it particularly impressed Walter. Something I was doing did attract his attention though – he described me as the “unobvious choice”.View image in fullscreen‘We had chemistry’ … Michael Beck as Swan and Deborah Van Valkenburgh as Mercy in The Warriors.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyAs a kid, my brother had taught me to cluck like a chicken so when I saw Mercy’s first line was a cluck, it felt like destiny. I liked her sense of independence and adventure with an undercurrent of discontent. Her world was seemingly limited and she was perhaps at a crossroads when the Warriors arrived in front of her stoop. She taunted and challenged the Orphans and the Warriors gangs. Her vibe got under my skin.My connection to all the guys was pretty instantaneous and my fondness for everyone immediate. Michael [Beck, played Swan] and I already had a trusting connection before our characters hooked up and Walter assured us we had on-screen chemistry.I fractured my wrist during the shoot on the subway platform. It was harrowing, and the schedule got turned upside down. The scene where I’m suddenly wearing a blue jacket was just to conceal my broken wrist. It gave me more moxie to get the job done, come hell or high water. But it was a tough shoot and physically there were challenges all along the way. We embraced our collective “warrior” in that regard.Audiences would clack bottles together in time to Luther’s ominous call to ‘come out and play’When it opened, I recall being with Marcelino [Sánchez, who played Rembrandt] at someone’s apartment and hearing about queues wrapping around city blocks. It was so exciting. I took my friends to see it in Times Square and clucked for the theatre employees. Audiences would clack bottles together in time to Luther’s ominous call to “come out and play”.Sadly, violence cut our momentum short. It was on its way to becoming a smash hit when gangs in various parts of the country clashed outside theatres and cinemas began pulling the film. We found ourselves defending it in interviews: these altercations weren’t perpetrated by the film but by the energy collecting outside in long lines – the film attracted volatile people. But thinking about the graphic violence in films today, The Warriors is a cinematic dance in comparison, epic and romantic.Whenever I see The Warriors, it’s like watching a home movie. There are throngs of people who watch it routinely like The Wizard of Oz. I’m profoundly grateful.Explore more on these topicsFilmHow we madefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the Scots return, they relive disowning their debut album, blowing Top of the Pops – and getting shocks off their battery-powered illuminated suitsMon 3 Mar 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Mar 2025 11.55 ESTShareSteve Mason is remembering the day in 2004 he was told the Beta Band was over. “There was enough money in the bank account to pay each of us a month’s wages,” says the singer, seated in a busy London greasy spoon. “And by that point, we were only on a grand a month. Then that was it.”For the previous eight years, life in the band formed in the Scottish seaside town of St Andrews had been one of constant reinvention and innovation. They’d made fiercely original records and experimental films, while putting on visually stunning live extravaganzas. Their transatlantic fanbase included Oasis, Radiohead, Irvine Welsh and actor John Cusack, who’d recommended their song Dry the Rain for a now-famous scene in High Fidelity. Playing a record store assistant, Cusack announces: “I will now sell five copies of The Three EPs by the Beta Band.” He then puts the CD on and the shopppers nod their heads to Dry the Rain.I picked up a samurai sword – and did four grand's worth of damage to our kit in 60 secondsAlthough the Beta Band were popular, notching up top 20 albums and biggish shows, they should have become massive. Instead, they ended up owing their label Parlophone £1.2m, reflecting all the money spent on recording, touring, videos and more. They weren’t expected to pay it back – but the plug was pulled, and the band was over.“Something like that is so intense,” says Mason. “It’s a big part of your life that’s gone. At the same time, a relationship I had with a girl that had run concurrently with the band ended as well. I had a monumental breakdown. I had a plan to kill myself. Then I tried to get myself sectioned.”View image in fullscreen‘Our ambitions were solely artistic’ … the Beta Band in the 90s.Photograph: Katrin GeilhausenBut now, 21 years on, they’re back, with a reissue campaign and UK and US reunion tours to “celebrate the music”. Keyboards/samples man John Maclean says he came to regard the debt as a “badge of honour” and Mason, still only 49, certainly has no regrets. “We never wanted to be rock stars or make lots of money,” he says. “Our ambitions were solely artistic and we pushed ourselves until the last minute. Then we split up. But how many bands can say they spent £1.2m on art?”Mason was working as a mechanic when conversations with old pal Gordon Anderson and Maclean, who the latter had met at art school, gave him an epiphany. “I’d never heard people talk unashamedly about art and poetry before,” he explains. “I came from this toxic male culture where everyone tried to be tough and there was a lot of tabloid newspapers and talking about women in a certain way. But I suddenly realised the real bravery lies in art.”Anderson soon left, for reasons concerning his mental health, and the lineup became Mason, Maclean, drummer Robin Jones (another art school student) and bassist Richard Greentree. Pitting themselves entirely against the GB jingoism and posturing of the tail end of Britpop, they created music that was completely different: engrossing mixtures of guitars, house grooves, ambient drones, R&B, psychedelia and haunting, enigmatic lyrics.“We went clubbing and listened to the Stone Roses,” Maclean remembers. “But I’d sample a bird sound rather than someone in America going, ‘Wassup?’ It was very organic. We worked with tapes. Pre-computers. Technology was catching up with us. We were constantly making videos. Way before TikTok and YouTube.”View image in fullscreenQuite Spinal Tap … Steve Mason on stage with the band in 2004.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianChampion Versions EP, made for just £4,000 in 1997, was immediately playlisted on Radio 1. “Driving to our first gig,” says Mason, “we pulled up next to some builders and our song came on their radio. We all started cheering.” In the 1990s, major labels could lavish cash on artists, so the Betas told Parlophone: “All we want from you is the money to pursue our ideas, then to be left alone.”After early compilation The Three EPs reached No 35, further catapulting expectations, Mason felt “on a mission from God” when they were then given £300,000 to record their eponymous debut in four cities and one isolated hut in Scotland. “The original idea had been to record in three different continents with Indigenous musicians,” he sniggers. “But that would have cost a million.”However, they then disowned the album. “In those days,” says Maclean, “Oasis would release a new record and claim, ‘This is the greatest ever!’ So there was an element of us going the other way.” Mason now admits the album has flaws, but is not without its moments: “We were still finding a way of writing together. The best tracks are the ones we worked hardest on.” The album reached No 18 in 1999, but two years later the band were still dismissing it, not least in anotoriously grumpy interview with the Guardian in Atlanta. Mason says it was sprung on them just as they came off stage, tired and still jetlagged. “So it was a disaster.”Hot Shots II, made with R&B producer C-Swing, was released to rave reviews in 2001. The album reached No 13 in the UK and dented the US Billboard charts, but by then the band had acquired a reputation for being difficult. Mason says: “When we recorded the single Broke for Top of the Pops, I said, ‘We’re in the belly of the beast now boys!’ as the song started. So it was never broadcast.”Squares, the single that followed a year later, would surely have been a huge hit – had Sheffield electronic act I Monster not released a song containing an identical earworm sample of Daydream, Günter Kallmann Choir’s trippy 1970 single. “I’m still suspicious,” admits Mason. “What are the odds on that?” Radio 1 played I Monster and the Sheffield boys went Top 20.A joke about clubbing together to get a gun to shoot President Bush led to a deportation petition being sent to the FBISome of the Betas’ adventures are quite Spinal Tap. They spent £4,000 on Velcro suits which a roadie left on the tube. They got themselves stage outfits that lit up. “We’d hear the crew walking down corridors muttering, ‘The fucking suits’,” Mason laughs, “because they were always breaking down. They were only powered by nine-volt batteries but one night Richard threw his bass down and started ripping off his jacket. He’d been sweating so much he was being electrocuted by this little battery.”The band once turned up in a small US town only to discover that the venue was “a scout hut”. They had to halve the show’s capacity just to get their equipment in. “We put on a hundred-grand show for 150 people,” laughs Mason. “But I still get messages saying, ‘You changed our town!’”High Fidelity and tours with Radiohead boosted their American popularity enough for Mason to justifiably claim to have been “bigger in the US than Manic Street Preachers or Robbie Williams”. But then, as the singer has revealed in previous interviews, an onstage joke in Texas, about clubbing together to get a rifle to shoot President George Bush, led to a petition to deport him being sent to the FBI.Tornado review – windswept samurai western set in apocalyptic ScotlandRead moreToday, Mason insists such behaviour wasn’t self-sabotage, but was actually caused by his struggles with mental health. “I was suffering a monumental lack of confidence and other stuff. I was so disappointed with the debut album. I mostly used to smash up my own possessions. Then once in rehearsals, I read some comments in the music press slagging us off. I picked up a samurai sword and caused four grand’s worth of damage to our equipment in 60 seconds. I remember John saying, ‘Well, that’s the rehearsal over.’”Maclean thinks that rather than rush to record 2004’s Heroes to Zeros, their third album, they should have taken six months off to recharge their batteries and repair their relationships. “But there was never a plan,” he adds. “It was always, ‘Right, we’re all moving into one house.’ ‘Right, we’re splitting up!’”With hindsight, Mason thinks the biggest reason they didn’t become as successful as they should have was “a lack of effective management or guidance. So we made poor decisions, especially choosing the second manager because he had eyes like a great white shark.”The week after they found out they owed £1.2m, EMI signed Robbie Williams for £80m. A more pressing issue was the £120,000 the members collectively owed the tax office. Mason sighs: “It took me 12 years to pay my share off.”Still, things haven’t turned outtoobadly. They’ve all got families. Mason, much happier, has made five solo albums. Greentree pursued carpentry. Jones and Maclean became film directors, the latter after actor Michael Fassbender liked the Beta Band videos and suggested collaborating. This led to the acclaimed 2015 experimental film Slow West. Maclean reveals that his new movie, Tornado, is loosely based on the Beta Band video forTrouble. “A samurai comes to Britain, suffering nightmares. But instead of me in it, it’s a Japanese actor called Kōki – and instead of Robin’s dad, it’s got Tim Roth.”Meanwhile, it’s hard to argue with how Mason sums up these upcoming tours: “A chance to see one of the greatest British bands of the last 30 years – before they turn us into holograms.”The Beta Band’s UK tour starts at Barrowland, Glasgow, on 25 September. A deluxe reissue of The Three EPs is released at the same time, with more to follow.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A camera that could detect your gestures and replicate them on-screen in a game, the Kinect allowed players to control video games with their bodies. It was initially a sensation, selling1m units in its first 10 days; it remainsthe fastest-selling gaming peripheral ever.However, a lack of games, unreliable performance and a motion-control market already monopolised by the Nintendo Wii caused enthusiasm for the Kinect to quickly cool. Microsoft released a new version of theKinect with the Xbox One in 2013, only for it to become an embarrassing flop; the Kinect line wasunceremoniously discontinued in 2017. The Guardian reached out to multiple people involved in the development of the peripheral, all of whom declined to comment or did not wish to go on record. Instead, the people keenest to discuss Microsoft’s motion-sensing camera never used it for gaming at all.Theo Watsonis the co-founder ofDesign I/O, a creative studio specialising in interactive installations – many of which use depth cameras, including the Kinect. “When the Kinect came out, it really was like a dream situation,” he recalls. “We probably have 10+ installations around the world that have Kinects tracking people right now … The gaming use of the Kinect was a blip.”View image in fullscreenAssistants demonstrate the game Kinect Adventures for Xbox 360 during a media briefing in 2010.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni / Reuters/ReutersWatson speaks about the Kinect, which turns 15 this year, with rare relish. (“I cannot stop talking about depth cameras,” he adds. “It’s my passion.”) As part of the collaborative effort OpenKinect, Watson contributed to making Microsoft’s gaming camera open-source, building on the work of Hector “Marcan” Martin. It quickly became apparent that the Kinect would not, as Microsoft had initially hoped, be the future of video games. Instead, it was a gamechanger in other ways: for artists, roboticists and … ghost-hunters.The Kinect functions on a structured light system, meaning it creates depth data by projecting an infrared dot cloud and reads the deformations in that matrix to discern depth. From this data, its machine learning core was trained to “see” the human body. In games such as Kinect Sports, this allowed the camera to transform the body into a controller. For people making interactive artwork, meanwhile, it cut out much of the programming and busywork necessitated by more basic infrared cameras.“The best analogy would be like going from black-and-white television to colour,” says Watson. “There was just this whole extra world that opened up for us.” Though high-powered depth cameras had existed before, retailing at about $6,000 (£4,740), Microsoft condensed that into a robust, lightweight device costing $150 (£118).Robotocists were also grateful for an accessible sensor to grant their creations vision and movement. “Before it, only planar 2D Lidar information was available to detect obstacles and map environments,” says Walter Lucetti, a senior software engineer atStereolabs, which is soon to release the latest version of its advanced depth-sensing cameras and software. The 2D Lidar detects objects by projecting a laser and measuring the time the light takes to reflect back; the Kinect, however, could create a detailed and accurate depth map that provided more information onwhatthe obstaclemay be and how to navigate it. “Before Kinect-like sensors,” Lucetti says, “a tuft of grass was not perceived differently from a rock, with all the consequences that entails for navigation.”This type of depth camera now powers a host of autonomous robotics, including2020’s Perseverance Mars Rover’s AutoNav system, and Apple’s facial identification tech. (Apple bought PrimeSense, the Israeli company behind the Kinect’s structured light system, in 2013.)View image in fullscreenNasa’s Mars Perseverance Rover in 2020.Photograph: Nasa/UPI/REX/ShutterstockThe Kinect’s technology was soon eclipsed by freely available open-source sensors and more advanced motion-sensing devices. But since Microsoft ceased manufacture of the Kinect line in 2017, the little camera has enjoyed a spirited and not entirely un-troubled afterlife. It haswatched over the Korean demilitarised zoneand worked on topography and patient alignmentin CT scanners; reports have emerged of it being used in airport baggage halls, as asecurity camera in Newark Liberty International airport’s Terminal C(United Airlines declined to comment on this), and even togamify training for the US military. It’s been attached to drones, rescue robots and even found a brief application in pornography.“I’m not sure anyone had a firm vision of what interactive sex involving the Kinect would be,” says Kyle Machulis, founder ofbuttplug.ioand another member of the OpenKinect team. The camera was deployed mostly as an over-complex controller for 3D sex games, fulfilling “more of a futurist marketing role than anything of actual consumer use,” Machulis says. In that role, it was successful: it attracted a flurry of attention, and threats from Microsoft to somehow ban porn involving Kinect. It was an interesting experiment, but it turned out that the addition of a novelty device was not a turn-on for many porn users. Besides, as Machulis says, when the camera malfunctions, “it looks pretty horrible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They deploy its body tracking to find figures the naked eye cannot see. Ghost hunters are thrilled by the Kinect’s habit of “seeing” bodies that aren’t really there, believing that these skeletal stick figures are representations of disembodied spirits.The paranormal investigation industry doesn’t care much about false positives, so long as those false positives can be perceived as paranormal – which is just as well, says Jon Wood,a freelance science performerwho has a show devoted to examining ghost hunting technology. “It’s quite normal for ghost hunters to be filming themselves in the dark, with infrared cameras and torches. You’re bathing the scene with IR light, while using a sensor that measures a specific pattern of infrared dots,” he says. Given that Kinect is designed specifically to recognise the human body in any data it receives, it would be stranger if the Kinectdidn’tpick up anomalous figures in this context.There’s a certain poetry in the Kinect living on among those searching for proof of life after death. In the right hands, the camera is still going strong. Theo Watson points me in the direction ofConnected Worlds, an exhibition that has run in the New York Hall of Science since 2015. Of the many Kinect devices that power the installations, only two have had to be replaced in the decade since it opened – and one of those was only a few weeks ago. Watson started stockpiling the device when Microsoft ceased production.“Half the projects on our website wouldn’t exist without the Kinect,” he says. “If we had this camera for another decade, we would still not run out of things to do with it.”Explore more on these topicsGamesSurveillancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It looks very glamorous and in certain moments it is, but the one thing that I’ve gained having the privilege to come back here is to have some perspective.

In recent years, Blumberg has become a key member.View image in fullscreenDaniel Blumberg with the Oscar he won for best original score.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Penske Media/Getty ImagesHe first emerged as part of Cajun Dance Party, the north London indie group who broke through when still in school and were described by the Guardian as being“Belle & Sebastian with backbone”. He moved on to the four-piece Yuck, who signed to the indie label Fat Possum, were briefly labelled as“grunge”(despite not sounding grungy) and then – despite critical plaudits – folded in 2013.In the same year,Oto Projectsopened in a space adjacent to the club. On an abandoned site, Assemble – the architecture collective thatwon the Turner prize in 2015– created a studio space/workshop built from discarded materials.It was there that Blumberg morphed into the experimental composer who would eventually scoreThe Brutalist. “When Daniel first started to come into the space, he was coming out of a background of playing in pop settings,” said Dunbar.While working in Oto Projects, Blumberg forged relationships with the likes of the pianist John Tilbury, the trumpeter Axel Dörner, the saxophonist Evan Parker and the percussionist Steve Noble. “I think all that had a big impact on on him,” added Dunbar.Derek Walmsley, a former editor ofThe Wire magazine, which covers the same type of adventurous music in which Cafe Oto specialises, said those connections were part of Oto’s appeal. “Everyone’s on the same level, and there’s not even a green room or changing room,” he said.“The musicians who you see play in the evening, will be in the bar later, and you can strike up a conversation with them. And lots of people have done that and then ended up creating new projects.”View image in fullscreenA performance by the late German saxophonist Peter Brotzmann (right) at Oto Cafe in February 2023.Photograph: Dawid Laskowski/The GuardianBlumberg is not the first Cafe Oto-affiliated composer to win acclaim. Mica Levi, known for their work with the film directors Jonathan Glazer and Pablo Larrain, also frequents it as a performer and a customer. Blumberg and Levi are part of a trio of British experimental composers, including Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, who have weaved avant garde soundsinto the scores of Hollywood epics.But despite the venue’s position as an incubator for talent, like many venues it is under financial pressure. Cafe Oto is in one of the more gentrified areas of London, where establishedcommunities and businesses are being forced out. Dunbar admits it has never been easy to run an experimental music venue in the centre of the capital but things have got more challenging as rents and costs have risen.“I think it’s a strange position because we’re busier than we’ve ever been, but it’s still really hard to keep something like Cafe Oto alive,” Dunbar said. “But I think it’s really important to dig our heels in and try to stay.”The venue has recently adopted a membership model, where people can join and pay a fee in order to support the venue whether they attend or not. “They feel it’s important that it exists, and is doing work that maybe wouldn’t otherwise get done,” added Dunbar.Now“the most critical listening room in London”has an Oscar to add to its appeal.Explore more on these topicsLondonExperimental musicThe BrutalistOscarsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

For the first time sinceVladimir Putinlaunched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, the Oscars made the news.The state anchor devoted the tightly controlled news bulletin toAnora, the night’s runaway success, spotlighting its cast of Russian actors – chief among them best supporting actor nominee Yura Borisov, who earned global praise for his performance as a brutish yet unexpectedly sensitive Russian bodyguard.“Borisov didn’t take home a personal Oscar,” the state anchor remarked, “but he earned praise for his talent and professionalism from none other than Robert Downey Jr,” referencing Downey’s speech from the stage in Los Angeles, which lauded Borisov.Anora has swept the Oscars. I can’t help feeling that shouldn’t have happened | Catherine ShoardRead moreSean Baker’sAnora, a Cinderella-like fairytale of a lapdancer’s whirlwind romance with the free-spending, reckless son of a Russian oligarch, has achieved somethingfew cultural works have managed in recent years: it has been embraced both in the west and in an increasingly nationalistic, militarised Russia.Anora took home five Oscars on Sunday, and has won acclaim both in Hollywood and Moscow for its sharp, unflinching portrayal of power dynamics and class struggle, earning particular praise for its authentic Russian dialogue. But for some, Anora is a difficult film to celebrate.At a time when Russian bombs continue to fall onUkraine, a story steeped in Russian themes and set in a pre-pandemic world – untouched by the invasion – feels, to its critics, unwelcome, like a retreat into a reality where the war doesn’t exist.“There’s a lot about this film that unsettles me … It’s the third year of full-scale war … And here … not a single word about the war. The feeling of discomfort never quite leaves,” wrote the Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyanskyin a post on Instagram.And perhaps more than anything, it is Borisov’s Oscar nomination that hastroubledUkrainians, who see it as a symbol of cultural normalisation amid Moscow’s aggression.View image in fullscreenThe film’s producers, Samantha Quan, Sean Baker and Alex Coco.Photograph: Al Seib/AMPAS/REX/ShutterstockBefore catching Baker’s attention with his raw portrayal of a gruff Russian miner in theFinnish film Compartment No 6, Borisov made his name in Moscow through a string of roles that fed into the Kremlin’s patriotic narrative. Among them was Kalashnikov, a biopic of Mikhail Kalashnikov, inventor of the AK-47, partially filmed in Crimea after its annexation by Russia in 2014. More recently, on his visits back to Moscow, Borisov has been promoting a new patriotic epic, this time starring as Russia’s most revered poet, Alexander Pushkin.Neither Borisov nor his Russian co-star Mark Eydelshteyn, who portrays the entitled son of an oligarch inAnora, has publicly voiced support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But neither have they spoken out against it, an ambiguity that has allowed both actors to move freely between Russia and the west.For many, that silence speaks volumes. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, thousands of Russian artists and creatives have fled the country or spoken out at great personal risk.As Borisov made his way to Los Angeles, Russian security services in Moscow last weekarrestedthe prominent film critic Ekaterina Barabash. She was later charged with spreading “deliberately false information” – the catch-all label for those who oppose the war – and now faces up to a decade in prison.“No such risks exist for Mr Borisov and Mr Eydelshteyn, who, thanks to the film’s embrace by the Hollywood establishment, are now heroes back home,” wrote Latvian American novelist and screenwriter Michael Idov, who previously worked in Moscow, in apiecefor The New York Times.That Anora’s success came amid the sharpest US-Russia thaw in years – fuelled by the Trump administration andat Ukraine’s cost– was not lost on anyone. “It’s a good night for Anora, two wins already. I imagine Americans are pleased to finally see someone stand up to a powerful Russian,” joked Oscar host Conan O’Brien, referencing the film’s plot, in which Anora goes up against the family of a Russian oligarch.But for Russian propagandists, the film’s very presence at the Oscars was framed as a victory for Russian culture. “Russian culture can’t be cancelled. Russia itself can’t be cancelled,” wrote Sergei Markov, a prominent pro-Kremlin commentator, ina post on Telegram. “Sooner or later, the west will have to come to terms with Russia.”Explore more on these topicsFilmOscarsAnoraRussiaAwards and prizesEuropeVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

His breakthrough came in 1998 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy’s annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist.A 2009 self-portrait was posted on his official Instagram page alongside a message announcing his death, which stated: “It is with great sadness that we share the news of Jack’s passing over the weekend.“He was not only an extraordinary artist but also a deeply private and humble man who was endlessly grateful for the support and admiration of those who loved his work. His paintings – capturing moments of intrigue, romance, and nostalgia –touched the hearts of so many around the world, and his legacy will live on through them.At this time, we ask for privacy as his loved ones come to terms with this loss. Thank you for all the kind messages and tributes already shared – your support means so much.”It is understood there are no suspicious circumstances around the 73-year-old’s death.View image in fullscreenVettriano’s The Singing Butler was sold at auction in 2004 for £744,500.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockHis works received international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities such as Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York.But Vettriano drew scorn from critics, many of whom considered his work derivative. Jonathan Jones called him “emotionally trite and technically drab”, while another writer said he was like “Hopper without the emotion, and sleazy to boot” and that “we should not make the mistake of classing him as a major – or even decent – artist” despite his commercial success.His 1992 painting theThe Singing Butleris among his most famed works and shows an elegant couple dancing on a storm-swept beach accompanied by their butler and maid. It became a bestselling image in Britain. Reproductions of the painting sold in their thousands but critics failed to be won over.In 2005, when Vettriano was compared to Dalí, Bacon and Picasso, Jonathan Jones wrote:“Those are all great artists. Vettriano is not even an artist. He just happens to be popular, with “ordinary people” who buy reproductions of his pseudo-1930s scenes of high-heeled women and monkey-suited men, and celebrities who fork out for the originals of these toneless, textureless, brainless slick corpses of paintings. I urge you to visit the National Gallery. Look at great paintings for a few hours. Now take a look at Vettriano. I’m not arguing with you; I’m telling you. I look at art every day and I know what I don’t like.”While some critics hated his work, Vettriano won over several celebrity fans, including Jack Nicholson, Alex Ferguson, Tim Rice and Robbie Coltrane.Three years ago, the artist revealed he had been addicted to cocaine, describing himself as living like “Jack Nicholson in The Shining”. “I never wanted to try anything else like heroin or ecstasy, because cocaine just hit the spot,” he told the Daily Mail. “It arouses your sexual appetite, but unfortunately it doesn’t give you the power to do anything about it.”He became depressed and abused alcohol when an injury to his shoulder in 2015 left himtemporarily unable to paint.His publicist said: “Jack Vettriano’s passing marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art. His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.”Explore more on these topicsArtPaintingScotlandFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We spoke from a place of love.”Saldaña, who became the first American actor of Dominican origin to win an Oscar, also went on to say she did not agree with the criticisms. “I don’t share your opinion,” she said. “For me, the heart of this movie was notMexico. We were making a film about friendship. We were making a film about four women.”She continued: “These women could have been Russian, could have been Dominican, could have been Black from Detroit, could have been from Israel, could have been from Gaza. And these women are still very universal women that are struggling every day, but trying to survive systemic oppression and trying to find the most authentic voices. So I will stand by that, but I’m also always open to sit down with all of my Mexican brothers and sisters, with love and respect, [to have] a great conversation on how Emilia could have been done better.”In her speech, Saldaña paid tribute to her heritage. “My grandmother came to this country in 1961,” she said. “I am the proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hard-working hands.”The film led the night with 13 nominations yet won just two for Saldaña and for original song. It had been the subject of a number of controversies, also backlash from the LGBTQ+ community and for leadKarla Sofia Gascón’shistory ofinflammatory tweets.Audiard had previouslyapologisedto those offended: “If there are things that seem shocking in Emilia Pérez then I am sorry … Cinema doesn’t provide answers, it only asks questions. But maybe the questions in Emilia Pérez are incorrect.”Sean Baker’sAnoraultimatelywon the most awardswith five wins, including for best picture.Read more about the 2025 Oscars:Anoratakes home best picture OscarAdrien BrodyandMikey Madisonwin best acting prizesKieran CulkinandZoe Saldañawin supporting awardsAnora’s Sean Baker wins fordirecting, editing ands creenplayExplore more on these topicsOscarsZoe SaldañaEmilia PérezAwards and prizesMexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Anora also received a fifth Oscar, for best actress, which went to its star,Mikey Madison.The haul completes a remarkable rise for Baker, a director who had previously been considered something of an arthouse film outsider and who, beforeAnora, had never received a single Oscar nomination.Despite Baker’s impressive haul at this year’sOscars, he still has some way to go to match Disney’s total Oscar haul, which stands at a record 22 wins.Read more about the 2025 Oscars:Anoratakes home best picture OscarAdrien BrodyandMikey Madisonwin best acting prizesKieran CulkinandZoe Saldañawin supporting awardsAnora’s Sean Baker wins fordirecting, editing andscreenplay3:04Oscars 2025: Anora takes it all, Adrien Brody’s second and Wicked dresses to impress – videoExplore more on these topicsOscarsSean BakerAnoraAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

The film was made between 2019 and 2023 and focuses on the steady forced displacement of Palestinians from their homes in Masafer Yatta, a region in the occupied West Bank targeted by Israeli forces.‘The UK should know what their government is supporting’: the Israeli and Palestinian film-makers shining a light on West Bank violenceRead moreSpeaking to a standing ovation, the film-makers thanked the Academy before co-director Basel Adra said he had recently become a father and hoped his daughter’s life would not be like his – “always fearing settler violence, home demolitions and forced displacement”.He continued by saying his film reflected “the harsh reality” that his fellow Palestinians had endured for many years, “as we call on the world to take serious action to stop the injustice and stop the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people”.Co-director Yuval Abraham then took to the stage to say that Palestinians and Israelis had made the film together “because together our voices are stronger. We see each other the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people must end.“Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7, which must be freed. When I look at Basel I see my brother but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law but Basel has to live under military laws that destroy his life and he cannot control.He continued: “There is a different path. A political solution. Without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. And I have to say, as I am here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path.“Why? Can’t you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe if Basel’s people are truly free and safe. There is another way. It’s not too late for life, for the living. There is no other way.”Despite acclaim, the filmcould not find distribution in the USand was self-distributed instead. The Guardian’s Adrian Horton called it “straightforward, un-sensationalized and completely infuriating” ina five-star review.No Other Land review – powerful Israel-Palestine documentary is essential viewingRead more“I believe it’s clear that it’s for political reasons,” co-director Yuval Abraham toldDeadlineabout the lack of formal distribution. “I hope that it will change. We basically decided not to wait on the theatrical release because the demand in the United States is now so high for the film, and we are now releasing it in almost 100 theaters independently. And we’re seeing everything is sold out.”Since the Hamas attack on 7 October, Israeli forceshave killedat least 48,200 Palestinians while forcibly displacing 2 million survivors.Last year saw 20 Days in Mariupol win the award.Read more about the 2025 Oscars:Anoratakes home best picture OscarAdrien BrodyandMikey Madisonwin best acting prizesKieran CulkinandZoe Saldañawin supporting awardsAnora’s Sean Baker wins fordirecting, editing andscreenplayThis article was amended on 3 March 2025 to correct a quote from co-director Basel Adra.Explore more on these topicsOscarsDocumentary filmsAwards and prizesNo Other LandIsraelPalestinian territoriesWest BanknewsShareReuse this content"

And next year, and for years to come, through trauma and joy, this seemingly absurd ritual is going to be here … the magic, the madness, the grandeur and joy of film worldwide is going to be with us forever.”To kick off the show, the broadcast from the city’s Dolby Theater opened with a shot of the Hollywood sign, with the voice of Judy Garland saying There’s No Place Like Home. The Wizard of Oz reference gave way to a montage of movie scenes filmed in Los Angeles, from Mulholland Drive to Barbie, La La Land to Iron Man, Her to Everything Everywhere All At Once, ending with the message: We <3 LA.View image in fullscreenConan O’Brien during the Oscars on 2 March.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the stars of the Wizard of Oz prequel Wicked, continued the tribute with performances of Somewhere Over the Rainbow (Grande) and The Wiz’s Home (Erivo). The duo then joined forces for Wicked’s signature track, Defying Gravity, before Erivo took on the climax with a shot of the glittering LA skyline in the background.After their performance, O’Brien emerged from Demi Moore’s back in his monologue opener, paying homage to the grotesque visuals displayed in the Oscar-nominated film The Substance.“It’s Hollywood’s biggest night that starts at four in the afternoon,” said the comedian as he began. “But it’s theOscarsand I say let’s do this thing.”In his more than 10-minute speech, O’Brien poked fun at Netflix (“Netflix leads all studios with an impressive 18, count them 18, price increases”), Oscar-nominated films The Brutalist (“I loved The Brutalist, I really did. I didn’t want it to end. And, luckily, it didn’t.”) and Conclave (“A movie about the Catholic church, but don’t worry”), and actress Karla Sofía Gascón (“Anora uses the F-word 479 times. That’s three times more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón’s publicist”).O’Brien offered levity by taking aim, in small part, at Amazon. He said that founder Jeff Bezos had been seen on the red carpet, before panning over to a staged Amazon delivery driver throwing a package at the heels of an Oscar statue. He then noted that Bezos wasn’t seen inside the Dolby Theatre before panning back over to a man in black seemingly stealing the package that contained Bezos.After showing off some old headshots of Zoe Saldaña, Guy Pearce and a sonogram of Timothee Chalamet, O’Brien did a bit with Adam Sandler, who appeared in what has become his uniform these days: a hooded sweatshirt and basketball shorts.O’Brien concluded his monologue with a musical number where he repeatedly said he wouldn’t waste time all while dancing beside a sandworm from Dune 2 playing piano and a dancing Deadpool.Sunday night’s show marked the first time the late-night legend hosted the telecast. Fellow late-night hostJimmy Kimmelpreviously hosted the Academy Awards in 2017, 2018, 2023 and 2024,revealinglast year that he had turned down a request to host in 2025.On the selection of O’Brien, the Academy chief executive officer, Bill Kramer, and the Academy president, Janet Yang, said in a statement that he was the “perfect person to help lead our global celebration of film with his brilliant humor, his love of movies, and his live TV expertise”.“His remarkable ability to connect with audiences will bring viewers together to do what the Oscars do best – honor the spectacular films and film-makers of this year,” they said.Later in the broadcast, O’Brien brought out a team of firefighters who braved the Los Angeles fires to the stage.“On behalf of everyone in greater los Angeles, thank you for all that you do,” he said, before introducing three of the Los Angeles fire department (LAFD) members to do some jokes of their own.Capt Eric Scott deadpanned: “Our hearts go out to all of those who have lost their homes and I’m talking about the producers of Joker 2.”Capt Jody Slicker took aim at the host himself, telling the audience: “It’s great to be back with Conan - usually when he calls, he’s stuck in a tree.”Read more about the 2025 Oscars:Anoratakes home best picture OscarAdrien BrodyandMikey Madisonwin best acting prizesKieran CulkinandZoe Saldañawin supporting awardsAnora’s Sean Baker wins fordirecting, editing andscreenplayExplore more on these topicsOscarsAriana GrandeCynthia ErivoCalifornia wildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

Not content with a skull as a memento mori, he acquired the stone sarcophagus of pharaoh Seti I, which gapes like the mouth to the Underworld in the shadow-filled basement ofhis museumat Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Two hundred years on, at his country house at Ealing, his fellow spirit, the painter Alison Watt, stares at the world with the kind of bleak thoughts he savoured.Watt’s exhibition starts with a painting of a broken plaster cast of a classical child’s head. Like all her still lifes, it is done with precision and craft. It is also totally eerie. The white plaster child’s eyes are blank, devoid of pupils. There is a blue-shadowed hole, where the hollow head has been broken off from its body, opening a lane to the land of the dead. Uneasy? Good, then the ghost story can begin.Meticulous but unsettling paintings of folded white linen follow. Watt depicts their sharp creases, enigmatic dimples and empty overhangs with precise, patient attention. Yet her pristine sheets and tablecloths look unerringly spectral in Soane’s spooky old place. She doesn’t do anything flashy, just sticks to the facts, with one exception – you can’t tell exactly what surfaces the linens rest on. They exist in a pale limbo yet still, disturbingly, cast shadows. Every manicured cloth made me think of my winding sheet.View image in fullscreenThe Day After (detail) by Alison Watt.Photograph: Alison WattWait, here are some nice pink flowers! The first of these four floral still lifes is perfect, with creamily exact pink petals casting cool shadows on a nondescript surface. But in the next painting they are yellowing, then in the next serious decay has taken over. In the final picture the flowers are just about surviving, like us all.Has Watt never heard of a cameraphone?Of course, it is not exactly original to put intimations of decay and entropy into a still life – 17th-century paintings do it religiously. But Watt does more than just emulate painters of the past. Watching a flower rot or staring at a sheet of linen until it seems alive was a more common pursuit for artists in a world without technological distraction. It means something different and positively strange to look this hard at things nowadays.And Watt really does look hard. A painting of a blue and white porcelain cup and saucer captures not just every detail of its antique pattern, but the sheen and depth of the glaze in a little wonder of observation. Has Watt never heard of a cameraphone? Doesn’t she know you can have it “see” something for you in an instant? Plainly she prefers to actually look. And look.This rigorously empirical method raises paradoxically metaphysical questions. A large depiction of a sheet pinned up to a wall sways in the light. It’s just white cloth. Is that all there is? Or does something inhabit it? In fact this hanging cloth echoes a haunting, or haunted, masterpiece of religious art. In Francisco de Zurbarán’s c1660 paintingThe Sudarium of St Veronica, a white sheet is similarly slung up and on it is the blood-brown, miraculously preserved imprint of Christ’s face.No face appears on Watt’s white cloth. Nothing. It is a religious painting without a God. She watches for so long, but nothing happens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These are not paintings from life but studies from death. Watt has done three still lifes, from different vantage points, of a death mask that survives in Soane’s collection. He bought it, a wall text tells us, thinking it was the death mask of a naval mutineer called Richard Parker. We are not told why he wanted such a grisly memento of a sailor hanged from a ship’s yardarm in 1797, or why the seller who conned him didn’t just sell it for what it was. For what Soane bought was the death mask of someone far more famous, Oliver Cromwell.Watt ironically gives the dead lord protector the same triple portrait treatment that Anthony van Dyck lavished on Charles I, whose death warrant Cromwell procured and signed. Unearthly light falls on the dead face, deep shadows overhang its eyes. Is there a ghost here, she seems to ask as she paints the death mask from different angles. No. Not even that. Just a great nothingness.It might be too sad a thought even for Soane.Alison Watt: From Light is at Pitzhanger Manor and Gallery, London, 5 March to 15 JuneExplore more on these topicsArt and designSir John Soane's MuseumLondonInstallationArtMuseumsExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

(Well, maybe. It would perhaps have needed a starrier cast; the actors here are solid stalwarts of German cinema, of the sort that Hollywood largely remains unenthusiastic about.)Contributing to this slight sense of the passé is the decision to have everyone speak English but in a German accent, a curious choice that was standard practice for years but is now largely avoided. In a film aspiring to moral seriousness, it strikes a slightly odd note. It’s hard to take a line like, “I can see you standing here with a grass stain on your new lederhosen,” quite as seriously as perhaps the film-makers would like.The film takes some liberties with the truth, which has caused a flurry of controversy among groups more au fait with the details of Bonhoeffer’s life than your average viewer. Giving the facts a bit of added dazzle is pretty much expected and not necessarily a problem, but when your subject is primarily remembered for their pacifist beliefs and theological writings, it does feel faintly counterintuitive to have them participate in various pieces of active dissent (plots with bombs and so on) – a narrative bolstering that risks missing the point of why they are of interest in the first place.As a thriller, this is not really thrilling enough. And as a biopic, it’s not necessarily representative of the spirit of the man. But it’s solid enough film-making in a traditional no-frills mode that will always find an audience – even if it’s not particularly trendy.Bonhoeffer is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsPeriod and historical filmsGermanyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Where this multigenerational novel luxuriates in lengthy interior monologues, full of poetic meditations, sexual longing and self-questioning, Werenowska pulls the focus sharply on its three central women and their passage towards modernity.Her prime interest is in Ursula (Rebecca Brudner), the early 20th-century girl who takes strides towards the kind of independence longed for by her mother Anna (Jessica Dennis) and impossible to imagine for her grandmother Lydia (Kate Spiro), a Polish immigrant who stepped down the social ladder to settle in rural Nottinghamshire.Performed as part of theUK/Poland Season 2025by a cast of Polish-heritage actor-musicians, The Rainbow becomes a female-centric tale of emancipation across the decades, in which one generation’s sense of being out of place becomes the next generation’s impulse to take control.View image in fullscreenFolk rhythms … The Rainbow.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicIn Jo Newman’s fluid production, Werenowska tackles the novel back to front, creating a kaleidoscopic collage of edited highlights, showing past and present rubbing up against each other. It is a good way to encompass the narrative’s movement from the agricultural to the industrial, the rural to the urban, traditional to modern. With the roving picture frames of Verity Quinn’s set and acoustic folk rhythms of Ela Orleans’s live score, it also provides scope for a free-flowing theatrical style.But there are downsides too. It is no big deal that it makes the men peripheral, even less knowable than Lawrence’s contradictory portraits, but as a consequence underplays the erotic charge of a novel that wasbanned for obscenity on publication in 1915.More of an issue is the breakdown of cause and effect. The restructuring of scenes means we often see actions before motivations; it is hard to identify with characters without knowing the reasons for their behaviour.And in the end, it hampers the forward direction of the story. The closer Ursula gets to resolution, to strike out on her own terms, the more the play jumps back in time, dragging out the backstory that Werenowska has so vigorously disposed of at the start and prolonging an ending that feels more laboured than liberating.At Perth theatre until 8 March.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreDH LawrencereviewsShareReuse this content"

When Steel asks the consultant whether his tumour is likely to prove fatal, the doctor replies “Touch wood”, and then actually touches some wood; at least, his patient notes, he was being professional about it. Maybe if the cancer had spread, Steel reflects, “they’d offer a more extreme approach and get me to pick up a penny and pass a black cat”.Cancer is common, and accounts of experiencing its arrival, treatment and – if you’re fortunate – aftermath are hardly rare. But this is not to suggest memoir fatigue. People, and illness itself, are infinitely various, and each chronicle reveals something different in between what have become the tropes of the genre: the shock of the news, the emotional and physical reserves required to endure treatment, the almost inevitably altered perspective on one’s own life and on more existential questions of life and death themselves.As a connoisseur of the everyday, as witnessed in his BBC Radio 4 showMark Steel’s in Town, in which he travels around the country meeting the citizenry and performing to them, he is unsurprisingly interested in the minutiae of his treatment and on his interactions with medical professionals, fellow patients and friends and family. Many of these involve throat-catching gallows humour: there is the Russian doctor he meets at the investigation stages, whose muttered “chances not good” in fact translates to optimism – the chances are Steel doesn’t have cancer rather than its reverse; and, in some of the book’s most moving passages, the sporting idiom he and his new pal Jules adopt when they’re going through radiotherapy together. (“Each day we’d describe the previous day’s climb as ‘set off at a good pace but only the first stage of the Tour de France’. By the third week it was ‘two sets and a break down with a heavily bandaged ankle but determined to finish the match.’”)The treatment itself is appallingly gruelling, but here, too, there is room for comedyJules has a bit of luck when it comes to dealing with the claustrophobia induced by the mask worn during treatment because he used to be an army tank commander; he’s less lucky with the byzantine path cancer cuts through his body and, despite Steel’s understandable impatience with the martial or value-laden language used to talk about the illness, it’s impossible not to feel astounded by his courage. He also points Steel, with immense usefulness, in the direction of Stoic philosophy, not in its axiomatic, vibesy current incarnation, but in the part of its original form that deals with the counterproductiveness of feeling that one has been wronged.We are often reminded of those who have not survived. Two of Steel’s closest friends, comediansLinda SmithandJeremy Hardy, both died of cancer, and Steel unabashedly commemorates their lives while pondering that, although he was close to both of them during their illnesses, nothing can convey the intricate practical, mental and emotional realities of facing death.Elsewhere, he catalogues the support given to him by peers who have coped with their own diagnoses, includingMatt FordeandRhod Gilbert, and relays an extraordinarily unexpected and touching message of support from Jimmy Tarbuck. And there is also the background account of Steel’s complex relationship with Shaparak Khorsandi, much of which remains private, but which clearly sustains him (perhaps especially when she sends him aVizannual anonymously).The treatment itself is appallingly gruelling, with particular horrors attendant on the way it deprives the body of saliva – without which eating, drinking and speaking are near impossible – while also flooding it with mucus. But here, too, there is room for comedy, as in the fraught exchange when a provider rings up to enquire how much nutritional formula Steel requires, and the patient is simply unable to make himself heard. The challenges of navigating the healthcare system are legion, but as this clear-eyed, humane and engaging book makes repeatedly and abundantly clear, without the NHS’s central tenet – if you are ill, you will be helped – we are completely sunk. Steel himself is now recovered, and cancer-free, but you feel there isn’t a day when he doesn’t think of those who didn’t, or won’t, make it through.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Orson Welles ran out of money making his doomed adaptation. Terry Gilliam’s first stab was such a catastrophe it went down as one of the unluckiest films in screen history. Disney bosses abandoned a version after reportedly deciding it was too adult. The makers of this family animation dodge the age-inappropriate issue with a central character who is Don Quixote’s modern-day descendant: an 11-year-old boy dreamer. Though to be fair, the film shares more DNA with other loud crashy kids’ movies than Cervantes.Our misguided hero is Alfonso Quixote, the great-great-great-and-then-some grandson of the legendary 17th-century Don. Alphonso is blessed with the family trait of crackpot idealism. He is hated in La Mancha for repeatedly causing carnage in the pursuit of his hare-brained schemes. Actually, most residents are leaving town anyway, forced out by extreme weather and constant storms. Alfonso’s father is one of the few locals resisting the offer of an all-mod-cons new home in another town from shifty property developer Carrasco (Tom Harris).Giants of La Mancha really is like dozens of past family animations – with added windmills. It’s got fart jokes, heaps of (not especially funny) wisecracks and animation of no better quality than shows your kids watch every day on streaming channels. It’s a disappointing and unsatisfyingly thin story, too, with its bland global warming theme, following Alfonso and his best friend Pancho Panza (descendant of Sancho) on a desperate mission to save the town. Even with the plot tweaks, the idea of Don Quixote targeted at little kids feels pretty random.Giants of La Mancha is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsFilm adaptationsMiguel de CervantesreviewsShareReuse this content"

We begin with a didactic parable, reminiscent of Brecht and Weill, introducing us to Lola Green (Ffion Edwards), whose activism leads to bullying at school and undermines relationships with her sister Zoe (Natasha Agarwal), father Clive (Ross Ramgobin), and mother Angela (Madeleine Shaw), a ghastly woman who views her daughter’s idealism as indicative of mental health issues.The second act, meanwhile, slides towards magic realism, as damaged nature is given its own voice by multiple soloists and choruses after the fashion of Ravel’s L’Enfant et les Sortilèges, though Angela, unwavering in her belief that progress equates with urbanisation, catastrophically persists in destroying forests to make way for unnecessary roads. A big, static choral finale, more cantata than opera, demands we let nature renew itself after all we have done to it. But mother and daughter remain unreconciled – and perhaps irreconcilable – at the close.View image in fullscreenRoads rule … Uprising.Photograph: Glyndebourne Productions/Richard Hubert SmithThe score score is eclectic, at times allusive. Rhythmic repetition, sometimes fierce and echoing Stravinsky or Adams, underpins Lola’s determination, while chic, insubstantial waltzes suggest Angela’s flippancy. Surging Wagnerian strings and horns characterise the forests and floods of Act II – a quiet reminder the Ring is also about damage to our planet. The work, however, is rooted in Dove’s writing for Glyndebourne YouthOperaand the Glyndebourne Community Chorus, direct yet complex, and utterly ravishing in the forest scenes with their overlapping counterpoint and textures.They sing it fantastically, too, and are superbly directed, by Sinéad O’Neill. In Act I, the Youth Opera first bully, then encourage Lola, while the Community Chorus snipe and gossip disparagingly, all of it characterised in considerable, at times excruciatingly realistic detail. After the interval, however, beautifully choreographed sequences (Mike Ashcroft is the movement director) suggest the teeming life of the forest or the surge and swell of water.The professional singers playing the protagonists are consistently impressive. Edwards sounds tireless and beautiful in the long, exacting central role, while Shaw is by turns funny and disquietingly malign. Ramgobin charts Clive’s gradual acceptance of his daughter’s beliefs with moving subtlety, and there’s magnificent singing from Edwin Kaye, as Quercus, the stoically suffering forest king. Andrew Gourlay conducts the Glyndebourne Sinfonia with terrific energy, while the call to protest is sounded onstage by some some awesome drumming from the Brighton and Hove Percussion Ensemble.Uprising is atSaffron Hall, Saffron Walden, on 15-16 March; thenin Edinburgh and Glasgow.Explore more on these topicsOperaGlyndebourneClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Shot in evocative black and white on textured 16mm stock, this almost dialogue-free feature evokes the freewheeling spirit of 1920s city symphony films. The propulsive opening alights at Istanbul, a metropolis gradually rousing from slumber. First lingering on wandering stray dogs and cats, Jimmy soon shifts gear into a more energetic mode; animated by the rhythm of urban life, the camera swirls around the bustling city, taking in its beautiful people and architecture. Enveloping these images is Paco Andreo’s chameleonic score, which accompanies almost the entire length of the film. Though at times punctuated by diegetic on-location sounds, the shape-shifting music responds to the ebb and flow of the montage, adding a sensorial tactility to whip-pans and capricious zoom shots.Initially, the reason behind this flood of images is elusive. The veil is lifted when this movable feast departs from Istanbul for Paris. In a wide shot of the Luxor obelisks in Place de la Concorde, a young Black man briskly walks towards the camera, then he hails a taxi. This is, in fact, James Baldwin, played here by Benny O Arthur. Embracing anachronism, Owens situates the writer’s 1948 arrival in Paris within the here and now, reading, writing, and falling in love. In another unusual move, other than an excerpt fromNo Name in the Street, the film-maker also includes little of Baldwin’s writing.While Jimmy’s approach risks veering into the ahistorical, there’s a certain emotional resonance in observing Baldwin not as a larger-than-life figure, but as a young soul liberated by fresh desires and experiences.Jimmy is at the ICA, London, from 6 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsJames BaldwinreviewsShareReuse this content"

But which star made him realise he could sing?Rich PelleyMon 3 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTShareThe first song I fell in love withI was in elementary school and If I Had No Loot by Tony! Toni! Toné! was getting a lot of play on BET – Black EntertainmentTelevision. I love the vibe. It has a good bounce. I like things that make me move and this is one song you can’t help but move to.The first single I boughtI remember buying Don’t Be Cruel by Bobby Brown because everybody was jamming out to Prerogative. I bought it from Streetside Records in St Louis, Missouri, where you could listen to albums on headphones before you bought them.The song I do at karaokeI don’t like people judging my vocals, but I can spit hot fire on the rap to Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-a-Lot. It comes from the heart, because I actually do like big butts.The song I know every lyric toI know a lot of musicals. Ragtime is one of my favourites. The character Coalhouse Walker Jr sings Wheels of a Dream with the mother of his child. It’s a beautiful duet. When I saw it, I fell in love with it, and went out and immediately memorised the song.The song I secretly likeBoom, Boom, Boom, Boom!! by Vengaboys is the jam. I’d be worried Black people might be like: “What, you listen to that stuff?” Hell, yeah. That song slaps.The best song to get the party startedA lot of women will go to Prince. Prince is great, but Cupid by 112 has this hypnotic beat and a sweetness when you get the party started. You want to start it off sweet for the ladies, but they like to finish with a little bit of edge.The best song to have sex toOh! I thought that’s what you meant by “get the party started” … The best song to have sex to is Cupid by 112, and the best song to get an actual party started is Poison by Bell Biv DeVoe.The song that changed my lifeAs a kid I used to try to sing like Aaron Hall, who performs on Let’s Chill by the band Guy. His voice fell right where mine was. It was a lot better than trying to hit the falsetto high notes on Whitney Houston. Singing the hell out of that song made me realise that I could sing.The song that makes me cryFor Good from Wicked. And a song called A Part of Us from a musical called Once on This Island.The song I’d like played at my funeralHappy by Pharrell Williams. Hopefully it’ll be a celebration of a life well lived, and I’ll be in a better place, so I’ll go ahead and leave with a smile on my face.Paradise is streaming on Disney+now.Explore more on these topicsMusicHonest playlistTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wrapping up the three-day event is the crowning of Spain’s best young chef (often a duo) or “revelation”. This year’s seven candidates ranged from restaurants as far afield as Galicia in the north-west to Tenerife, Seville and Madrid. Most cook at intimate spaces with few tables, and offer ingredients and cooking techniques you would be hard-pushed to find on a British menu without breaking the bank.We start in Galicia, with the winners of thebest emerging chefs for 2025.Restaurante Simpar, Santiago de Compostela, GaliciaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Carlos Manzano AlonsoPilgrims have been walking to Santiago for over a millennium, and now gastronomes are following to discover this Michelin-star restaurant south of the monumental cathedral. Opened in summer 2023 by Axel Smyth, 33, a native of the city, with his Ecuadorian partner Claudia Merchán, 32, it offers a sophisticated take on Galicia’s pristine produce from the rugged coast to its verdant hills.Seven tables host a 14-course Simpar (€110) or 11-course Conocer (€85) menus, both starting with an inventive play on mushrooms and ending with a deconstructed Santiago tart.If you’re a tripe fan, indulge in Simpar’s award-winning stew with chickpeas and don’t miss the hamcroquetas– another prize winner. Other exceptional concoctions are rooster with chocolate and truffle, and scallops (the pilgrims’ symbol) in a meunière sauce. From the wine list, which is 70% Galician, Axel suggests Quinta da Muradella (€84) made from the white Treixadura grape.restaurantesimpar.comRestaurante Sisé, Lleida, CataloniaWe’re in Catalan territory at 27-year-old Ángel Esteve’s buoyant restaurant in Lleida, which capitalises on local suppliers in the Pyrenees, in Aragón and on the coast. Idiosyncratically named after his grandparents’ apartment, which is on the sixth (siséin Catalan) floor, it has eight tables facing an open kitchen. “We don’t want to hide what we do,” says Angel, much influenced by his time at the top Catalan restaurant El Celler de Can Roca.The menu reflects childhood food memories, as do his sister’s charming wall drawings, and specialises in charcoal grills and stews that change weekly. There is something earthy here, from a starter of artichoke, comté cheese and truffle (€16), to mains of barbecued lamb with calçot onions and romesco sauce (€21), or rice with quail and burrata cream (€28). Angel’s signature dessert is a chocolate tart rivalled by a calorie-light teaser of blackberries, goat cheese and galette (both €7). Unusual wines (€25-€150) are national and French.OnInstagramRestaurante Ausiàs, Pedreguer, AlicanteView image in fullscreenAs Felicia Guerra, the wife of Ausiàs Signes, puts it, they are “in a random town of 7,000 inhabitants”, so they hardly expected instant success. After meeting at Madrid’s Cordon Bleu school, they have welcomed customers from afar to their slick restaurant of just seven tables in Pedreguer, which is inland from the Costa Blanca fishing port of Dénia and an hour’s drive from Alicante. “It means we manage to fill the restaurant, so there’s no waste, which keeps our prices reasonable,” says Ausiàs, who heads the kitchen, leaving front of house to Felicia.They preserve traditional flavours, methods and ingredients – but with a twist. Their tasting menu (€84 for 12 courses or €62 for 10) is strong on reinvented seafood such as cuttlefish with cauliflower, yeast and bergamot, or baked grouper with roast cabbage and pickled seaweed. Carnivores despair not, as roast lamb also features. End with a luscious ode to Valencian oranges, an emulsion of orange, olive oil and saffron. The wine list (€29-€500) focuses on small Mediterranean wineries and rare champagnes.ausiasrestaurante.comRestaurante Arsa, Logroño, La RiojaView image in fullscreenIn the lively historical capital of La Rioja, this place is run by Beatriz Fernández and her husband Rodrigo. Since opening under a year ago, the quirkily decorated restaurant of 22 tables hasn’t looked back.An appetiser of chilled orange soup with bluefin tuna tartare (€6) might continue with a starter of wild boar stew with oloroso sherry (€16) or scallops in broth with cauliflower (€18). Mains include turbot with seaweed, semi-dried tomato and black olives (€24) and wood pigeon smoked with vine stalk alongside roasted chestnuts and lemon in brine (€26). Desserts range from a pomegranate and rose sorbet (€8) to pumpkin cake with olive oil and thyme ice-cream (€8). True gourmets should order the 12-course tasting menu (€70) backed up by inexpensive wines and sherries from Andalucía and La Rioja. For an unusual tipple, Rodrigo recommends a Riojan white, Eraso Azala (€25) – “not quite orange, more dark golden” – made from grapes in their skin.arsarestaurante.esskip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Thanks to the nearby catalysts of Madrid Rio, a new urban park, and the Matadero contemporary arts centre, this southern neighbourhood has been energised. So, just over a year ago, Lucia took over the restaurant space of her now retired father.With only five tables, its spacious interior of natural woods and potted olive trees exudes calm, a quality reflected in her meticulous cooking and plating. The seven-course tasting menu (€87) remains seasonal, though vegetables dominate and Lucia injects a fine line between savoury and sweet. Sourced from small producers, some ingredients hail from the Basque Country where Lucia worked near San Sebastián. The name itself, Lur, is Basque for “land”.restaurantelur.esRestaurante Moral, SantaCruz de TenerifeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edu GorostizaIn the centre of sunny Santa Cruz, the capital of Tenerife, and the ferry gateway to other islands, is Restaurante Moral – a name referring to the mulberry tree and to the restaurant’s ethics. It was opened last summer by Canarian couple Icíar and Juan Carlos Pérez-Alcalde, who met working at Poemas by Hermanos Padrón, La Palma’s top restaurant. Moral brings inspired cuisine to locals and visitors in the serene setting of a converted mansion with only six tables.Island produce dominates, whether in the five-course tasting menu (€50) or à la carte choices. Here you have a starter of aubergine with eel, yoghurt and mushrooms (€19), main courses of duck in an orange sauce spiked with dried fruits (€27) or skate with mussel and parsley sauce (€25). Wash down a dessert of roast beetroot, passion fruit and flowers (€7) with a Tenerife wine recommended by Juan Carlos – a light, aromatic Finca Vegas made from the white Listán grape (€26).OnInstagramRestaurante Leartá, SevilleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mateo LipperaHidden down a side street south of the burgeoning Alameda, Leartá conjures up ambitious dishes that fuse Andalucían tradition with technique. At the helm is Manu Lachica, 30, a true Sevillano, and his wife, Rita Llanes, a 23-year-old Catalan. After working together in Galicia, they opened Leartá less than a year ago.“We want people to feel at home as well as showcase Seville’s trades such as hand-painted tiles and handmade furniture,” says Manu.With an open kitchen, the restaurant seats 12 and offers 10 complex dishes (€72). Each plays with textures and temperatures. Wild boar comes with burrata, a chilled pumpkin broth includes salted kaki fruit and sea urchin cream, while a sweet edge comes in celery macerated in herbal syrup with butter from the yeast of wine barrels.Teetotallers can revel in delicious kombuchas (€6) infused with fruits such as limequats, ginger and mint. Wines (€35-€147), including sherries, are from emerging Andalucían vintners as well as national and international labels.leartasevilla.comExplore more on these topicsSpain holidaysSpanish food and drinkRestaurants (Travel)Food and drinkEurope holidaysFoodRestaurants (Food)featuresShareReuse this content"

Your first task is to decide on their replacements, and for that you have a few options. “I useaquafabaand whisk it with apple cider vinegar, rapeseed oil, dijon mustard, unsweetened soya milk and water,” she says. She then combines plain flour, chickpea flour, salt and turmeric (“for a bit of colour”), and whisks that into the wet mix to make a batter.Marc Joseph, ofE3 Vegan, meanwhile, prefers a combination of soya milk, baking powder and self-raising flour: “I’ve tried all sorts of things,” he says, “and baking powder gives the best results.” Once mixed with the flour and popped into a really hot oven, “they rise quickly like a cake at the start, so, by the time they’re cooked, you have really crisp edges”. That’s also Gaz Oakley’s preferred route. For 12 yorkshire puddings, the author ofPlant to Plate, published in May, combines 260g self-raising flour, one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of salt. “Add 480ml soya milk, whisk until smooth, then pour into a jug.” Just like the OG, vegan yorkies also benefit from a rest, Joseph says: “Make the batter at least 30 minutes before you want to use it.”On to the baking vessel, for which Davis favours a metal muffin tin: “This is thereallyimportant part,” she says, “otherwise your yorkshire puddings are going to come out like pancakes!” Both Oakley and Davis pour oil into each hole of the tin (about two teaspoons in total of vegetable oil for Oakley and 3-4mm rapeseed oil per hole for Davis), then whack it in a hot oven (210C-220C) until smoking. “As soon as you open the oven door, quickly take out the pan and pour in the batter,” Davis says. “Grab a spoon and make a small indent in the top of each yorkshire, so it has that natural collapse.” Oakley bakes his batter for 16 minutes “until golden brown and nicely risen”, Davis gives it about 30 minutes and Joseph opts for 45-50 minutes.Shaun Rankin, chef/patron ofShaun Rankin at Grantley Hallin North Yorkshire, has another tip: “Make a little well in the centre of the mix with an oiled spoon halfway through the cooking,” he says. “This allows the edges to rise further.”Oakley serves his yorkshires right away, but Davis recommends giving them a rest: “Vegan ones have more of a gooey texture than those made with egg, so you need to let them cool for at least 30 minutes on a rack,” she says. The proof, of course, is in the pudding, and Joseph ensures that his are “even better” by pouring onion gravy into the well just before serving. And as we all know,everythingis better with gravy.Got a culinary dilemma?

It is, however, an equally delicious way to feast on fatty foods before Lent, and a fun kitchen project at any time of year, not least because it’s never a bad idea to have a freezer full of pancakes.A popular savoury snack throughout China and Taiwan,cong you bingare often served as awinter breakfastin the north of the country, Ken Hom reports. Eileen Yin-Fei Lorepeatsthe widely held belief that “no one but a chef from Shanghai should even attempt to cook” them, though that doesn’t seem to have put off the rest of the Chinese-speaking world: food writerGrace Youngsays she learned to make them from her Hong Kong-born mother. If you’d like to throw caution to the wind, too, here’s how to go about it.The doughTexture is well nigh everything when it comes to these simple flour-and-water pancakes, and I’d be hard pushed to put it better than chef and author Hannah Che, who, on her blog The Plant-Based Wok,describesthem as “flaky with a crisp-thin,酥 suexterior that crackles when you bite into it, with sheet upon sheet of satiny, translucent layers inside.”View image in fullscreenKen Hom’s quick-fried scallion pancakes. All thumbnails direct from Felicity Cloake’s kitchen.That flaky texture is, as in pastry, created by building up layers of dough to be forced apart by the steam produced in the cooking process, though Hom’s more straightforward northern recipe in his book Vegetarian Cookery omits this step for a result that, he concedes, is “slightly doughy and heavy”, but pretty tasty nonetheless. Hom does, however, in common with many of the other recipes I try, deploy a technique known astang, or cooked dough – only chef and influencer Liz Miumakes no mention of it. This uses hot rather than room-temperature water to scald the gluten proteins in the flour, which creates a soft, pliable, obedient dough that has none of the usual rebellious stretch and spring, and is therefore far easier to roll out than, say, pizza or other bread doughs. In my book, that’s a definite boon; though the deftly expert Miumakes the process look easy, I struggle to keep a handle on her dough, especially after 10 minutes of energetic kneading.(We’re not looking to develop gluten here, so I don’t really see the point of this step, which is also called for by Yin-Fei Lo’s Mastering the Art of Chinese Cooking Jeremy Pang of London’s School of Wokcautions: “Do not knead the dough for too long, we want it to stay quite soft”. You do, however, need to rest the dough. Like Pang and Che, I find that a longer rest gives a more reliably crisp but flaky texture, allowing the flour to absorb the liquid and the gluten to relax fully, though 30 minutes will do, if that’s all you can spare.)For the most part, scallion pancake dough is very plain – all the flavour comes from the filling – but Yin-Fei Lo includes melted lard in hers, which she describes as “the traditional shortening”, in place of the separate, vegetable oil-based filling favoured by the others. Leaving aside my complete failure to find anyone in London who sells lard that even lists a country of origin, let alone makes any claims for the welfare of the pigs concerned (a rant for another day), I find the soft, shattering texture that the fat gives the dough less pleasurable than the slightly chewier alternatives; once fried, they’re just too rich for my taste.The rollingHom just portions out the rested dough, kneads in the flavouring, rolls them out and fries, but the other recipes all call for a more involved layering method. Che helpfully condenses the different techniques she’s come across on Mandarin-language internet into six principal styles, from simply rolling the stretched dough into a sausage and curling this into spirals (as Miu also does) to something called “accordion folds”, to Pang’s double snail coil. Serious Eats’ J Kenji López-Alt goes for a double roll, which, he estimates, provides “a full 25 layers of scallion-packed, pastry delight” (though, if I read correctly, Yin-Fei Lo goes one step further with a triple roll). I find what Che terms “the scroll” the easiest to master for the best, flakiest results, but it’s worth checking out her hard work on the other options.View image in fullscreenJ Kenji López-Alt’s scallion pancake is ‘a full 25 layers of scallion-packed, pastry delight’.Miu notes that “the secret to great scallion pancakes is getting that dough super-thin”, and to make that task easier, I favour a lightly floured surface rather than a greased one, on which the dough tends to slip around unhelpfully. The thinner the pancakes, the harder they are to flip in the pan, but the easier they are to cook; Che’s 0.6cm versions cook more evenly than Pang’s 2cm numbers (more like the thicker, crunchier versions common in Shanghai than the floppier northern variety), which remain resolutely slightly doughy in the middle; not unpleasantly so, but not the result I’m after here.The fillingAs the name suggests, scallion pancakes are flavoured with scallions,knownas spring onions in the UK, finely sliced to minimise the number of chunks that break through when they’re rolled out. You can just incorporate them in the dough raw with a dash of sesame oil, as Hom and López-Alt suggest, but it’s easier, and more flavourful, to make a paste (you su) with flour and hot fat, as Miu and Pang do. As Che observes, this “means oil won’t leak out when you roll the dough; it leaves your countertop a lot cleaner, and creates distinct layers in the scallion pancakes”.View image in fullscreen‘No one but a chef from Shanghai should even attempt to cook’ Eileen Yin-Fei Lo’s scallion pancakes.Pouring hot oil on to the filling also helps to bring out the flavour of the onions, and any other seasonings you might fancy – for Miu, that means five-spice, sugar, sesame seeds and MSG, and for Pang and Che five-spice or Sichuan peppercorns; chilli flakes would also work well. Pang infuses the oil with spring onion before use, and Yin-Fei Lo suggests a similar spring onion oil for cooking, but I find to my surprise that both options leave things overwhelmingly oniony, almost like a cheap Cornish pasty – again, I think I’d prefer to keep the profile fairly plain, with the exception of a light sprinkle of Che’s zingy, slightly lemony, ground Sichuan peppercorns.The cookingView image in fullscreenJeremy Pang’s scallion pancakes are ‘more like the thicker, crunchier versions common in Shanghai’.Hom cooks his pancakes in a lightly oiled pan over a low heat until crisp, Yin-Fei Lo heats the pan over a high heat for 30 seconds, then adds a generous amount of oil and waits for it to start smoking before adding the pancake, at which point it bubbles up enthusiastically, a bit like an oily poppadom. It’s a delicate balance, as frying always is: too low a heat, and the pancake soaks up all the oil before the outside crisps and browns; too high, and the outside burns and dries out before the thing is cooked through (see also rolling them as thinly as possible). Pang and Che’s suggestion of covering the pan initially is a clever one, because it helps to kickstart the cooking process before any crisping can occur.The finishing touchesMiu covers her pancakes with sesame seeds, chopped coriander and a delicious-looking hoisin sesame drizzle, and López-Alt mixes up a very tasty black vinegar dipping sauce that I’d highly recommend. My current favourite topping, however, is a fried egg and a drizzle of chilli crisp.View image in fullscreen‘Get them super-thin’: Liz Miu’s scallion pancakes.Note that these pancakes freeze brilliantly: make them up to the rolling-out stage, then layer them up between squares of greaseproof paper.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Seven years ago, I walked along Oxford Street in London with the baker and writerHenrietta Inman. I can’t remember where we’d been in order to be illuminated by Foot Locker and Muji at midnight, but I do remember we talked about spelt flour. Or, rather, Henrietta did, describing its flavour as soft and nutty, and all as part of our wider conversation about her decision to leave the subterranean pastry kitchen of a five-star London hotel and return home to Dorset, where she adapted her knowledge and skill to different ingredients, resulting in her bookThe Natural Baker.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Back then, I knew a bit about spelt’s importance in ancient cooking (by various civilisations, including the Romans, who called it the marching grain), but I was confused as to what spelt actually was, which wasn’t helped by the translations:spelta, farro spelta,emmer, einkorn, dinkel wheat. While we crossed Regent Street and passed the many windows of John Lewis, Henrietta explained that spelt was a grass related to wheat and a cousin to farro; she also encouraged me to think less about names and more about flavour, and how it could work in pastry and biscuits. Also to try emmer, einkorn, rye and barley flour. It would take me seven years to heed her advice.During those years, I would also have the chance to travel with Henrietta, who has since run a bakery within theWakelynsorganic agroforestry hub in Suffolk, and is about to open another (her own) as part ofHodmedods(also in Suffolk). Along with Italian journalist Laura Lazzaroni, we visited a biodynamic farm inLe Marchein eastern Italy calledCoste del Sole, where we tasted just-milled farro dicocco flour, which was so fragrant and edible that I thought it contained hazelnuts. It was this same trip that also made me realise how little I had considered the flavour of flour.Henrietta was right: spelt flour is soft and nutty, with notes of acidity and natural sweetness, which means recipes such as these hazelnut shortbreads (inspired by Henrietta’s malty biscuits, Laura’s shortbread and my own need for hazelnuts) require less sugar, alongside plenty of butter. And, because they contain butter, it is crucial that the dough is well chilled (a couple of hours, to be safe), and even then the biscuits will spread slightly.It’s a good idea to lift the biscuits from the hot tray on to a rack to cool as soon as possible after they are baked, but do so very carefully – they are fragile until cold. It is also a good idea to have these biscuits with a hot drink – tea, milky coffee, hot chocolate – because warmth wakes three things: the oil in the nuts, the butter and – I think of Henrietta as I write this – the flavour of the flour.Hazelnut, spelt and butter biscuitsMakes12-14120gspelt, wholegrain or plain flour160gtoasted hazelnuts, or almonds or walnuts,ground to a fine, sandy flour with the odd chunkA pinch of salt150g cold butter, cut into small cubes90gmuscovado sugar, or soft brown sugar1 egg yolkWorking in a bowl, mix the flour with 100g of the ground nuts (save the rest for later) and the salt. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles fat breadcrumbs, then add the sugar and egg yolk, and bring everything into a ball.Try this recipe and many more of Rachel’s ideas on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Form the dough into a log with a diameter of 5-6cm – it will be slightly sticky, but this is good, because the next step is to roll it in the reserved nut mix. Wrap the nut-covered log in baking paper and refrigerate until completely chilled – so for at least a couple of hours.Heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½ and line a baking tray with paper. Using a sharp knife, cut the log into 1cm-thick rounds, then space them out well on the tray – the biscuits will spread by about 1cm. Keeping a close eye on them, bake the biscuits for 12-14 minutes, until they are light gold and just firm to the touch. Lift carefully on to a wire rack and leave to cool completely.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkNuts and seedsBiscuitsBakingSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

Drain and place the slices in a pan with the honey. Cook over a low heat for 5 minutes. Set aside.In a large bowl, beat together the butter, sugar and zest of the 3 remaining lemons until pale and fluffy. In a separate bowl, loosely beat the eggs. Slowly trickle the eggs into the butter and sugar mixture, beating continuously. Sieve over the flour and fold into the beaten butter. Add the milk until the batter is a dropping consistency.Pour the syrupy lemons into the prepared pudding basin, then spoon over the batter.Cut a large square of greaseproof paper and tin foil, making sure they overlap the edges of the basin by at least 4cm. Place the foil on the table and top with the sheet of baking paper, then fold a 2½cm pleat into the centre. Place on top of the basin, greaseproof-paper-side down, with the pleat across the middle and fasten tightly with a rubber band or string.Half fill a large, deep pan with water and place an upturned heatproof plate in the bottom. Place the pan on the stove and, when the water is simmering, lower the wrapped pudding on to the centre of the plate. The water should reach the middle of the pudding basin.Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and steam the pudding on a medium heat for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a skewer poked into the centre comes out clean. Check on it as it cooks, topping up the water if need be. If you use the skewer test and it’s not quite ready, make sure you reseal the top, covering the hole before continuing to cook; otherwise the sponge will become soggy from the steam.Remove the pudding carefully from the pot and leave to stand for 10 minutes before unwrapping and turning out on to a warmed plate.

Put it on some pastry, scrunch up the edges, you’re good to goThe 20 best dessert recipes – in fullRavneet GillMon 3 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTShareIalways look forward to forced rhubarb season. One of my favourite ever trips was to visitRhubarb Robert, a farmer in Yorkshire, who showed me how they grow and force rhubarb into the wonderful, neon-pink stuff that we use in restaurants at this time of year. The sheds are lit with candles and you can actually hear the rhubarb popping as it grows. Fascinating. This galette uses double cream in the dough, which helps to bring it together and bake into a crumbly pastry.Serves 4rhubarb200glight brown sugar60glemonzest of 1egg1, beatenFor the pastrywholemeal flour120gsalta pinchunsalted butter50g, cold, cubeddouble cream50mlcaster sugar10gFor the pastry, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and, using your fingertips, rub it into the flour until the mixture resembles very fine breadcrumbs.Pour in the cream and caster sugar, and bring the mixture together to make a loose dough (it won’t be really wet – it should be almost slightly dry, but that’s a good thing). Tip out the dough on to a work surface and use your hands to work it into a disc. Wrap tightly in greaseproof paper or clingfilm, and chill for at least 4 hours.Cut the rhubarb into 3-4cm pieces and toss with the brown sugar and lemon zest.Heat the oven to 165C fan/gas mark 4½. Roll out the pastry into a 25cm-diameter circle and place on a greased and lined oven tray. Pile the rhubarb up in the middle, leaving a 5cm border all around the edge, then fold the edges up over the sides of the rhubarb, to create a ridge. Brush all the exposed pastry with the beaten egg.Bake for 45 minutes, until the edges are golden and the rhubarb is soft to the touch, then remove and leave to cool before serving with creme fraiche or pouring cream.Ravneet Gill is a chef and broadcaster.

There is no time of any day, in fact, when a little pick-me-up is not welcome.For me the key is the quantity of alcohol. Like a good trifle, it is this boozy kick that elevates the childhood nostalgia of a custardy cream-and-cake combo into something a little more adult and refined.I like to make mine in a big dish or trifle bowl for serving by the generous scoopful, rather than in individual portions. A traditional tiramisu has only two layers of biscuit, but you can scale this recipe up quite easily, or use a tall but narrow vessel to create more layers.Feeds 4 greedy people, or 6 asceticseggs3, separatedcastersugar100gmascarpone500gstrong black espresso coffee200mlmarsala80mlbrandy1½ tbspsavoiardi biscuits (ladyfingers)20-24bitter cocoa powder5 tbsp, for dredgingPlace the egg yolks and the sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk with an electric beater (or in a stand mixer) until they become thick, pale and mousse-like.Mix in the mascarpone by hand, folding it in until completely incorporated.In a small bowl, mix the coffee with the marsala and brandy.Whisk the egg whites until smooth, creamy peaks are formed, but not so stiff that they become dry. Fold into the mascarpone mixture, incorporating them gently so as not to lose too much air.Dunk the savoiardi briefly into the coffee mixture, making sure they are fully immersed, and arrange half of them on the base of a serving bowl. The idea is not to have them either sopping or still crisp, but somewhere in between. I dip, hold for a second, turn and hold for another second, then remove. It pays to be diligent, as no one wants a tiramisu swimming in liquid.Scoop half of the mascarpone mixture over the biscuit layer. Spread out evenly. Repeat the soaked-savoiardi layer and finish with a second mascarpone layer on top of this. Dredge well with bitter cocoa powder and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour or two. If you like, you can add more cocoa powder just before serving, but I like it when it has slightly melted into the cream.FromBitter Honeyby Letitia Clark (Hardie Grant, £28)Explore more on these topicsDessertObserver Food Monthly's 20 best recipesFoodVegetarian food and drinkItalian food and drinkCoffeerecipesShareReuse this content"

Add the flour and stir gently until a mass forms, then beat until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat on to a trivet. Beat the dough for a minute or so until the steam subsides.Crack the eggs into another bowl and whisk together lightly. When the dough in the pan is tepid, add in a little egg and beat well until thoroughly mixed in. Continue thus until all the egg is incorporated and the dough is made.Scrape the dough into a tub for which you have a lid, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This just makes spooning or piping the dough that bit easier.When sufficiently chilled, spoon little rounds on to your prepared baking tray, a few centimetres apart so they may puff well. Put the tray in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 160C fan/gas mark 4 and bake for a further 15-20 minutes. The profiteroles should be golden brown all over and as light as air. When cooked, remove from the oven and set aside to cool.To make the custard filling, pour the milk into a pan, then cut the vanilla pod down the middle and scrape out the seeds into the milk. Bring this to a simmer over a gentle heat.In another bowl, with an electric beater, mix the egg yolks and sugar together until pale and voluminous. Reduce the speed of the beater and add in the flours. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk, and pour the latter in a gentle, steady stream into the egg mixture, stirring all the while. Pour it all back into the pan and return to the heat, stirring until the custard thickens. Lower the heat and beat for a minute until the custard is smooth. Remove from the heat and tip into a bowl. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and pierce lightly all over to allow steam to escape. When cooled, put in the fridge.In another bowl, whip the double cream, then fold into the cold custard until smooth. Return to the fridge while you prepare the rest.For the chocolate sauce, break the chocolate into small pieces. Put the cream in a pan and heat until simmering, then tip in the chocolate and whisk until smooth. Set it aside, keeping it warm so it doesn’t harden.To assemble, split each profiterole and fill with a spoonful of custard and a small scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Put the lids atop the profiteroles. Heap them in a bowl or on a large serving plate, spoon all over with the warm chocolate sauce and serve swiftly.Jeremy Lee is chef/co-owner ofQuo Vadis, London W1, and author ofCooking: Simply and Well, for One or Many(HarperCollins, £30)Explore more on these topicsDessertObserver Food Monthly's 20 best recipesFoodBakingPastryChocolateVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
