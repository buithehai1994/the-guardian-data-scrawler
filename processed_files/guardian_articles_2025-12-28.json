He was already a figure of some controversy, as would become a lifelong habit, among the younger pupils and staff at Dulwich college in south-east London.“I remember it was either in a particular English lesson or a particular form period that his name came up,” said Chloë Deakin, then a young English teacher, of a discussion with a class of 11- and 12-year-olds. “There was something about bullying, and he was being referred to, quite specifically, as a bully. And I thought: ‘Who is this boy?’”Nazi salutes and racism: the allegations about Nigel Farage’s school days – podcastRead moreDeakin conferred with colleagues in the staff room who corroborated accounts of harassment of fellow pupils and of Farage’s apparent fascination with the far right, including claims that he had been “goose-stepping” on combined cadet force marches.“But initially I had heard it from boys,” she said. “I was shocked to hear that this Dulwich boy was apparently getting away with this kind of behaviour, at cadet camp etc, and I thought: ‘This is seriously out of order. It’s horrible.’”Despite the chatter in the playground and staffroom, Farage was put on a draft list of prefects by the headteacher, David Emms, and his deputy, Terry Walsh. There was a meeting where strong views were aired, though Emms and Walsh were of the opinion that Farage was naughty, rather than being a malevolent racist.“So when I heard that Farage’s name was on the finalised prefect list, I was appalled and that was why I wrote independently to Emms, because I felt strongly about it – I still do,” Deakin recalled.View image in fullscreenA Dulwich college magazine, the Alleynian, shows members of the combined cadet force including a boy believed to be Nigel Farage seated on the ground (centre, reaching towards his feet).Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianDeakin’s letter of June 1981,first revealed by the Channel 4 journalist Michael Crick in a report in 2013, is uncompromising. She has never spoken before of this episode with the letter – written after Farage’s 17th birthday – emerging only as a result of her having given a copy of it to a senior teacher at the time, as was the practice at the school.She wrote: “You will recall that at the recent and lengthy meeting about the selection of prefects, the remark by a colleague that Farage was a ‘fascist but that was no reason why he would not make a good prefect’ invoked considerable reaction from members of the [staff] common room.“Another colleague, who teaches the boy, described his publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views, and he cited a particular incident in which Farage was so offensive to a boy in his set that he had to be removed from his lesson …“Yet another colleague described how, at a [combined cadet force] camp organised by the college, Farage and others had marched through a quiet Sussex village very late at night shouting Hitler Youth songs; and when it was suggested by a master that boys who expressed such views ‘don’t really mean them’, the college chaplain himself commented that, on the contrary, in his experience views of that kind expressed by boys of that age are deep-seated and are meant.”The letter concluded: “You will appreciate that I regard this as a very serious matter. I have often heard you tell our senior boys that they are the nation’s future leaders. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that these leaders are enlightened and compassionate.”View image in fullscreenThe Guardian has spoken to more than 30 contemporaries of Farage at Dulwich college who have given testimony of receiving or witnessing racist or antisemitic abuse from him.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesFresh and detailed allegationsabout Farage’s teenage past, contained in a series of reports by the Guardian in recent weeks, have caused what has been described as the greatest crisis in the Reform leader’s political career, in large part because of the way he has responded.‘Deeply shocking’: Nigel Farage faces fresh claims of racism and antisemitism at schoolRead moreFarage’s lawyer initially wholly denied any racist or antisemitic behaviour, and threatened to sue the Guardian. Farage then conceded in an interview with the BBC’s political editor in Wales that some thingssaid in “banter”more than four decades ago might be construed differently today, but denied targeting anyone “directly”or with “intent” to hurt.The Guardian has now spoken tomore than 30 school contemporaries of Faragewho have given testimony of being on the wrong end of racist or antisemitic abuse or witnessing it at the school.Farage’s behaviour is said to have continued from age 13 to 18, after which he went on to a career in the City. But despite loud calls for a show of contrition and understanding of the hurt he is alleged to have inflicted, includingthrough an open letter from 26 of his school contemporaries, he is yet to apologise.Deakin, now 74, does not recall who had told her that Farage had sung Hitler Youth songs, for which no evidence has subsequently emerged, although the Guardian has heard testimony that he was involved in singing songs about gassing Jews and other minority ethnic people.‘He used to say things like ‘Hitler was right’’: Farage faces more allegations of racist behaviour at schoolRead moreShe was not personally acquainted with Farage and did not see or hear his alleged racism and antisemitism, she said. But her memories of boys’ complaints of bullying, the subsequent testimony of the staff, the contemporaneous letter – written by her decades before Farage gained public prominence – and the sheer weight of credible allegations in recent weeks should leave no room for doubt for the public, she said.“Of course Farage directly abused pupils,” Deakin said. “His was the only name I recall boys mentioning to me.”For all her efforts at the time, her protests to the headteacher did not dissuade him from making Farage a prefect. It was part of the reason why she decided to leave the school, later becoming a civil servant in the Department for Education, she said.“Emms [the headteacher] called me in: he was quite a forbidding figure for me as a young teacher,” she said. “And he was very pleasant and polite, but nothing came of it; he had made his decision. Soon after that I started thinking, I don’t want to stay here. This is not the place where I’m going to make my future.”Former Dulwich pupil says Farage told him: ‘That’s the way back to Africa’Read moreIn Crick’s broadcast in 2013, the deputy headteacher, Walsh, suggested Deakin might have been among a “leftist” group in the teachers’ common room. Faragehas claimedthat those making accusations were doing so as part of a political plot to undermine him.Deakin said: “I was not then and never have been a member of a political party – indeed I have, over the years, voted differently in local and in general elections. Nor, of course, did any of us anticipate that Farage would subsequently become a politician: at that time he appeared to be focused on a City career.“My motive in writing to Emms was neither political nor anti-college but was, rather, driven by my disgust at the accounts I had heard of Farage’s racist and neo-fascist views and behaviours: that he was a bully, that his rightwing views were extreme, that he revelled in the fact that his initials were the same as those of the National Front, that he imitated neo-Nazi singing and marching, etc.“I had previously taught in a large, culturally diverse comprehensive school in Brent, with many Jewish colleagues and other staff of colour. It would have been unthinkable for such behaviours to have been tolerated there, or to have gone unpunished.”Among those who have spoken of their disappointment in recent weeks at Farage’s approach to the claims have been 11 Holocaust survivors who have been concerned by attempts to dismiss Farage’s behaviour as banter.Deakin said she had been similarly appalled by what she believed was a lack of a regard for telling the truth.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage is yet to apologise for his behaviour during his schooldays.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“Of course it is absolutely normal for teenagers and students to debate hotly about politics, religion and other significant issues,” she said. “But Farage’s extremist views and behaviours appeared to be singular and to go well beyond any normal discussion of party politics, freedom of speech, or even teenage ‘high jinks’ … Farage’s unwillingness to offer a straightforward apology to those men affected by his past behaviours is also both puzzling and concerning.”Reform did not respond to a request for comment. A new letter written by Chloë Deakin to the Guardian can be found below:Once upon a time – in June 1981 – I wrote a letter to the thenmaster of Dulwich College, David Emms, about a teenage pupil named Nigel Farage.My letter followed a heated meeting between Emms and my Common Room [teaching staff] colleagues, during which a number of us had objected to Emms’ inclusion of Farage in a list of nominations for new prefects.I was a young English teacher, in my late twenties, at the time. I neither taught Farage nor knew him personally, but I had been hearing about him from colleagues and from boys I taught.In his book about Farage, Michael Crick quotes Emms describing Farage, retrospectively, as having been a“naughty boy” who had“got up the noses” of staff because of his“chirpiness and cheekiness”. But in 1981 we had taken a more serious view of Farage’s reputation and behaviour, arguing that it was inappropriate for him to be rewarded and that he was not a suitable role model for other pupils. I was therefore dismayed when I learnt that Emms intended to override the meeting and proceed with Farage’s appointment.I wrote a personal letter to Emms, setting out in detail why I disagreed. We had a cordial meeting to discuss the matter, but he would not be swayed from his decision. Farage’s appointment went ahead and I imagined that my letter had been consigned to Emms’ waste paper basket.Regarding my motivation for writing the letter, it was not the case (as suggested by a pastdeputymaster, Terry Walsh in Channel 4’s programme in 2013) that I objected to Farage’s appointment because I was part of some Common Room“leftist” element. I was not then and never have been a member of a political party (indeed I have, over the years, voted differently in local and ingeneralelections). Nor, of course, did any of us anticipate that Farage would subsequently become a politician: at that time he appeared to be focused on a City career.Nor was it the case (as suggested by a former colleague, the Rev Neil Fairlamb [in the Guardian]), that my letter was“motivated largely” by my“dislike of the college’s culture”. (Fairlamb also described Farage as“cheeky and charming and you could never quite believe him”.)Dulwich College offered wonderful facilities and opportunities to its pupils (in painful contrast to my previous school) including, at that time, many boys still on theassistedplaces scheme, whose families would not otherwise have been able to afford to educate them there.I participated fully in College life and enjoyed teaching such lively, intelligent and talented pupils, whom I remember with affection. (There were touching moments too: the boys were unused to women staff – three of the four of us were recently appointed – and I was occasionally asked out by senior boys, unsure of our status; while younger boys, when raising their hands in class, often called me“Sir” or occasionally“Mum” instead of“Miss”, to the great amusement of their peers.)There was a house system for sports and other competitions; a form system, which dealt mainly with administrative procedures; and a sanatorium, for physical health issues: but there was neither a pastoral system nor counselling support available to pupils, such as those in private and public sector schools today. So it is perhaps unsurprising that pupils – the majority of whom were day boys – would have kept their problems to themselves.My motive in writing to Emms was neither political nor anti-College but was, rather, driven by my disgust at the accounts I had heard of Farage’s racist and neo-fascist views and behaviours: that he was a bully; that his rightwing views were extreme; that he revelled in the fact that his initials were the same as those of the National Front; that he imitated neo-Nazi singing and marching, etc.I had previously taught in a large, culturally-diverse comprehensive school in Brent, with many Jewish colleagues and other staff of colour. It would have been unthinkable for such behaviours to have been tolerated there, or to have gone unpunished.Of course it is absolutely normal for teenagers and students to debate hotly about politics, religion and other significant issues: but Farage’s extremist views and behaviours appeared to be singular and to go well beyond any normal discussion of party politics, freedom of speech, or even teenage“high jinks”. So it concerned and disillusioned me that Emms, Walsh – and some other members of the Common Room – seemed to take an indulgent and, I thought, somewhat naive attitude towards Farage’s reputation. (No doubt this was a sign of the times: I recall Emms, expressing appreciation for something I had done, saying“Thank you Chloë, that’s very white of you.” I remember feeling puzzled, never having heard this expression before. Many yearslater I realised, with distaste, what it meant.)Soon afterwards I decided to leave the College, to pursue my career in the public sector. Over time, I forgot about the letter and must have destroyed my own copy at some point: so I was surprised when Michael Crick contacted me in 2013, having seen a copy of it, asking me to participate in Channel 4’s programme about Farage. (At first I did not recall the letter, until I saw the redacted version online and remembered my feelings about the original sequence of events.) However, my work role at that time prohibited me from commenting on, or engaging in, political debate, so I had to decline. The main thrust of criticism of Farage in that programme focused again on his generalised racist and neo-fascist views and behaviours.So I was distressed to read in recent weeks accounts by many former pupils – now middle-aged men – of Farage’s targeted racist and antisemitic bullying of individuals, both before and after he was appointed a prefect. It seemed that Farage’s behaviour was much worse than I had been aware in 1981. Multiple, consistent accounts described him generally acting alone, singling out and pursuing specific pupils repeatedly, solely because they were Jews, or because of their skin colour.[The Reform deputy leader] Richard Tice hasreferred to these accounts as“made-up twaddle”. Farage himself has offered various explanations of events, including that whatever he might have said at the time was merely“banter”. There have also been allegations of an orchestrated intention to“smear” the Reform party, because of its elevated position in recent polls.I write this letter, as I wrote my original letter to Emms, of my own free will. I have not been approached by the Guardian, nor by any former Dulwich pupil, to support their points of view. I am not receiving any payment for it. I write it simply because, in the light of having worked for nearly fifty years in education and mental health, I regard these pupils’ accounts to be painfully authentic and sadly consistent with Farage’s previously recorded views and behaviours whilst a pupil at Dulwich College.I agree with the many online comments by people unconnected with the College confirming that, across the years, you never forget the names, faces, words or actions of individuals who have bullied you.Anyone who has worked with people who have been deliberately targeted and demeaned – by bullying or assault, for instance – knows that the legacies of such experiences are shame and secrecy (the shame that belongs to the perpetrator is felt by the victim).It has taken time and courage for these men to speak out – courage which has, however, been met with derision and dismissal by Farage, Reform and some media commentators, who have described Farage’s words as playground“banter” and former pupils’ words as politically-motivated“smears”.The word“banter” generally carries the sense of a playful, teasing or good-humoured exchange: but there was nothing playful, teasing, good-humourednor reciprocal, about Farage’s attacks, as reported by former pupils who suffered them.Similarly, the word“smear” carries the sense of a false accusation or slander, intended to harm a reputation: but there was nothing false about the reports relating to Farage that I recorded in 1981. Recent reports are consistent with those.Meanwhile, Farage himself has claimed (BBC, 24November 2025) that he“never directly racially abused anybody … by taking it out on an individual on the basis of who they are or what they are” and that he would“never, ever do it [ie use racial abuse] in a hurtful or insulting way”.His statement is inconsistent with the multiple accounts of his targeted behaviour; and I am at a loss to understand how racial abuse could be used in any way that was not hurtful or insulting. (In the same interview, Farage also cited free speech –“Sometimes you say things that people don’t like” – as a defence.“Free speech” seems to have become, for some, a justification for saying anything to, or about, anyone.)But where does all that leave us now? Does any of it matter? Some commentators argue that Farage’s schooldays are irrelevant now: that reports about them were unfounded, or too long ago, or that we should be focusing on larger, current, pressing issues.But there seems to be a curious link between Farage’s obsessive teenage preoccupation with targeting, demeaning and frightening only those fellow pupils who were identifiable in ways that accorded with his far-right views – ie by their Jewishness or their skin colour (not, for example, ginger hair or lack of sports prowess) – and how this has burgeoned into his adult preoccupation with immigration/deportation as the main plank of his political campaign.Farage’s unwillingness to offer a straightforward apology to those men affected by his past behaviours is also both puzzling and concerning. Theprimeminister, theattorneygeneral, a group of Holocaustsurvivors and now, a group of former Dulwich pupils and staff – to which I add my own name here – have all called upon him to do so: but there is no evidence to date of any regret or change of view on his part.On the basis of recent polls there seems a strong possibility that Reform could win the nextgeneral election and that Farage would be appointedprimeminister. Anyone engaged in public life is required to adhere to the sevenNolan Principles–selflessness;integrity;objectivity;accountability;openness;honesty; andleadership. We need Farage to demonstrate his active commitment to all theseprinciples now, if we are to have any confidence in his future leadership.Some commentators have argued that pressing current issues (such as ensuring that Jews and others can live safely in our communities) are more important than the events of Farage’s school days, some forty-odd years ago. Of course current issues do need addressing urgently. But we should also remember that the small seeds of large issues find space to grow and flourish wherever prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and persecution are permitted to go unchallenged.

French headline-writers loved calling the world’s most desirable film star by her initials: “BB”, that is:bébé, a bit of weirdly infantilised tabloid pillow-talk. When Brigitte Bardot retired from the movies in the mid-70s, taking up the cause of animal rights and a ban on the import of baby seals, the French press took to calling herBB-phoque, a homophone of the French for “baby seal” with a nasty hint of an Anglo pun. But France’s love affair with Bardot was to curdle, despite her fierce patriotism and admiration for Charles de Gaulle (the feeling was reciprocated). As her animal rights campaigning morphed in the 21st century into an attack on halal meat, and then intoshrill attackson the alleged “Islamicisation” of France, her relations with the modern world curdled even more.View image in fullscreenMaking her debut at Cannes in 1953.Photograph: SIPA/Rex/ShutterstockIn the 1950s, before the sexual revolution, before the New Wave, before feminism, there was Bardot: she was sex, she was youth, and, more to the point, Bardot was modernity. She was the unacknowledged zeitgeist force that stirred cinema’s young lions such as François Truffaut against the old order. Bardot was the country’s most sensational cultural export; she was in effect the French Beatles, a liberated, deliciously shameless screen siren who made male American moviegoers gulp and goggle with desire in that puritan land where sex on screen was still not commonplace, and in which sexiness had to be presented in a demure solvent of comedy. Bardot may not have had the comedy skills of a Marilyn Monroe, but she had ingenuous charm and real charisma, a gentleness and sweetness, largely overlooked in the avalanche of prurience and sexist condescension.Brigitte Bardot – a life in picturesRead moreShe drove a hungry media industry as a supposed man-eater, whose lovers and ex-husbands obligingly brawled over her in the Paris streets in front of press photographers. But Bardot was driven half- or three-quarters mad with the relentless intrusion. She was a public figure whose image was consumed not only through movies but magazine covers, paparazzi shots and gloating press stories. Perhaps onlyJennifer Aniston, in our own time, has endured something similar.View image in fullscreenAnd God Created Woman (1965), Bardot’s breakthrough.Photograph: Vestron/Sportsphoto Ltd/AllstarAfter a number of gamine roles in which her hair was mousy brown, Bardot made her spectacular breakthrough in 1956, at age 22, in a now very genteel-looking Technicolor romantic comedy knowingly titled And God Created Woman. She played a devastatingly desirable blonde, doing the wasp-waisted, derriere-wiggling walk that was the last word in 50s sexiness. Her character attracted the self-destructive obsession of an older man – which became a bit of a trope in Bardot movies – and was desired by younger types, including, in an early role, the sobersided young Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was destined to be Bardot’s lover in real life. It was directed by Bardot’s Svengali-like then husbandRoger Vadim, who controlled her personal and professional life.Bardot did work with serious film-makers. Louis Malle directed her inVie Privée, or Private Life (1961), in which she plays a version of herself, the epicentre of hysterical celebrity and voyeuristic disapproval, with blond Bardot-clones everywhere on the Paris streets, and her character heading for an awful, Princess Diana-type nemesis at the hands of the media. But it was Bardot’s unhappy fate to be patronised by the biggest name of all: Jean-Luc Godard. In Le Mépris, or Contempt (1963), she plays Camille, the beautiful wife of Michel Piccoli’s troubled screenwriter. Bardot’s nakedness is displayed as the very epitome of cinema’s tacky commercialism, but there is something cynical and misogynist in Godard’s approach.A wittier and more playful response to Bardot’s colossal celebrity came from Agnès Varda in her 1965 film Le Bonheur, or Happiness. A carpenter and his wife are thinking of going to see a film starring Bardot and Jeanne Moreau (presumably Louis Malle’s Viva Maria!, for which Bardot got a Bafta nomination). His wife asks him whom he prefers: Bardot or Moreau? Gallantly, he replies that he prefers her to either of the two film stars. Then Varda does a hard cut to his workplace locker – covered in Bardot pictures. Of course he prefers Bardot! Who didn’t?View image in fullscreenPreparing to meet the press in London, 1959.Photograph: Larry BurrowsAs the 60s continued, Bardot did an awful lot of ropey films, although fans have a soft spot forShalako(1968), a somewhat bizarre western she did with Sean Connery, whose hairpiece she reportedly found disconcerting. But then she made her move into political activism, one of the most intensely French moments in the country’s postwar history. While skiing in Meribel in 1965, Bardot was mortified when Charly, a German shepherd belonging to Alain Delon that she was looking after, bit a fellow skier on the leg: the victim was none other than French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, who was entranced by Bardot’s extravagant apologies and the way she slathered ointment on his leg – she turned him into an unlikely political ally. Bardot was, however, teased for her animal campaigns, even before she went full-time with them. Her home in Bazoches, near Paris (now the home of theBrigitte Bardot Foundation), was a place where animals were allowed to wander indoors: six goats, a dozen cats, a rabbit, 20 ducks, a donkey and some sheep. The aroma was distinct.Bardot made some great films. La Vérité, or The Truth (1960), directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a rip-roaring courtroom drama with Bardot’s character in the dock on a charge of murder. If her defence lawyer can prove it wasn’t premeditated, then she can get off on the Frenchcrimepassionnelclause. Flashbacks show her desolate life as a runaway, obsessed with men who had been obsessed with her, semi-homeless, drifting into prostitution. Her character scandalises the court by having read Simone De Beauvoir’s racy novel The Mandarins. (De Beauvoir was a Bardot fan.) It is gripping stuff, with a barnstormingly defiant final speech from Bardot, denouncing the hypocrisy and cruelty of the censorious older generation.View image in fullscreenAnimal lover … Bardot in 2005, with two puppies rescued after being seized by French customs officers.Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/Getty ImagesBut my favourite isEn Cas de Malheur, or In Case of Emergency (1958), a terrific crime melodrama adapted from a Georges Simenon thriller and directed by Claude Autant-Lara. Bardot plays a woman accused of violent robbery who seduces her middle-aged lawyer into fabricating evidence that will acquit her. The lawyer is played by Jean Gabin, and there is a real, crackling chemistry between these two icons of French cinema, old and new. Their scenes together have a real tenderness and wonderful poignancy, especially when Bardot’s character believes herself to be in love with her kindly but cynical older man – a great role for Gabin. “On est heureuse!”she declaims to the heavens: We are happy! Watching Bardot in this film is enough to make you happy.Explore more on these topicsBrigitte BardotAnimal welfareAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A truly intense watchHannah J DaviesSun 28 Dec 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 17.06 ESTShareApril 2026 will mark 114 years since the night that the RMS Titanic collided with an iceberg, but our grim fascination with the disaster shows no sign of abating. There was, of course, a surge of interest in the Titanic in the late 90s – thanks to James Cameron’s Oscar-bothering blockbuster – and there has been a steady stream of documentaries, dramas and podcasts about its demise ever since, some more sensitive than others (among the less tactful offerings: the 2010 film Titanic II – directed by Dick Van Dyke’s grandson Shane – a cash-in about a replica ship ravaged by a tsunami). Occasionally, the subject matter lurches starkly from the past back into the present.In June 2023, five people died on board an experimental submersible made by the company OceanGate; its passengers had hoped to see the liner’s rusting wreckage up close.Titanic Sinks Tonight is a part-documentary, part-drama series playing across four nights, its episodes constructed from letters and diaries written by those on board, as well as interviews the survivors would give in the decades after. On the strength of the two episodes released for review, there’s no denying that it sates our appetite for Titanic-themed content. However, in centring the words and memories of those who lived through the terror of that night, it restores much-needed agency to those people. It also does well to bring a sense of reality to events that can sometimes feel unreal on account of their ubiquity, and that uncanny valley of Titanic-themed media. Central to its success is the presence of experts such as historian Suzannah Lipscomb and former Royal Navy admiral Lord West, to sharpen the corners of the story that Hollywood has sanded down.View image in fullscreenWho will make it? … Charlotte Collyer, 2nd Class Passenger on a lifeboat.Photograph: BBC/Stellify MediaFor the upper-class passengers, their quarters for the journey from Southampton to New York would have been – says Lipscomb – “like a cross between the Ritz and an English grand country house”. We meet one such traveller, a fashion designer named Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, as the actor playing her – the excellently named Candida Gubbins – smothers her face in a thick cold cream (it is, she says, “a pleasure to go to bed” in her lavish cabin). Duff-Gordon would have been eating roast duckling and foie gras just hours before the ship began to sink, revelling in what Lipscomb describes as a “joyful” day; we even see a photograph of the real Lucy, Gubbins proving a strong likeness. Her comfort is contrasted with the likes of Charlotte Collyer (Lisa Dwyer Hogg), a seasick émigré to the US, whose lodgings were in the more spartan surroundings of second class. Even as strange, “queer” noises rang out, Collyer had no reason to think anything was wrong, putting her trust in those above her in the social hierarchy: “If these people weren’t worried, why should I be?”In fact, as Lipscomb shows, how much information you had very much depended on who you were. As opposed to a Jack and Rose, flip-of-a-coin situation where anybody could feasibly find themselves on a lifeboat, the “chumocracy” between the first-class passengers and those in charge put them at a major advantage when it came to surviving. Episode two, which airs tomorrow, also asks why the evacuation happened in the maddening way that it did, with Nadifa Mohamed explaining the “Sliding Doors” moments that saw families separated or kept together depending on where they were on the ship.The Somali-British novelist proves to be one of the programme’s biggest assets. She draws parallels between that period and today, when immigrants can put their trust in a new system and way of life, sometimes to their detriment: “Something I hear … is this belief that you’ve entered a world of order and protection and security, so you don’t have to worry about anything.” It was, says Mohamed, “so wrong” in this context. She and fellow author Jeanette Winterson may not seem the most obvious talking heads, but they’re great at it – their authorial skills adding to the many layers of world-building on show here. Maybe more writers should be invited to take part in programmes like this.View image in fullscreenRich history … Gerry O’Brien as Capt Smith realising his fate in Titanic Sinks Tonight.Photograph: BBC/Stellify MediaWhile the reconstructions are well-realised, there are perhaps a surplus of testimonies, and a failure to draw out the most powerful ones (among them, a truly intense performance from Tyger Drew-Honey as wireless operator Harold Bride). Really, though, Titanic Sinks Tonight is a rich history lesson that makes the familiar new once more; it also acknowledges that the truth is often far more frightening than any work of fiction.Titanic Sinks Tonight aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewThe TitanicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet to no one’s great surprise, the extreme power of his serve, combined with the spin and velocity of his groundstrokes, proved too much for the women’s No 1 player.New Battle of the Sexes is cynical bid for attention and own goal for SabalenkaRead more“It was a really tough match,” the 30-year-old Kyrgios insisted after his 6-3, 6-3 victory. “ I didn’t know what to expect. She broke my serve numerous times and honestly she was hitting some amazing shots. She is a hell of a competitor. It could have gone either way.”Not many saw it that way. For while the modified rules of this contest meant that Sabalenka’s side of the court was 9% smaller, that advantage was nullified by both players also being limited to one serve, a change that significantly favoured Kyrgios. Almost every time the Australian fizzed down one of his howitzers, Sabalenka was left scrambling on the baseline. And while she hit plenty of winners, and often moved better than her opponent, there was always a sense that Kyrgios could step up whenever he wanted.View image in fullscreenNick Kyrgios serves to Aryna Sabalenka on the unusually sized court.Photograph: Getty ImagesIn the first set, the crucial moment came with the Belarusian serving at 40-15 up with the score level at 3-3. From looking in control, she served two faults in a row. Kyrgios sensed blood. Soon he had broken, held serve, and seen out the set.Kyrgios then appeared distracted as he went 3-1 down in the second set. But despite not moving well, he was able to gain control with a mix of power and junk tennis – especially through his sliced forehands that often had the 27-year-old rushing uncomfortably to the net. And in no time at all, he was able to win five games in a row to wrap things up.But mostly this was a tennis match for those who have only a passing interest in tennis. During one timeout in the second set, Sabalenka did the Macarena. On another occasion, the public announcer threw tennis balls from a Ralph Lauren bag. Meanwhile on match point, Kyrgios used his 60-second timeout just to get his breath back.Earlier there was also a delay while the stadium PA announced that the former Brazil footballers Kaká and Ronaldo were making their entrance. For a contest that was expressly designed to appeal to the TikTok crowd it seemed a curious choice.It was all a far cry from the famous Battle of the Sexes match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973. True, Riggs was 55 and a long way past his prime. But the stakes couldn’t have been much higher.King feared that if she lost it would push women’s tennis back 50 years. Yet with every swish of her Wilson Autograph racket, King struck a mighty blow for fairness, equality and social justice.The Guardian called it “the kind of crushing, tactical, technical and psychological victory that ought to keep the male chauvinists quiet for a long time”. It also popularised tennis in a way that no ordinary match could.The reaction on social media after Kyrgios’s victory suggested that this latest match had done quite the opposite. The misogynists and incels were delighted.Tennispurists appalled.However Kyrgios, whose fitness looked short of what will be required to play five-setters in the Australian Open, insisted that it would help grow the game.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka makes her way to the court.Photograph: Amr Alfiky/AP“This is a great stepping stone for the sport of tennis,” he said, before floating the idea of a rematch. “This was all the world was talking about for six months.”Sabalenka also indicated she would like to do it again. “I feel I put on a great fight,” she said. “He was struggling, he was getting really tired. I feel like next time I play him, I know the tactics, and his strengths and weaknesses.”But ultimately the match told us what we know already. Men have enormous advantages due to puberty, and are faster, stronger and more powerful as a result.Curiously, it was shown live on the BBC, which apologised three times for loss of pictures in the second set. Beforehand, its analysts, ­Russell Fuller and Annabel Croft, also sounded defensive when ­talking about the exhibition nature of the match, Kyrgios’s past – including an assault on a previous girlfriend – and the fact it was promoted by the Evolve player agency, which represents Kyrgios and Sabalenka.This match, they suggested, was more about fun and entertainment than “going toe-to-toe as if it was a grand slam”. Those words were to prove prophetic. Although it did also make you wonder why the BBC had acquired the rights in the first place.Explore more on these topicsTennisAryna SabalenkaNick KyrgiosAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not that in the lead roles Margot Robbie is blonde and 35, and Jacob Elordi is white, when Emily Brontë described Cathy as a teen brunette and Heathcliff as “a dark-skinned gypsy”. It’s not the gaudy splendour of the interiors – silver walls, plaster Greek gods spewing strings of pearls, blood-red floors and a flesh-pink wall for clutching and licking. It’s not Robbie’s gobstopper diamonds or her scarlet sunglasses or her stuffing grass into her mouth or the loud snip of her corset laces being slashed with a knife or her elaborately – erotically – bound hair as she contemplates multiple silver cake stands stacked with vertiginous fruit puddings. It’s not any of her dresses – the red latex number or the perfectly 1980s off-the-shoulder wedding dress topped by yards of veil half-wuthered off her head. Nor is it any of the times Elordi takes his top off.The most astonishing thing is that the trailer says Wuthering Heights is “the greatest love story of all time”. Which is almost exactly how the 1939 Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon film was trailed – as “the greatest love story of our time … or any time!” Have we learned nothing? I am not talking about the fact that (like Oberon’s!) Robbie’s wedding dress is white, which is not period-correct. This has exercised many people on the internet. I’m more worried about the fact that almost a century since Olivier’s film, we are still calling it a love story – a great one! The greatest! It’s being released the day before Valentine’s Day! – when what actually happens is that Cathy rejects Heathcliff because she’s a snob, and he turns into a psychopath.This is why the novel is all but unfilmable – unless you stop halfway through. The 1939 film cut from Cathy’s death to her ghost walking hand in hand with Heathcliff’s while the housekeeper Nelly Dean sighs rapturously: “They’ve only just begun to live!” Most adaptations have done the same, a rare exception being Peter Kosminsky’s 1992 version which didn’t just cover the whole book but also starred Emily herself, played by Sinéad O’Connor in a big blue cloak, warning the audience “not to smile at any part of it”.There’s so much cruelty. Heathcliff is abused by Cathy’s brother Hindley. He then goads Hindley into drinking himself to deathIt’s true it’s low on laughs. It’s no romcom. Instead of a meet-cute there’s Cathy’s father bringing home a ragged orphan he’s found starving on the streets of Liverpool. The boy-loses-girl part is all there, but the boy-gets-girl ending never quite happens. The real question is whether it’s too brutal for the screen – Andrea Arnold’s raw, stripped-down 2011 version is probably the closest to the book’s dark energy, and even she stuck to the first half of the book.There’s so much cruelty. Heathcliff is abused by Cathy’s brother Hindley. He then goads Hindley into drinking himself to death, takes his house and abuses Hindley’s son. He tricks Cathy’s sister-in-law into marriage, beats her, calls her a slut, hangs her dog and gaslights her, insisting this is what she wants. Cathy is too narcissistic to care about any of this. So even ignoring her death and the second half of the novel, it’s a lot. If Fennell continues to the (bittersweet) end she’ll have to deal with Heathcliff abusing his own son and Cathy’s daughter, forcing them to marry, and renting Cathy’s marital home to a middle-aged fop who slashes a ghost girl’s wrists with broken glass. (In a frame narrative. The complexity of the plot is another reason it’s a nightmare to adapt.)When it came out in 1847, the critics did not think it was a love story. “How a human being could have attempted such a book … without committing suicide … is a mystery,”wrote the Graham’s Magazine, shuddering at its “vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors” and speculating that its author’s nightmare vision must have come from eating “toasted cheese”. The Spectator found it “coarse and disagreeable”; Atlas called the characters “utterly hateful or thoroughly contemptible”; and the North American Review shrank from the novel’s “coarseness”, “stupid blasphemy” and “morbid imagination”. So in a way it’s a good sign that a viewer at a test screening of Fennell’s film found it “aggressively provocative and tonally abrasive” because, the rumours go, of a scene in which a man is being publicly hanged, ejaculates and is fondled by a nun. None of that is in the book, but Wuthering Heights has always shocked. It has always been depraved and unhinged.Heathcliff literally begs Cathy to “drive me mad”. She feels obliterated by love, crying: “I am Heathcliff!” Love sends her into a brain fever and makes him gnash his teeth and dash his head against a tree until he bleeds and digs up her grave. All this is in the book. And we want it. Brontë surrounds Cathy and Heathcliff with characters who are so petty, hypocritical, small-minded and smug that their uncompromising love seems like a breath of fresh air. She also gives Cathy a brother who bullies her and a husband who stultifies her so that you can even argue, as critics Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar did, that Heathcliff is a feminist force who helps her smash the patriarchy and run wild in nature.Perhaps, anyway, the love isn’t supposed to be real. Some say it’s, as Elizabeth Hardwick rather unkindly put it, “a virgin’s story”, a book about impossible, abstract love which can only work when it becomes ethereal or, to put it less romantically, when both the lovers are dead. Perhaps that’s why it appeals so much to teenagers – Kate Bush wrote her soaring song at 18 and Fennell has explicitly said she wants her film to reflect the book as she read it at 14. Perhaps it’s not the greatest love story of all time, our time or any time, but is the greatest story about what we think love is like when we haven’t experienced it.But I am not sure that’s entirely the novel Brontë wrote, at 27, intellectually brilliant and canny too (she managed the sisters’ investments), physically strong (she walked miles, she could handle a gun) and an avid reader of newspapers as well as all the newest books. Her novel is absolutely bursting with ideas. In its intricate structure it holds a tension between love and nihilism. She wanted to confound us, to perplex us, to startle us, so perhaps it’s absolutely right that the trailer should do the same.It will be a shame, though, if the adaptation doesn’t take in any of the novel’s tricky second half where, having conjured our darkest desires, I think Brontë is asking us whether we really want to indulge them. Heathcliff tells Nelly he started digging up Cathy’s corpse but stopped at the last moment. Repulsed, she asks what he’d have done if he’d found her, “dissolved into earth, or worse”, and he says he would have dreamed “of dissolving with her …!” Is this what we want love to cost? Do we really want love that is so toxic that it can only end in death and damage everyone around us? Is this love or a macabre will to suicide? And while we might enjoy this kind of love in fantasy, wouldn’t we be better off going for the kind of love Brontë actually ends the novel with, as Cathy’s daughter gently, intimately, teaches Hindley’s son to read, a scene that has hardly ever – yet – made it to the screen.Samantha Ellis is the author ofTake Courage: Anne Brontë and the Art of Life (Vintage).Wuthering Heights is released in cinemas on 13 February.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëfeaturesShareReuse this content"

MasterChef, despite being one of the most exhilarating jobs a girl can do, sucked up most of my waking hours this year, and made my free time extra-precious. So the very best restaurants I found this year – those with zinging hospitality and heart-thumpingly good food – became equally extra-crucial.I’m talking about the likes ofTropea in Harborne, just down the road from the TV studio, and where I’ve spent a fair few Saturdays eating butternut squash arancini, fresh tagliolini and whopping great deep-fried salted cannoli. Over in Bristol, meanwhile, two absolute gems revealed themselves on the very same trip:RagùandLapin, both in Wapping Wharf and both in repurposed shipping containers, but entirely different creatures. Lapin I described as a “peculiar, meta, slightly earnest and definitely delicious” slice of France that serves asparagus with sauce gribiche, gnocchi Parisienne and, well, lapin itself whenever local hunters manage to bag some bunnies. Lapin will add caviar to any dish, if you ask for it, they play 80s French pop and serve a mint-green, menthe-over-club-soda diabolo for those French exchange school trip vibes. Ragù, meanwhile, may quite simply be one of the greatest dinners I’ve eaten this decade: crespelle in rich tomato brodo, artichoke fritti and chocolate budino with sour cherries and amaretti – flawless cooking in completely understated surroundings.View image in fullscreen‘Fancily plated’: ackee and saltfish spring roll at 2210 By Natty Can Cook in south-east London.Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianLargely because of those telly commitments, I made it to Manchester only a couple of times this year, but those visits gleanedBangkok Diners ClubandWinsome, both of which are terrifically good ways to fill your stomach and leave jolly. Bangkok Diners Club, in Ancoats, is a Thai restaurant tucked upstairs at the Edinburgh Castle, an elegantly restored, 19th-century pub where rich, golden beetroot massaman curry is served with decadent chicken-fat rice and where delicate plates of raw bass come with calamansinam jimand rice bran before a round of fruity rice ice-cream lollies. Winsome, on the other hand, is a stonkingly good modern British restaurant with a wonderful, warm, devoted crew led by Shaun Moffat, whose food is “a scoop ofFergus Henderson, a nod toMark Hix, a dash of London’sQuality Chop Houseand a teeny touch ofToby Carvery”. They serve roast dinners, wild mushrooms with pease pudding and rhubarb jelly with custard.View image in fullscreen‘Worth the bunfight to get in’: hake with squid ink at Belotta in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.Photograph: Cristian Barnett/The GuardianAnother fabulous night spent expanding my waistline was atBellotain Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, a Spanish tasting menu experience where seats are limited but well worth the bunfight to get in. Elsewhere, I was bowled over byJulietin Stroud, where the local boho community of artists and eccentric toffs currently celebrate their high days and holidays. And, just last month, IlovedDave Hart and Polly Pleasence’s new place,Franc, where simple French cooking and a very limited menu are the order of the day: we had world-class duck breast with caramelised endive and a big bowl of fresh chips. Another great dinner in 2025 involved a trip to the blustery British seaside for hake with orange-y sauce Maltaise atHarry’s in Camber Sands.Back in the capital, however, many over-hyped London restaurants left me cold, though there were the odd moments of greatness. The Ukrainian restaurantTatar Bunarin Shoreditch, for instance, is fabulous for plump mushroomvarenykyand borscht, plus I’d advise you to run, not walk to the newKuduin Marylebone, London’s prettiest new restaurant this year, for its confit trout braai and the “Kudu kit kat”. Or even just for a loaf of its warm fresh bread with a bowl of obscenely good curry-leaf butter. It would be remiss of me not to remind you aboutTownin Covent Garden, either, which I still recommend to everyone to solve their dinner-scheduling woes – it’s big, bold, deliciousandglamorous; take a date, take a client.View image in fullscreen‘A whopping great deep-fried tube stuffed with cream, salted caramel and chocolate sauce’: Tropea in Birmingham’s fried lemon cannolo.Photograph: Jack Spicer Adams/The GuardianI’m also guilty of harping on aboutOsteria Angelina, a Japanese-Italian hybrid in Shoreditch, and the wilfully eccentric, mock-historical pleasure palace that isLilibet’sin Mayfair, which will discombobulate you with its wild, monarchical, faux olde-worldeness, and then delight you with an exemplary Dover sole with Café de Paris butter and piles of profiteroles. Finally, creeping in at the end of the year, there was for fancy Caribbean at2210 Natty Can Cookin south London – think ackee and saltfish spring rolls and deep-fried apple crumble.Yes, time might have been a bit tight this year for lounging about in restaurants, but I gave it a damned good go and can confirm that the scene out there is roaring.

When asked about the status of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station – occupied since the start of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion – Trump gave a confused answer and said Putin was no longer bombing it.The meeting took place just hours after Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russia’s president.“The two leaders want it to end,” Trump said, adding: “I think we can move pretty rapidly. Otherwise it’s going to go on for a very long time.” Trump praised Zelenskyy, saying: “This gentleman has worked very hard, and is very brave, and his people are very brave.”He added: “I do think we have the makings of a deal. We have two willing countries. We are in the final stages of talking.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump meets Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside other officials at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesSpeaking to reporters, the two leaders discussed the latest iteration of a20-point peace planand the unresolved question of the future of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Standing next to Trump, Zelenskyy said US and Ukrainian negotiators had made good progress in recent weeks with “90%” of the draft agreed.Writing on Truth Socialbefore the meeting, Trump described his one-hour-15-minute call with Putin as “good and very productive”. Asked if Putin was serious about peace, Trump replied: “I think he is.”There were no signs, however, that Russia was willing to drop any of its maximalist demands. According to Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov, Trump “listened carefully” on Sunday to Russia’s assessment of the conflict. Both sides agreed that a ceasefire proposed by Ukraine andEuropewould only prolong the fighting “and is fraught with renewed hostilities”, Ushakov said.Trump greeted Zelenskyy on the steps of his residence and offered him a businesslike handshake. There was no hug. US officials did not meet Zelenskyy when he arrived at Palm Beach international airport, in contrastto the red carpet reception given to Putin by an applauding Trumpat their summit in August in Alaska.One former Ukrainian diplomat, Maria Drutska, said Putinwas trying to “sabotage things”by ringing Trump before he saw Zelenskyy. During their previous meeting in October in the White House, Trump rowed back on the delivery of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine after a similar call to Moscow.Putin wants Ukraine to hand over territory in the north of Donetsk oblast that his forces have been unable to capture. Zelenskyy’s counter-proposal envisages a demilitarised zone, with both sides withdrawing from the line of contact. The plan could be put to a referendum, providing Moscow first agrees to a ceasefire lasting from 60 to 90 days.But fundamental problems remain, including the issue of security guarantees to prevent Russia from attacking again. Trump has made no military commitment to defend Ukraine. The original 28-point US plan was presented in November after talks with Russia andin effect demanded Ukraine’s capitulation.View image in fullscreenCanada’s prime minister, Mark Carney (left), met Zelenskyy on Saturday.Photograph: Riley Smith/APSpeaking alongside Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, on Saturday in the wake of another large-scale air attack on Kyiv by Russia, Zelenskyy described the onslaught as “Russia’s answer to our peace efforts”. The Ukrainian president said to Carney: “We need two things, pressure on Russia and sufficient strong support for Ukraine.”Ukraine’s capital was hit by more than 500 drones and ballistic missiles across Friday night and Saturday. The 12-hour attack killed four people and left half a million without power. Carney called the bombardment “barbaric”. A “willing Russia” was necessary to create conditions for a just and lasting peace, he said.Trump declined to condemn the latest strikes on Kyiv and did not acknowledge that Russia – unlike, in his view, Ukraine – had deliberately targeted civilians. “I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also. I don’t say that negatively. You probably have to,” he said, speaking outside his estate.0:29Russia strikes Kyiv before Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump – videoSunday’s Mar-a-Lago talks were a moment of high risk for Zelenskyy.In a recent interviewwith the Guardian, Ukraine’s leader said he “wasn’t afraid” of the mercurial US president because both of them had a democratic mandate.In February, Trump and the US vice-president,JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy in a bruising session at the White House. Subsequent meetings have gone better, including at the Vatican in April, and at the White House in October, when Zelenskyy was flanked by European leaders including Keir Starmer.Ukrainian officials have worked hard to repair relations with a Russia-leaning White House, while coordinating closely with European allies.Zelenskyy said he called Starmer on Sunday, informing him about the frontline situation and the consequences of Russian strikes. Trump said European leaders would join Sunday’s talks through a video conference link from Mar-a-Lago.The Ukrainian delegation included Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, the first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, and Ukraine’s new ambassador to Washington, Olha Stefanishyna. Witkoff and Kushner joined from the US side, as well as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, Susie Wiles, the president’s chief of staff, and Gen Dan Caine, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff.Zelenskyy described the meeting with Trump as a bilateral mostly focused on US-Ukraine issues. Key topics include security guarantees from the US and Europe, the military situation and the sequence for implementing agreements.mapSaving Kyiv’s heritage: a city rebuilding itself in the shadow of warRead moreOn Sunday, Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had seized five settlements in eastern and southern Ukraine, including Myrnohrad near the eastern city of Pokrovsk and Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region. The announcement before the Florida talks appeared designed to send a message to Trump that Russia’s victory in Donbas is inevitable.Russian forces have been advancing but they have also suffered setbacks. In recent weeks Ukraine’s defence forces have clawed back control over much of the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, after its infiltration by small groups of Russian infantry. Ukraine dismissed Moscow’s latest claims and said its defences were holding.Its military said it hit the Syzran oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region in an overnight drone attack. The damage was still being assessed, it added. Three civilians were wounded after Russian drone and missile attacks in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s national police said.With Trump unwilling to pressure Russia, observers expect the nearly four-year-old full-scale war to continue. “The fundamental flaw in the current diplomatic push is the absence of the aggressor at the negotiating table,” Yuriy Boyechko, the founder of the charity Hope for Ukraine, said.He added: “Peace is not achieved by one side agreeing to terms with a third party; it requires the principal belligerent, Vladimir Putin, to commit to a ceasefire and withdrawal. As long as Russia is actively launching its heaviest attacks in months, it is signalling that it has no intention of honouring a deal it did not sign.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpEuropeVladimir PutinJD VanceJared KushnernewsShareReuse this content"

The prediction algorithm is trained on historical data including weather trends, school holidays, and rates of flu and Covidto determine how many people are likely to visit A&E.The government said the technology allowed healthcare staff “to do the things that they’re trained to do, rather than having to be bound down by bureaucratic processes”.Ian Murray, the minister for digital government and data, said: “The front door of theNHSis the A&E department. You’ve no idea how many people will come through the door, although you can have some analytical evidence that Saturday nights might be busier than a Tuesday night, for example, and the winter might be busier than the summer, unless you have a heatwave, of course.“It [the forecasting tool] helps us to [predict] how busy their A&E departments are going to be. If you put that into context and see seasonal trends, along with how busy days are going to be, you can then put your resources in the right place.”Hospitals could deploy more consultants in particular specialities or more nursing staff in the departments predicted to be busiest, Murray added.“You can maybe then see about freeing up beds further down the pipeline, maybe see how you might need to get more people out of the hospital quicker, and free up those beds,” he said.The A&E forecasting tool is available to all NHS trusts in England. About 50 NHS organisations are already using it, and, according to Murray, they are “seeing great results”.“It’s about modernising the NHS, using the tools to allow clinicians and professionals to do the things that they’re trained to do, rather than having to be bound down by bureaucratic processes, allowing resources to be targeted where they need to be targeted,” he said.The tool forms part of Keir Starmer’s AI Exemplars programme. In January, the prime minister said artificial intelligence would “drive incredible change in our country”.Prof Julian Redhead, the national clinical director for urgent and emergency care at NHS England, said: “Early and efficient planning is key to managing busy periods like winter, and new tech like the AI tool has the potential to make a real difference to the way we manage care for patients.”Explore more on these topicsA&EArtificial intelligence (AI)NHSHealth policyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been a longstanding priority under successive governments to work for his release from detention, and to see him reunited with his family in the UK. The government condemns Mr el-Fattah’s historic[al] tweets and considers them to be abhorrent.”Both the Labour government and its Tory predecessors are expected to come under pressure to explain why they campaigned for the release of Abd el-Fattah, who has a British-born mother, when his posts were already in the public domain.The postscost him a nominationfor the European parliament’s Sakharov prize in 2014. The group backing him withdrew their nomination for the human rights award, saying they had discovered a tweet from 2012 in which he called for the murder of Israelis.In 2015, Abd el-Fattah claimed his comments had been taken out of context, and that while it had seemed “shocking”, it had been part of a “private conversation” that took place during an Israeli offensive in Gaza.The decision to grant citizenship would have been made by the Home Office, which at that point was led by Priti Patel, advised by the Foreign Office, where Liz Truss was foreign secretary and James Cleverly was the minister for the region.Successive Tory prime ministers have also called for Abd el-Fattah, to be released and reunited with his family, including Rishi Sunak whosaid it was “a priority”for his government in November 2022.When Labour came to power, Starmer continued lobbying the Egyptian president over Abd el-Fattah, ongoing imprisonment,making three calls to his Egyptian counterpart, while the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end the detention.The campaign for the release of one of Egypt’s most prominent political prisonersbecame a cause célèbrein the UK, where his mother, Laila Soueif, almost died whileon hunger strikeover his detention.Abd el-Fattah, finallyarrived in Londonon Friday after Egypt lifted a travel ban it had imposed on him despitereleasing him from jailin September. In 2021, he had been sentenced to five years in prison on charges of “spreading false news” after sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country.After the social media posts emerged, Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, called for Abd el-Fattah, to be stripped of his dual citizenship and deported, adding he should “be made to live in Egypt or frankly anywhere else in the world”.Writing to the prime minister about his words welcoming the activist’s return to the UK, Jenrick said: “Given Mr Abd el-Fattah’s record of extremist statements about violence, Jews and the police, it was a serious error of judgment. Nobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily, nor for peaceful dissent. But neither should the prime minister place the authority of his office behind someone whose own words cross into the language of racism and bloodshed.”Nigel Farage waded into the row, posting on X on Sunday that he had reported Abd el-Fattah to counter-terrorism police over his remarks.“Whilst Robert Jenrick is right to criticise Starmer … we must not forget that it was the Tory government who started this … Labour are only doing the same as the Tories, just worse,” the Reform UK leader said.Several Tory politicians who lobbied for Abd el-Fattah’s release from prison have said they now regret their participation in the campaign. The former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith, who was among those who had pushed for Abd el-Fattah’s return, urged the police to investigate his comments.“I do … regret signing the letter calling for the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, given his views, that have since come to light, are utterly abhorrent. Had I known of these, I would not have signed the letter. I urge the police to investigate the nature of these extremist comments,” Duncan Smith posted on X.The Tory MP Alicia Kearns, a former chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said: “I trusted the process to give Alaa citizenship, and then supported the campaign for his release. I feel deeply let down, and frankly betrayed, having lent my support to his cause, which I now regret.“It is wholly improper for British citizens to be detained without due process by foreign states; however Alaa must unequivocally apologise and make clear he now wholly rejects the hatred and antisemitism he expressed, which is so wholly incompatible with British values.”The democracy activist was a leading voice in Egypt’s 2011 Arab spring uprising and went on hunger strikes behind bars. His imprisonment was labelled a breach of international law by UN investigators. He was eventually released after being pardoned by the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had raised concerns with the UK government over Abd el-Fattah’s remarks and that there was an “urgent need” to find out whether he still held the views expressed online.The board said: “The social media history that has emerged from Alaa Abd el-Fattah is of profound concern. His previous extremist and violent rhetoric aimed at ‘Zionists’ and white people in general is threatening to British Jews and the wider public.“The cross-party campaign for such a person, and the warm welcome issued by the government, demonstrate a broken system with an astonishing lack of due diligence by the authorities.”Tom Rutland, Labour MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, posted: “It is unclear to me why it has been a priority for successive governments to bring this guy over here. What kind of vetting is routinely done in these cases? His tweets are impressive in how they manage to be vile in such a variety of ways.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsAntisemitismEgyptActivismLabourConservativesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Churches disagree about how to respondC of E faces dilemma as far right claims Christianity to push agenda that often clashes with gospel messageHarriet SherwoodandBen QuinnSun 28 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 13.41 ESTShareGary made sure he got to Whitehall early for the“unite the kingdom”(UTK) outdoor carol service in the run-up to Christmas. After about 150,000 people turned up for thelast rallycalled by Tommy Robinson in September, the leader of the anti-migrant far-right movement, he wanted to be sure of a prime position.He needn’t have worried.About 1,500 people – perhaps 1% of September’s turnout – came to Whitehallto sing carols and hear preachers in the twilight of a mid-December day. Robinson had publicly insisted the event was a non-political celebration of Christmas; maybe that deterred some of movement’s more ardent activists.Crosses and flags were on display, but there was little overt talk – either from the preachers or people in the crowd – of Robinson’s favoured political themes. One did complain loudly that her grandchildren were “banned from celebrating Christmas” at school; another group of women handed out leaflets calling for communities to be “protected from illegal immigration”.Standing beneath a “Jesus saves” sign, Gary said he was a believer but didn’t attend church. “That’s not for me, I can’t be bothered with all that,” he said. Some others attending the service also said they were Christians but not churchgoers.Since Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, emerged fromprison last May, bearded and wearing a wooden cross around his neck, churches have been uncertain how to respond to incipient Christian nationalism on the far right of British politics. Some church members have wanted to push back unequivocally against racism and xenophobia, saying it has no place in Christianity; others have warned that any direct response risks amplifying the far right’s message.Robinson was “led to Christ” while in prison, according to Rikki Doolan, a minister at the Spirit Embassy church in Tottenham, north London, which has a large component of worshippers with west African heritage. Three weeks before his release, Doolan – a former Ukip candidate in local elections – paid Robinson a visit. “We spoke about the gospel, and he received Jesus Christ as his personal lord and saviour, right there in the prison,” Doolan said later.After his release, Robinson told the far right Visegrad 24 media platform that he had “looked deeply over the past few years about what we are fighting for and what made Britain, and it isChristianity. We are a Christian culture”.View image in fullscreenTommy Robinson after his release from HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in May.Photograph: @TRobinsonNewEra/PAOver the Christmas period, Robinson posted a number of messages on X positioning himself as an advocate for a Christian revival, includinga Boxing Day repostof a tweet by a rightwing account which claimed there had been a “MASSIVE surge in attendance across all denominations” with the comment: “It’s happening” and a cross emoji. The account shared part of a Sky news interview with an Anglican vicar talking about “huge growth” in churchgoing, particularly since the pandemic.At the huge UTK march in central London in September, there was overt Christian symbolism on display, including large crosses and placards proclaiming “Christ is King”. Hymns were sung, prayers were said.Some have suggested that the far right’s newfound Christianity is cultural rather than deeply rooted in faith, or that it is simply a respectable cloak to drape over anti-migrant and Islamophobic views, while also tapping into potential new supporters from beyond Robinson’s largely white base.Others point to entrenched, hugely influential and well-funded Christian nationalism in the US, saying he is seeking to emulate that movement.The hard right is claiming the cross – and true Christians should not allow it | Polly ToynbeeRead moreAccording to Chris Wickland, a senior pastor at the evangelical Living World Church Network in Hampshire and an associate of Robinson, the rise of Christian nationalism is a “continuation of much older debates about identity, sovereignty and social cohesion that have been unfolding for years”.He said: “Many of the people attending our churches currently are disillusioned with the political situation in the country and see faith as a stabilising influence in family life, local communities and society more generally … People are drawn by a shared concern about the role of faith in public life, and many are also exploring or deepening their own personal commitment to Christianity.”Online footage has shown Wickland attempting to find new members of his flock from the ranks of men attaching flags to lamp-posts as part of the rightwing “Raise the Colours” movement.1:23Protesters clash with police at far-right rally in London – videoA few UTK supporters have begun turning up in churches, creating a dilemma for clergy and fellow congregants who don’t share their views. “People are showing up on the back of these rallies, and local church leaders are thinking: ‘What do we do with this?’ It’s something we have to think very hard about,” said one person who attended a December meeting of church, charity and civil society leaders in Westminster on their response to Christian nationalism.Arun Arora, the bishop of Kirkstall and co-lead in the Church of England on racial justice, said he “rejoiced” that Robinson had come to faith, but that the far-right leader needed to hear the key messages of Christianity: love thy neighbour, compassion, justice for the weak and vulnerable.Within the C of E, Arora has been at the forefront of the argument that the church needs to push back hard against the Islamophobia and anti-migrant stance of Robinson – while taking care not to demonise all those in his orbit.“Not everyone who goes on a UTK march is racist. No one is in favour of uncontrolled immigration. But that doesn’t mean you stand neutral in the face of Robinson’s message,” Arora said. He and other Leeds clergy have engaged with protesters outside asylum hotels in the city, offering cake and a vision of “positive patriotism” in an effort to create a space for discussion. In the next few years there would be a “battle as to what Christianity is”, he said.In the lead-up to the UTK carols service, a number of clergy publicly called for a firm response from the C of E. Their case was strengthened by criticism of the event by the Baptist Union, Methodists and United Reformed Church. Churches Together in England shared an opinion piece questioning “why so many churches were slow to challenge [Robinson’s] insidious rhetoric”.The day before the UTK carols event, the C of E national head office released a 43-second video to remind people that“Christmas belongs to all of us”.It didn’t mention Robinson or the UTK carols event, but C of E officials indicated that they were happy for it to be seen as a response to both. Some of those who had argued for pushback felt it was a “safe” way of heading off a more radical response.View image in fullscreenSupporters of British far-right activist Tommy Robinson gather on Whitehall in central London on 13 December for a carol concert.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesDifferences in views on how to respond to Robinson, UTK and the Reform UK party are believed to exist at the very top of the C of E, between Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, who has a long track record on racial justice issues, and the incoming archbishop of Canterbury, Sarah Mullally. She condemned the use of “Christian symbols to oppress” in a pre-Christmasinterview with the Sunday Times, but Mullally is thought to be wary of the potential pitfalls of a political battle with hard-right politicians and activists.In January, C of E bishops will discuss the church’s response to Christian nationalism and the far right at one of their regular meetings. Nick Spencer, a senior fellow at the Christian thinktank Theos, who is embarking on a two-year study of Christian nationalism, said the C of E faced a genuine dilemma. If it embraced rightwing activists proclaiming newfound Christianity, it would “get its head kicked in”; if it slammed the door in their face, it would be “missionally-speaking a catastrophe”.The church is “damned if they do, damned if they don’t”, he said. “I don’t think it can remain silent, but its response risks underlining the narrative that the C of E is only for the comfortable middle-class.”Steve Chalke, a Baptist minister and founder of the Oasis Charitable Trust, said to ignore Christian nationalism was “really unwise. You don’t ignore a cancer in your body”.Chalke, who has spent decades working against poverty and injustice, said: “We need to create community, belonging, hope. Britain is not only a post-Christian society, now it’s post-secular. People are searching for meaning and purpose.”According to Spencer, what happens next depends on whether Robinson reflects on the low turnout for the UTK carols and decides to “quietly ditch” his Christian nationalist rhetoric. “Or will he stick with it? How sincere is he in his Christianity?”A possible clue came the week before Christmas, when Robinson and UTK announced the “largest demonstration for national unity and strength this country has ever witnessed” on 16 May in central London. It was billed as a “celebration of our culture, our identity and our shared destiny”. There was no mention of Christianity.Explore more on these topicsChristianityTommy RobinsonThe far rightAnglicanismReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gerald Stratford, who has 370,000 followers, has starred in a photoshoot forGuccioff the back of his grassroots success.View image in fullscreenGerald Stratford, who is a fan of red cabbage.Photograph: @stratfordgerald/InstagramRowland Smith, the creative director at Billion Dollar Boy, a UK-based advertising agency thatworks with creators, says Stratford is an example of the authenticity and passion that online audiences are seeking as their channels become overwhelmed withAI-generated “slop”.Pointing out that the demand for everyday content appears to have increased this year, he says: “We are getting a lot of AI content on social media and I think this is an antidote to that. A lot of material like Gerald’s has an educational element as well. Audiences are wanting to get more out of their feeds than just scrolling every three seconds.”TikTok is viewed as a good platform for lesser known creators because its algorithm prioritises relevance and resonance over celebrity, according to Smith.“Audiences are becoming quite fatigued with polished, overly stylised creator content. We are starting to see a push away from it.”At this year’s TikTok awards for UK and Ireland, the platform handed the Voice for Change gong to Tola and Kevin Andu, a mother and son, for their@raisingkevin_account, which documents Kevin’s journey as a young autistic man. Badged “autism joy”, the videos detailing 20-year-old Kevin’s daily experiences, fromtrying new foodstohaving a job, receive millions of views. The account has more than 700,000 followers.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Tola Andu, Kevin Andu and a guest at the TikTok awards where they won the Voice for Change award.Photograph: Nicky J Sims/Getty ImagesTola says Kevin’s online popularity has given him opportunities that have “truly changed his life”, including a permanent job. “I’m incredibly proud because I remember the nights I lay awake worrying about him, what his future will look like and worried sick about if the world would ever understand and accept him,” she said. “So now to see millions of people choosing to follow his journey and celebrate him is an answered prayer for me.”Elsewhere on TikTok in the UK,“bus aunty”Bemi Orojuogun and the ornithologistJack Baddamshave proved popular.View image in fullscreenJack Baddams with a feathered friend.Photograph: @jabaddams/TikTok“When people have a niche and are passionate about it, it tends to blow up,” Smith says.In the US, unlikely creator hits on TikTok include the seventysomething identical twins Wayne and Dwayne Haneline, who were a singing duo before serving in the Vietnam war and have returned to entertaining several decades later. Theirunique takeon AC/DC’s Back in Black has had nearly 80m views alone.

From 2002 to 2005 alone, the late financier victimized “dozens” of underage teens by luring them into sex acts for payment under the auspices of massage work, some as young as 14, prosecutors said.Epstein leaned on a coterie of employees and associates – including British socialiteGhislaine Maxwell– to secure a “steady supply of minor victims”. He also enlisted his victims to recruit other girls under the false pretense of providing massages, prosecutors said.While the breadth of Epstein’s crimes is well-documented, papers in recently unveiled investigative files from the Department of Justice have put into sharper relief how he and his associates had an almost assembly line-like process for procuring victims.These documents – released over the past week by aTrump administrationunder intense political pressure from both Democrats and Republicans – also make clearer how girls and young women were perceived as commodities: mere bodies meant to serve a predator’s twisted predilections – and possibly those of his associates.US justice department says it may need ‘a few more weeks’ to process 1m more Epstein documents for releaseRead moreOne document from 2001 described how Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding Epstein’s crimes, accosted three female students on a Palm Beach, Florida, college campus.“Maxwell said she needed young, beautiful unmarried women to answer phones and do office work at her home on Palm Beach,” a police report stated. At least one of the students went to the house on several occasions and “described the telephone calls as men call[ing] in saying when they were going to drop of[f] particular girls”.“All three girls said Maxwell and Epstein were secretive about what was going on at the house, and at least two of the girls complained about Epstein touching them inappropriately. They said Maxwell asked for a list of other girls who she could call to work on short notice,” the report continued. Maxwell “said she needed a large pool of girls to call as she did not know how many she would need at any given time”.Investigative notes from 2019 describe what seemed to be a crisis for Epstein: his supply of girls to abuse was running low.Notes taken by an FBI investigator during an interview stated: “Friends of [redacted] friends. Big Brazilian group. Desperate time” and “running out of girls”.“Cant just bring girls he doesn’t like,” the interview apparently recounted. “Told her keep looking for girls.” At one point, someone witnessed Epstein “asking for ID to girl wanted to make sure under 18 b/c he wasn’t believing them b/c [redacted] messed up by bringing more older girls”.The interviewer also noted the witness recalling Epstein’s comments such as “you know what I like” and “you know what I’m into”.“Understood that to mean young petite underage,” the interview notes also said.Newly disclosed documents also describe how victims were encouraged to source girls and young women for Epstein. During grand jury proceedings in Maxwell’s federal case, a law enforcement officer described one victim’s recollection of these requests.This victim told the law enforcement agent, in effect, that Maxwell once said: “Do you know anyone who could give him a blowjob today, I don’t feel like it?” The victim also remembered that when Maxwell asked her to bring other girls, “they have to look young at least”.This victim did not bring any girls or women into Epstein’s orbit, telling law enforcement that “she didn’t want anyone else to go through that”.Another victim told law enforcement that she brought other girls to Epstein’s house. “She was told she could earn more money,” the law enforcement agent told grand jurors.The victim said that this directive came from Epstein and Maxwell. “They asked if she could bring younger girls,” the agent told the grand jury.These tranches of documents have provided still more insight into others’ potential participation in crimes that treated girls as objects to be used. One email dated 7 July 2019 states: “When you get a chance can you give me an update on the status of the 10 CO conspirators?”In addition to Maxwell, one of the names mentioned in this exchange about co-conspirators is “Brunel”. Epstein was friends with a French modeling agent named Jean-Luc Brunel.Policearrested Brunel in December 2020at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on suspicion of crimes such as rape and sexual assault of minors, as well as human trafficking of underage girls for sexual exploitation.Brunel, who was believed to have provided teens to Epstein, was founddeadin prison about two years after his arrest. Authorities said his cause of death was suicide.Documentation also suggests that Epstein and others might have shared child sexual abuse images with each other. An attorney representing a co-executor for Epstein’s estate wrote the FBI in April 2023 for guidance; they were reviewing documents and came across potential child sexual abuse images.“Apparently the relevant video was shared with Epstein by an individual who was convicted of a child pornography-type offense and it depicted one or two topless women,” the letter states.The potential casual transfer of child sexual abuse images was mentioned in an FBI file nearly 30 years prior. Maria Farmer, a fine-art painter who worked for Epstein in the mid-1990s, told authorities in 1996 that he “stole” nude photos and photographic negatives of her 12- and 16-year-old siblings.Farmer, whose sister Annie was abused by Epstein, told the FBI that he “is believed to have sold the pictures to potential buyers”. The case type was listed as “child pornography” in this report.Federal authorities did not follow up on Farmer’s complaint. They did not recognize that she had reported him for possible child sexual abuse images; the public confirmation of this report came during Epstein document disclosures.In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

The phrase “AI psychosis” has been used to describe the plight ofpeople experiencing delusions, paranoia or dissociation after talking to large language models (LLMs). Our collective anxiety has been compounded by studies showing that young people are increasingly embracing the idea of AI relationships; half of teens chat with an AI companion at least a few times a month, with one in three finding conversations with AI “to be as satisfying or more satisfying than those with real‑life friends”.But we need to pump the brakes on the panic. The dangersarereal, but so too are the potential benefits. In fact, there’s an argument to be made that – depending on what future scientific research reveals – AI relationships could actually be a boon for humanity.Consider how ubiquitous nonhuman relationships have always been for our species. We have a long history of engaging in healthy interactions with nonhumans, whether they be pets, stuffed animals or beloved objects or machines – think of the person in your life who is fully obsessed with their car, to the point of naming it. In the case of pets, these arerealrelationships insofar as our cats and dogs understand that they are in a relationship with us. But the one‑sided, parasocial relationships we have with stuffed animals or cars happen without those things knowing that we exist. Only in the rarest of cases do these relationships devolve into something pathological. Parasociality is, for the most part, normal and healthy.And yet, there is something unsettling about AI  relationships. Because they are fluent language users, LLMs generate the uncanny feeling that they have human-like thoughts, feelings and intentions. They also generate sycophantic responses that reinforce our points of view, rarely challenging our thinking. This combination can easily lead people down a path of delusion. This isnotsomething that happens when we interact with cats, dogs or inanimate objects. But the question remains: even in cases where people are unable to see through the illusion that AIs are real people that actually care about us, is that always a problem?The emergence of AI is not unlike the discovery of the analgesic properties of opiumConsider loneliness:one in six people on this planet experienceit, and it’s associated with a26% increase in premature death; the equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.Research is emergingthat suggests AI companions are effective at reducing feelings of loneliness – andnot just by functioning as a form of distraction, but as a result of the parasocial relationship itself. For many people, an AI chatbot is the only friendship option available to them, however hollow it might seem. As the journalist Sangita Lalrecently explainedin a report on those turning to AI for companionship, we should not be so quick to judge. “If you don’t understand why subscribers want and seek and need this connection,” said Lal, “you’re lucky enough to not have experienced loneliness.”To be fair, there is an argument to be made that the rise of new tech and social media has itself played a role in driving the loneliness epidemic. That’s why Mark Zuckerberggot flakfor his glowing endorsement of AI as a solution to a problem he might be partly responsible for creating. But if the reality is that it helps, this cannot be dismissed out of hand.There’s also research to show that AI can be used as an effective psychotherapy tool.In one study, patients who chatted with an AI-powered therapy chatbot showed a 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms. Not as effective as human therapists, who generated a 45% reduction, but still better than nothing. This utilitarian argument is worth considering; there are millions of people who are, for whatever reason, unable to access a therapist. And in those cases, turning to an AI is probably preferable to not seeking any help at all.But one study isn’t proof of anything. And there’s the rub. We are at the early stages of research into the potential benefits or harms of AI companionship. It’s easy to focus on the handful of studies that support our preconceived notions about the dangers or benefits of this technology.It’s in this research vacuum that the true dangers of AI are revealed. Most of the entities deploying AI companions are for-profit companies. And if there’s one thing we know about for-profit companies, it’s that they are keen to avoid regulations and eschew evidence that could hurt their bottom line. They are incentivised to downplay risks, cherrypick evidence and tout only benefits.The emergence of AI is not unlike the discovery of the analgesic properties of opium; if harnessed by responsible parties with the goal of relieving pain and suffering, both AI and opioids can be a legitimate tool for healing. But if bad actors exploit their addictive properties to enrich themselves, the result is either dependency or death.I remain hopeful that there is a place for AI companionship. But only if it’s backed by robust science, and deployed by organisations that exist for the public good. AIs must avoid the sycophancy problem that leads vulnerable people to delusion. This can only be achieved if they are explicitly trained to do so, even if it makes them less attractive as a potential companion; a notion that is anathema to companies that want you to pay a monthly subscription, without which you lose access to your “friend”. They must also be designed to help the user develop the social skills they need to engage with actual humans in the real world.The ultimate goal of AI companions should be to make themselves obsolete. No matter how useful they might be in plugging the gaps in therapy access or alleviating loneliness, it will always be better to talk to a real human.Justin Gregg is a biologist and author of Humanish (Oneworld).Further readingCode Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AIby Madhumita Murgia (Picador, £20)The Coming Wave: AI, Power and Our Futureby Mustafa Suleyman (Vintage, £10.99)Supremacy: AI, ChatGPT and the Race That Will Change the Worldby Parmy Olson (Macmillan, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The big ideaRelationshipsComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 28 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 11.54 ESTShareMaddy, 24I would tell him about my hook-ups, including a threesome I’d hadLuke and I started as a one-night stand that was so drunken he fell off the bed. That was at university three and a half years ago; last month we got married.We’re both Catholic, and he was a couple of years older, deeper in his faith and about to graduate when we met, so nothing came of it. We stayed friends, and I would tell him about my hook-ups, including a threesome I’d had, hoping it would make me seem interesting and available, but it actually put him off.I had quite a lot of casual sex at university – I was having fun, but also chasing affirmation, reassurance that I was desirable. But I began to regret my promiscuity after reconnecting with my faith in my final year. I realised the sex hadn’t meant much to the people I’d had it with, and decided to wait until I was in a committed relationship.We probably do it three to five times a week, but I wonder if we should be doing it every dayTwo years after our first encounter, I drunk-texted Luke to say I was in the city where he lived. We slept together, and spent the weekend together. I moved in with him three weeks later, and after four months, he proposed. We tried, and failed, to implement a no-sex-before-marriage rule; I wore pyjamas to bed, we stopped buying condoms, but none of it worked.There’s pressure as newlyweds to constantly be at it, as if our relationship is defined by how much sex we’re having. We probably do it three to five times a week, but I wonder if we should be doing it every day. I have a higher sex drive than Luke, and still use sex for affirmation. So when he’s tired or not in the mood, my insecurities flare up. I worry that he was more attracted to the women he’s been with before. I ask: “Do you think she’s prettier than me?” He reassures me, but it doesn’t quieten the voice that says I’m not enough.I hope I’ll get better at ignoring that voice, because I love life with Luke. I love that he only cares about things that have meaning and doesn’t care about the things that don’t. Now that we’re married, the sex feels freer. We recently had sex in a train toilet, which was gross, but a first for both of us. And now, we feel satisfied after sex, rather than like we’ve failed.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

At university, casual sex and heavy drinking didn’t feel true to who I am. It left me feeling guilty. I’d have one-night stands, then go to confession. Now that Maddy and I are married and sex no longer carries that weight, I feel liberated.Sexas something to be enjoyed is completely new for me.With Maddy it’s passionate and emotional. But the emotion comes first – I don’t have strong urges or see sex as a necessity. I even considered becoming a priest because I was comfortable with celibacy. Sometimes I worry I’m not sexual enough for Maddy. She says: we’re young, we’re married, we should be having sex every day.As we know the people each other have been with, we both get insecure. I’ve heard the stories and can picture the scenarios. And because Maddy has explored more, I worry about being measured against her past experiences.As Maddy told me about the sex she was having while also saying she wanted a relationship, I felt jealous and confusedThe first time Maddy and I slept together was the first time I’d had sex in two years. Our night together, although very fun, only reaffirmed my belief that sex was bad and reflected poorly on me. When we met again six months later, my commitment to celibacy had become quite negative – I was lonely and full of self-loathing. As Maddy told me about the sex she was having while also saying she wanted a relationship, I felt jealous and confused. But when we reconnected a year and a half ago, instead of overthinking, I knew I wanted to commit to Maddy.After spending four years dancing around a relationship, it is everything we wanted it to be.Marriage has given us the freedom to explore without guilt. For the first time, sex is fulfilling. Maddy is the only person in the world who understands who I am. Modern life can feel very hectic, but when we’re in bed talking after sex, everything slows down. It’s as though we’re the only people in the world.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think the only way to truly solve a housing crisis is to build – if you’re not building houses, that’s still going to cause property prices to rise.MikeI don’t know what you do about the issue, but I worry about using specific taxes to achieve particular aims, as there is no guarantee it will have the desired outcome.View image in fullscreenSharing plateAlexPeople have different understandings of what woke means. My friends and I don’t take the term too seriously. We’d use it in a joking way; if someone says something that’s right and aligns with progressive liberal values, we might still teasingly call them woke. I understand why some see woke as bad; you get a lot of people virtue signalling on certain issues without understanding the full history and context.MikeMy feeling is that often I respond positively to what people identified with woke culture are saying, because it’s difficult to argue with. Do you want more polluted air or less polluted air? I’m not saying it isn’t annoying. There’s nothing more irritating than being told you’re an idiot by a teenager – but it doesn’t mean they’re wrong.View image in fullscreenFor aftersMikeWe both felt the BBC was a vital part of British culture. But they try to find a balancing point of view even when there is none – nearly 100% of experts say you can’t deny climate change is happening. My view would be you just say: “This is what everybody thinks bar one or two people.” And just get on with telling the story.AlexI agreed with his point about the problem with impartiality. But because we live in a society where people are consuming media in so many different forms, climate denialists are going to seek out that point of view elsewhere and will always feel the BBC is biased; I think that means it’s more important than ever to aim for impartiality.View image in fullscreenTakeawaysAlexI had a lovely time, and it makes me realise how important it is to talk with people, to engage and to actually be mindful of these issues.MikeI think he’s a good example of where there might be hope for broadcasting.

Will creatine bolster your brain power? Does pickle juice prevent cramp? Here’s what we learned about living well this yearJoel SnapeSun 28 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareThe best advice for living a healthy, well-adjusted life – eat your vegetables, get a good night’s sleep, politely decline when the Jägerbombs appear – never really changes. Other nuggets, such as how much protein you should be eating or how to maximise workouts, seem to change every year. But as we wonder whether we should really give sauerkraut another go, science marches on, making tiny strides towards improving our understanding of what’s helpful. Here’s what you might have missed in the research this year, from the best reason to eat beetroot, to how to ruin your five-a-side performance before the game even starts. There’s still time to break out the pickle juice shots before 2026 …Collagen might help you jump higherCollagen’s effects on your skin might be slightly overstated – a2023 reviewof more than two dozen trials concluded that supplementation has benefits for hydration and elasticity, but the effects aren’t huge. However, there’s another reason to take it:a 16-week trialon healthy young men, the results of which were published in July, found it can enhance muscle-tendon stiffness, which appears to improve explosive strength. Start with 10g a day: you might not look any younger on the pickleball court, but there’s a chance you’ll improve yourErne shot.Hot baths might be the next best thing to training up a mountain …If you want to do altitude training to improve your endurance in the UK, you’re out of luck – even Ben Nevis, at 1,345 metres (4,413ft) tall, is a bit short of the 2,000 metres or so where oxygen really starts to thin. But there might be another option: a study published in May oncross-adaptation, where the training effects from one stressor (such as heat) might carry over to another (such as altitude), put 20 well-trained adults on a high-intensity interval training programme and then dunked half of them in hot water after their sessions. After six weeks, they tested the athletes under low-oxygen conditions and found the hot-bath gang’s time to exhaustion was 25% longer than the control group’s. Jumping in a 42C bath after a bunch of sprint intervals probably isn’t anyone’s idea of a good time – and proper hydration is crucial – but if you’re training for an altitude-based race, it’s worth trying.… and cold after training is probably badIf you’ve spent time onFitstagram, you’ll have seen people jumping into everything from Alpine lakes to wheelie bins full of ice to boost post-training recovery – but evidence is mounting that it might have the opposite effect. Astudy published in Septemberfound that when young athletes plunged one leg into chilly water after a resistance workout it reduced blood flow and the delivery of amino acids – which would actually stunt, rather than promote, muscle growth.View image in fullscreenBeetroot juice is good (again)Remember the beetroot juice craze of 2012? It’s fine if you don’t: the short version is that it’s a natural source of dietary nitrate, which the body converts to nitric oxide, improving blood flow and lowering the “oxygen cost” of exercise. Top-flight athletes started taking it, and so did part-time Pelotonians – but the benefits for most people weren’t huge so the fad fizzled out. Now, the purple elixir is making a comeback: in a studypublished in August by researchers at the University of Exeter, taking concentrated juice “shots” twice a day lowered blood pressure in older adults after just two weeks. Adults in their 60s and 70s saw improvements in their oral microbiome – beneficial bacteria increased while harmful ones decreased – helping to convert nitrate to nitric oxide, which is key to healthy blood vessels. The same effect didn’t seem to occur in younger volunteers, so if you aren’t a fan of beetroot you can put it off until later – or try nitrate-rich alternatives such as spinach, rocket, fennel, celery and kale.Exercise seems to help with internet addictionWe should be trying to cut down on TikTok and YouTube Shorts – ameta-analysispublished in September suggests increased use of shortform video and scrolling interfaces are associated with poorer cognition, reduced attention and more stress. Quitting is easier said than done, but physical activity might help. In adifferent analysis, published in January, exercise interventions reduced internet addiction and improved the psychological symptoms of college students suffering from it. It’s important to note that “open” motor skills – where you’re forced to make quick decisions – are more effective than “closed” ones, such as lifting weights or swimming laps. Time to sign up for that Brazilian jiu-jitsu class …Gargling with pickle juice can stop crampsSportspeople have been glugging pickle juice for a while – the England men’s football teamreportedly used itto treat cramps during Euro 2024 – but it really had a moment during this summer’s French Open, with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner knocking it back during their five-set final. It’s a source of electrolytes – sodium and potassium in particular – but the anti-cramp effect seems to come from the sour taste, which stimulates reflex signals that make muscles relax. The good news is that you don’t even need to drink the juice for it to do the job – swilling it around in your mouth can work, witha previous studysuggesting it can take effect in 35 seconds.Creatine might help your brain (or make up for a bad night’s sleep)Though it’s often used by bodybuilders and athletes to let them push harder during workouts, evidence is mounting that creatine might bolster your brain. It canhelp cognition in older adults, according to a study published in September, andmight improve clinical outcomesin menopausal women, according to one out in August.Sex is a mood booster … for up to two daysThere are a few benefits to regular rolls in the hay – frombetter sleepto a loweredrisk of death from heart disease– and new research suggests that it can also give you a mood boost that lasts for up to 48 hours. Astudy published in January using diary datafrom almost 600 volunteers found that “sexual afterglow lasted at least one day on average, particularly following partner-initiated and mutually-initiated sex”, and might last up to two days.Eating more fruit might protect your lungs from pollutionIt’s not ideal that 90% of the global population is exposed to air pollution levels that exceed WHO guidelines. If you’re looking to offset the effects of dirty air, new research suggests that diet could offer a backup.A study out in September, using UK Biobank datafrom about 200,000 people, found that a healthy diet is linked to better lung function regardless of air pollution exposure – and that women who ate four or more portions of fruit a day appeared to have smaller reductions in lung function associated with air pollution than those who ate less. “This may be partly explained by the antioxidant and anti-inflammation compounds,” noted study lead Pimpika Kaewsri. “These could help mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation caused by fine particles, potentially offsetting some of the harmful effects.” Write to your MP, but have an apple in the meantime.Sitting for hours isn’t good for your brainBad news if you’re a fan of front-loading your daily exercise – staying sedentary for hours is associated with neurodegeneration as you age, even if your physical activity levels are high. Established back in 2012, the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project is a longitudinal study investigating vascular health and brain ageing, anddata collected from more than 400 of its participants, and published in May, suggests that more sedentary time is associated with worse executive function, memory and cognitive function.View image in fullscreenGoing on your phone before five-a-side might ruin your first touch …Doomscrolling before Monday night football might seem sensible: a bit of aggression never hurts on the pitch, so why not get angry about everything? Sadly,a study of volleyball players, published in February, suggests otherwise: when a group of teenage athletes went on social media before training, their attack efficiency diminished, so being “too online” can actually harm concentration before a match.… and being dehydrated might make you more stressedGot a few horrible days in the office coming up? It might be time to invest in one of those big water jugs. In a study published in theJournal of Applied Physiologyin September, volunteers were labelled as “low fluid” (if they drank less than 1.5 litres of fluid per day) or “high fluid” (if they regularly met the daily water intake recommendations – 2 litres for women and 2.5 litres for men). Then they took the Trier Social Stress test, a way of provoking anxiety in subjects by putting them through a mock job interview and mental arithmetic questions. The low fluid group showed a cortisol response to stress more than 50% higher than those who met daily water intake recommendations – which could, over the long term, be harmful to health.Drinking coffee helps your heart– if you do it in the morningIf you haven’t already been browbeaten into not drinking coffee after 1pm by the sleep-optimisation lobby, there’s one more reason to keep your mochas for the morning: it seems to be better for heart health. Analysis of more than 40,000 adults published in January found that morning coffee drinkers were 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease during a 10-year follow-up period than those who went without – but there was no significant reduction in mortality for all-day drinkers compared with those who avoided coffee.There was already researchto suggest that up to three cups of coffee a day can help heart health, but it’s unclear why the effect disappears for afternoon drinks – one possible explanation is that it disrupts sleep, with all of the negative effects that entails. There’s also hope for people who just love the taste of an after-lunch americano: if coffee’s protective effects come from anti-inflammatory compounds, as some researchers speculate, then decaf would have similar benefits … without ruining your shut-eye.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFitnessHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I may have just the story you’re looking forMartin KettleA single act of kindness reminded me that, despite so much evidence to the contrary, the better angels of our nature are not necessarily doomedSun 28 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 13.41 ESTSharePerhaps you are searching for reasons to be cheerful at the end of what has been a particularly dispiriting year? In that case, read on. In November, I was on a train travelling into London. When I got off the train and headed for the ticket barrier, I realised I didn’t have my wallet. I knew that I had it when I boarded. I made an undignified scrabble and search through my coat, jacket and trouser pockets that deserved the comic skills of a Charlie Chaplin or Jacques Tati. There was, though, no mistake. I had somehow managed to leave my wallet on the train.A nice station attendant took the details and said he would pass the message down the line. I left him my mobile number. But it was rush hour, the man pointed out, and the chances of getting the wallet back had probably vanished with the departing train. Meanwhile I rang my bank and eventually succeeded in cancelling my cards. I felt horribly stupid, old and embarrassed. I went for a drink with friends and felt sorry for myself.A couple of hours later, I looked at my phone. Among my emails was one from a woman called Natalya. She had found my wallet on the train, she explained, and had already dropped it off with the security people at the Guardian’s office. Everything was intact, including the cards and some cash. She had seen the Guardian connection because of my National Union of Journalists card, and had taken the not inconsiderable trouble to go to the office and hand the wallet in.One of my friends is prone to ask people if, in these dark political times, they can nominate three things that should give us all cause for optimism. You might want to try it, because it’s a harder exercise than it sounds, but for me, the story of Natalya’s kindness offers a reassuring start. I imagine Shakespeare must have had a story of this sort in mind when he wrote that lovely line in the Merchant of Venice about the candle whose beam shines like a good deed in a naughty world.Cheeringly, I am not alone. Only a couple of weeks after I got my wallet back, I read an article by the Belfast Telegraph’s excellent journalist Sam McBride, which began: “Last week I was about to get on a bus in Belfast city centre when I realised that the wallet I thought was in my hip pocket wasn’t there, wasn’t in my bag, wasn’t in my coat – wasn’t anywhere on my person.” And, yes, you guessed the rest. A little while later, Sam’s phone had rung with the news that the bus driver had handed the wallet in, cash untouched.Perhaps McBride’s experience and mine were just a coincidence – two journalists separated by the Irish Sea experiencing the same good fortune at the same time. Perhaps, if so, they illustrate a version of Rupert Sheldrake’s deeply controversial theory of formative causation, or so-called morphic resonance, in which humans in different places somehow learn to behave differently without anyone urging them to do so or without anyone orchestrating it.The safer explanation, however, is simply that there are more Natalyas than you may think. Maybe alotmore. I’m not saying that if you lose your wallet, I can guarantee you an observant good citizen who will ensure you get it back. Like Shakespeare, we live in a naughty world. But I am prepared to say that the chances of you encountering the kindness of strangers, as I did, are quite a bit higher than the unremitting bleakness of an all too common view of Britain in 2025 might lead you to believe.There is no way around the fact that the media – traditional and social alike – are sleepless drivers of our reflexive collective pessimism. We live in a country where failure, risk and danger are deemed ever present and on the increase. Our media endlessly reports terrible cases of cruelty, exploitation, greed and anger. As a result, no one in my profession would ever think my wallet story was worth sharing, except perhaps at Christmas.Of course, in the wider scheme of things, my wallet story was trivial. But reflexive pessimism is a big issue for modern societies, not a little one. Here’s a wider illustration of how it can work. When Andy Burnham was health secretary in the Gordon Brown government, he invited a group of us into Whitehall to share some private polling that was worrying the government. The polling showed public expectations of the NHS were getting lower, driven largely by repeated news of healthcare crises. At the same time, however, the public’s own personal experiences of the NHS, and the experience of their closest relatives, remained almost uniformly excellent.I remember feeling sceptical about these findings. I knew too many bad NHS stories, even back then, as well as some better ones. But the questions Burnham posed in the light of the department’s own focus groups remained valid. How do we get past the public’s conviction that the macro-NHS was in decline, and that they had simply been lucky? How do we get people to see that their own good experiences were not freak good fortune, and to have confidence that the NHS – or a myriad other embodiments of the common good – could deliver for all?In essence, this is the same possibility that is posed by Natalya’s single act of kindness. You can put it in various ways. Maybe all of us, and our media and our politicians in particular, are too quick to believe the worst. Maybe our social and moral norms are more decent and resilient than we assume. Maybe we live in a better country than we all seem to think. Maybe we should be less angry.If even some of this is true, the questions that follow from Natalya’s decency are ones such as these. What can we get beyond the belief, fired by so much political and media exaggeration, that we all inhabit a howling wilderness of incivility, misbehaviour and ineffectiveness from which our only refuge is either fear or repression? What can we do to help ourselves see that individual experiences of kindness, politeness and decency are not random oases of good fortune in a desert of general nastiness?The answers are obviously not easy. But they are out there, and they are worth nurturing. Natalya’s kindness reminded me that, in spite of so much evidence to the contrary, the better angels of our nature are not necessarily dead or doomed. There are still plenty of things in our society which work well, exactly as you want them to do.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionFriendshipcommentShareReuse this content"

But Donald Trump’s words bolster narratives of foreign ‘crusader’ aggressionSun 28 Dec 2025 09.32 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 10.04 ESTShareThe response of Nigerians to theairstrikesagainst Islamic State (IS) targets in Sokoto state, north-western Nigeria are complicated. The rationale behind them has been widely opposed, but the strikes themselves have been welcomed.The airstrikes were framed as a response to what have been described as genocidalattacks on Christiansin the country. But the Nigerian authorities have consistentlyrejectedthis narrative, arguing that armed groups in the country do not discriminate based on religion, and that Christians and Muslims largely coexist peacefully. Ironically, it was Trump’s redesignation of Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” in November that deepened Muslim-Christian tensions. Many northerners, who are predominantly Muslim, blamed southern Nigerians for championing a narrative that ultimately resulted in US sanctions and international stigma.The geographic and operational focus of the strikes has complicated the “Christian genocide” framing. Sokoto is the spiritual heartland of Islam in Nigeria, but armed violence in the area disproportionately affects Muslim communities. By contrast, attacks against Christian farmers are most prevalent in north-central states such as Benue and Plateau, where violence is often linked to armed Fulani herders rather than explicitly jihadist groups. The strikes targeted IS elements, not herder militias. Whilesome reportssuggest tactical collaboration between jihadist groups in the north-west and armed herders, the mismatch between the stated justification and the operational target raises questions about whether Washington fully understands the local drivers of violence it has labelled genocidal.Despite there being opposition to – and confusion over – the rationale behind the strikes, they have been broadly welcomed, cutting across religious, ethnic and social divides.Earlier fearswere shaped by the spectre of the prolonged US occupations in Libya, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, cases frequently cited in Nigerian media. By contrast, the Sokoto operation was a limited, targeted precision strike. Moreover, there have so far been no credible reports of civilian casualties, alleviating a major concern in a country where Nigerian air force operations have, on several occasions, accidentally killed hundreds of civilians.The strikes against IS came at a time of public fatigue with insecurity caused by insurgency, terrorism, banditry and communal violence. Nigerians were ready to accept almost any intervention that promised relief. As terrorist networks become increasingly interconnected across the Sahel and West Africa, Nigerian security forces have become overstretched. Persistent corruption, inadequate training and equipment shortages continue to undermine counterinsurgency efforts. In some theatres, groups such asBoko Haramand its splinter factions now wield more sophisticated weaponry than state forces.Why has Trump ordered strikes in Nigeria and what has it got to do with the persecution of Christians?Read moreThe Nigerian authorities have confirmed that theyendorsed the operation. The minister of foreign affairs, Yusuf Tuggar, acknowledged that Abuja provided intelligence that enabled the strikes and Nigerian officials remained in communication with US forces until minutes before execution. This joint counter-terrorism action, rather than a unilateral violation of Nigerian sovereignty, eased concerns about territorial integrity and external military overreach.Despite the support, Nigeria’s insecurity will not be resolved through airpower alone. Airstrikes may yield short-term tactical gains, but they risk generating longer-term strategic setbacks. Framing the intervention as the defence of persecuted Christians may strengthen extremist narratives of foreign “crusader” aggression, potentially attracting more external funding and support for jihadist groups. Organisations such as Isis-Sahel and emerging groups such as Lakurawa thrive on such symbolism.The durable solution lies in starving violence of its fuel by addressing its structural drivers: deep socioeconomic inequality (Sokoto has one of the highest numbers of out-of-schoolchildren in Nigeria), desertification and climate stress, weak state presence in rural areas, porous borders and fragile security institutions. Strengthening state capacity to manage grievances, regulate competition over land and resources, and counter extremism remains the only sustainable path to peace.Onyedikachi Madueke is a security analyst at the University of AberdeenDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The sinister watch towers with their searchlights and armed guards, the minefields in no-man’s land, the notorious Checkpoint Charlie border post, and the Wall itself –all were swept asidein an extraordinary, popular lunge for freedom.Less than a month later, on 3 December 1989, at a summit in Malta, US president George HW Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev declared that after more than 40 years,the cold war was over. All agreed it was a historic turning point.Yet fast forward to December 2025, and one question persists: did the cold war – the west’s many-fronted, global confrontation with Moscow and its allies – ever truly end? Led byVladimir Putinfor the past 25 years, Russia has resumed the familiar role of an aggressive, expansionist power stalking Europe’s borderlands. Ukraine, the Baltic republics, Georgia, Moldova, even Poland, are again treated as property or prey.With hindsight, it seems that 1989 “turning point” was less than wholly decisive. In fact, it has been turned on its head.This phenomenon is nothing new. Successive generations typically believe their experience is unique – yet, historically, factually, ideologically, they are usually wrong. When major geopolitical shifts occur, they are breathlessly described as “historic” and “unparalleled”. Because history is insufficiently studied, because perspectives are limited by human lifespans, because the same mistakes are repeated over and over, momentous events are hailed as watersheds, landmarks and epochal inflection points. Almost invariably, they’re not.Think of theArab Spring of 2010-11, a series of uprisings hailed as a Middle Eastern democratic renaissance. Those hopes were soon dashed. Think of 9/11, which led the US to declare a “global war on terror”. That, too, was deemed unprecedented at the time. Yet if any lasting change occurred, it was in the damage done to international law, respect for sovereignty and human rights. Think Afghanistan. ThinkIraq. Both invasions are now widely viewed as mistakes.In a world fixated on sensational, ostensibly seismic upheavals, the realisation that many such events are false dawns – products of national delusions, strategic miscalculations and ahistorical misperceptions – is salutary and reassuring. Putin’s 2022 Ukraine invasion isa disaster for Russia. Brexit is proving chastening and instructive. Now – too slowly – it’s beingpainfully reversed.There’s a lot to be said for continuity, and there’s a lot more geopolitical continuity around than is generally allowed. Despite the disruption, schisms and confusioncaused by hard-right politicianspromoting nationalist-populist panaceas, culture warriors campaigning to change the world and unregulated online media hyping flashpoints and spreading disinformation, the basics don’t change that much.Revolutions are overrated, intrinsically unpredictable and typically followed by counter-revolutions. True turning points in history are actually quite rare – and difficult to spot. Even rarer are genuinely world-changing leaders.Donald Trumppresents a case study.The way Trump tells it, he’s Alexander, Charlemagne, George Washington, Napoleon and Mahatma Gandhi all rolled into one. Yet after a decade at the top of US politics, solid achievements are few. His peacemaking flounders, his economic and trade tariff policies falter, his personal approval ratingtumbles. Towering ego, ignorance,vulgarityand bottomless narcissism are Trump’s only exceptional traits.Right now, the global and domestic upheavals triggered by Trump and Maga seem transformational. They are symbolised by the new US national security strategy – an authoritarian,anti-European, transatlantic alliance-rupturing charter. On all sides the cry is heard: “The old order perishes. Chaos looms!” Yet looked at in the round, the Trumpian moment is fleeting. Trump, 79, has three years remaining in power, at most. Even if a loyalist wins in 2028 – a huge “if” – no heir can match his monstrous appeal. His Maga coalition isfracturing.It’s claimed Trump has permanently changed how Americans view the world. But they said that about 1930s America First isolationism, and that didn’t last, either. Time will show the Trump era to be less turning point, more freakish aberration – a sort of Prohibition for populists. In history’s bigger picture, Trump is a blotch, an unsightly smear on the canvas.When Putin, Xi Jinping and Netanyahu go, successor governments may opt for reform, as was the case post-Stalin and post-MaoAt an unsettling moment in world affairs when the tectonic plates are shifting (to recycle another melodramatic cliche), it’s important to stay grounded, to maintain perspective. As 2026 trepidatiously creeps through the door, nursing hangovers from the tumultuous year just ending, try counting the continuities and bridges rather than dwelling on earthquakes and chasms.Given a free choice (which is the whole point), democracy, for all its flaws, continues to be thepreferred system of governanceworldwide. Divisive hard-right and neo-fascist parties remain, mostly, on the fringe; they do not rule. Authoritarian leaders such as Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu have no recognised successors, not least because they fear usurpers. When they go – and it won’t be long – successor governments may opt for reform, as was the case post-Stalin and post-Mao.Most countries still support the UN and respect international law. Music, film, theatre and the arts continue, overall, to connect and bind the peoples of the world, as does sport, the great global leveller.Religious faith, broadly defined, acts as a timeless, superhuman unifying force, despite the distortions of extremists. And the quest for knowledge and understanding, pursued through schools, universities, scholarship, historical research, books, scientific inquiry and technological innovation, inexorably advances with each new generation.If one is allowed a wish for 2026, it’s that there be no great geopolitical turning points, no epic spasms or watersheds (with possible exceptions for Putin’s defeat and Trump’s resignation). Most people, given the option, would surely prefer to live their lives peacefully, striving to improve their lot and that of others, free from importunate, lying politicians, divisive dogmas, shaming bigotry, competing great power hegemonies and renewed conflicts.Que no haya novedad–let no new thing arise, as the old, wistful Spanish saying has it. For a still hopeful, vibrant world haunted by fear of another cold (or hot) war, it would be a gift and a blessing.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsRussiaVladimir PutinChinaAsia PacificEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Self-service checkouts, electronic shelf labels, handheld barcode scanners and the video screens showing you – caught byAI facial recognition cameras– leaving the shop.In an economy struggling for growth, the encroachment of these machines in our everyday lives could be an early sign of a new dawn – a tech-driven renaissance in activity after years of flatlining growth in productivity and stalled business investment. No bad thing.On the other hand, it could be the glimpse of a dystopian future that is already beginning to take shape. Of retailers using tech with low running costs instead of low-paid, but relatively more expensive, humans. A productivity boom. But who for?In the past yearunemploymentin Britain has risen to the highest rate in a decade, excluding the height of the Covid pandemic. Meanwhileeconomic outputhas maintained a reasonable, if pedestrian, pace of growth. Put those two things together and rising levels of productivity – output per hour of work – is the mechanical consequence.Much of the gains are down totumbling employment in low-paying sectors– retail in particular, where jobs are being shed and hiring frozen in the face of rising labour costs.Bosses have blamed the government. This year’s £25bn hike in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and living wage increases are among reasons the British Retail Consortium (BRC) gives for a10% jump in the cost of employing peoplein full-time entry-level retail roles. The trade association also complains about Labour’s employment rights bill and packaging costs hitting jobs.At this time of year, retailers typically take on hordes of staff for the festive season. However, this year has not matched the usual pattern.Figures from the jobs website Adzuna showed retail vacancies fell by almost 6% in November, typically the key month for hiring. Openings are atthe lowest point in a decade, excluding the Covid pandemic.Much of this is down to feeble consumer demand and the boom in online retail. However, the rise of the machines is also playing a role. Industrysurveysshow investment in automation rank second as the most common response to Labour’s business tax changes, after raising prices.Taken together, it is hardly surprising retail employment hascollapsed by more than 350,000in the past decade.Young peopleapplying for lower-skilled, entry-level positions – which also happen to be easier to automate – have borne the brunt.Within Labour circles, there is an unspoken logic to driving up the cost of employment. For too long, firms have relied on paying poverty-level wages to turn a profit. UK firms havelagged behind in the G7 investment league tablesfor decades. Economists reckon some of that is down to a lower relative cost of employing labour versus capital – especially in volatile economic times.Recently, however, the balance has shifted. Employment costs are up; access to immigrant labour is down, andworkforce participationhas fallen amid rising levels of ill-health and early retirement. Much of this is the outcome of policy choice.“The higher your employment costs, regulation, and risk around hiring – the more likely you are as a business to consider options to automate,” says Tera Allas, a professor at theProductivityInstitute, a research organisation.So far, the data shows the UK is still in the foothills of the turnaround.Business investment has not exploded, but is rising – with a1.5% increase in the third quarter. Meanwhileproductivity rose 1.1%compared with a year earlier. Although still short of the 2% pre-2008 financial crisis annual average productivity growth, that is better than the flatlining of investment of recent years.Successive governments have treated productivity as a silver bullet to Britain’s decades of economic underperformance. None, however, would have campaigned for any gains to come at the expense of workers.There is also an irony in the prospect of a “jobs-lite boom” underLabour– a party tracing its roots, however thinly today, to the struggle of organised labour amid the galloping productivity gains of the Industrial Revolution.In the early 19th century, factory owners investing in steam-driven power looms, knitting frames and mill engines fuelled a productivity boom. At first, the spoils went largely to the capitalists – in a period later described as “Engel’s pause”, after the philosopher Friedrich Engels, to describe the years of wage stagnation as Britain became the world’s richest economy. Many angry workers turned to rebellion.In the long run, living standards rose as workers shifted into new occupations. The Luddites were on the wrong side of history. However, progress was not without social upheaval, nor taken for granted. There were struggles for employment rights and pay through the nascent trade union movement – culminating in political representation and the creation of the modern welfare state.There are clear parallels today. This month,Andrew Baileywarned that job displacement similar to the Industrial Revolution was highly probable – with the Bank of England governor calling for the UK to have “training, education, [and] skills in place” to help those at risk.Allas says there are reasons to be hopeful, not least because new technologies typically help to create new forms of work – enabling people to leave behind menial tasks. Businesses, too, worry about the consequences of losing their pipeline of middle managers if all the entry-level work is automated out.“Humans are infinitely resilient. We have a capability to learn and we’ll figure out how to learn in new ways,” she says.However, there will be serious problems if the transition is not managed well. Workers will demand to be brought along, not left behind. For Labour there are a few lessons from history.Explore more on these topicsProductivityEconomics viewpointRetail industryUnemploymentFacial recognitionArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

The holidays are no longer something to construct but something to receiveMaking sense of itis a column about spirituality and how it can be used to navigate everyday lifeSun 28 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 17.06 ESTShareJust over a year ago, my mother died. It was a few months after my second baby was born and a month beforeChristmas. She was the last in the generation above me, and this fact reordered things in ways that are only just revealing themselves.This time last year, I was still unravelling – months of hospitals, grief and the unmanageable weight of suffering pressing into my postpartum body.Roshi Joan Halifax, a Buddhist teacher, once said that grief, particularly that for a parent,scours the heart. The life I once had was disintegrating. Yet what I found at the bottom was not pessimism or despair but rather a softening. A welcome and changing sense of who I was in the world.The late psychologistJames Hillmancalled this kind of season the process ofgrowing down– sinking deep into the roots of things, relaxing into the life we are given, not the one we imagined.In my growing down, what once felt urgent no longer felt compelling. I stopped fretting over the small stuff and I started to notice that the present carried all sorts of offerings I had been too distracted to savour. It felt like a kind of effortless mindfulness, a natural consequence of a directencounter with impermanence.A hidden life in the era of social media can still change history, as the story of Jesus shows | Justine TohRead moreGone are the years of racing from shop to shop, collecting toys, vouchers, last-minute gifts and those very particular treats for a new year’s party. I still do those things, of course, but more as a dawdle. And I catch myself muttering, “Who cares about lunch! To hell with gifts.”Don’t get me wrong, I look back on those frenzied preparations with fondness and I don’t rule out their return. My mother spent her whole working life in retail and, when I was a child, department stores felt magical, full of possibility and aliveness.But this year I don’t feel the need to curate my holidays into an “experience”, an “event” or even something special. Instead I find myself open to what greets me through the senses – taste, touch, sight, scent – and through memory and imagination. All freely given and undemanding in their nature.I remember the muggy Australian summer air as I make Turkish coffee in my mother’s kitchen, stirring heaped sugar into her tiny copper pot. The quiet of early morning streets. The magpie’s call. My partner thumbing through records, knowing he is about to choose Paul Kelly. My kids’ thrill at the resident Christmas elf, their squeals of rapture.It seems my centre of gravity has shifted. The holidays are no longer something to construct but something to receive.The Buddha taught that it isgrasping that leads to sufferingand that meeting things as they are leads to spaciousness, room to breathe. In Buddhist thought, when grasping falls away the world takes on greater clarity and vividness.Themiddle wayis a guide here. It invites balance and cautions against the extremes – the overindulgence of December or the punitive approach to new year resolutions. It also warns against rigid either/or thinking.So we approach our holidays tenderly, not overindulging and not denying ourselves necessary and small delights. And these small delights are unfolding right now if we care to look.As the Buddhist teacherJack Kornfieldexplains, this is a path “of balance and care, where the heart’s natural awareness and practical compassion can grow. Through this, we become gracious and free.”How can we navigate difficult conversations these holidays? Buddhism offers some guidance | Making sense of itRead moreOf course, for many, the period after Christmas can be stressful, painful or overwhelming. And choosing to pause is not available to everyone; the holidays can easily be overshadowed by financial stress, caring responsibilities or sheer exhaustion. I don’t mean to romanticise very real moments of suffering.But this receptive awareness can hold what is difficult as well as what is sublime.Thich Nhat Hanhsaid the most precious gift we can offer – to ourselves and others – is presence itself. And sometimes it takes difficulty, held with tenderness, to finally notice what has been in front of us all along.I have never related to the idea that life is a gift but maybe I was missing something crucial. Perhaps it is not one grand present tied in a bow but rather a series of small gifts being offered continually, ordinary yet beautiful in their ephemerality and particularity.I often imagine this is what Derek Walcott summons in the title of his poemLove after Love, which speaks to the moment we stop turning away from life and its unexpected splendour. He writes:The time will comewhen, with elation,you will greet yourself arrivingat your own door, in your own mirrorand each will smile at the other’s welcome,and say, sit here. Eat …The poem ends:“Sit. Feast on your life.”May it be so for you in these suspended, in-between days.Explore more on these topicsBuddhismMaking sense of itNew yearChristmasBereavementParents and parentingFamilyReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

It’s lonely being the only person who cares about something. It’s even lonelier when the thing you care about makes you want to stamp your feet, tear your hair out and run naked into the streets while making the face of Edvard Munch’s The Scream. And so it is for me whenever I see a film poster, headline, book cover or screen caption featuring the incorrect use of the Cyrillic alphabet.You might think this is a niche preoccupation. But you would be surprised how many times the name of “STДLIN” pops up in poster designs, supposedly representing “STALIN”. This phenomenon annoys me most when the entity depicted is not fictional. If you write the (nonexistent-in-any-language) word “STДLIN” instead of “STALIN” you are writing “STDLIN”. Which would be fine if you were attempting some kind of wordplay comparing the impact of the one-time Soviet leader to a sexually transmitted disease. But clever wordplay is not the intention of these designs. The intention of the incorrect use of the Cyrillic alphabet is to indicate one thing and one thing alone: “This is about something that is happening east of Warsaw! It is probably connected to the former Soviet Union! It should give you a frisson of creepy exoticism!”The most famous of these alphabetical abominations include the opening credits for Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Red Heat (where his name is given in Cyrillic as “Lyaiold Schwlyazeieggeya”) and the posters for the moviesThe Death of Stalin,Chernobyl Diariesand Borat. The name of the eponymous fake Kazakh, for example, is rendered as “ВОRДT”. This reads clearly as “Voyadt” in Cyrillic. I did not suffer decades of learning Russian and Ukrainian to deserve this cerebral meltdown. It is equally undeserved by the 250 million global users of Cyrillic, from Azeris and Bulgarians to Macedonians, Serbians and numerous other nationalities, not least the 20 million entirely non-fake Kazakhs.Faux Cyrillic is prevalent enough in everyday design to have its own Wikipedia page where the phenomenon is described as “mimicry typeface” and rendered – painfully literally and truly horrifically – as “Fдцx Cчrillic”. This reads, in the most mind-boggling brain-bleed of them all, as “Fdtsx Schrillic”. I can just see someone like Elon Musk taking the name “Fdtsx Schrillic” and thinking: “That is a great brand name for my next metaversal AI interface venture.” Which is yet more proof that this typographical travesty has no place in a world where we want to encourage people to be more, not less, sane.Despite the many millions of potential fellow sufferers of faux-Cyrillic-phobia, I do recognise that I plough a lonely furrow. The only place in the universe where I have found any solidarity is, sadly, Reddit. Typical responses to the use of pseudo-Cyrillic: “My eyes are bleeding.” “Another Hollywood film-maker trying to make something look ‘Russian’ without paying someone who actually knows Russian.” “It’s annoying and maybe even a little bit racist.” “Bad design. Bad colours. Everything bad.” That’s exactly it: everything bad. These are my people.To my great joy, though, I have recently discovered a subset of my tribe: German speakers who object to the gratuitous use of the umlaut. This is commonly – cömmonly? – used in the world of heavy metal, the chief offenders being Blue Öyster Cult, Mötley Crüe and Motörhead. (See Kerrang’s gloriousBrief History of Heavy Metal Umlautsfor the full hall of shame.) In the case of Motörhead, there is no grammatical or linguistic reason for the second “o” to have the umlaut any more than the first “o” to have it. But that’s the whole point: the reason is not to do with logic, reason or the laws of any known alphabet, it is to do with implication. It is about the shared emotional language of the onlookers: “We don’t care if this looks weird to you, it means something to us. And you are not one of us.”I suspect the same is happening with Fdtsx Schrillic. As Motörhead’s Lemmy said of his umlaut: “I only put it there to look mean.” The misuse of language is there to menace, to emphasise the “other”, to suggest the exotic, the foreign, the “enemy”, to separate “them” and “us”. But it isn’t mean or scary. It is just very, very silly indeed.Viv Groskop is a comedian and author ofOne Ukrainian SummerExplore more on these topicsLanguageThe hill I will die onGraphic designLanguagescommentShareReuse this content"

Today we look skyward, where a new lunar contest mirrors humanity’s struggle to live within planetary limitsSun 28 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 15.04 ESTShareDuring the cold war’s space race, the Apollo moon missions were driven by the need to prove American superiority. Having made that political and technological point with the 1969 moon landing, the contest between Moscow and Washington petered out. A new dash across the skies kicks off in2026, reigniting geopolitical competition under the guise of “peaceful exploration”. The moon’s south pole is emerging as the most valuablereal estatein the solar system, offering “peaks of eternal light” for solar arrays andice depositsin craters shielded from the sun.The US and a China-led bloc are eyeing the lunar surface and its potential to control a post-terrestrial economy. Space had been humanity’s last commons, supposedly shielded by the 1967 UN outer space treaty that bans state exploitation of the heavens. It is vague, however, on private claims – a loophole that is now fuelling a tycoon-led scramble for the stars. The aim is obvious: to act first, shape norms and dare others to object. Two lunar missions launching next year– Nasa’sArtemis IIand China’sChang’e 7– are competing for strategic supremacy.To hasten the commercialisation of space, Donald Trump isshrinkingstate support for Nasa, which will have its smallest budget since 1961. Washington wants space exploration to be led by the private sector, a wish anchored in the Artemis accords. Signed by more than 40 nations, the accords are a vision of extending earthly ownership structures into space – and one embraced by tech moguls such asElon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Little wonder, then, that Mr Musk aims to float his space exploration firmSpaceXin 2026 for $1.5tn.By contrast, the International Lunar Research Station – China’s joint effort with Russia and global-south partners – embodies a state-led approach that seeks to escape an American-led system. China and Russia say that they are complying with UN rules because their lunar bases will be under an international “collaborative” consortium not any one state’s control.Superpower rivalryThe result is a rivalry with two camps both publicly invoking “peaceful exploration” while engaging in strategic competition for lunar resources. Already there are claims thatwatercould produce rocket fuel and sustain life. Others speculate whethermoon rockmight be useful for construction. These are essentially rhetorical claims – like the oft-repeated assertion that space’shelium-3is a potential fusion fuel. These are arguments, however thin, for governments to justify lunar spending with the promise of future potential.Nuclear fission on the moon, by contrast, is a concrete engineering race, with the US andChina-Russiaalready funding reactor designs necessary to support human lunar colonies. Nasa intends to do so withinfive years; China and Russia say theirs will be running by2035. The technology is not new: small fission reactors inspacewere part of cold war duelling. But the moon looks like a proving ground. Reliable nuclear power during the 14-day lunar night would be needed for permanent human bases. Once solved, the same power technology can be taken toMars. Mr Trump has alreadysaidUS astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on Mars.The1992 UN principlesrelevant to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space provide a framework for safety and risk reduction, but not a regulator. The nation that works out how to achieve reliable off-world energy systems could determine the balance of industrial and digital power for the next century.The drive to leave Earth is often characterised as humans’ need for discovery and exploration. But there may be something more pressing: humanity is using up natural resources1.7 times fasterthan our planet’s biocapacity can regenerate them. There are essentially three ways out: become more efficient by squeezing more GDP per unit of energy; green the production, distribution and consumption of the economy to bring capitalism in line with ecological limits; or move energy-intensive processes off-world.Much ofSilicon Valleyfavours the last techno-optimist option rather than the first two Earth-based approaches. Google wantsdatacentres in orbitpowered by solar energy. Energy and computer arms races have merged in a startling admission that Earth-based datacentres are approaching ecological and political limits. The answer: Google is to put them in the skies. As artificial-intelligence demand and electrification accelerate faster than terrestrial grids can decarbonise, the incentive for off-Earth, continuous solar energy will grow stronger. What begins as pragmatic innovation could end as a new phase of extraction: a search for energy and compute capacity once Earth’s limits have been reached.Red MarsLife may be imitating art. Kim Stanley Robinson’s classicsci-fi Mars trilogyopens in 2026 with humanity’s first colonial voyage to the planet. In its first book, Red Mars shows Earth’s nations and corporations over decades compete to control the new frontier. Robinson’s “Transnats” foreshadow today’s private contractors and state conglomerates. Echoes of the novel’s debates – nuclear versus solar, terraforming versus preservation – can be found in the real space race today. And just as the colonisation of Mars was justified by Earth’s ecological decline, today’s lunar exploration is rationalised by “resource utilisation” – using the moon’s resources to reduce dependence on the home planet. The logic subtly inverts the problem: planetary overshoot becomes a licence to expand it.Red Mars ultimately warns that humanity would export its old politics to new worlds with disastrous results. Before occupying another planet, the novel’s message is that we must first learn to live sustainably on our own. We can escape Earth but, the novel asks, can we escape ourselves? Yet today, space law is being fashioned to allow appropriation under the guise of peaceful, commercial activity. The US’s2015 Space Actpermits the mining of asteroids as if they were open seams of ore. Nasa’s moon rock returns helped the US Congress justify space property rights – opening the door for humanity’s last commons to slide into corporate hands.In the last instalment of Robinson’s trilogy,Blue Mars, by the year 2225 settlers are living in harmony with the world they have made. Humans terraform Mars andbegin, at last, to inhabit it responsibly. One can only hope we understand that far sooner.Explore more on these topicsSpaceOpinionThe moonMarsUnited NationsRussiaChinaElon MuskeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer’s biographer Tom Baldwin has noted that Starmer is an iterative problem solver who gets the right solution, eventually.There are three problems with this approach; most importantly, when his starting point is too distant from the right solution he wastes time that could be better put to increase the number of successful achievements; second, he ends up looking weak to parliamentary opposition and the electorate because he’s reversed his position so often; and lastly, he causes anger, frustration and resentment within his own party.In short, Starmer should listen seriously to his opponents in his own party. When his initial instinct is to instead suppress opposition, it is no wonder that it takes him so long to work out when he is in the wrong.Hylton GuthrieNorth Shields, Tyne and WearPolly Toynbee rightly draws attention to Labour’s successes, but, as she says, “what’s the use” when the government and its leader are so unpopular. She is correct that voters have little patience with incumbents’ failure to produce change, compounded in this case by policy errors and an inability to tell a convincing story. The danger is that without some restoration of Labour’s fortunes, defeat by the far right beckons at the next general election, when many of Labour’s achievements will be dismantled.In these circumstances, the prospects under an alternative leader will continue to be a matter for speculation. One of the hardest choices for a leader will always be to consider whether their own position helps or hinders the prospects for their party and the country.Keir Starmermay well come to reflect that stepping aside at the appropriate time would enable transition to a new leadership better equipped both to unite the party and collaborate with others to ensure there is no return to the destructive rightwing policies of the past.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondonPolly Toynbee points to the achievements of the government since July 2024, but we have been here before. It was not popular on the left to say so, but New Labour did some positive things – from the minimum wage to investment, albeit qualified by privatisation. All that, however, was overshadowed by the Iraq war, just as currently Gaza rightly looms large. Labour needs to get rid of its imperial delusions, or, as the Sex Pistols sang almost 50 years ago now, there is no future in England’s dreaming.Keith FlettTottenham, LondonFinally, someone with the courage to list the positive achievements of this government. I am heartily sick of the expectation that so many years of Tory mismanagement can be turned around in five minutes. Get behind this team and give them a chance.

I believe that it is important to share examples of a middle way somewhere between free birthing and obstetrical violence. Personally, I chose the middle way.My child was born at home. At the time, we were living off grid in an isolated village in France. We knew of many women who had chosen to give birth at home in our village accompanied by the only independent certified midwife in the area who accepted the risk of accompanying home births in this particularly isolated place.We were also friends with a registered physiotherapist – a mother to three children born at home – who agreed to accompany me throughout my pregnancy and who promised to be with us on the day of the birth of our child.On the day of the birth of my child, guided by our friend, I stayed in conscious movement the whole day throughout the contractions. Our midwife arrived late in the day, a couple of hours before the actual birth.I was able to maintain control of my body with the presence of the father of my child and two professional, highly experienced women by my side to ensure my safety and that of my baby.We need informed comparative research about mother and baby mortalities in unassisted and hospitalised births. Without clear figures, women are left in a state of confusion and fear, making an informed choice difficult.Olympia BowmanDie, FranceIt is absolute nonsense to say the risks of giving birth without medical assistance “are not well understood” (Editorial, 15 December). We know the risks from thousands of years of history when very many women died from childbirth and many babies were stillborn, and when mothers and babies were often severely damaged if they survived; and from other parts of the world now, we know exactly what those risks are.Helen StyleRichmond, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

One of the key groups of women she cites in this campaign were the “187 sewing machinists at Ford’s Dagenham Plant” who “forced the issue” with their 1968 strike for equal pay.The sewing machinists did not go on strike primarily for equal pay. They were outraged that the 1967 new grade structure introduced by theFordMotor Company had evaluated the their work as grade B. The sewing machinists believed their work was at least semi-skilled and should have been graded C.Barbara Castle was brought in to negotiate with the sewing machinists, who had brought the Ford production line to a halt. Following her intervention, the machinists agreed to return to work, having been offered an increase in pay which, over two years, wouldraise their payfrom 85% of the male grade B rate to 100%.It took until 1984and another strike by the sewing machinists, who once again brought the Ford Motor Company production lines to a halt, for their grievance to be addressed. They made a claim under theEqual Value (Amendment) Regulations of 1983. A panel under the auspices of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service iunanimously evaluated the machinists’ job as grade C. Finally, they won recognition of the skill and value of their work.Sarah BostonLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

City finished without a major trophy for the first time since 2016-17, Guardiola’s first in charge, but are hunting a seventh Premier League title under him after six straight wins.Rayan Cherkistruck late on at Nottingham Foreston Saturday to maintain City’s impressive winning run, which extends to eight in all competitions. Second-placed City are two points behind leaders Arsenal, who host third-placed Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. City do not return to action until Thursday, when they face high-flying Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.Rayan Cherki grabs Manchester City winner to deny bold Nottingham ForestRead moreGuardiola pinpointed last summer’s Club World Cup as a “critical moment” on their path to this point. Asked what changed in the US, where they exited at the last-16 stage, the City manager laboured his point. “Energy, energy, energy,” he said. “Me first. We lost it last season. We started to train better, to compete better. After that we can talk about three at the back, four at the back, wingers or full-backs – that is all bullshit. We needed to get energy back, and then you have a good environment.”Guardiola acknowledged he was personally drained last season. “It was something … something was in the fog in Manchester, surrounding our training centre. We missed something. It is not switching on or off [energy]. Managers are not magicians, click your fingers and everything is clear. Sometimes you need time. Winning helps to advance this process.”During the off-season Guardiola also reshaped his coaching staff, with Jürgen Klopp’s former assistant Pep Lijnders, the club’s former defender Kolo Touré and the set-piece coach James French, also formerly of Liverpool, forming a new-look setup.View image in fullscreenJames French (far left), Kolo Touré (centre, left) and Pep Lijnders (centre, right) were appointed to Pep Guardiola’s backroom staff this summer.Photograph: MB Media/Getty Images“Everyone was happy,” the City manager said. “[We] made a lot of dinners, a lot of talks, [about] what we have to do next season. We wanted to extend it, just to live that. I think there, after talking with Pep and James, Manel [Estiarte, a longtime adviser to Guardiola], Hugo [Viana, City’s director of football], Txiki [Begiristain, their former director of football], we turned around and said something changed. Something [you can feel],” Guardiola said, rubbing his thumb against his index finger.“It doesn’t mean you are going to win but that you are able to recognise the team. Now it is eight victories in a row [in all competitions]. It is not easy but we compete in the way we do. We have to improve, absolutely, but this mindset is better.”Asked if he was concerned his vigour may not return, the 54-year-old replied: “No. Energy can go down but energy can go up. Never in our lives is it the same. In [our] professional or personal [lives], you’ll never be happy or sad all the time. You have to realise why, to realise what we missed, to come back.

Keep the skills sharp, keep the mind keen. But how big a test? How tough? How many beats per minute? How much spinal fluid do you want to shed? How close do you really want to get to smelling the paint on the exit door?Luke Humphries reckons he got it about right here, and for now we will have to take his word for it. But the outpouring of emotion we saw at the conclusion of his 4-2 win over Gabriel Clemens was a measure of just how thoroughlythe 2024 world championhad been rattled by a man whose game had basically been in hibernation for the past three years.PDC world championship: James Hurrell stuns Stephen Bunting in thrillerRead moreIt was in 2023 that Clemens unexpectedly reached the semi-finals, catalysing a revolution in German darts in which everyone assumed he would play a leading part. Instead, his game disintegrated alarmingly. He stopped qualifying for the majors, didn’t even make Germany’s World Cup team and by the end of this year was ranked No 47 in the world and in a genuine fight for his 2027 tour card.But on Sunday, in a room packed with roaring German package tourists, he waddled back on to this stage and unleashed the pure magic of which he has always been capable. From trailing 3-0, by the end he had three darts to level a scintillating game at 3-3. He averaged 115.6 in the fourth set, 101.5 overall, the first ever German to clock a three-figure average at the world championships. He may still be No 47 in the world, by dint of the sport’s maddeningly inelastic ranking system. But he now knows to expect better.What to make of Humphries in the meantime? On one hand, the ability to prevail under immense pressure is what marks out a true champion. On the other, you could argue that his measured, undemonstrative stage game almost encourages opponents to play their best stuff against him. This is going to sound like a mad question, but are there times when Humphries is too consistently excellent for his own good?Think back to Peter Wright in the fourth round last year. Luke Littler and Gian van Veen in major finals this year. Call it aura, alpha energy, stagecraft, dark arts. The intangible ability to rip up the script, harness the moment, make the other guy doubt himself. Phil Taylor had it. Littler has it. Humphries, by and large, does not. It may just be the one absence in an otherwise flawless game.Either way, we are yet to see the best of Humphries, and arguably we are yet to see the best of Michael van Gerwen either. After his 4-1 victory over Arno Merk the triple world champion looked bemused when the Sky Sports interviewer suggested he had been in a tough contest. “Was it a contest?” he retorted. “Not for me. I played an OK game. Overall, I can’t really complain.”3:00‘From pubs to the Palace’: Jonathan Liew at the World Darts Championships – videoCertainly Van Gerwen’s game looks more robust than it has done at various points of a difficult year. He is no longer falling forwards at the oche, a glitch that resurfaces during his tougher moments and forces him to pull his first dart low. But as ever with Van Gerwen, it comes down to whether he can double. He was good here, 50% on the outer ring. He may need to need hit similar levels in his last-16 game against Gary Anderson.For the 2015 and 2016 champion looks in vintage nick, beating Jermaine Wattimena 4-3 in a game that occasionally touched the hem of greatness. It was seven sets of pure cinema, a rapid, breathless game that Anderson should probably have closed out far sooner. Remarkably it was exactly the same scoreline by which Anderson beat Wattimena in the same round eight years ago.View image in fullscreenMichael van Gerwen’s game looks more robust than it has done during a difficult year.Photograph: John Walton/PA“I was getting palpitations, never mind flashbacks,” Anderson joked afterwards. But he knows, too, that his game is in good working order. In a dramatic final set he went eight darts into the perfect leg before finally sealing victory. His third set average of 121.3 was the second highest of anyone at the tournament. He leads the 180 standings by a clear distance. If he can tighten up on the outer ring, then never mind Van Gerwen: the entire tournament may just be at his mercy.Little by little, the big names are clanking into gear. Rob Cross and Ryan Searle both looked ominously strong in whitewash victories over Damon Heta and Martin Schindler respectively. Van Veen saw off Madars Razma of Latvia to make it into the last-16 while barely stretching himself.An intense sweat or a brief stroll: yes, there are many different workouts available under the roof of the Palace gym. But the tests only get tougher from here.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipLuke HumphriesDartsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now the Panthers will need to win at Tampa Bay next weekend to win their first division title since 2015 and snap a seven-year playoff drought.Bryce Young was limited to 54 yards on 14-of-24 passing and threw an interception for the inconsistent Panthers, who followed up a win with a loss for the fifth straight time. Young ran for 30 yards and accounted for Carolina’s only touchdown with a 10-yard scamper.Carolina were limited to 139 yards of offense.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 17-20 Miami DolphinsRookie quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for 172 yards and two touchdowns, including a 63-yard toss for his first career score, and the Miami Dolphins beat the slumping Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20-17 on Sunday.The Bucs (7-9) remained one game behind theCarolina Panthers(8-8) in the NFC South after the Panthers’ 27-10 loss to Seattle on Sunday. The Buccaneers would still clinch their fifth consecutive division title and sixth straight playoff berth by beating Carolina in next week’s regular-season finale.But Tampa Bay has lost four straight games, seven of its last eight and has barely looked like a playoff team during that stretch. The Buccaneers’ last four losses have all been by one possession.Despite three turnovers and being outgained 145-53 on the ground Sunday, Tampa Bay pulled within three after a three-play, 91-yard drive that Baker Mayfield capped with a four-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans with 54 seconds left.A busted coverage by the Dolphins defense led to a 59-yard reception by Chris Godwin that set up the score, but Miami recovered the ensuring onside kick to end Tampa Bay’s comeback attempt.Arizona Cardinals 14-37 Cincinnati BengalsJa’Marr Chase caught two touchdown passes from Joe Burrow, who threw for 305 yards as the Cincinnati Bengals beat the Arizona Cardinals 37-14 on Sunday.Chase finished with seven catches for 60 yards and became the first player inNFLhistory with at least 80 receptions, 1,000 receiving yards and seven TD catches in each of his first five seasons.Burrow passed for 300 yards or more for the 28th time, tying Andy Dalton for the most in franchise history. Chase Brown ran for 101 yards and two touchdowns as the Bengals (6-10) improved to 3-2 since Burrow returned from left toe surgery.Arizona’s Trey McBride had 10 catches, giving him 119 this season to break the NFL single-season record for a tight end, topping Zach Ertz’s 116 in 2018. He also broke DeAndre Hopkins’ Cardinals record of 115 catches, set in 2020.The Cardinals (3-13) had the seventh-ranked pass offense the league, but the improved Bengals defense held them to 233 total yards. Jacoby Brissett threw for 212 yards and two TDs.New England Patriots 42-10 New York JetsDrake Maye threw a career-high five touchdown passes before getting the rest of the game off in the third quarter, New England scored a TD on its first six drives and the Patriots finished the regular season undefeated on the road by dominating the New York Jets 42-10 on Sunday.Rhamondre Stevenson had a TD run and catch for the Patriots (13-3), who moved closer to winning the AFC East title for the first time since 2019. They’ll do so if Buffalo loses or ties against Philadelphia later in the day.Maye was 19 of 21 for 256 yards and a 157.0 quarterback rating with TD tosses to Stevenson, Stefon Diggs, Austin Hooper, Hunter Henry and Efton Chism III before being lifted by coach Mike Vrabel for Joshua Dobbs with 5:31 left in the third quarter. Maye joined Tom Brady (11 times) and Drew Bledsoe (twice) as the only New England quarterbacks to reach 4,000 yards passing in a season.Dobbs’ first drive ended the Patriots’ touchdown run, with New England settling for a field goal on its seventh possession – but Andy Borregales clanked the 41-yard attempt off the right upright.It didn’t matter much by then, though, as the Patriots cruised to their eighth 13-win season in team history.

It is the first time since 10 December 2009 that the Browns defeated the Steelers and held them without a touchdown.Cleveland scored on their first two possessions and jumped out to a 10-0 lead.Jacksonville Jaguars 23-17 Indianapolis ColtsTrevor Lawrence ran for two scores, Cam Little kicked a tiebreaking 42-yard field goal with 6:58 left, and the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Indianapolis Colts 23-17 on Sunday, moving within one victory of their first AFC South title since 2022.The Jags (12-4) won their seventh straight game one day after two-time defending division champ Houston beat the Los Angeles Chargers to remain in contention for the title. The Texans’ victory also eliminated the Colts from playoff contention.Jacksonville’s Liam Coen became the first coach in NFL history to take over a four-win team and win 12 games the next season.Lawrence went 23 of 37 for 263 yards, though his streak of consecutive games with at least 225 yards passing, two TDs and a passer rating over 100 ended at four. He did not have a touchdown pass and he threw his first interception in five weeks.The Jags kept 44-year-old Colts quarterback Philip Rivers winless in three games since he returned to the league following a five-year retirement.New Orleans Saints 34-26 Tennessee TitansTyler Shough threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Austin Jr with 6:22 left to put New Orleans Saints ahead to stay as they rallied from a 13-point deficit to beat the Tennessee Titans 34-26 Sunday.Shough improved to 5-3 as a starter, helping the Saints (6-10) win their fourth straight. He outplayed Cam Ward, the No 1 overall pick in the draft, in this NFL’s third game between starting rookie quarterbacks this season. Shough was 22 of 27 for a career-best 333 yards and two touchdowns with a 142.7 passer rating.Audric Estime added a 32-yard TD run with 3:44 left as New Orleans dominated the second half. The Saints both outscored the Titans 24-6 and outgained them 331-152 after halftime.Chase Young had one and a half of the Saints’ four sacks and also stripped Ward and returned the fumble 33 yards for a touchdown. Charlie Smyth kicked a pair of field goals.

The Bills thought they had a touchdown one play earlier, but Dawson Knox was ruled short of the goal line after a replay review.Rather than playing for overtime, coach Sean McDermott opted to go for two. Allen dropped back in the pocket and had a defender in his face when he let loose a pass that was about a foot wide of Shakir.

How should we feel? What are the roots that clutch? What branches grow out of this stony rubbish? For most of its combined 142 overs, watching England’sfourth Test victoryin Melbourne felt like drifting in and out of a drunken sleep while trying and failing to follow the plot of a particularly gruelling action movie.Why is this car chase happening? Why is The Rock defusing a torpedo inside a collapsing Maya temple? Why are they running to the top of the nearest generic tall building for this final, final, final showdown? Wait. Will Jacks is playing?‘Everyone is still human’: Travis Head sends message of support to Ben DuckettRead moreAustralian cricket has at least taken decisive action. It seems a collective policy decision has been made to categorise this as a game to be voided. The talk is of unacceptable grass. The curator Matt Page, whose name, in a confusing note of nominative non-determinism, basically means “unresponsive surface”, has been subjected to the equivalent ofa congressional hearing.On social media Melbourne has been dismissed as a game no one actually won (England won by four wickets); an emblem of all that is spiritually wrong with the game; and a mutually culpable cash haemorrhage forCricketAustralia (England won by four wickets, too quickly). In the newspapers words such asunbefitting,uglyandmeaninglesshave been tossed about. England’s victory has been deemed an occasion “never to be spoken of again”, not even for Josh Tongue, who probably wants to talk about it quite a lot.In the process Australian cricket has arrived at its own version of England’s much-derided chat about moral victories in 2023. Here we have something new: theimmoralvictory. An immoral victory that, like the moral one, conveniently voids the actual scoreline. Maybe you can buy these in Noosa too.They do have a point. Melbourne was junk-cricket for much of the game, played out on a furry green horror of a pitch. But this was also a genuinely notable overseas England victory. And a significant occasion in other ways too, evidence of a basic refusal to fall apart at this late stage, to be broken by the tour that breaks everyone.View image in fullscreenMelbourne confirmed that Josh Tongue is now the leader of England’s bowling attack.Photograph: James Ross/EPAFor England the search for meaning has rested mainly on the fourth innings batting, the reignition of the Baz-flame, 20 overs of aggressive stroke-play that made perfect tactical sense chasing on a seaming pitch. Zoom out a little, however, and there is something else. Bowling has always felt like the neglected hand in the current regime’s game of energy and intent, but it was also the key note here.Melbourne confirmed that Tongue, eight Tests in, is in effect the leader of the attack now. It also provided Brydon Carse with his best day in Test cricket, Carse who has been a whipping boy in defeat for some, dismissed as the captain’s best mate, an open pressure valve, a cautionary tale told by the god of stat-padding.There was always a lurking weakness in this injury-shadowed tour squad. With the collapse of the Broad-Anderson-Woakes-verse England lost 1,500 Test wickets. Jofra Archer and Mark Wood may or may not be back. So here we are. Tongue and Carse. This is England’s attack now, the International Cricket Council’s 29th and 43rd ranked bowlers, veterans of 21 matches between them, and also the source of 12 of England’s 20 wickets at the MCG.Tongue in particular was focused, hostile, accurate and unusually likable. There was something slightly jarring, in the moment, about hispost-match press conferenceon day one. England had just been bowled out for 110. There was dark talk already of 4-0 down with one to play.At which point Tongue breezed into the media dungeon beneath the MCG looking infectiously happy. He talked about dreams coming true and the fun of having his family there to witness his Boxing Day five-for. Twenty-four hours later he was man of the match in an England victory, the first England bowler to get one of those in Australia since Dean Headley (1998, Melbourne), Gladstone Small, (1986, Melbourne) and Norman Cowans (1983, also Melbourne).Tongue is a late-bloomer, aged 28 with some major injuries behind him. His method is alluringly simple – straight run, strong shoulders, full length – but also nuanced enough to provide an element of mystery. The arm at one o’clock, the angled seam, the way the ball shapes in and holds its line: there is a degree of inbuilt unorthodoxy here, qualities he has somehow maintained through the sausage-processing factory of pathway pace coaching.Tongue has 43 wickets now at 26 against mainly strong opposition. This is a genuine Test match bowler and a major tick, it should be noted, for the Key-Stokes-McCullum talent ID machine.Carse is two years older and more of a puzzle at this stage. His tour has been an oddity. The numbers are good in every area except economy. Look closer and 11 of his 19 wickets have been top order players, and just half of those for scores of 20 or less. Where Tongue has been decisive, with eight of his 12 wickets top order batters for low scores, Carse has often mopped up with England struggling, a solution to problems he has helped to create.View image in fullscreenBrydon Carse has had a difficult tour but has demonstrated a knack of making things happen.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesToo often Carse has seemed to have no default option, no stock ball, dishing up a random all-sorts box of German supermarket chocolates, the odd ripper, too many soft and sickly disappointments. But in Melbourne you got a proper sense of his value.A major plus at this stage: he isn’t broken, still works, has played all four Tests with no loss of intensity. There have been catches, run-outs, clutch moments. On the final afternoon in Melbourne Australia seemed to be edging ahead at in effect 161 for six.Cameron Green was lurking doggedly, albeit with the vague sense, as ever, that someone has wheeled a flatpack wardrobe out into the middle and left it in front of the stumps. Steve Smith was running through his range of bravura leaves, spreading his voodoo about the place, driving nicely when England overpitched.Carse made other stuff happen. He hit Green on the arm, took a fine caught and bowled, overstepped and got Mitchell Starc with his seventh ball. Even his horrible, cartwheeling cameo at No 3 when England batted seemed to generate the requisite sense of danger, the Don’t-You-Know-I’m-Loco energy of early Bazball.Tongue and Carse might end up a marriage of convenience, a winter sun fling, Mr Right-Now and Mr Other Right-Now. But this is what England’s attack has pared itself back to now, last men standing at the end of the Test of shame. If Carse, in particular, can maintain the pressure of that second innings in Melbourne, they might just have a chance of turning the screw once again.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketAustralia sportThe AshesanalysisShareReuse this content"

You’ve spent four days eating and drinking, the belly is straining at the belt, work is looming on Monday and there’s a dreadful sense that the holiday is over and you’ll soon have to get back to mundane chores: defrosting the freezer, filing the tax return, shopping for real food that might actually have some nutritional value.For neutrals, this was the ideal game for dozing through on the sofa. Very little happened, and almost none of what did was pleasing on the eye, with the possible exception of the two passages of play Tottenham put together that led to Richarlison scoring goals that were subsequently ruled out for offside. At the start of play it was ninth v 14th and in the first half especially, it looked like it. It was bitty, scrappy, ugly, and included many of the worst elements of Long Throw Britain.Archie Gray heads Spurs to victory at Crystal Palace to ease pressure on FrankRead moreOliver Glasner looked thoroughly fed up, his frustration evident in every wander to the edge of his technical area. Three minutes into the seven added minutes at the end, he sat down glumly, folded his arms, and seemed only with a great effort of will to be able to stand up and propel himself forward again, hands whirring as he yelled: “Four more minutes. Come on!” It felt a characteristically understated howl of despair.On another day Palace might have nicked an equaliser – Justin Devenny andMaxime Lacroix both went close. On another day Kevin Danso might have been sent off for clipping Devenny’s heel as he ran clear in the fifth minute. But this never felt like their day; they were sluggish and uninspired, the toll of their European and Carabao Cup campaigns perhaps catching up with them. The uncertainty over Glasner’s future doesn’t help but on the evidence of the past couple of weeks, perhaps he has hit the realistic ceiling of where he can take them.Not that Tottenham will care. When you’ve lost six of your previous 10 games, you’re not in a position to be choosy. And not that Archie Gray will care as he finally scored his first Tottenham goal on his 60th appearance. It says much for his precocious excellence that that still made him the youngest Englishman to score for Spurs in the league since Dele Alli on this ground nine years ago. Where Alli’s was a strike of notable brilliance, though, Gray’s, in keeping with the occasion, was nudged in from a couple of yards as Spurs won three headers following a corner. If you can’t do anything with the second ball, at least make sure you’re winning the third balls.View image in fullscreenArchie Gray heads home the game’s only goal, his first for Spurs.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesGray is 19 years and 291 days old (four days older than Alli was when he scored here) and represents one of the obvious positives of this Tottenham squad. He’s already started 64 league games and it’s probably been to his benefit thatThomas Frankhas used him more sparingly this season.Plenty of players have been ruined by being overexposed too young and there seemed a real danger last season that he could be an indirect victim of Tottenham’s defensive injury crisis as he was forced to fill in as a makeshift centre-back in a team that was not noted for its defensive solidity.But he’s come through that and now seems to be blossoming into the player it looked like he could be at Leeds. The goal is a statistic, no more, although his obvious delight at scoring and broad grin at the final whistle suggested how much it meant to him, but far more significant was his general contribution.It was his pass inside the full-back that led to the cross for Richarlison’s second offside goal, but he had also supported Rodrigo Bentancur at the back of midfield. In that sense it was a classic performance from one of the midfield shuttlers, making his blocks and interceptions, but always ready to stride forward and distribute sensibly.He and Lucas Bergvall could easily form the basis of the Spurs midfield for years, although Tottenham would need to find some more creativity in wide areas if their midfield three is ultimately to comprise a holder and two such hard-running players. And that perhaps is the problem for Frank. He has found another win and so, for now at least, quelled the mounting doubts, the sense of a team losing its way and its discipline that was soapparent against Nottingham Forestand Liverpool. But nobody could call this performance beautiful.Whether that matters is perhaps subjective, but Tottenham are a club that, as trophies have eluded them, have come to value beauty. They might not win, is the self-consoling logic, but they do things the right way. Grinding like this is fine if it produces victories, particularly in the short term, but it means there is nothing to fall back on if results go awry. There is a cohort of Spurs fans sceptical of Frank purely because he came from Brentford; a diet of attritional long punts, grit and effort is only going to fuel their fears.For now, though, Spurs can celebrate a Gray Christmas.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceTottenham HotspurThomas FrankanalysisShareReuse this content"

Second place in the Prem table heading into 2026 with momentum building nicely is a very different story from last season’s grim struggle and, in front of a 15,000 capacity crowd, here was another example of exactly why they are a developing force.While this was not quite as compelling as theirpre-Christmas raid on Saracens, the Chiefs could conceivably have registered another half-dozen tries in the absence of Len Ikitau, their injured Wallaby centre. Another barnstorming display from No 8 Greg Fisilau set the standard and the whole side showed enough physicality and defensive hunger to leave the Tigers to survive on seasonal scraps.I was there: Red Roses lifted the Rugby World Cup with a roar like no otherRead moreChiefs, bottom of the heap 12 months ago, might even have been on top entering the new year for the first time in five years had they not been denied a try bonus point at the death. Campbell Ridl and Will Goodrick-Clarke both dropped balls over the line but even without them their side now sit only a point behind leaders Northampton, with next week’s visit to Bath looming as a significant game for both sides.Northampton’s fabulous weekend performance at the Rec will already have provided food for thought for those in contention. Bath still have a hefty international contingent and it could be that sides like Exeter will be fresher than others over the season’s closing months. Rob Baxter is no one’s fool and already looks to be ahead of schedule in terms of reconstructing another squad capable of winning major titles.The latest template is not entirely unfamiliar: the marauding Fisilau, scorer of his side’s opening try after just seven minutes, could be a spiritual descendent of Sam Simmonds or Thomas Waldrom, while the box-office, tackle-busting energy of Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has echoes of prime Jack Nowell.Quick GuideExeter 24-10 Leicester: teams and scorersShowExeter Chiefs:Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Rigg (Haydon-Wood, 72), Ridl; Skinner, Varney; Sio (Goodrick-Clarke, 58), Dweba (Yeandle, 58), Tchumbadze (J Roots, 69), Jenkins (capt), Zambonin (Tuima, 69), Hooper (James, 60), E Roots, Fisilau.Replacements (not used):Chapman, JohnTries:Fisilau, Ridl, Varney.Cons:Slade 3.Pen:Slade.Sin-bin:Tuima, 75.Leicester:Steward; Radwan, Perese (Hamer-Webb, 60), Kata (Bailey, 32), Hassell-Collins; Searle, Whiteley (Van Poortvliet, 32); Smith (Haffar, 63), Blamire (Theobold-Thomas, 72), Heyes (Hurd, 50), Henderson, O Chessum (capt), Moro, Reffell (S Williams, 39), Cracknell (Thompson, 50).Try:Henderson.Con:Searle.Pen:Searle.Sin-bin:Searle, 61.Referee:A Woodthorpe (RFU).Att:15,000.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Perhaps most tellingly of all, though, the physical crunch is back. In place of the old family firm led by Dave Ewers et al there is now a new-look heavy mob fronted by Ethan Roots and that kind of hard-nosed mindset tends to be infectious. One seriously big tackle from Feyi-Waboso on his opposite winger, Ollie Hassell-Collins, certainly dislodged a lot of hyphens.Baxter also remains good at spotting raw talent, planing away the rough edges and unleashing it without great fanfare. The latest off the production line is the 20-year-old Ridl, born in Tooting but reared in South Africa, who has come through the ranks at Exeter University and represented England at U20 level.View image in fullscreenExeter’s promising Campbell Ridl flies over the line against Leicester.Photograph: David Davies/PAChiefs already have some eye-catching wingers but any of them would have been proud of the spectacular solo try that Ridl contributed to extend Exeter’s lead to 14-0 after 25 minutes. Turnover ball offered the rangy Ridl some broken-field space and a chip over the top and impressive acceleration turned a half-chance into a 50-metre cracker.A properly one-sided contest looked possible following another sharp chip-and-chase effort by Harvey Skinner, only for it to be ruled out for an off-the-ball push in the buildup. For the first time Exeter sat back momentarily andLeicestertook advantage, a midfield linebreak resulting in Cameron Henderson bursting clear to score.With Henry Slade also denied inches from the line by a last-gasp Jack van Poortvliet intervention, the half-time score of 14-7 did not remotely reflect the balance of play. Leicester under Geoff Parling, once an Exeter player, can also be a hard side to shake off and the first-half withdrawal of scrum-half Tom Whiteley, who had been ill overnight, and the hamstrung Solomone Kata also seemed to stiffen their resolve.Exeter’s bench, though, also gave them renewed impetus, along with a penalty from Slade. Another Ridl surge set up Skinner for a scything break that, again, was halted fractionally short of the whitewash, with Billy Searle subsequently earning a yellow card. Leicester did their best to cling on in his absence but a 71st-minute breakaway by Stephen Varney, teed up by Fisilau, effectively put the game to bed.Parling, in his first season as the Tigers’ head coach, was not happy. “For the first time this season we lacked a bit of edge in the first 30 minutes. That wasn’t our DNA today. We’re not good enough yet to have those off days.” His Exeter counterpart, Dave Walder, would also have preferred Chiefs to collect an extra point – “Deep down we’re a little bit disappointed with our accuracy” – but if they retain this level of physical appetite there will be plenty more good days to come.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyExeterLeicesterRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

He worked the other day and worked the sight out of your eyes, he was unbelievable.”The Gold Cup market is unusually open after Sunday’s race, with Inothewayurthinkin and Galopin Des Champs top-priced at 6-1 and 7-1 respectively, and Jango Baie (8-1), The Jukebox Man (8-1) and Gaelic Warrior (10-1) – the fourth, first and third home in Friday’s King George VI Chase at Kempton – next in the list.The shortest-priced favourite for any race at the Cheltenham festival after the first three days of the Christmas programme is Mullins’s Final Demand, who continued his flawless transition from hurdling to chasing with an effortless success in the Grade One Faugheen Novice Chase at Limerick.Final Demand was a creditable third after setting off as the 6-4 favourite for last season’s Baring Bingham Novice Hurdle at the festival but clearly had the physical scope to be better still over fences and scarcely came off the bridle on the way to an eight-length success.He was immediately cut to around even-money for the Brown Advisory Novice Chase, over three miles, at Cheltenham on 11 March.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bardot was briefly hospitalised in October for what her office called a “minor” procedure.1:07French icon Brigitte Bardot dies aged 91 – video reportThe town hall in Saint-Tropez, where Bardot had holidayed as a child and where she later shot the film And God Created Woman, said the actor had “helped make Saint-Tropez shine across the world”.The town said Bardot was its “most radiant ambassador” and part of “the collective memory of Saint-Tropez, which we must preserve”.Bardot shot to international fame in 1956 with And God Created Woman, written and directed by her then husband, Roger Vadim, and for the next two decades was said to have embodied the idea of the archetypal “sex kitten”. In the early 1970s, however, she announced her retirement from acting and became an outspoken campaigner on animal rights, and increasingly active politically on the far right.Bardot’s incendiary comments about ethnic minorities, immigration, Islam and homosexuality resulted in a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred. French courts fined her six times between 1997 and 2008 for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community. In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 (£13,000) for describing Muslims as “this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts”.Jordan Bardella, the president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party (RN), which Bardot supported, wrote: “Brigitte Bardot was a woman of heart, conviction and character. An ardent patriot, devoted to animals that she protected throughout her life, she embodied a whole French era, but also above all a certain idea of courage and freedom.”View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in 2007.Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty ImagesLe Pen, whom Bardot once described as “the Joan of Arc of the 21st century”, wrote on social media that Bardot was “exceptional for her talent, courage, frankness and beauty”. “She was incredibly French,” she said. “Free, indomitable, whole. She will be hugely missed.”Such was Bardot’s role in the far right’s cultural pantheon that tributes were also paid to her from Italy’s government, where the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, called her “a timeless star, but above all a woman who was free, nonconformist, protagonist of courageous battles in defence of our traditions”.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in 1958.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/AllstarThe Italian culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, said: “Brigitte Bardot was not only one of the great protagonists of world cinema, but also an extraordinary interpreter of western fundamental freedoms.” He said she “resolutely defended her vision of cultural and social values and civic engagement”.Brigitte Bardot – a life in picturesRead moreBorn in 1934 in Paris, Bardot grew up in a prosperous, traditional Catholic family but excelled enough as a dancer to be allowed to study ballet, gaining a place at the prestigious Conservatoire de Paris. At the same time she found work as a model, appearing on the cover of Elle in 1950 while still 15. As a result of her modelling work, she was offered film roles; at one audition she met Vadim, whom she would marry in 1952, after she turned 18. Bardot was cast in small roles, with increasing prominence, playing Dirk Bogarde’s love interest in Doctor at Sea, a big hit in the UK in 1955.But it was Vadim’s And God Created Woman, in which Bardot played an uninhibited teenager in Saint-Tropez, that consolidated her image and turned her into an international icon. The film was a huge hit in France, as well as internationally, and catapulted Bardot into the front rank of French screen performers.As well as for cinema audiences, Bardot swiftly became aninspiration for intellectuals and artists; not least the young John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who demanded their then girlfriends dye their hair blond in imitation of her. The columnist Raymond Cartier wrote a lengthy article about“le cas Bardot”in Paris-Match in 1958, while Simone de Beauvoir published her famous essay Brigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome in 1959, framing the actor as France’s most liberated woman. In 1969, Bardot was chosen as the first real-life model for Marianne, the symbol of the French republic.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in The Bride is Much Too Beautiful from 1956.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesIn the early 1960s, Bardot appeared in a string of high-profile French films, including Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Oscar-nominated drama The Truth, Louis Malle’s Very Private Affair (opposite Marcello Mastroianni) and Jean-Luc Godard’s Contempt. In the second half of the decade, Bardot took up a number of Hollywood offers: these included Viva Maria!, a Mexican-set period comedy with Jeanne Moreau, and Shalako, a western with Sean Connery.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in Doctor At Sea from 1955.Photograph: John Springer Collection/Corbis/Getty ImagesBardot also had a parallel music career, which included recording the original version of Serge Gainsbourg’s Je T’Aime … Moi Non Plus,which Gainsbourg had written for herwhile they were having an extramarital affair. (Afraid of scandal after her then husband, Gunter Sachs, found out, Bardot asked Gainsbourg not to release it. He went on to re-record it with Jane Birkin, to huge commercial success.)Bardot found the pressure of stardom increasingly irksome,telling the Guardian in 1996: “The madness which surrounded me always seemed unreal. I was never really prepared for the life of a star.” She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, after making the historical romance The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot. Her primary focus became animal welfare activism,joining protests against seal hunts in 1977and establishing the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in 1986.Bardot subsequently sent letters of protest to world leaders over issues such as dog extermination in Romania, dolphin killing in the Faroe Islands andcat slaughter in Australia. She also regularly aired outspoken views on religious animal slaughter. In her 2003 bookA Cry in the Silenceshe espoused rightwing politics and took aim at gay men and lesbians, schoolteachers and the so-called “Islamisation of French society”, resulting in a conviction for inciting racial hatred.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot  in 1958.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveBardot was married four times: to Vadim between 1952 and 1957; Jacques Charrier between 1959 and 1962, with whom she had a son, Nicolas, in 1960; Sachs from 1966-69; and to the former Le Pen adviser Bernard d’Ormale, whom she married in 1992. She also embarked on a number of high-profile relationships, including with Jean-Louis Trintignant and Gainsbourg.View image in fullscreenBardot outside court in Edinburgh in 1998 celebrating a reprieve for Woofie the dog, who was due to be put down for chasing a postal worker.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsBrigitte BardotFranceEuropeJean-Luc GodardWorld cinemaSerge GainsbourgAnimal welfarenewsShareReuse this content"

And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”From shrimp Jesus to erotic tractors: how viral AI slop took over the internetRead moreDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialistZohran Mamdaniinto office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech mogulsElon Musk,Mark Zuckerberg,Jeff Bezosand Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”Sanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”That theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor oflegislationto protect minors from chatbots.The proposedmeasure– the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.Britt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to themaboutsuicide”.She said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”Britt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types ofsensual and sexual relationshipswith young people or encouraging suicide”.From that bird guy to ‘bus aunty’: the real social media personalities rising above AI slopRead moreThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”Explore more on these topicsBernie SandersArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicsUS SenateUS CongressRepublicansComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Video from the scene shows a helicopter spinning rapidly to the ground. Police and fire crews subsequently extinguished flames that engulfed one of the helicopters.The Federal Aviation Administration described the crash as a midair collision between an Enstrom F-28A helicopter and Enstrom 280C helicopter over Hammonton municipal airport. Only the pilots were on board each aircraft.One person was killed and another was transported to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries. Video from the scene showed a helicopter spinning rapidly to the ground.Sal Silipino, the owner of a cafe near the crash site, said the pilots were regulars at the restaurant and would often have breakfast together. He said he and other customers watched the helicopters take off before one began spiraling downward, followed by the other.“It was shocking,” he said. “I’m still shaking after that happened.”View image in fullscreenAuthorities and investigators work the scene where police are securing wreckage following an inflight collision in Hammonton, New Jersey, on Sunday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating.Hammonton is a town of about 15,000 people located in Atlantic county in the southern part ofNew Jersey, about 35 miles (56km) south-east of Philadelphia. The town has a history of agriculture and is located near the Pine Barrens, a forested wilderness area that covers more than 1m acres (405,000 hectares).Dan Dameshek, a Hammonton resident, told NBC10 that he was leaving a gym when he heard a loud snap and saw two helicopters spinning out of control.“Immediately, the first helicopter went from right side up to upside down and started rapidly spinning, falling out of the air,” Dameshek told the station. “And then it looked like the second helicopter was OK for a second, and then it sounded like another snap or something ... and then that helicopter started rapidly spinning out of the air.”Investigators will likely first look to review any communications between the two pilots and whether they were able to see each other, said Alan Diehl, a former crash investigator for the FAA and NTSB.“Virtually all midair collisions are a failure to what they call ‘see and avoid’,” Diehl said. “Clearly they’ll be looking at the out-of-cockpit views of the two aircraft and seeing if one pilot was approaching from the blind side.”Although it was mostly cloudy at the time of the crash, winds were light and visibility was good, according to the weather forecasting company AccuWeather.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyHelicopter crashesAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

His leadership during that period reshaped the company. Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.”IBM had dominated the technology sector in the 1960s and 1970s with its mainframe computers. But having developed the IBM personal computer in 1981, the company lost ground in the booming PC market as competitors created “IBM-compatible” machines using Intel processors and Microsoft’s MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.Gerstner startled reporters after arriving at the then loss-making IBM bydeclaringthat “the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision” and insisting the top priority was restore the company to profitability and serve customers better.One of his many decisions was toabandon its OS/2 operating system, which it had hoped to use to challenge Microsoft’s dominance of PC operating systems.Gerstner had previously worked as president of American Express and CEO of RJR Nabisco before joining IBM. After he left, he chaired the Carlyle Group.Krishna said Gerstner had been a “direct” leader who expected preparation and challenged assumptions.“I have my own memory of Lou from the mid-1990s, at a small town hall with a few hundred people,” he told staff. “What stood out was his intensity and focus. He had an ability to hold the short term and the long term in his head at the same time.“He pushed hard on delivery, but he was equally focused on innovation, doing work that clients would remember, not just consume.”Explore more on these topicsIBMComputingShareReuse this content"

But it is a rare scene that defies a wider trend:more than 6,000 bank branches in the UK have closed since 2015as bosses try to cut costs and push millions of customers towards online services.Relief for customers may be at hand, however, with banks now pausing closures and opening new sites, in what appears to be a mini renaissance for bricks-and-mortar branches.HSBC UK pledged to keep all of its remaining 327 branches open until at least 2027, while Barclays – which has been one of the most aggressive in shutting sites – has extended opening hours at 87 of its 200 or so branches.Challenger banks are bucking the closure trend, too. Among smaller lenders, Metro Bank has launched three new locations in Gateshead, Chester and Salford, while Newcastle Building Society poured millions of pounds into a Grade II listed building to open a new branch in Newcastle city centre.“It’s interesting how the commercial decisions are starting to change,” Nikhil Rathi, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority told MPs this month. “You’re starting to see more of the major financial institutions actually seek to make a virtue of the fact that they’re going to keep branches open for a certain period, and that is a shift.”Nationwide has made one of the biggest commitments, promising to keep 696 branches open until at least 2030. That news was a relief for Jatish and Sudha Shah, a couple in their 70s, who were worried that their local Virgin Money branch in Northampton would be under threat following Nationwide’s £2.9bn takeover of the rival bank in 2024.Jatish, who is hard of hearing, often needs a private space to discuss his accounts. He visits the Virgin branch, which is just 300 metres from a Nationwide site, every few months to check on the couple’s ISAs.“I know we could do it online and I’m quite capable, but I prefer face to face,” he said. Had the branch closed, he added, the couple would have considered jumping ship to another bank.View image in fullscreenJatish and Sudha Shah rely on being able to visit the Virgin Money branch in Northampton.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianBy and large, however, decisions to keep branches open do not reflect a reversal in customer behaviour. The move to digital banking has led to an overall decline in the number of branch visits, according to KPMG research, which found that a fifth of UK customers had not visited a branch in the last two years.But banks are seeing the benefit of connecting with customers in person, albeit through a much smaller and cheaper network. “There is a sweet spot where you try and push as many customers on to digital channels as possible, but it is still constructive to have physical locations,” said John Cronin, the head of research and analysis firm SeaPoint Insights.Some of the shift is about serving older, and less technologically capable account holders, but it is also helping banks compete for small and medium business customers who need advice or help with paperwork.The trend is even drawing in digital natives, the younger generations that have long had access to online-only services such as Monzo, Starling and JP Morgan’s Chase brand. More 18– to 24-year-olds visited a bank branch last year than those aged over 65, with younger customers representing 72% of customers visits.“It’s a misconception that younger customers only care about digital banking,” said Peter Rothwell, a partner and head of banking at KPMG UK.“While they appreciate seamless apps, many still value having a local branch, whether it’s to deposit cash from a side job or a birthday gift.“At the same time, older customers remain some of the most loyal and financially significant clients, expecting not just convenience but also competitive rates and attentive service from their traditional banks.“To succeed, banks must deliver on both fronts, offering digital innovation without losing sight of the personal touch that matters to every generation.”Back on Abington Street, most of the customers streaming into Nationwide on a Friday morning were simply looking to make withdrawals at indoor cash machines. But some, like Diana Yates, 73, had bigger fish to fry, having made the trip to cash in her bond investments.View image in fullscreenNationwide customer Diana Yates.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“I have got internet banking. But because of my age and because I live on my own, I’m not confident doing things with large amounts of money on my own. I haven’t got anyone to sit with me and say, ‘Is this OK?’ They’ll do it all in the branch with me.”Gary Greenwood, a banks analyst at Shore Capital, said most banks were trying to morph into “hubs for advice rather than day-to-day processing”. That has meant providing more advice and support around investments and life events such as getting a mortgage or securing power of attorney when a loved one can no longer manage their own finances.That is where banking hubs–where lenders share a single location to make up for local branch closures– have been falling short. Many hubs offer only simple transactions and lack the personal touch, leaving many underused. KPMG said 72% of UK individuals have never visited a banking hub.Threats such as online scams and digital service outages are also making branches seem more attractive. While they are usually tied in to the same systems as the online service, it can provide a sense of security to know problems can be discussed in a physical branch with its own dedicated staff.Over time, Greenwood predicts, branches will become even more focused on narrow support functions, especially as older generations pass on. “Day to day transactions will be processed via self-service terminals while staff will be focused on providing value-added advice and resolving more complicated issues,” he said.Cronin believes artificial intelligence may also turn out to be a boon for branches, despite fears about the technology. Bank bosses hope it can replace many manual operations in back offices, potentially increasing scope for face-to-face contact.“That’s where the efficiency focus is,” Cronin said. “It was branches 10 years ago, and that has now largely played out. Maybe there is another wave of branch closures [coming] in a few years’ time [though]. I suspect that’s how it will play out: this is a pause rather than an end state.”Explore more on these topicsBanks and building societiesBankingConsumer affairsCommunitiesNorthamptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For some audiences, that’s quite an interesting gateway.”Asked if she considered streaming services such as Netflix as a direct competitor to theatre, Dawson said: “There’s a competition for people’s time and people’s money.“People are really excited by going to the theatre and coming out but it’s good for organisations to take a moment to think ‘Are we doing things that are interesting to our community? How do we fit in this space, both locally, regionally and nationally?’.”Dawson said audiences were less predictable than they used to be and larger commercial theatres had realised that a starry lead in a play could help them predict the demand for the show.However, she added: “The important thing is that they’re good productions, it’s about talent rather than getting to a point where it’s just a celebrity badge.”Another advantage was big stars’ attraction to theatre, with many seeking credibility, which again helped against “digital competitors”, Dawson said.Theatre was dealing with the “long tail” of Covid, Brexit and austerity, while also battling with cost of living, she said.But Dawson argued in support of increasing public subsidy for the theatre and arts, despite the headwinds faced by the UK government. She said Arts Council England grants had been at a standstill since about 2012, which in real terms equates to a near 50% cut.“The government is clearly having to make lots of decisions where they find public funds and there are absolutely vital parts of our society which needs investment, life and death parts, about dignity and care.“But I think, interestingly, the arts is a really important part of that picture. They can, if they’re properly resourced, add so much value.”Theatres were not political organisations but there was an expectation for them to reflect their values through their output, on the stage, Dawson said.“It’s about universal stories with themes that are relevant, that are important, and might make you think differently, might make you question something that you’d always thought and we want to get as many people through the door to come and see that.”Despite the challenges, Dawson is optimistic about the industry. “The arts in general and theatre is incredibly resilient. They are creative for a living, and they respond very well to challenging circumstances, and sometimes it generates really interesting new ideas. There’s room for creative risk that establishes Bristol Old Vic for the future.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreBristolnewsShareReuse this content"

In June thegovernment banned bonusescovering the 2024-25 financial year for the chief executives and finance bosses of Wessex and five other companies.Wessex received another £11m finelast month over more sewage failures.However, the water industry regulator, Ofwat, said that Skellett was able to retain the bonus under the law, because it was related to a different part of the parent company’s business. YTL is developing housing, offices and an arena in an area north of Bristol known as Brabazon.A spokesperson for Wessex and YTL said that the bonus “entirely relates to his new role and was entirely funded by YTL. In his new role Colin is responsible for YTL UK group businesses including the development of Brabazon New Town”.The large pay packets for water company bosses have become controversial in recent years amid widespread outrage over sewage leaking into Britain’s rivers and seas.Wessex Water paid Skellett £157,000 for three months’ work from July to September 2024, when he stepped down as chief executive after 36 years in charge. However, Skellett stayed on as chief executive of the parent company, and continues to draw a large salary.Despite Wessex Water describing his YTL job as a “new role”, Skellett has been a director of YTL Utilities (UK) since May 2002. In the last decade alone he has received £8.4m in pay for that job – including £3.4m in bonuses, according to the accounts for the business, which is the highest UK-registered company in the corporate structure. That is double the £4.2m he received in the same decade for his apparently separate but much more prominent job running Wessex Water Services – putting his total pay at £12.6m over 10 years.MPs and Ofwat have already raised questions over the lack of transparency over payments to water bosses from other group companies. The Guardian in August revealed that the boss of Yorkshire Water, Nicola Shaw, hadreceived £1.3m in undisclosed extra pay via an offshore company. Shaw was also allowed to keep the pay, after Ofwat determined it was not a performance-related bonus.Earlier this month Shaw told the BBC that it had been a “mistake” for Yorkshire Water to hide the payments, although she would not commit to refusing the extra pay in the future.“I do understand that we need to be transparent because people need to trust us. We’re providing the water and taking away the wastewater for them in Yorkshire and they need to trust us,” she said.The Guardian’s reporting prompted Ofwat to consult on changes toforce water companies to reveal pay from other companies in the same groupfrom next year.Bosses at six water firms had £4m in bonuses blocked under new rules, Ofwat saysRead moreAnna Sabine, the Liberal Democrat MP for Frome and East Somerset, said: “For far too long, water company fat cats have been taking huge bonuses for pouring filthy sewage into our rivers.“It is absolutely disgusting that the chief executive receive any kind of bonus after Wessex Water’s reckless and blatant disregard for nature, and even more disgusting that Ofwat allowed them to accept it on a technicality. The government needs to get far tougher with these water companies to end the sewage scandal, and put a full stop to bonuses until they do.”A YTL spokesperson denied that the bonus was a “technicality”, saying it related to the nine months after Skellett stepped down from Wessex Water.Ofwat itself is due to be abolished and replaced with a new regulator, with a government white paper setting out its new plans for the water expected in January.A chart showing the structure of the YTL group’s companies in Jersey, Malaysia and the Cayman Islands, as well as the UK businesses that include Wessex Water.Wessex Water was bought in 2002 by Malaysian group YTL, which was founded by the late billionaire businessman Yeoh Tion Lay. YTL, which is ultimately controlled by a company based in Jersey, bought Wessex Water from Enron, a US energy trading firm that collapsed because ofan enormous fraud. Skellett stayed on as chief executive until last year.YTL Utilities (UK) describes Wessex Water as its “principal subsidiary”. The vast majority of its £1bn revenues in the year to June came from water-related business. That included £653m from Wessex Water, and £240m from Water2Business, a joint venture with South West Water owner Pennon Group. However, YTL Utilities (UK) also made a £1.6m profit on £110m in revenues from the property development.Skellett’s YTL pay packet for the last financial year was essentially unchanged from the £691,000 he received in the 2024 financial year, on top of his £313,000 total pay for Wessex Water. He received the same £170,000 bonus in 2024 – pushing his total pay for that year above £1m.The Guardian view on water boss’s undisclosed bonus: Labour won’t fix a system it won’t confrontRead moreA spokesperson for the environment department said the government had imposed “the toughest enforcement framework the sector has ever seen”, and added: “For the first time, we introduced criminal liability for water bosses who cover up illegal sewage spills, and the power to ban unfair bonuses – which resulted in £4m in bonuses for 10 water bosses being blocked this summer. We expect water companies to follow both the letter and spirit of the law.”An Ofwat spokesperson said: “The new rule on executive performance-related pay is already having a positive impact – we have blocked more than £4m of potential bonuses in 2024-25.“Wessex Water did not award any performance-related pay for its regulated activity. The payment to its former CEO was outside the scope of the rule as it was awarded for work not related to the regulated company.“Transparency matters for customers and the public. For next financial year we are proposing an update to water company annual reporting to include more transparent disclosures on remuneration.”Explore more on these topicsExecutive pay and bonusesWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They are dying really hidden, in potentially quite serious situations, and it’s very unclear whether or not they were getting the support they deserved, or whether being in that accommodation was a factor in their deaths.”She said there was an urgent need to start collecting more data on how many exempt accommodation properties there were, and who was living in them.“It’s not that local authorities don’t care about this issue, it’s that at the moment they simply have no way of knowing what’s going on, to who, and where,” she said.Some councils have started implementing their own measures to try to temper the growth of exempt accommodation, but campaigners said this does not do enough to clamp down on rogue providers.The market in Birmingham is dominated by five large providers, all of which have been deemed as “non-compliant” by the Regulator of Social Housing.A report by administrators overseeing one recently bankrupt provider, Midland Livings CIC, said it had employed security guards to protects residents after a number of serious incidents.These included people associated with the company allegedly using “threatening behaviour and intimidation tactics to pressure residents into signing leases with other companies and to vacate premises at short notice, causing considerable distress to vulnerable tenants”, as well as unlawful entry to homes, theft of white goods and diverting funds.A Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government spokesperson said: “The failure to build enough safe and affordable homes has meant rising homelessness, unaffordable rents, and increased housing insecurity for millions of people across the country.“That’s why we have set out our National Plan to End Homelessness, and just last week announced an additional £124m to help people in supported housing.“The Supported Housing Act is a priority for the government and implementation will begin next month – giving people the support they need and ensuring that providers consider the mix of people in their properties.”The caption to the picture accompanying this article was amended on 28 December 2025 to correct a date error: the Supported Housing Act was passed in 2023, not 2013 as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsHousingSocial careMental healthCommunitiesEnglandLocal governmentBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

You’re seeing it now inNigeria,” Turner said.Turner denied that the strikes represent a different second-term approach to military force. With respect to theIslamic State(IS), he told ABC’s This Week, US policy is “very consistent” in defeating it whether in Iraq, Syria or “here in Nigeria”.Turner said the US is “seeing that [IS] around the world has not been defeated but will continue to be a target and something that, with our allies, we’re going to have to continue to respond to or they’re going to continue to be a threat”.View image in fullscreenMike Turner speaks after a briefing at the US Capitol on 15 February 2024 in Washington DC.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesHis comments came three days after the Pentagonlauncheda cruise missile strike on terrorist camps in north-western Nigeria during what Trump latercalleda “Christmas present” for IS militants in Nigeria.The president later amplified his comments onWABCradio in New York, calling IS “butchers” who “got a very bad Christmas present”. Trump, referring to the persecution of Christians in the region, said he “told Nigeria, and I told the people around Nigeria, that if you do it, you’re going to get hit.”US defense secretaryPete Hegsethsaid on X that Trump had made it clear that “the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end”. He added that the defense department, which the Trump administration hasrebrandedthe war department, “is always ready, so [IS] found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come.”The consistency of the US approach, Turner said, applied to the its position on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Turner said the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s Christmas Day strikes in Ukraine andovernight on Saturdaywere a reminder “that we can’t be for this”.“When we address the issue of whose side we’re on, you can’t be America first and be pro-Russia,” Turner remarked. “Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States. They are mercilessly killing Ukrainians and trying to take Ukrainian land. So, the president has rightly said we need to end this war.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryTrump administrationIslamic StateNigeriaSyriaUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

He haggles with buyers to get a good price for the animals, which are reared in the open and roam freely.Goats are the main – and sometimes only – source of income for the people of Macururé, a small town in the Braziliansertão.This rural hinterland in the country’s north-east is known for its dry climate and harsh conditions.But earning a living from goat rearing is becoming more difficult as the dry season extends and the native vegetation withers in the Caatinga, a shrubland and thorn forest biome that spans much of the sertão, leaving even these hardy animals starved for food.“It used to rain earlier,” says Maia, 54, a short, wiry man with the weathered face of someone who has spent a life outdoors. “Now, there are no cacti, there’s no grass, there’s not enough water. We have to spend what we earn from selling the animals on buying feed.”View image in fullscreenRaildon Suplicio Maia, a goat farmer from Macururé sells his animals at the market. Grazing has disappeared and he now spends any profit on feedMacururé and four neighbouring municipalities in northern Bahia state are facing a disturbing new climate reality. In 2023, researchers found that a 5,700 sq km area in Brazil’s semi-arid north-eastcould be classified as an arid region– the first in the country – a change brought on by decreased rainfall and higher temperatures over a sustained period.“We never previously had an arid zone [in Brazil],” says Ana Martins do Amaral Cunha, a researcher at the national centre for monitoring and warning on natural disasters (Cemaden), and one of the study’s authors. “It’s an area in which the climate changed, from semi-arid to arid. That means it got hotter and drier,” she says.“We know that the increase in temperatures is linked to climate change, to anthropogenic global warming, that is to say, the emission of greenhouse gases,” she adds.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Raildon Suplicio Maia’s farm. He used to farm crops as well, but ‘now, when you plant something, it dies,’ he saysCunha and her colleagues analysed data on rainfall and evapotranspiration – the transfer of water from soil and plants to the atmosphere – over four overlapping 30-year periods, from 1960 to 2020. In the area newly classified as arid, average annual rainfall fell below 400mm during the period 1990 to 2020. It’s a climate shift that has taken place over just one generation.The arid climate could accelerate desertification, which already threatens about 13% of the Caatinga.If steps aren’t taken to prevent or reverse soil degradation, which stems primarily from human activity, the region could become an infertile desert.Two comparison maps, one from 1961-1990, the other from 1991-2020, showing how the arid area in Brazil’s Caatinga biome has got much bigger.In Macururé, residents are accustomed to punishing droughts and few are aware of their municipality’s new climate status. But they feel the shift in the unpredictable rainfall and in their lean goats, which struggle to find food in the parched landscape.These changes should be on our radar. It’s not just a problem in the north-east, it affects the whole countryAna Martins do Amaral Cunha, researcher“Everything has changed,” says Maia, looking out at the naked shrubs that surround his home. A few steps from the house, a goat gets up on its hind legs to nibble at the scarce leaves.The rainy season would normally run from year’s end to April. But by early September, it hadn’t rained properly since January, when about a year’s worth of rain fell in the space of a month.“We used to grow corn, beans, potatoes, everything,” Maia says. “Now, when you plant something, it dies.”Macururé and the surrounding towns areamong the poorest in Bahia. The decline of subsistence agriculture means the population must spend more on food and animal feed.About 30 miles north, in the Curral da Pedraquilombo– a traditional afro-Brazilian community descended from people who escaped enslavement more than 200 years ago – Marisete dos Santos tells a similar story.View image in fullscreenVenancio Lorenzo do Santo says if he stops breeding goats he will have to leave Macururé“There was so much watermelon. Watermelons the size of a little boy,” she says, recalling the abundant crops tended to by her grandfather. The fruits she plants now are small and dry, and the beans she saves for the following planting season don’t germinate.Although the current situation is more extreme, water scarcity has always been a challenge in the sertão.People have long relied on engineered solutions to the problem, such as artesian wells and dams that divert streams into small reservoirs.In Maria Alves dos Santos’s neighbourhood, a cluster of government-built bungalows a bone-rattling 20-minute drive from the town centre, a white cistern stands outside each home. Water trucks operated by the army routinely pass by to fill the 16,000-litre cisterns, installed as part ofa government policylaunched in the early 2000s to provide water for human consumption.Families have only recently been provided with a rainwater catchment system for livestock and irrigation. Deep trenches known asbarreiro trincheiradot the surrounding shrubland. Holding up to 500,000 litres each, they are designed to prevent the rainwater they capture from evaporating in the heat.View image in fullscreenChildren from the Dos Santos family play around theirbarreira-trincheira, a trench that collects water for their familyView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft, Maria Alves dos Santos and right, Marisete Dolores Graciliano dos Santos whose community has recently been provided withbarreira-trincheiraAlves dos Santos’s trench hit groundwater and already contains some precious inches of water, even though there has been no rain. She plans to use it for laundry, for her animals and, in the long run, to irrigate cash crops such as coriander and onions. “Things are going to get better now that we have this water,” says the 41-year-old, while her youngest son plays around the edge of the ditch.Yet these solutions have their limitations, particularly under the new climate conditions. Water tanks such as that used by Alves dos Santos no longer outlast the lengthier, more punishing dry seasons.The Caatinga is an extraordinary biome, but it’s small and attention reaches us more slowlyGustavo Vieira, Macururé’s municipal secretary for agriculture“You don’t know any more how long the water will remain stored. The sources empty quicker, because it’s hotter,” says Gustavo Vieira, who has served as Macururé’s municipal secretary for agriculture, environment and livestock for the past 12 years.The town of just over 7,000 people, which lost 10% ofits populationbetween 2010 and 2022 as young people left in search of work, is a warning for the rest of Brazil as the climate grows hotter and drier in most of the country.Brazil’s semi-arid region expanded by 75,000 sq km every decade between 1960 and 2020, the Cemaden study found, while two dry subhumid areas have appeared outside the north-east, in Rio de Janeiro state and the Pantanal wetlands.“These changes should also be on our radar. It’s not just a problem in the north-east, it’s a problem that affects the whole country,” says Cunha.Once the climate has shifted, the change is irreversible, she says. Addressing this starts with climate mitigation measures. Efforts to prevent or reverse desertification are also necessary. The environment ministry, which commissioned the research, will present an updated national policy for fighting desertification in the coming months.‘Green desert’: the farmers winning a battle with Brazil’s wood-pulp giantRead morePublic policies are slow to reach places such as Macururé, says Vieira. “There has always been a lot of concern with the Amazon, a biome that attracts attention from abroad. The Caatinga is an extraordinary biome, but it’s small and attention reaches us more slowly,” he says.People have gathered in Macururé’s town hall to discuss solutions to their predicament, as part ofa government rural development initiative. Desalination devices are dismissed as too expensive and polluting. Most would like the water trucks to visit more frequently.Vieira pins his hopes on the development of alternative sources of income and employment. But some industries, such as mining andrenewable energy plants, he admits, would bring little benefit to the local communities. Others, such as ecotourism and carbon credits for preserving the Caatinga, seem distant possibilities.And for mostMacururenses, such as 53-year-old Venancio Lorenzo do Santo, life doesn’t make sense without their goats, of which there are 30 for every human in the town. “The day I stop breeding goats, I know I’m going to have to leave,” he says, as the sun sets on his herd gathered in their pen for the night.View image in fullscreen‘Things are going to get better now that we have this water,’ says Maria Alves dos SantosExplore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanClimate crisisDroughtDesertificationExtreme heatWaterBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 19 December deadline for the justice department to comply with a new law the California representative wrote was ticking closer – and his bill wasalready forcing sealed documents aboutJeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation into full view.In the weeks leading up to the deadline, three federal judges in Florida and New York had reversed years of secrecy, releasing grand jury testimony they had previously kept sealed. And when the deadline arrived, while the justice department didn’t release everything, thousands of new files, connections and photographs began to complete the picture on what Khanna calls “the Epstein class … rich and powerful men who still have buildings named after them, who still are on corporations, are still in positions of prestige, who engage in heinous conduct.“I believe that this is going to be a reckoning for America,” Khanna said during an interview in his office.The Epstein Files Transparency Act took just five months from concept to passage, unusually fast for a political body where most legislation dies quietly in committee. It was not beginner’s luck for Khanna. The forced release of the Epstein files is just the cherry on top in a series of Khanna’s major improbable wins that have crossed party lines over the years, which include the passing of the first war-powers resolution through both chambers of Congress in history and the passage of the largest industrial policy bill in generations.TheCaliforniaDemocrat’s theory is simple, even if it upends decades of Washington thinking: finding common ground doesn’t just happen in the center. It also happens at the edges, where populist anger on the left and right finds new avenues to align against a system both sides believe has failed them. “The places where you can find common ground is not on incremental policy of how we extend the tax credits for healthcare,” he said.Consider the 2019 Yemen War Powers Resolution, which marked the first time Congress passed a war -powers resolution through both chambers to direct an end to US involvement in an ongoing conflict. Khanna has cited that passage as an early sign that bipartisan agreement on restraining executive war powers was possible, even though the measure was ultimately vetoed by Trump and did not take legal effect.View image in fullscreenRo Khanna with the Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie outside the Capitol in September.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesAt that time, Khanna, Senator Bernie Sanders and the Republican representative Thomas Massie built what seemed like an impossibly odd coalition: progressiveDemocratswho opposed endless wars and libertarian Republicans skeptical of foreign intervention.“The Republicans were in charge of Congress, the Republicans were in charge of the Senate,” Khanna recalls. “And then we actually did pass the war -powers resolution, Sanders and I, to stop the refueling of Saudi planes that were bombing Yemen. We had Trump as president, and we had a Republican Senate, but I built an alliance at the time with people like Thomas Massie, Mark Meadows, Rand Paul and Mike Lee.”The turning point, Khanna explained, was the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi – an event that “helped catalyze the Republicans to be willing to get on board”. But the groundwork had been laid for months. “It requires all of these things that also require months, if not years, of effort,” he says.The Chips and Science Act took even longer: two years of work that began in the first Trump administration in 2020 with the former Republican congressmember Mike Gallagher, Republican senator Todd Young and Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader in the Senate. The bill initially stalled, and finally passed in 2022, bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to American soil, with factories now rising in Ohio and Arizona.“It took Biden’s election. It took two years of work and … a lot of work with getting Republicans on board on industrial policy,” Khanna said, pointing at the Publius award hanging in his office, which is awarded by the non-partisan Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress for best exemplifying bipartisanship.Then there’s the Epstein case. First, Khanna introduced an amendment to release sealed files related toJeffrey Epsteinand Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking operations. He got one Republican vote in the rules committee – Ralph Norman. That was enough to get the ball rolling.“Thomas Massie said: ‘Well, if you can get one Republican in the rules committee, maybe we can get more Republicans,’” Khanna recalled.Despite all those wins, Khanna doesn’t have the distinction for being the most bipartisan member of Congress. In fact, he sat somewhere in the middle of the 436 representatives ranked in theLugar Center’s 2023 bipartisan index, the last time it was released.Trump over-promises and under-delivers with heavily redacted Epstein cacheRead moreIf you’re looking for a pattern to his votes, he’ll give you one: “Good jobs at home, no dumb wars overseas, accountability for elites.” These are his three pillars for what he calls a “modern FDR coalition” – a realignment that brings together progressive voters and what he terms “disaffected Maga voters”.It’s an openly populist pitch, one that rejects what the Democrat sees as the failed deal-making between the parties of the past several decades. “The traditional coalition of neoliberalism, which was an overreliance of the faith in the market,” he argues, “was accompanied with the militarism overseas, had failed a lot of people, including many Trump voters.”This isn’t about splitting the difference on tax policy or finding modest compromises on healthcare subsidies, he says: “This is, how do we build coalitions to fundamentally change the economic and political structure that has shafted the working class?”The formula has led him to unlikely partnerships. He’s written op-eds with Rand Paul about ending overseas wars. He’s worked with Marco Rubio, while he was a Florida senator, on creating a White House economic development council. Before she began her congressional exit, he was talking with Marjorie Taylor Greene about expanding Medicare to people 50-55 and working on a cost of living resolution.View image in fullscreenRo Khanna at a town hall at the Norco College Amphitheater in Norco, California, on 23 March 2025.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images“I developed a relationship with her, so, you know, but now I look for other partners,” he said.Ask Khanna about the mechanics of bipartisanship success and he gets specific. First, master the institution: “You’ve got to really understand the rules of the institution and the procedure of the institution. You can’t be effective here without understanding the institution.”Second, build real relationships: “You’ve got to have people on the other side. It doesn’t have to be a lot, but a few who you develop relationships of trust, where you can really text each other, call each other, be able to do more than just put your name on a bill.”He estimates he has these kinds of relationships with “a handful” of Republicans – “people who really I can go out and have a meal with, or will take my call so that you can build some momentum”.Files release illuminates Maxwell’s tactics to lure teens into Epstein’s orbitRead moreThe Epstein act succeeded so quickly, Khanna argues, partly because of what he calls “muscle memory” – the trust he and Massie had already built working on foreign policy. “Massie and I had been working together on other issues,” he explains.But he’s candid about the odds. When asked whether these bills ever almost fell apart, he laughs: “All of them almost fell apart. I mean, the probability of passing a bill is stacked against you.” He estimates he gave each bill a 5% chance of success when they started.Even with Republican partners on board, there were obstacles. On the Epstein act, “the president, President Trump, was campaigning and threatening people”, Khanna says. Within his own party, he “had to convince my own leadership that this was a worthwhile fight”.That’s where establishment politics mattered. “Hakeem [Jeffries] and his team, [executive director ] Gideon [Bragin] on his team, they’re very savvy, and so they understand, follow the cultural trends,” Khanna says of the House minority leader. “This is an example of why having younger, modern leadership is important for a party, because they jumped on it right away.”With three major wins, clear pillars of agreement and trusted partners across the aisle, it’s a feelgood story of how politics could work differently. Yet, his theory assumes populist anger can overcome deep disagreements about solutions.A progressive wanting Medicare for All and a Maga Republican wanting to dismantle agencies might both oppose “endless wars” but they are fighting different wars at home.View image in fullscreenRo Khanna: ‘Good jobs at home, no dumb wars overseas, accountability for elites.’Photograph: Heather Diehl/Getty ImagesThen, there’s the question of replicability. Khanna is himself a former Silicon Valley executive with degrees from the University of Chicago and Yale, representing one of California’s wealthiest and bluest districts. He has the luxury of not worrying about leftwing primary challenges when working with the Freedom caucus.But Khanna would argue this misses the point. His wins don’t only come from policy alignment, but also from shared moral conviction: the Epstein act worked because both sides genuinely wanted to hold powerful predators accountable.The DoJ failed to comply with Epstein files law – can Congress do anything?Read more“One woman came up to me when I was back home and said: ‘You know, I’m a victim of sexual assault, and I finally feel heard by my government,” he said.Whether that anger and disillusionment with the system could scale to build a “modern FDR coalition” without a unifying crisis like the Depression remains an open question.For now, Khanna keeps working his theory. He’s currently pushing a bipartisan war-powers resolution to prevent regime change in Venezuela, working again with Republicans to constrain executive military action.The chances it goes through may not be the best. But he’s passed bills with worse odds before.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsDemocratsUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesJeffrey EpsteinCaliforniainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.But the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.Nowworth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world’s AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.This year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging froma $5bn investment into Intel– to facilitate its access to the PC market – to$100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.But even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executiveJensen Huang’s energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.The start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing:Nvidialending money to customers so they can buy its products.The largest of these is its deal withOpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia’s chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia’s chips.The circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.View image in fullscreenThe tech investor James Anderson has expressed concern about Nvidia’s deal with OpenAI.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianJames Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, butsaid this year that the OpenAI dealpresented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.He added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”Other high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMDsigned a multibillion-dollar chip dealthat also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.There is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”All these moves form part of OpenAI’s $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies –and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.Graphic showing the companies Nvidia has deals with and the types of deals they areNvidia has also used structures calledspecial-purpose vehicles(SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk’s xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia’s chips.This drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.Nvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.The journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidiais not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent’s dotcom bubble partners. And it isn’t like Enron, Zitron argues, because it’s being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.So what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”Essentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia’s customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.Approached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.In particular, Kress argued that Nvidia’s recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.There is another complexity, which is that Nvidia’s health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.View image in fullscreenHuang signs autographs at a summit in Gyeongju. Nvidia’s deal with the South Korean government is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.Photograph: Lee Jin-man/APAdd to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and South Korean companies. Thevalue of this dealwas not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.Likewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.Governments are likely to pay. There’s nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia’s revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingOpenAIfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Standing beside his husband, Baconi could not bring himself to ring the bell, to find out who was living in the rooms that held Eva’s childhood memories.“I want to imagine it empty, loyal, waiting for our return. I want it to exist outside of time, as if everything stopped that April,” he writes in his memoir. Simply finding the house was the physical connection he sought between her past and his inheritance of memories. “I have finally bent time, held her history in my present.”The book at its core is a love story between two boys … I felt like [that story] was completely absent from the world around meThe long road to that sunny seaside street, from a childhood of personal and political repression as a refugee inJordan, is the heart of the memoirFire in Every Direction,published last month.Weaving the story of his first love with his family’s history of generational flight and dispossession – from Haifa, to Beirut and then to Amman, before moving on his own to London – it explores Baconi’s struggle to recognise and embrace his enmeshed Palestinian and queer identities.“The book at its core is a love story between two boys. And I always knew that it was something I wanted to write because I felt like it was completely absent from the world around me,” Baconi said in an interview in London of a book that is both intimate and fiercely political.The memoir is a departure for Baconi, who is well known as a political analyst and expert on Hamas. By instinct a very private person, he began writing itas a personal project that he imagined as an extended letter to “Ramzi”, the boy he loved, “recounting everything that I wanted to tell him that I didn’t really have the words or capacity to say when I was in my teenage years”.He was able to be both intimate and vulnerable, creating an unsparing portrait of his younger self, in part because he convinced himself it would never be published.View image in fullscreenTareq Baconi in an undated family photograph.Photograph: Courtesy of Tareq BaconiThe explicitly political aspect of the book expanded as he realised readers needed to understand why the boys were in Jordan, the silences and trauma in their homes and everything that had to be left unspoken in a country that offered refuge only to Palestinians who renounced politics.His mother had been a firebrand political activist but was driven into exile from Lebanon when civil war exploded and her best friend was murdered. In Amman,she burned against forced domesticity and boredom, but complied with what she felt was the unwritten cost of physical safety.“Our parents’ lives had come unhinged too many times, and – rightly or wrongly – they decided it was enough for us to have been given shelter,” he writes of their years in Jordan. “To demand more was a betrayal of that gift. There was an unacknowledged pact with our host country: to live, we had to be silent.”She was an ally and a refuge for Baconi, who chronicles his early realisation that he did not entirely fit into Palestinian life in Amman, skipping football games to look for wild tortoises, and begging his mother to buy him a doll in a glittery ballgown.“In some ways queerness served to put me out of the norm. It forced me into the margins. It forced me to reconcile with the fact that I didn’t quite belong in this patriarchal and homophobic society I was growing up with,” he said.Bullied at school, he was rescued from social isolation by the friendship of Ramzi. The pair were closer than brothers until Baconi’s declaration of love in his final year of school ended the friendship and he moved to London to escape gossip in Amman.The politics of the second intifada that was raging at the time were little more than background noise to an engineering degree for Baconi. But the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 would fan the spark inherited from his mother into life.He flew back to join his family in Amman on a plane filled largely with journalists racing to cover the war, many of them with a degree of enthusiasm, and a conversation with one of them would crystallise a growing sense of unease into a moment of radicalisation.“Sitting there, chatting to the well-meaning British man, I realized I was, in fact, and despite all performances to the contrary, an Arab man who was scared and filled with foreboding, with a force I had not realized was within me,” he writes in the memoir.View image in fullscreenThe Associated Press photographer David Guttenfelder photographs US troops in Baghdad in July 2004 during a search of a neighborhood near Baghdad’s Martyrs’ Square.Photograph: Khalid Mohammed/APHe had been seduced by a western liberal promise that he could find safety and freedom by moving to cosmopolitan London, leaving behind the Palestinian community that rejected his queerness. But he began to understand that day that his Palestinian identity could no more be suppressed or abandoned than his sexuality, and spent the years that followed exploring both.Traveling around the Middle East as a consultant and discovering a semi-hidden queer subculture, Baconi began to recognize that he had been largely oblivious to Palestinian political history, even though it permeated the Amman of his youth through shared memories of massacres, stolen homes and scattered family.“What other silences have filled my childhood?” he writes. Returning to university he studied the history that gave his patchwork of family stories a broader context.The US invasion of Iraq, he said, “was a moment of political awakening that then took me intoPalestinein a very academic way in terms of trying to reclaim my family history”.He became a political analyst and scholar, writing Hamas Contained, a highly regarded account of the rise of the Islamist group as a political force. Eventually, armed with a British passport, he went to live in Ramallah and visited Haifa with the husband he was never able to tell his grandmother about.Baconi’s exploration of the damage caused by silence and suppression is powerful in part because it is so frank, an exploration of a family struggling to reconcile their deep love for Baconi with a cultural and religious context that condemns him.When he came out for a second time to his father – the first was dismissed as a teenage phase – his mother prepared coffee with sedatives for her husband, in a pre-emptive attempt to prevent any confrontation spiralling.Even so, Fadi told his son: “I wish you had the decency to let me die not knowing you were like this.” Despite the cutting cruelty of those words, over time love prevailed. Fadi became a devoted father-in-law before his death, chiding Tareq for not visiting more often with his husband.This is what it is to be queer and Palestinian, and this is how I hold these politics togetherBaconi’s family have been supportive of the book, something he does not take for granted and says is “not necessarily representative” for other queer Palestinians in the region.“In Jordan specifically, maybe more broadly in the region, there’s something funny about how certain things are accepted, [including] queer life, as long as we don’t talk about it,” he said.“This book is disruptive in that way, because it’s not only telling, but it’s unapologetic in the telling. It’s saying this is what it is to be queer and Palestinian, and this is how I hold these politics together.”He hopes it will come out in Arabic, but is unsure how it will be received. “It’s either the stupidest or the bravest thing I’ve done. I really don’t know what the implications are.”A Palestinian American writer’s story of exile, addiction and surrogacy: ‘I had to do something with the fragments’Read moreBaconi’s exploration of the world of queer Palestinians is a powerful counterpoint to Israeli attempts to portray the country as an LGBTQ+ haven, and Palestinian society as entirely and violently homophobic.This campaign, which critics call “pinkwashing”, has included Israeli soldiers in Gaza unfurling the rainbow flag with the slogan “in the name of love” in front of ruined Palestinian homes.Presenting Israel as the sole regional defender of LGBTQ+ rights erases the existence and activism of queer Palestinians, Baconi said.“It puts queer people in a very difficult position, because they’re then seen in some ways as being foreign implants, not necessarily as people who are Indigenous to the region or their sexuality or gender identities as being Indigenous to the region,” Baconi said.The book was largely finished before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, and Israel’s war in Gaza which a UN commission, genocide scholars andrights groupssay is genocidal.“I really struggled with the idea that this would be published at this moment, in the same way that I struggle with doing anything normally on a day-to-day at a moment of genocide,” Baconi said. “On the one hand, life is continuing, and on the other hand, it shouldn’t be.”The book does not directly address the last two years. But as a chronicle of one Palestinian family’s losses over decades of mass killing, theft and forced displacement, in Baconi’s words “a timeline etched in massacres”, it provides vital context.For all the tragedies, however, it is ultimately a book filled with love, from and for his own family, for the region, Palestine and queer culture – a call for “an imagined future where none of us must cover, or absent, a part of ourselves to live”.Fire in Every Direction by Tareq Baconi is published in the US bySimon and SchusterExplore more on these topicsAutobiography and memoirPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaJordaninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But, he says, his country feels more empowered than ever beforeSun 28 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareÉanna Hardwicke cannot really remember Saipan. Not Saipan the place, a small Pacific Island 200km north-east of Guam. Nor, thankfully, Saipan the film, in which he stars, and which I’m hoping to discuss with him at length this afternoon. No, he means Saipan the incident, Saipan the event, Saipan the crisis that has baffled and incensed Ireland’s population for a quarter of a century.We are sitting in a pleasantly boxy meeting room deep within the lungs of the NationalTheatre, a space so starkly concrete that the current king of England once described it as a clever way of building a nuclear power plant in the middle of London without anyone objecting. Hardwicke himself sports the quiet, thoughtful presence of a literature student, at times speaking like a particularly articulate MA who’s popped round to deliver a treatise on some dramatic works he just happens to be starring in. He’s here rehearsing a play that forms another contentious landmark in Ireland’s cultural history, but we’ll get to that once we move past the summer he turned five.“I remember colours and shapes,” he says of June 2002, “sticker books and jerseys, Roberto Carlos taking a free kick.” That, and one other recollection. “I have a vivid memory of someone from Cork coaxing me to say a certain thing aboutRoy Keane,” he says. “She said: ‘He’s a disgrace to his country!’ and it’s only come back to me now, since I’ve done the film. I didn’t understand what she was talking about, only that people were incensed.”View image in fullscreenTaking the Mick … Steve Coogan as McCarthy and Éanna Hardwicke in Saipan.Photograph: Aidan MonaghanThe cause of this fissure was that Ireland’s football squad, having qualified for just the third World Cup in their history, took off for a pre-tournament trip to a sunny island none of them had heard of. Within days, a massive fallout between captain Keane and managerMick McCarthy(played in the film, with weary brio, by Steve Coogan) caused the former to exit the squad with a notorious rant that culminated in the line “you can stick it up your bollocks”. To say this prompted grief and horror back home would undersell things a tad. Saipan immediately became the number one story on every Irish news bulletin, uniting the front and back pages of every newspaper and prompting an anguished primetime press conference from football-loving taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who made it known there was a jet, fuelled, ready and waiting, to ferry Keane back to the fold should the fracture be healed. No such healing came to pass, for ever rendering Saipan the one island in the Northern Marianas archipelago that every Irish person still knows by name to this day.Having been 17 when Saipan occurred, I tell him I felt vaguely retraumatised by the film, not least the strong yearning it gave me for everything to have happened differently. “Well,” he says, amused, “when we screened it in Cork and Belfast, the biggest reaction we had was that feeling: of willing the end not to happen.”Hardwicke doesn’t know if either Keane or McCarthy has seen the film – “I believe both have been offered a chance to watch it, but no idea if they have” – but is aware of how live an issue it remains, 23 years later. He doesn’t, it must be said, look much like Keane, a man Alan Bennett once described as having the face of a mercenary. (“Meet him before the walls of 15th-century Florence” Bennett wrote in a 2005 diary entry, “and one’s heart would sink”.) Beyond his Ireland team garb, and a subtle widow’s peak shaved into his hairline, everything that makes Hardwicke’s scorching, seething performance so ... Keane is internal.For the first two months of drama school I felt it wasn’t right. I had this idea that acting was a bit bullshitty, not a real job“If there’s one thing I needed to carry in,” he says, of playing such an intense figure, “it’s this feeling that you never change or adapt yourself to the environment or its energy. You’re always Roy. I think that’s a brilliant quality in anyone who has it. I certainly don’t. I’ll blow with any wind, depending on who I’m with.”Even now, Keane’s supporters will stress he had a point in objecting to world-class athletes training in blazing heat on laughably hard pitches, during sessions where no sunscreen, or even footballs, were provided. McCarthyites might reply that none of that justifies briefing against the team to the press, or calling into question the national allegiance of McCarthy who – in common with Coogan, and more than half of Keane’s own squadmates – is an English-born man of Irish heritage.“I definitely come from a family where Keane looms large,” Hardwicke says, when I ask where he fell within this national schism. “In Cork, he’s a massive figure, from a city just small enough that those people can shape its identity. I was a huge fan of his, so I probably agreed with him, that it’s all about striving for the best and self-actualising that. In some ways, doing the film only made that sense stronger.”Saipan – which its star is at pains to tell me is “not a biopic” – nevertheless treads this line with a tact I hadn’t expected. Hardwicke’s Keane is compelling and persuasive in pursuit of excellence, but also cold and contemptuous around his colleagues. Coogan’s McCarthy, on the other hand, has the bluff and bluster Keane’s camp has long accused him of, but also a deep well of warmth and decency which his own supporters have always emphasised.“What I love about the story,” Hardwicke says, “is it never feels like it’s asking which ideology do you subscribe to? Mick clearly has such a love of the game and a sense that, when you play sport, you’re sharing that with your country. What comes across in the film, and from Steve’s performance, is the great pathos of that. Personally, I feel closer to that at this stage of my life; that it isn’t about winning, that it’s about something harder to put your finger on than winning.”Hardwicke’s own life saw him catch the acting bug young, encouraged by his mum to actively pursue drama as a career – “She told me to throw the kitchen sink at it” – an inducement that may have carried more weight than your typical supportive parent, given her lifelong job as a career-guidance counsellor. Not that he didn’t harbour any doubts. “For the first two months of drama school I felt like it wasn’t right,” he says. “I think I had this idea that acting was a bit bullshitty or something, like not a real job, and not a very noble job.“For some reason, my antidote to that was I should have gone to university and studied classics,” he tells me, becoming perhaps the first person in history to consider that a stable and secure career path. Thankfully, Plan A appears to be delivering the goods. Prior to Saipan, most may recognise Hardwicke as Connell’s troubled pal Rob in Normal People, or his terrifying turn as murderer Ben Fields in true-crime drama The Sixth Commandment, for which he won a Royal Television Society Award in 2024.It’s hard to know what it would take now to get people jumping out of their seats and shouting, storming the stageNow, he’s at the National Theatre in Catriona McLaughlin’s new run of John Millington Synge’s 1907 masterwork, The Playboy of the Western World. Hardwicke plays Christy Mahon, the charismatic stranger who enters a rural Mayo tavern and tells its patrons he’s just killed his father. For this, he is initially celebrated, impressing the men with his storytelling and earning amorous attention from the womenfolk, before his story unravels and all must contend with his deceptions, and the messiness of real-life violence intruding on fanciful tales of the same.“It’s hard to know what it would take now to get people jumping out of their seats and shouting, storming the stage,” Hardwicke says. “What would do that these days?” He’s referring to the notorious rioting that accompanied Playboys’s original run in the Abbey theatre in Dublin, where it was brigaded from within by angry audience members, and from without by hundreds more who’d never seen the production. Some considered its depiction of drinking and lasciviousness an insult to moral decency. Others decreed it nothing less than a crime against Ireland herself; an English-language account – by a Protestant, no less – showcasing Irish peasants as simplistic, violent fools. Even now, with its reputation much rehabilitated, Hardwicke feels some misconceptions persist.“I think some people have a sense of the play’s language as hokey,” says Hardwicke, a notion he rejects. “This play takes place in the west of Ireland,” he says. “There was so much music and wildness and laughter, and one of the things I love about Catriona’s perspective on it is that in the darkest reaches of the country, going into public spaces around a fire and having a really good time is essential to life. The pub gets a bad press sometimes, but these were places where you could tell stories as a way of lifting yourselves out of the doldrums and transport yourself to a different place. I think that’s what the characters in the story are doing for each other.”Never scared of tying a clumsy ribbon around things, I ask him whether he sees any connection between public rejection of Synge’s most famous work, and the rending of garments over Keane’s departure 95 years later.“I do think there’s something there,” he says. “Something about people riding high that we begrudge. But there is a funny thing right now, where it does feel like Irish artists have a sense of themselves on that global stage.” He points to the festival-conquering Fontaines DC and CMAT, the wave of “phenomenal novelists working today”, or his Playboy co-star Nicola Coughlan: “People doing incredible work at huge moments in their careers, and choosing to use that platform for things they passionately believe.”‘We’ve got to release the dead hand of the past’: how Ireland created the world’s best alternative music sceneRead moreHardwicke wonders if this flowering has something to do with Ireland having a “more unified voice” than in other parts of the world. “You see that politically with Gaza over the past two years, and the way that people of Ireland are united across lots of different divides by our solidarity there,” he says. “I don’t want to try any clumsy parallels but there’s something I’m very inspired by in terms of the art that comes out of the country now. Its outward looking, it’s not apologising.”Has Ireland, then, moved past tearing down its greatest exports for saying the unsayable, or hectoring them for doing the country down?“I think now,” Hardwicke says, “there’s a sense of Irish people taking stage in the world and not playing down their culture. Maybe that has something to do with the fact we come from an island that’s been colonised and denied its own language and culture for many centuries, so now there’s a sense of: fuck it. We’re emboldened now. We’re empowered.”Saipan is inIrish cinemas from New Year’s Day andUK cinemas23 January; The Playboy of the Western World is at the National Theatre: Lyttelton, London, to 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmTheatreRoy KeaneMick McCarthyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

From the ascent of the young, Grammy-nominated bandsTurnstileandKnocked Looseto the comeback ofDeftonesand their fresh grip on gen Z, as well as the growth of the UK festival Outbreak, heavy guitar music is enjoying a renaissance. After releasing their debut album, Faded Intentions, in November, False Reality might seem like a new name to watch in this world – but they have deep roots.Vocalist Rachel Rigby started out as a teenage gig promoter in Essex and London before putting on festivals in her early 20s. After a decade of witnessing a chronic lack of female representation among the countless bands she saw live, she decided to give fronting her own a shot. “I felt that it was important to send a message,” she says. “I’ve made most of my friends through hardcore; the only thing I hadn’t done was be in a band.” Her voice is a ripper: raw and upfront in the album mix, it makes the tracks feel as close to live as possible.Guitarist Dave Connolly, the oldest member, earned his stripes in crews like Ironed Out, 50 Caliber and Bun Dem Out. They all orbit Rucktion Records, a London label that started in the late 1990s, aiming to form a comparative scene to that of New York City. London bands such as Knuckledust became local versions of New Yorkers like Madball; all in, the musical equivalent of a roundhouse kick to the head.Drummer Louis Dale credits the Rucktion universe as his teenage entry point into the sound. “The physicality and precision of the music blew my face off, and there was also, frankly, a level of violence that I just was really interested in,” he says. “It’s dangerous and exciting.” Meanwhile, the true love of bassist Joe Cornwell, who fizzes with the energy of a kid who never grew up, is melodic metalcore by bands such as Poison the Well.As a DIY sound that thrives off hungry newcomers, hardcore, in principle, doesn’t tend to over-prioritise legacy. But the cumulative effect of False Reality’s previous bands and their years being steeped in the sound gives Faded Intentions a real edge. After playing and moshing at thousands of shows between them, the four of them have an ear for what makes a track rip through a room with maximum impact, and a learned musicality that goes beyond the classic three-chords and beatdown formula of some of the tougher music they grew up on.‘Pepper-spraying a 15 year old is cowardly’: Turnstile on hostile cops, playing through pain and taking hardcore punk globalRead moreFaded Intentions is full of playful, dynamic shifts. For metalheads, there are thrash guitar solos reminiscent of early Metallica, Slayer and Arcangel, and for hardcore lifers, there are plenty of two-step parts. The music’s toughness is charged by Rigby’s ferocity. On Cost of Spite, her lyrics tear through the noise: “Suffer, set it off, trapped in unequal life.” She says it’s about “feeling anger when your hard work and passions are boiled down to your gender, skin colour or sexuality, but then breaking from that, not diluting yourself to make others comfortable.”The most distinctive, surprising element of their music is how they bring shoegaze into the mix. Shoegaze can be crushingly loud, of course, but it’s not necessarily heavy. On tracks such as Sonder, they flood the beatdowns with distortion and melodic vocal chains. “We love that Deftones sound and worked it into our world,” says Dale. “Having an interlude is one thing, but turning shoegaze into a False Reality song is another. We want to subvert expectations of what a hardcore band should be doing. We wanted to come out with something unexpected on our debut album – and we’re proud of it.”Explore more on these topicsMusicNew music for 2026Pop and rockMetalinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We have to be proud of loving whatever. I’m not going say You’re the Voice by John Farnham is a guilty pleasure, but it’s definitely a song that not everybody would love. Part of the reason I love it is because it’s got bagpipes in it, and there aren’t enough pop songs with bagpipes.The best song to have sex toI’d be giving away too many secrets to share that one. Have I tried having sex to my own music? No, thank you very much – that just sounds repugnant.The song that changed my lifeI grew up on MTV and didn’t think about being a musician. When I saw the video to Loser by Beck, I thought: That’s what I want to do. I want to make music like that.The song that gets me up in the morningI’m not a morning person, so when I need to get up, I need to have something that slaps you in the face, like Sabotage by the Beastie Boys.The song that makes me cryI’m not a crier, either, but when I need to cry, The Circle Game by Joni Mitchell absolutely floors me, particularly the version on her Miles of Aisles live album.

His novels, most of them composed in a week or two, are simple, straightforward, shallow-seeming even, but below the surface lie dark and fathomless depths.Many readers will know him as the creator of Commissioner Jules Maigret of the Paris Police Judiciaire, the most unpretentious, humane and convincing of the great fictional detectives. However, his finest work is to be found in what he called hisromans durs, or hard novels, including such masterpieces as Dirty Snow, Monsieur Monde Vanishes and the jauntily horrifying The Man Who Watched the Trains Go By. Now, Penguin Classics has launched a series of 20 of theromans dursin new translations, starting with The Cat, originally published in French in 1967.The plot focuses on a Parisian couple, the retired builder Émile Bouin and his wife, Marguerite. Both were widowed, and remarried in their 60s. Theirs is not a match made in heaven. Indeed, they inhabit a domestic hell in a claustrophobic Parisian cul-de-sac, where they spend their days devising means of taunting and tormenting each other in a battle of wills that can only end in tragedy. They are no longer on speaking terms, and only communicate, if that is the word, by exchanging the briefest of notes.The cat of the title was a stray that Émile rescued from a building site. The creature afforded him a little warmth and companionship in the melancholy of his days, until Marguerite poisoned it, or so he is convinced. In response, he mutilated Marguerite’s pet parrot so badly that it died. Now the bird, stuffed and mounted in its cage, presides over their living room, a standing rebuke to Émile, and a grotesque assertion of his wife’s unrelenting animosity and vengefulness.The couple spend their days devising means of tormenting each other in a battle of wills that can only end in tragedyWe first meet them seated by the fire of an evening. Émile writes a couple of words into a notebook he keeps for the purpose, and tears out the page. “He rolled the paper between his thumb and index finger. He curled back his thumb and released it rapidly, flicking the message into Marguerite’s lap. He never missed his target, as it were, inwardly jubilant each time.” Marguerite pretends not to notice, but in the end she opens the note and reads the message:The cat. In retaliation, “she answered him wordlessly:The parrot”.Their predicament is hideous and hideously comic, yet the tale overall is deeply sad, and becomes increasingly so as it progresses. Much of the sadness is generated out of remembrances of things and times past. Émile’s first wife, Angèle, was a jolly farm girl with red hands and a raucous sense of humour. Also she loved to make love: “I don’t know who invented this thing, but whoever it was deserves a statue.” Then one day on the Boulevard Saint-Michel she was run down by a bus, and lived on, disabled, for two painful years before dying.Marguerite is made of steelier stuff than her predecessor. She comes from a wealthy middle-class family – her father built and owned all the houses in the cul-de-sac where she and Émile live – and her late husband played first violin in the orchestra of the Paris Opera. She despises Émile for his working-class origins, and besides, her passions all are spent, except her passion for revenge. They married in their 60s, and even at the start, when they were still speaking, “they were awkward with each other, more inhibited than very young lovers”.Inevitably, Émile seeks solace elsewhere – though the idyll cannot last. When he returns to his old life in the cul-de-sac, relations between the couple are more vindictive than ever. And yet The Cat, for all its bleakness, is, in a strange, Simenonian fashion, a  kind of love story. Only an artist of genius could have wrought pathos out of the ghastly plight of Émile and Marguerite, lost souls clinging to the raft of their mutual dependence.The Cat by Georges Simenon, translated by Ros Schwartz, is published by Penguin Classics (12.99).

From BTS conquering global charts to Parasitesweeping the Oscarsin 2020 and Korean dramastopping Netflix, Korean popular culture has never been more visible. Exports driven by the country’s artshit a record$15.18bn (£11bn) in 2024, cementing the country’s reputation as a cultural superpower.But inside South Korea, the two industries that helped build the Korean Wave – cinema andK-pop– are now experiencing fundamental transformations, with their survival strategies potentially undermining the creative foundations of their success.The decline in cinema is the most dramatic. Admissions – for Korean and international films –have fallen45% since 2019, from about 226 million to 123 million, while box office revenue has dropped from $1.3bn to $812m.With investment slowing sharply, Korean distributors that once released more than 40 locally produced films a year are expected to put out about only 20 in 2025, and warn that 2026 could be “even more serious” as the pandemic-era backlogruns outand new productions are not coming fast enough.Kim Han-min, director of the Yi Sun-sin trilogy, delivered the bluntest warning when hetold lawmakerslast year that the sector had “almost collapsed”.View image in fullscreenA scene from Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar award-winning film Parasite.Photograph: BFA/AlamyJason Bechervaise, a professor of Korean film at Hanyang University, sees not a short-term slump but a structural weakening. “Years of tightening margins and rising costs have thinned out the mid-budget productions where new directors once developed and established film-makers experimented,” he says. “Much of the talent pipeline is now moving toward streaming platforms, where investment is steadier and production schedules more predictable.”Korean cinema in ‘precarious period’ due to Netflix, says Jang Joon-hwanRead moreThe theatrical “holdback window” – the period between a cinema release and a film’s arrival on streaming – has also shortened to just a few weeks for many titles, leaving audiences with little reason to buy a ticket. The strain has already triggered historic consolidation, with the operators of the Lotte Cinema and Megabox chainsplanning to mergetheir 1,682 screens.Cinemas areinvesting heavilyin premium formats such as Imax and Dolby, but without a reliable flow of domestic films, industry insiders say such upgrades cannot deliver a sustained recovery.K-pop’s reckoningCinema is not the only pillar under strain. K-pop, long considered one of South Korea’s strongest cultural exports, is also entering a period of uncertainty.Physical albumsales fell19.5% in 2024 – the first decline in a decade – dropping from 115.2m units to 92.7m, with the dropprojectedto continue by the end of 2025. This includes international releases, but few make major inroads into the Korean charts.Yet major agencies have found their salvation elsewhere, with concert revenues now surging past traditional album sales as theypivot to global touring.Areum Jeong, a professor of Korean studies at Arizona State University, says companies have increasingly prioritised their mostdedicated fans. “K-pop companies began catering mainly to the core fandom, and kind of forwent the idea of being widely known to the public,” she says. “When companies cater to the core fandom’s needs, the core fandom will spend and support.”This narrow focus, she argues, has influenced how idols are recruited, trained and marketed, and the superfan-centred model is now being copied by industries outside Korea. Yet questions remain about whether this approach can produce the kind of breakthrough global phenomena that defined K-pop’s golden era, such asBTSor Blackpink.View image in fullscreenBTS performing in Busan, South Korea, in October 2022.Photograph: Bighit Music/EPAMeanwhile, smaller agencies, once vital for experimentation and diversity,have struggledto survive, squeezed by rising production costs and a shrinking share of fan spending.At the same time, the global success of Korean cultural ideas no longer guarantees that Korean companies will be the ones profiting.‘It’s ended up being nothing to no one’: can K-pop overcome crisis?Read moreNetflix’s animated hitKPop Demon Huntersbecame the platform’smost-watched animated film. The film was co-directed by the Korean-Canadian Maggie Kang, and included several Korean/Korean-American voice actors, but was an American production based on Korean aesthetics.Jeong describes it as a “de-territorialised, hybrid idea ofK-pop[rather] than an authentic K-pop product”, suggesting that Korean cultural concepts have become portable enough to be reproduced internationally without Korean participation. Similar groups trained in Korean methods are now emerging in Japan and south-east Asia, creating direct competition.Yet she says audiences still seekreal-world encounterswith Korean culture. After the film’s release,museums,food brandsandcosmetics companiesexperienced renewed interest in items featured onscreen.Bechervaise notes how creative dynamics have shifted. As domestic productions became more formulaic, American studios and Korean-diaspora creators began drawing on Korean cultural elements in works such as Minari, Beef and Demon Hunters. “Korea had beaten Hollywood at its own game,” he says, “but now it’s as though Hollywood’s beating Korea at its own game.”View image in fullscreenThe singing voices of HUNTR/X from KPop Demon Hunters performing onstage in Los Angeles, California, in December.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartRadioThe governmenthas respondedwith a sweeping five-year, 51.4tn won (£26bn) cultural investment plan, aimed at expanding South Korea’s global cultural footprint and strengthening broader cultural industries, from content exports to arts training, tourism and sports.President Lee Jae Myung has also appointed the JYP Entertainment founder and K-pop mogul Park Jin-young toco-chair a new presidential cultural committeeto promote the spread of Korean pop culture internationally.Major agencies such as HYBE and SM Entertainment are opening new subsidiaries insouth-east Asia,IndiaandChina. But critics say the focus on overseas expansion risks overlooking the infrastructure at home that once powered South Korea’s cultural ascent and eroding the cultural authenticity that originally attracted international audiences.Jeong believes the industries will continue to earn money but warns that financial success alone cannot guarantee creative renewal. “The Korean entertainment industry will continue to profit this way,” she says, “but I think it will be difficult to create something likeKPop Demon Huntersthat has won over so many people worldwide.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaK-popKPop Demon HuntersPop and rockAsia PacificNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whether you’re hitting the pavements for the first time, running with a club or racing for personal glory, the ability to track your workouts has become an essential part of any training regime. Not only can it help you improve, but you can also use it to avoid injury and share in the social experience. A running watch isn’t the only way to do this, but it is a pretty effective option.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But with the market flooded with options, offering an array of features, you might find it difficult to answer all the questions that arise. Do you need offline maps? Do you want to listen to music while you run? Which brand is best, and how much do you really need to spend?Since a running watch is likely to last for far longer than most other bits of tech, you’ll want to make a smart investment – and I’m here to help you do just that.I ran more than 1,000km to guide you through my tried-and-tested options, so you can pick up the best running watch for you.At a glanceBest running watch for beginners:Garmin Forerunner 55£122 at AmazonBestbudget running watch:Suunto Run£174.99 at SportsShoesBest mid-range running watch:Coros Pace Pro£299 at HealfBest-looking mid-range running watch:Suunto Race 2£429 at SportsShoesThe best running watch money can buy:Garmin Forerunner 970£579 at BlacksBest running watch for battery life:Garmin Enduro 3£615.99 at SportsShoesBest running watch with LTE/satellite:Garmin Fenix 8 Pro£875.49 at SportsShoesWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, watched cutting-edge technology become mainstream commodities, used my body as a test bench for hundreds of watches, rings, glasses, goggles and other wearable devices, and covered thousands of kilometres as a keen club runner.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I ran well over 1,000km’: our writer wearing the Garmin Forerunner 970.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianTo really determine whether a running watch goes beyond the basics, you have to use it for some time. I ran well over 1,000km, testing each watch on its own and in pairs, wearing the devices for short and long runs, across different urban and wooded environments. I wore them for club runs and on solo efforts, for training, workouts and races, plus during the day and night, to fully evaluate their capability to track metrics and analyse data.I’ve poked and prodded them, updated them, tested their maps and navigation, and monitored their stamina. I’ve compared readings from the wrist-based optical heart-rate sensors to more accurate chest straps, compared pace and cadence readings, splits and total distances, routes and traces. And since GPS accuracy is so important and varies between watches, I put the top contenders through two different urban stress test routes to see which devices were reliable and which lost the plot. The first saw me weave between the tallest buildings in the City of London, while the other was around the notorious Canary Wharf loop of the London marathon, which tends to send racers’ watches wild.Do you need a running watch?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: alvarez/Getty ImagesJust starting out? Use your phone for freeIf your running journey is just beginning, then it’s likely you already have a device to track your workouts. Your smartphone will be able to track your route, distance and pace; you just need the right app to do it.If you’re an iPhone user, Apple’s built-inFitness appcan track runs and other workouts, too. Android phones usually arrive with a workout-tracking app installed; which one will depend on the brand of your phone.Samsung’s Health,Google’s FitorFitbit, for example, can all track the basics.One of the most popular free, cross-platform apps isStrava. It not only tracks your workouts but also enables you to share them with friends and family through its integrated social features for support and encouragement.Do you already own a smartwatch?Similar to phone-based tracking, practically any smartwatch can be used for tracking runs. Even older versions of theApple Watch,Google Pixel Watchand theSamsung Galaxy Watchwill work great, with built-in GPS and heart-rate monitors, and many of them track far more than the basics.The downside is relatively short battery life, but they should be fine for runs under marathon distances. All models should come pre-loaded with fitness-tracking apps that can record your runs, butStrava also has free appsfor the Apple Watch and Google’s Wear OS.The best running watches for 2026View image in fullscreen‘If you want the very best running watch there is, there’s one clear winner’: the Garmin Forerunner 970.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest running watch for beginners:Garmin Forerunner 55GarminForerunner 55from£122.49£179.99 at Decathlon£122.49 at Amazon£179.99 at Decathlon£122 at AmazonThe Forerunner 55 is the cheapest in market-leader Garmin’s running watch lineup, and covers more than the essentials.As well as 20 hours of workout battery life, this compact watch offers solid heart-rate tracking and can monitor cadence, pace and other essential metrics. It connects to the excellentGarmin Connect appon your phone via Bluetooth orcomputer via USB, which can then send the data to Strava and other third-party apps.Using Garmin’s Coach feature, you can leave the watch to automatically create a training plan for you, or load your own structured workouts such as intervals. Sleep tracking and recovery tools help you figure out whether you should step up a gear or if you should be taking it easy. Plus, it has race-time predictions and a race planner, so you can pre-program the route and see what’s coming up around the bend.What sets the Forerunner 55 apart from the competition at this price, however, is the speed and accuracy of its GPS tracking. Despite lacking the more advanced dual-band GPS of pricier models, it proved surprisingly reliable during testing, even in the most built-up areas of central London.However, the Forerunner 55 is now a fairly old watch with a tiny low-res LCD screen and button-only functionality. It also lacks offline maps, music, contactless payments and many of the more advanced metrics that have become increasingly useful training aids on more modern and expensive watches.Screen:1.04in LCDWeight:37gWater resistance:5 ATMGarminForerunner 55from£122.49£179.99 at Decathlon£122.49 at AmazonBest budget running watch:Suunto RunSuuntoRunfrom£174.99£174.99 at SportsShoes£199 at Suunto£174.99 at SportsShoes£199 at SuuntoThe Run is a surprise budget hit from longtime Finnish GPS-maker Suunto, which takes the best bits of its pricey models and condenses them into a super-light, bright running watch for under £200.The good-size 1.3in OLED touchscreen is crisp and looks great, while the body of the watch is neat and slim on the wrist. It arrives with two lengths of a quick-release nylon band, but is also compatible with standard 22mm straps, should you prefer a silicone one.Heart-rate monitoring is solid, and the dual-band GPS achieves a lock quickly, outclassing many of its rivals for accuracy in our urban stress tests. The Run records most of the advanced metrics you’d need, including the usual pace, heart-rate zones, cadence, running power and dynamics, plus it has solid VO2max, training load and recovery tracking viewable on the watch or in thedecent Suunto phone app.The Run lasts a good 20 hours of tracking at its highest accuracy level, and has profiles for workouts on outdoor running tracks, multisport for triathlons and many other modes. It also supports structured workouts and interval training when things get a bit more serious.While the screen is bright enough to see in direct sunlight, some of the dim grey fonts were a struggle to read at a glance. Some of the metrics looked a little too similar when four were on the screen at the same time, too. But the two buttons and crown make navigating, starting and pausing the watch easy, and it’s useful to be able to disable the touchscreen during workouts to prevent accidental presses.The Suunto app, whether on an Android or iPhone, is fairly simple, displaying decent maps and graphs, plus daily health and sleep tracking. But the Run lacks offline maps, restricted to simple breadcrumb navigation – a line with no underlying map tiles – if you sync routes from your phone beforehand. It supports offline music via Bluetooth headphones, but only with MP3s; there’s no support for Spotify or other streaming services. The USB-C charging puck is a bit flimsy with weak magnets, too, so you have to be careful to keep the watch charging.Screen:1.3in OLED touchscreenWeight:36gWater resistance:5 ATMSuuntoRunfrom£174.99£174.99 at SportsShoes£199 at SuuntoAlternative:Coros Pace 3CorosPace 3from£178.99£178.99 at SportsShoes£199 at Amazon£178.99 at SportsShoes£199 at AmazonCoros’s Pace 3 is a popular budget running watch for good reason: it packs a lot in for the price. But for GPS accuracy, it was beaten by the Suunto Run in our urban stress tests. Its battery life is shorter, too, and it has an older-style LCD screen. It has similar limitations with offline music and no maps.A great option if the Suunto Run isn’t for you.Screen:1.2in LCDWeight:30g (nylon band)Water resistance:5 ATMCorosPace 3from£178.99£178.99 at SportsShoes£199 at AmazonBest mid-range running watch:Coros Pace ProCorosPace Profrom£299£299 at Healf£299 at Myprotein£299 at Healf£299 at MyproteinWith highly capable budget watches champing at their heels, mid-range running watches essentially add one thing: offline maps.One of the best in a crowded pack is the Coros Pace Pro, which offers a lot while costing less than rivals. It has a bright and crisp OLED touchscreen, a button and crown on the side for control, as well as decent haptics and beeps to let you know what’s happening.The interface is fairly basic but responsive, with the watch tracking a wide array of sports, including a triathlon. Its heart-rate tracking is solid, and the dual-band GPS got a lock quickly and performed well in our urban stress tests. Battery life is up to 31 hours in its highest accuracy mode, which is very good. It even ships with a natty little keyring charging adapter that you plug into your own USB-C cable and then into the back of the watch.The Coros tracks all the metrics you probably want, too, with a decent set of training and analysis tools. However, I did find its recovery metrics a little optimistic – and, bizarrely, its training load tools reset every Monday rather than using a seven-day rolling average, which make them a bit useless.Nevertheless, there are plenty of workout configuration options, with up to eight metrics on display per screen. They’re only accessible from theCoros appon your phone, though. That app is a little basic, but it gets the job done, displaying your data, routes and maps well.This app is also where you plan and send routes to your watch – you can’t create routes directly on the device. Browsing a map on the watch is fast and responsive via touch, as is zooming into road names using the crown. But if you do happen to veer off course, the watch can’t automatically re-route you back to the correct path.The Coros offers support for offline music, but it’s only of the MP3 variety, which is less useful when you use streaming services. It lacks contactless payment support, and while the Pace Pro is light and comfortable, it doesn’t look or feel as premium as some more expensive rivals.Screen:1.3in OLED touchscreenWeight:37g (nylon band)Water resistance:5 ATMCorosPace Profrom£299£299 at Healf£299 at MyproteinBest-looking mid-range running watch:Suunto Race 2SuuntoRace 2from£429£429 at SportsShoes£429 at Suunto£429 at SportsShoes£429 at SuuntoThe Suunto Race 2 just misses out on being the top mid-range pick: it’s significantly more expensive than the Coros Pace Pro, yet didn’t perform quite as well in our urban GPS stress tests.This watch has plenty going for it, though. It’s good-looking, with a solid, premium feel, while the large, crisp 1.5in OLED touchscreen is bright and covered in super scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. The crown and two buttons make it easy to control the device during workouts, and the excellent rubber straps give a secure fit.The Race 2 tracks more than 110 different sports, including multisport and triathlons, and the collection of free apps in the SuuntoPlus store can add extra elements to each sport profile, such as a cadence coach or a climb app. It tracks every running metric you’re likely to need, with a new decent heart-rate sensor and dual-band GPS traces, support for structured workouts and external sensors such as footpods. It also has a decent set of training and analysis tools, some of which are from leading training firmTrainingPeaks.Battery life is impressive, with an outstanding 55 hours of tracking at the highest accuracy levels. That figure drops if you turn on the always-on screen option, though. Its offline maps look great on the big touchscreen, but like the Coros Pace Pro and other non-Garmin watches, you have to set routes on your phone first or rely on manual navigation.The companion app on your phone is a little basic-looking but has decent maps, stats, data and graphs, plus daily health and sleep tracking. Compared with a Coros or Garmin, the watch is a little short on different faces and customisations, but the ones included look good. It doesn’t have contactless payments or offline music, either.Screen:1.5in OLED touchscreenWeight:76g (steel); 65g (titanium)Water resistance:10 ATMSuuntoRace 2from£429£429 at SportsShoes£429 at SuuntoThe best running watch money can buy:Garmin Forerunner 970GarminForerunner 970from£579£579 at Blacks£629.99 at Cotswold OutdoorPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£579 at Blacks£629.99 at Cotswold OutdoorIf you want the very best running watch there is, there’s one clear winner: the Garmin Forerunner 970. It tracks every metric and statistic you could possibly want, both on the run and after the fact, and looks the business doing it.Alongside a compact and comfortable fit, the watch has a large and crisp OLED touchscreen, protected by super-hard sapphire crystal. There are five buttons for when you don’t want to use the touchscreen; contactless payments; and a built-in speaker and microphone for calls, voice commands and accessing your phone’s voice assistant. The Forerunner 970 even has an extremely useful built-in torch, which can be used as a strobe light for running or for just illuminating your way at night.On a run, the watch can clearly show up to eight different metrics onscreen at once and has excellent, highly detailed built-in offline maps. Unlike competitors, Garmin’s maps are routable, which means you can plan routes on the watch itself, and it can re-route you like a car’s GPS if you veer off course. It also supports offline music from various streaming services, including Spotify, Amazon and YouTube Music, or your own MP3s.Garmin’s dual-band GPS with best-in-class tracking accuracy did very well in our urban stress tests. Plus, its battery lasts a solid 23 hours of tracking – or more, if you turn down the screen’s brightness, or switch to less power-hungry GPS modes. The heart-rate sensor remains consistent even in difficult conditions and takes ECGs for monitoring arrhythmia, similar to the best health-tracking watches.The Forerunner 970 comes with the full suite of Garmin’s industry-leading fitness tracking, training and recovery tools. That includes the new impact load and running tolerance metrics that help you avoid injury by more accurately measuring the strain each run puts on your body, while keeping a rolling seven-day log of distance and impact, so you don’t overdo it.If you want to track more than running, the watch is fully triathlon-ready and tracks 30-plus sports of all guises. It’s great at general health and activity tracking, too, with various coaches for sleep, training and recovery. Garmin’s excellent automatic workout plans can be tailored to upcoming races or can be replaced by your own or third-party plans just as easily.TheGarmin Connectapp is the best in the business, with every stat, analyses and metric you’re likely to want to deep dive into; solid route planning and built-in social features, including options to share the data to Strava or other platforms; plus a good website for big-screen interrogation.Read our fullGarmin Forerunner 970 review: the new benchmark for running watchesScreen:1.4in OLED touchscreenWeight:56gWater resistance:5 ATMGarminForerunner 970from£579£579 at Blacks£629.99 at Cotswold OutdoorAlternative:Garmin Fenix 8GarminFenix 8from£692£769.99 at Argos£692 at AmazonPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£769.99 at Argos£692 at AmazonIf you like the sound of the Forerunner 970 but want a watch that looks more like a traditional timepiece, the Fenix 8 has all the same features and more.

And if you really have to go the distance, switch to a special “expedition GPS mode” and it will manage up to 77 days.This level of stamina does come with a few drawbacks, though. The first is its sheer size: the Enduro 3 is massive all round, and uses a low-power LCD screen rather than the fancy OLEDs equipped to Garmin’s other watches.Otherwise, it has most of the same features and high accuracy levels as the Forerunner 970 and Fenix 8, including offline maps and a torch.Screen:1.4in LCDWeight:63gWater resistance:10 ATMGarminEnduro 3from£615.99£615.99 at SportsShoes£649 at MilletsBest running watch with LTE/satellite:Garmin Fenix 8 ProGarminFenix 8 Profrom£875.49£875.49 at SportsShoes£991.57 at John LewisPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£875.49 at SportsShoes£991.57 at John LewisAll running watches have at least a guide or a map to help you out in tricky situations, but a new breed of devices has recently upped the game by adding cellular and satellite connectivity – which could help save your life in an emergency.At the top of the game is the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, which takes the excellent regular Fenix 8 and adds LTE and satellite connectivity. If it has mobile signal, it can keep you in contact and share your location with loved ones without you having to carry a phone. More importantly, you can contact the emergency services via satellite if you find yourself without reception in Europe and North America.Coupled with its full offline mapping, including re-routing on the watch, and the fact it tracks every metric under the sun, it’s a killer go-anywhere, do-anything device.However, for all this functionality, you’ll need to part with the big bucks. In addition to the cost of the watch, you’ll have to subscribe to Garmin inReach for the phone-free communications features, which costs from £7.99 a month.Read our fullGarmin Fenix 8 Pro review: built-in LTE and satellite for phone-free messagingScreen:1.4in OLED touchscreenWeight:77g (47mm); 90g(51mm)Water resistance:10 ATMGarminFenix 8 Profrom£875.49£875.49 at SportsShoes£991.57 at John LewisAlternative:Apple Watch Ultra 3AppleWatch Ultra 3from£719£719 at John Lewis£719 at ArgosPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£719 at John Lewis£719 at ArgosIt may not be a dedicated running watch, but the Apple Watch Ultra 3 ticks almost every box for running if you’re an iPhone user, including a dual-band GPS that was one of the most accurate in our urban stress tests.The latest model adds emergency satellite communications to its existing cellular connectivity, so like the Fenix 8 Pro, it can help you seek rescue if you find yourself in a sticky situation off-grid.Elsewhere, it tracks almost every running metric you could need, has a big and bright screen, an accurate heart-rate monitor and a durable body made of titanium and sapphire. Battery life isn’t quite as long as proper running watches when tracking, but it will manage a marathon or two. And it comes with all the trappings of a true smartwatch, including offline maps, music, Apple Pay, notifications and Siri.The Apple Watch only works with an iPhone, and while the satellite SOS feature is free, using 4G or 5G requires a compatible plan with your phone provider.Read our fullApple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhoneScreen:1.93in OLED touchscreen;weight:61.6g (natural titanium strap);water resistance:WR100AppleWatch Ultra 3from£719£719 at John Lewis£719 at ArgosOthers worth consideringView image in fullscreen‘Remains extremely capable’: the Garmin Forerunner 965.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGarmin Forerunner 570– a really great running watch that’s just a little too expensive for what it offers, in particular, the lack of offline maps. A great option at a discounted price, though.Suunto Race– software updates see the predecessor to the great Race 2 gain most of the new features of recent models. It’s a smart buy at a good discount.Garmin Forerunner 165– Garmin’s entry-level OLED running watch is great, but it costs a bit too much to be a budget pick and lacks dual-band GPS. Look for a deal.Garmin Forerunner 265– the older-generation mid-range Garmin was one of the best with dual-band GPS, an OLED screen and multiple sizes, but was quite expensive at launch without maps and has since been phased out.Garmin Forerunner 965– Garmin’s previous top-of-the-line Forerunner remains extremely capable, missing only a few of the Forerunner 970’s features. A good buy at a steep discount.How I pickedGo to the effort of buying a dedicated running watch and you want the device on your wrist to at least work as hard as you are, pounding the pavements. So while practically any watch with a GPS will get the job done to some extent, it’s the features below that I considered alongside when selecting models for this test:Screen– it has to be bright, crisp and clear enough to view and understand at a glance during the run.Fit and profile– it has to sit on the wrist comfortably and securely, neither moving about during vigorous exercise, nor being too tight as you become warm due to activity.Strap replacement– straps become sweaty, smelly and wear out, so being able to replace them easily is essential, either with a like for like, or with different options for different occasions.Ease of use on the run– do the buttons work, can you lock the touchscreen, are the haptics strong enough, and can you hear the beeps and chimes while pushing for that next PB?Heart-rate accuracy– accurate and consistent heart-rate tracking is essential for using heart-rate zones for training, as well as evaluating effort, fitness and recovery.GPS accuracy– how long does the watch’s GPS take to get a lock and how well does it hold on to it in difficult forested or urban conditions? This is vital for accurate traces, distances, paces and various other metrics.Battery life– will it last long enough for all your weekly runs, and how often will you have to charge the device?Water resistance and durability– a running watch should be able to take some punishment and survive rain, wind, mud, snow, sleet, swims, freezing temperatures and baking summer days – anything you can cope with, it should do too.Companion app and data export– a good cross-platform app is essential, offering reliable syncing, plenty of stats, graphs and maps, as well as the ability to send your data to Strava, other services, or export it to industry-standard files such as GPX or FIT for use elsewhere.Training and analysis– how good is the data analysis of your training, fitness and recovery? Is it representative and will it adapt to your progress?Software support– a running watch isn’t a huge target for cybercriminals, but since it and the connected service contain a lot of sensitive data, it should be secure and kept up to date for an extended period.For more:The best running shoes for men and womenThe best treadmills, testedThe best fitness tech and gadgets, according to expertsSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorExplore more on these topicsSmartwatchesThe FilterRunningHobbiesHealth & wellbeingGadgetsbest ofShareReuse this content"

We were coming all the way from Albany in Western Australia and drove across the Nullarbor to get there – not exactly a “lap of the map”, but still a big trip. We’d packed our bikes, surfboards and our kelpie, Anzac.It was all going beautifully until we got to St Helens in Tasmania. We were looking forward to hitting the bike trails and the beach. But what was meant to be a fun day of mountain biking quickly turned into a stressful, late-night rescue when my husband broke his leg on the trail.Thanks to the incredible local emergency services, he was located, rescued and airlifted to hospital. As I watched him being flown off the mountain by helicopter, relief flooded through me – and then reality hit. I was now solely responsible for the dog, the vehicle and the camper trailer still set up back at the caravan park. Packing up the trailer was a two-person job. Hobart was four hours’ drive from here. My family and friends were 4,000km away in Western Australia. And Anzac needed a walk!The kindness of strangers: a boy picked up my spilled shopping when I was too pregnant to reach the groundRead moreThe next day, new neighbours arrived at the campsite. Exhausted and worried, I managed a small smile as a man named Sam said hello and began setting up with his partner. I wondered what they thought – a solo woman with a dog, no partner in sight, and a camper full of gear.Eventually, Sam’s curiosity got the better of him. He asked a few gentle questions and, after two days of silent stress, the whole story poured out.Sam listened patiently, kindly. He nodded, said little, and returned to his own camp. That evening, he and his wife, Hillary, did something extraordinary. With no fuss and no hesitation, they told me they’d pack everything up for me. “Tasmania has given us a warm hug,” they said. “Now we want to pass that hug on.”They invited me to join them for dinner and a seat at their campfire, sharing their food, their warmth and their company. I hadn’t realised how much I needed that simple kindness. It felt like the first deep breath I’d taken in days.The next morning, true to their word, they arrived ready to help. And what followed was no small task. My husband, still in a hospital bed, talked us through the process over the phone. It was fiddly, complex and physically demanding. Piece by piece, with calm and methodical care, Sam worked it all out, while Hillary offered encouragement, guidance and good humour. It would have taken me days on my own and, even then, I’m not sure I could have done it.But their kindness didn’t stop there. It would take weeks of recovery before my husband’s leg was stabilised enough for us to begin the drive home, with him in the passenger seat the whole way. Sam and Hillary helped me find an Airbnb close to the hospital in Hobart to stay in and made sure I had everything I needed to get through the next part of the journey. They checked in with us along the whole drive home to make sure we got back to WA safely.I will never forget that holiday. Not just because of the accident, or the brilliance of the emergency services, but because of Sam and Hillary. When you’re thousands of kilometres away from family and friends, you realise that all that matters in the end is our relationships with others. Sam and Hillary stepped in when there was no one else around to offer support, steadiness and invaluable practical help. They gave me a warm Tasmanian hug – just when I needed it most.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Not because of the drink, or the fireworks, or the pressure of staying awake past midnight (although that alone should qualify as an endurance sport). Like Valentine’s Day and your birthday, what makes New Year’s Eve perilous is the collective insistence that this night has to deliver: the best meal, the best party, the best version of ourselves. High expectations that will inevitably lead to disappointment, and haven’t we had our fair share of that already?There was one year in the restaurant when we convinced ourselves that the only way to rise to the occasion was a set menu of showstoppers. We thought we had predicted everything, and we assumed (boldly, wrongly) that everyone would choose the chocolate dessert. It made sense: who wouldn’t want chocolate on the most celebratory night of the year? So the tarte tatin went on the menu as a polite alternative, a back-up singer, not the star. Except, of course, everyone wanted the tarte tatin.What followed was a caramel-slicked nightmare. We were making individual tarte tatins to order; the kitchen turned into a quagmire of apple peel and sugar, with bubbling pans of molten sugar, apples wedges threatening to leap out, and warm, buttery pastry sliding around like a mischievous toddler on an ice rink. Caramel burns, panicking chefs, hot trays hitting the pass with a slap. Happy customers, though.Another year, we convinced ourselves to go “high concept” with a surprise menu: mysterious, ambitious, theatrical. We loved the idea so much that we forgot to do the sensible thing: plan, prep and test it properly. The kitchen degenerated so quickly that it felt as if we were trapped inside a live-action cautionary tale, except this time the customers were not happy at all. I was working the floor that night, and even though I knew what things were like in the kitchen, I’d have given anything to have a door between me and the angry mob in the dining room. That was more than a decade ago, but the experience is still too raw and the details too embarrassing to share, even in therapy. Let’s just say that one table was so upset that I offered to order them a pizza. Or sushi. Or whatever they wanted. Anything to make them happy, and anything that did not involve us.After that, we swore (loudly, dramatically) that we were done with New Year’s Eve – and, for a while, we were. One of those quiet years coincided with the first NYE in our current flat. We managed to forget all about it and went to bed early, only to be woken by loud explosions and a glow flashing through the curtains. We sat up and realised we could see fireworks from our bed – proper London fireworks, the big ones, with the city lit up like a giant glitter bomb. It turned out that you can see the fireworks from almost every window in our flat. From the front you get Battersea, Clapham and Brockwell Park – multiple displays at slightly different rhythms, like a pyrotechnic conversation. From the back you get Waterloo and London Bridge, and those enormous coordinated shows that shake the sky. For those, though, you have to stand in the bathtub, which feels ridiculous until the first golden chrysanthemum explodes over the river and suddenly it feels like the most magical place in the world. It’s probably the reason we’ll never move.Such a treasure must be shared, so now we do – when we can bear it. And because we always invite too many people, and because the flat is small and the bathtub not big enough to hold everyone, we stick to the only NYE strategy that actually works: something simple, abundant and forgiving. A buffet-style situation with one big, generous dish and plenty of bits to pile on top and around it.Our favourite is a chicken-and-rice number withamba, an Iraqi condiment that should win some kind of global diplomacy award for making everything taste better. Made from fermented sour mangoes and spices, amba is tangy, funky and bright, a bit like a firework for your palate. If you know it, you know how good it is; if you don’t, treat yourself to something that will make the coming year that much more delicious. If you can’t find it or can’t be bothered to look, use piccalilli instead: same spices, different fermented biomass.We lay out pickles, chilli sauce, a fresh chopped salad and a bowl of tahini sauce (our never-fail default). People scoop rice into their bowls, pile some chicken on top with zigzags of amba and tahini, plus pickles for crunch, freshness and heat. It’s perfect when you have more bodies than chairs and no chance of sitting down, and it’s the right pitch for our kind of NYE: festive without fuss, domestic comfort – but with fireworks.Chicken with amba or piccalilli one-pot wonderServes4, or 8 as part of a larger spreadFor seasoning the chicken1kg bonelesschicken thighs(about 8 pieces), ideally with the skin on1 tbsp ground cumin1 tsp paprika1 tsp turmeric2 tbsp flaky sea salt2 tbsp olive oil(if using skinless chicken)3-4 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced (250g)3 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced (250g)2 fennel bulbs, trimmed, halved and thinly sliced (250g)4garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushedFor the amba rice1 tbsp olive oil2 shallots, peeled and finely diced (120g)3 carrots, peeled and grated on a corse grater (250g)500g jasmine rice400ml boiling water100g ambaor 100g chunky piccalilliTo serveChopped flat-leaf parsleyLemon wedgesMix the chicken pieces with the spices and salt to coat, then place skin-side down in a large ovenproof saute pan with a lid. If you are using skinless chicken, add two tablespoons of olive oil to the pan before adding the chicken. Place on a medium-low heat and fry for eight to 10 minutes, until the skin is golden all over; remove the chicken with a pair of tongs to a bowl.Add all the sliced vegetables and crushed garlic to the pan, mix well and saute over a low heat for six minutes. Empty into the bowl with the chicken.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Return the pan to the heat, add the tablespoon of olive oil and the diced shallot and grated carrots. Mix well and cook over a medium-high heat for about five minutes, until the carrots start to collapse. Add the rice and mix well to coat, then return the content of the chicken bowl to the pan, with all the juices – this is very important because this is the only salt and flavouring you are adding to the dish. Mix a little to bury the vegetables and chicken in among the rice kernels.Mix the boiling water with the amba or piccalilli, and pour over the rice. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, cover first with a sheet of baking paper, then a lid (or silver foil), and transfer to the oven for 25 minutes.Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes, before uncovering and serving with plenty of freshly chopped parsley, plus a few lemon wedges.Explore more on these topicsFoodNew yearChickenMeatMiddle Eastern food and drinkVegetablesStewrecipesShareReuse this content"

Time to turn the tables …As told toClare FinneySun 28 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 04.08 ESTShareAs the wildly popularsocial media platformcelebrates its 10th year, we ask the Topjaw frontman what he loves – and hates – about eating out during the festive season.LovesPiesI love pies. I scoff when people ask: “What is British cuisine?” First, we have the most diverse culinary scene on the planet, with great Asian and Mediterranean food everywhere. And, second, what even is British cuisine?! A pie is one of the greatest dishes ever created. Think a chicken, rabbit and tarragon pie, with good 50:50 butter:potato mash and really good gravy. I don’t want to eat that in July, sure, but on a chilly day, there is no better dish. That brings me on to one of my other great loves: game.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: littleny/Getty Images/iStockphotoGameWe are in game season right now, and I love seeing the different spins on it.The Harwood Armsin west London does one of the best game dinners in town; so doesTrulloin Islington. AndCamillein Borough Market should be a pilgrimage for anyone with even a half-interest in food – they’re making game and, especially, offal super-accessible and genuinely delicious.I like how jolly everyone is. I love how often you see your friends, and that you have far longer and more meaningful dinnersCandlesCandles are one of the most primitive things we have in a world of double-glazing, wifi and electric cars, but, just as there is no camera as good as the human eye, you will never make a light source that does what a candle can do. I just got back from filming in Paris, where candlelight is everything. For filming, it’s a nightmare, but for atmosphere and pleasantries nothing matches it.Red wineI drink red wine all year round, and often get a raised eyebrow from waiters and friends, but a crisp white just doesn’t do it for me; it’s a gateway drug for red. Come winter, I’m drinking full-bodied reds that are velvety and daring to be jammy, and just about everyone else is doing the same. I really enjoy that.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: wundervisuals/Getty ImagesBlinisMy mum isn’t winning any cooking awards any time soon, but she makes her own little blinis, with salmon and maybe a little bit of caviar if we’re feeling extravagant, and it’s harder to get a better canapé than that. There are people who want to get all creative with canapés, but I say don’t mess with the classics.Silly seasonI love silly season. All the wheels come off, no one is exercising any kind of restraint, and everyone is up for everything, even if it’s a Monday. People fudge things – there are lots of lunches – and, of course, that can be a little dangerous and stressful, but I like how jolly everyone is. I love how often you see your friends, and that you have far longer and more meaningful dinners, because it gets dark earlier, so you start earlier. In winter, the weather doesn’t give people a better offer. If you’ve got a party or an event, people show up – and they show up at 7pm, because it’s dark and they want the night to start.PubsLike dogs, pubs aren’t just for Christmas; they’re for all year round. But at this time of year they are probably the best thing the UK has to offer, and I love bouncing around them. At the risk of sounding like an alcoholic, no building will hug you like a pub.HatesCoat fuckerySo many restaurants, for obvious reasons, don’t have extensive cloakrooms, so you either have to sit with your coat on the back of your chair in a restaurant full of people and candles, getting all hot and sweaty, or you have to put it in a pile with everyone else’s and trust that nothing gets nicked.Steamy windowsI don’t really hate them as such in restaurants – rather they give me the ick. They remind me ofthat scene in Titanicwhen Jack and Rose are getting off in a car. A crisp, frosty window is lovely, but a steamy window? Just no.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty ImagesDry JanuaryOf all the months, January is the one you need to do the most drinking in. It is a heinous month, not least because it sucks for the pubs and the hospitality sector in general. I know the likes of Lucky Saint have a field day, but it sucks for everyone else. So, for the past few years, my friends and I have a Saturday Swim Club in January, when we all get together and do a big pub crawl.Jesse Burgess is co-founder and host ofTopjaw, a food and travelsocial media platform.Knife Edge: Chasing Michelin Stars, presented by Burgess, is available on Apple TV now.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsWinter food 2025Christmas food and drinkChristmasFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can I support her – and cope with the loss?It might seem like all gains for her and all losses for you, but it’s really the start of an exciting new chapter in your relationshipAnnalisa BarbieriSun 28 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 15.02 ESTShareI am a singlemum to an 18-year-old daughter. It has always been just us two, andwe have a very open, supportive, healthy relationship.She is goingawayto university in thenewyearand hasrecentlydeveloped a new friendship groupI know less well thanher old friends. They all seem friendly, lookout for each other, and don’tletanyone go home on their own, etc.At first, I found her being out late with her friends particularly worrying. It took me a few days to get used to this new part of life, but we talked and Igot across to her that it’s purely me worrying about her safety– I think she felt I was annoyed with her.I just worry, though I really appreciate that she keeps me informed of where she is, and I know many 18-year-olds wouldn’t be so open.Now one friend is becoming a boyfriend and staying over. Itseems very fast and I’m struggling to take itin. This empty nest is happening more suddenly than Iexpected and I miss her even though she hasn’t left yet.I know I have no control.I know I have to just be there for herand keep communication channels open. Butshould I do more?I supposethere are two issues: is this OK for her; and how do I get through this period?This is a major transition for both of you, but whereas for your daughter it seems to be all about new experiences and “gain”, for you it seems more about loss. The reality is that this is about letting go of the old, accepting the new and sitting with some feelings which may be uncomfortable for both of you.It sounds as if you have a really good relationship and you’ve given your daughter a solid base from which to fledge, which is an essential next step. Her feeling shecanleave home is also good news. Some children feel they can’t because they feel their parents are too vulnerable or needy. As for the boyfriend, are you comfortable with him staying in your house? You do have a say here, just as you would for any other friend staying over.If you’re relying heavily on this relationship with your daughter for your emotional needs, that’s worth exploring, for your wellbeing and hersSo the answer to your first question, “Is this OK for her?” is a firm yes. She sounds capable and sensible, but it’s important she doesn’t feel responsible for your happiness. That’s on you to manage, and I talk as an Italian mamma. Otherwise she may stop coming to you if something worries her, as she’ll worry about you worrying.I went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Sarah Calvert, who thought it important to understand that this separation is healthy: “This is exactly what needs to happen even if it feels uncomfortable for you both.” She wondered if you’ve taken the time “to identify specifically what worries you? Is it anxiety about her safety? A sense of losing control? Perhaps the fear of what life looks like when it’s no longer ‘just the two of us’? Understanding your own fears is an important first step.”It will also help you separate out what’s your stuff to work through and what’s a real worry about something that may not be right. If you can, say these fears out loud to a trusted friend. When we don’t want to sit with uncomfortable feelings it’s easy to bat them away or “do” rather than think, so it’s really worth being brave and pondering the questions Calvert raises.I want be a single mum, but feel envious of peers with partners | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead more“I’d encourage you to have an open, honest conversation with your daughter about what kind of relationship she’d like with you now,” she says. “What does she need from you as she navigates this stage. While she’s building her independence she’ll still need and benefit from your love and support, just in a different form.”We’d both like you to consider what opportunities this next phase could bring. “What are your own needs and desires outside of being a parent?” Calvert asks. “If you’re relying heavily on this relationship with your daughter for your emotional needs, that’s worth exploring, for your wellbeing and hers.”Think about what brings you joy right now, take it slowly, reach out to friends. Expect days that feel heavier than others, but know they will pass. This is an exciting new chapter in your mother/daughter relationship, not the end of the story by any means.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Jeans, patented 152 years ago as workwear, have the power to make a wearer feel either on-trend or old fashioned, depending on their cut, wash and length and, most importantly, timing. As we bid farewell to 2025, it’s hard to decipher what exactly the jean of the year has been.In April, Vogue declared baggy white jeans as a“spring staple”. By August, it was endorsingslim cigarette styles, but by December“straight-leg jeans – not baggy, not skinny, but that sweet spot in between,”were the new must-have. In November,GQhailed a pair of vintage slim-cut Levi’s 501s worn by Ben Whishaw inPeter Hujar’s Dayas the “Sexiest movie jeans of 2025”. Add to the mix viralcarrot,horseshoeandstovepipeshapes and can anyone really keep up?Amy Leverton, founder ofDenim Dudes, a denim consultancy firm, says social media and a growth in competition have created greater choice. “Consumers have never been more in control of the narrative when it comes to fit trends,” she says. “The late 90s and early 00s were simpler times, where jean fits moved slowly, acted like a kind of ‘universal uniform’ and stuck around much longer.” Now, Leverton says, “the switch has flipped.”She points to aGap campaignreleased in August starring the K-pop-inspired girl band Katseye as exemplifying the trend. In the advert, each of the band’s six members and dozens of backing dancers appear in different types of jeans, including extra-baggy and flared styles.View image in fullscreenAt Gap, the focus is on a wide choice of styles and cuts … members of the band Katseye in different fits of Gap jeans.While there is no agreed It-jean of 2025, there has been a general loosening and widening of the silhouette. The catalyst was Kendrick Lamar’s half-time Super Bowl performance in February. When theAmerican rapper dissed Draketo more than 133 million viewers, he did so in a pair of women’s low-rise, blue-wash, bootcut jeans from Celine.According to John Lewis, out of the 1,349 styles of jeans available in its womenswear, wide-leg cuts have outpaced straight and skinny this year. At M&S, which is No 1 in the women’s jeans market, selling 10 pairs every minute, the current bestseller is awide-leg indigo wash jean. Barrel legs, a sort of balloon-like shape that hang wide on the hip and thigh, then tapers at the ankle, are also a strong performer. Since April, it has sold 47k pairs of itsmid-rise version.Yet at Levi’s,the XL straightin womenswear remains its most popular style. Anne-Catherine Lepas, vice-president of merchandising of Levi’s Europe, says part of their appeal is their versatility. Cut for a baggy fit, they feature an adjustable tie waist allowing the wearer to choose where they want them to sit.View image in fullscreenA pair of high-waisted carrot jeans from M&S.In womenswear Levi’s “baggy dad barrel” jean with a subtle curved leg has also gained traction, while in menswear the 568 and 578 styles, both of which take baggy inspiration from the 90s, are trending. Mitch Hughes, menswear director at M&S, describes giving its denim offering a “complete overhaul” with a focus on trend-led styles, including loose, tapered and baggy styles. After the success of the barrel leg in womenswear, the retailer introduced the shape into menswear in September and it’s now one of its most popular styles. At John Lewis, sales of men’s denim is up 484% year on year. Beth Pettet, head of menswear buying, says men are pivoting towards relaxed fits. Skinny jeans made up 15% of its denim offering in 2019. Now it is 5%.While Levi’s sees “a bigger traction” of low-rise and baggy fits with gen Z, Lepas says the XL straight and baggy barrel have resonated across genders and all age groups. Leverton says it is the versatility of a baggy fit that has multi-generational appeal. “Baggy is more universally adopted because no matter who you are, you can wear ‘your interpretation’ of it. Looser fits don’t have to be extreme,” she says. Even gen Xer Parker Posey posed in Gap’s baggy “Carpenter” jeans.Leverton describes a sense of individualism as a new challenge for brands. “A regular high-street brand really has to carry every fit and size in store, which isn’t great for the environment,” she says. “But in my opinion it is positive when it comes to easing the social pressure for consumers to jump on the new trend ‘just because’. Finding what you love and sticking to it is more acceptable.”You have to be careful with skinny jeans. We don’t want the whole world to look like sausagesBy August, baggy and flare styles were endorsed by the gen Z actor Sydney Sweeney in her controversial American Eagle campaign that wasaccused of pro-eugenics messaging. Despite widespread criticism andTrump weighing in, it fuelled interest in the brand, withshares up nearly 60%since the ad launched in July. It wasn’t the only politicised moment for jeans this year.Clipsof the 71-year-old US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr went viral in August when he was filmed doing a “Make America Healthy Again” gym challenge in baggy-ish blue jeans.In September, the lines between millennials and gen X were blurred once more when the actors Amanda Seyfried (millennial) and Julia Roberts (gen X)shared a pair of Versace high-rise, dark-wash, straight-leg jeansduring the Venice film festival. Elsewhere, Levi’s leaned into its western roots, which saw Beyoncé don some classic 501s.View image in fullscreenKendrick Lamar performs at the Super Bowl in women’s low-rise, blue-wash, bootcut jeans.Photograph: Biloxi Sun Herald/TNSSo does this mean it’s all over for skinny jeans? In short, no. Lamar’s jeans were designed by Hedi Slimane before he left Celine in 2024. He is the designer responsible for launching skinny jeans at Dior Homme circa 2000 and Saint Laurent during the 2010s. Fans of Slimane’s spindly silhouettes are known as Hedi boys, and now, thanks to the LA band the Hellp, are once againgaining traction. Its members, Noah Dillon and Chandler Lucy, gatekeep where their spray-on skinnies are from, although it is widely believed they hail from Slimane’s time at Dior and Saint Laurent. His successor at Celine, Michael Rideris also backing them. Even the ex-Balenciaga designer Demna, who made oversized everything his default, toldDie Zeitin June that he has lost interest in the XXL style. Although he did caveat with: “That doesn’t mean I’m going to start wearing tight stretch jeans. You have to be careful with skinny jeans. We don’t want the whole world to look like sausages.”So what can we expect in 2026? While Leverton describes a baggy flare as “kind of cool”, she doesn’t believe they have “main character energy”. For her the flare is “counter culture”, referencing how people collectively wore flares in the 70s. “I don’t see it as taking over again, at least not right now. It’s certainly a B-list denim trend and we’ll see it on the runway and on the streets, but I don’t think it has universal appeal.”Right now, jeans seem to be simply extreme. Jonathan Anderson, who showed straight styles in his debut Dior collection, just launched extra-long pavement-scraping styles for a mid-season women’s collection,describing themas “really weird”. On thefinal day of the F1 season in December, Lewis Hamilton was pictured in a giant pair with the circumference of a bank vault as he exited the paddock.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton in extra-wide jeans this year.Photograph: Ahmad AlShehab/NurPhoto/ShutterstockLeverton suggests that once we reach peak baggy, the pendulum will swing back and we will see “slimmer silhouettes gain traction, but not in the super-stretch ‘jegging’ direction that shaped the 2000s”. Her money is on a twisted baggy style, where the seams curve around the leg rather than sitting in a straight line.Meanwhile, Levi’s is betting on “the freedom to move between silhouettes – loose and baggy one day, skinny or low-rise the next”. But for those worried about soggy hems being the future, there is some reassurance. Leverton says looks such as Hamilton’s will “always live on the fringes of fashion”. But she says: “What I would bet my life on is that we’re not all going to be wearing them down Tesco Metro on a random Tuesday!”Explore more on these topicsJeansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a fever dream perhaps, but also here, in theBlackpoolIlluminations storehouse.Inside this nondescript building, close to Blackpool airport, is where the magic is made.A team of just 35 staff design, build and maintain theLancashiretown’s annual light display, which has endured for almost 150 years.View image in fullscreenNew displays need to be more resilient to strong winds and wintry weather.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIt is where the modern meets the traditional; a huge black cast iron drill dating back to 1937 is still used to construct the illuminations, but it sits alongside a cutting-edge 3D printer.“We don’t buy illuminations at all,” head of illuminations, Richard Williams, said. “We manufacture absolutely everything.”One of the biggest drivers for changes to their manufacturing process in recent years has been climate change. The designers have been forced to adapt the displays so they can withstand stronger winds, while also reducing their own energy output to avoid exacerbating the very problem they are trying to mitigate against.View image in fullscreenA team of 35 maintain the annual light display.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAgainst a wall in the storehouse is one of the most famous “heritage” illuminations, Hickory Dickory Dock, a huge tableau where a mouse runs up and down a grandfather clock. It has been badly damaged by strong winds.Now, rather than being constructed from solid blocks of wood, tableaux are designed in a trellis style, to allow the wind to rush through the gaps.“We’ve had to adapt more of [the manufacturing] now, because with the climate change, the winds have got a lot stronger, a real lot stronger, and we do get things that blow down occasionally,” Williams added.View image in fullscreenThe head of illuminations, Richard Williams.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIf there is a yellow wind warning in place, there will be someone on call to attend to any reports of falling lights; with an amber or red, staff patrol the seafront.While until recently the Illuminations season ran from late summer until early November, during Covid the season was extended until just after Christmas to boost the local economy. This time, it runs until 4 January.Many of the displays are decades old, but they are rebuilt, repurposed and modernised. “We started investing in LED technology back in 1999 and we’ve reduced our power consumption by 85% which is huge,” Williams said.“So it’s paid off for us. Even the last couple of years, because LED technology moves on all the time, we reduced our consumption by 1% each year for the last two years. So it’s still going, [and] really important.”View image in fullscreenOld displays are repurposed to create something new.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“Some [illuminations] are a lot older than me,” Williams said. “It’s really great for parents and grandparents to come back and see things that they remember.” And when an illumination is eventually retired, he said, “we’ll use everything that we can, and redesign it to something”.“Everyone loves the heritage, don’t they?” he added. “And I think there’s room for absolutely everything. So there’s room for new, but also room for traditional. I think that’s quite a challenge, getting that balance just right.”Throughout the season, lights are rotated in and out of the six-mile trail to encourage repeat visits. It means visitors could come two or three times during a season and see a different display each time.In recent years, they have moved to more interactive lights along the seafront; tunnels to walk through, and baubles to pose for a photograph inside.View image in fullscreenThe light display can also be explored by foot.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“That’s one of things we’ve tried to do now, is to get people out of their cars,” Williams said. “Obviously it’s better for them to be walking, but also better for us and the economy, because you might go and buy a cup of coffee and things like that. Because ultimately, that’s what we are, an economic tool.”In 2029, Blackpool Illuminations will mark its 150-year anniversary. “I’ve always said I feel like a custodian, I’m pretty honoured to look after it,” Williams said. “You always like to think you leave it in a better place than where it was, and then hand over to someone else for the next 150 years.”While there are now festive light trails in parks and tourist attractions all over the country, Blackpool is still the original, and, Williams would argue, the best. It is also free of charge – although public donations typically amount to £90,000 per year. “I think we can safely say we’re the capital of light now,” Williams said.And does he think the appeal will endure for the next 150 years? “I think it will, I think there’s always tradition,” he said. “Everyone might not have seen them, but they’ve heard of them.”Explore more on these topicsBlackpoolBlackpool holidaysLancashireUnited Kingdom holidaysUK weatherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Volunteers had nicknamed its elegant transom window the “croissant”, a nod to its curved shape. “I think it’s more of a peacock,” she said, admiring its branch-like details. The restoration project at one of Kyiv’s early 20th-century art nouveau houses was supported by residents, who celebrated with two pavement parties.It was also an act of resistance against Russia, she explained: “We are trying to live like normal people despite the war. It’s about arranging our life in the best possible way. We’re not afraid of staying inUkraine. I could have left the country and moved away to Italy or Germany. Instead, I’m here. The new entrance shows our commitment to our homeland.”View image in fullscreenLesia Danylenko outside the restored art nouveau doorway of her home in central KyivPhotograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianSaving Kyiv’s architectural heritage seems strange ata time when Russian missiles and drones routinely fall on the capital, bringing death and destruction. Since the beginning of 2025, the Kremlin has dramatically stepped up its aerial raids. After each attack, workers board up shattered windows with plywood and try, where possible, to save residential buildings.Amid the bombs, a group of activists have been attempting to preserve the city’s crumbling mansions, built in a playful style known as Ukrainian modernism. Danylenko’s house is in the central Shevchenkivskyi district. It was built in 1906 and was originally the home of a rich fur dealer. Its exterior is decorated with horse chestnut leaves and delicate camomile flowers.View image in fullscreenA volunteer restoring the front door of Danylenko’s building.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian“They are symbols of Kyiv. These properties are quite rare nowadays,” Danylenko said. The Austrian-German architect Martin Klug designed the mansion. Several other buildings nearby display similar art nouveau features, including asymmetry – with a gothic tower on one side and a turret on the other. One much-loved house in the area boasts two unhappy white stucco cats, as well as owls, masks and a devil.But Russia is only one threat. Preservation campaigners say they face unscrupulous developers who knock down listed buildings, corrupt officials and a governing class indifferent or hostile to the city’s rich architectural history. The harsh winter climate adds another burden.“Kyiv is a city where money wins. We don’t have real political will to save our heritage,” said Dmytro Perov, an activist with theHeritage Kyiv group. He claimed the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, was friends with many of the developers who bulldoze important houses. “Klitschko lives in an illegal building with a striptease club. His vision for the capital comes straight out of the 90s and Tony Soprano,” he alleged. Klitschko denies the claim, which he says comes from political rivals.View image in fullscreenThe preservation campaigner Dmytro Perov warns that neglect and unscrupulous development are endangering Kyiv’s architectural legacy.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianPerov said many of the civically minded activists who once defended older properties were fighting on the frontline or had been killed. Russia’s almost four-year war meant that everyone was facing financial problems, he added, including judges who mysteriously ruled in favour of dubious new-build schemes. “The longer this goes on the more we see degradation of our society and governing institutions,” he argued.He took the Guardian to one of the most egregious demolition sites in the riverside Podil neighbourhood. The street was home to classical 19th-century houses. A developer who acquired the plot agreed to preserve its attractive brick facade. A day after Russia’s 2022 invasion, diggers tore it down. Last week, a crane excavated foundations for a new shopping and business centre, watched by a surly security guard.Construction work in the Podil neighbourhood.Anatolii Pohorily, aHeritageKyiv supporter, said there was not much hope for the remaining turquoise-painted houses on the site. Sometimes developers levelled old properties while claiming they were doing “archaeological research”, he said. The Soviet Union also inflicted immense damage on the capital, reconstructing its Khreshchatyk thoroughfare after the second world war so it could accommodate tanks and communist military parades.View image in fullscreenAnatolii Pohorily is trying to preserve Kyiv’s pre-communist architecture from illegal development.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianOne of Kyiv’s most prominent champions of historic buildings,the tour guide and blogger Serhiy Mironov, was killed in 2022 while fighting in Bakhmut. His colleague Nelli Chudna said she and other volunteers were carrying on Mironov’s important preservation work. There were originally 3,500 brick-built mansions in Kyiv, many constructed for the city’s prosperous sugar barons. Only 80 of their original doors survived, she said.“It wasn’t Russian rockets that got rid of them. It was us,” she lamented. “The war could go on for another 20 years. If we don’t defend architecture now nothing will be left,” she added. Chudna recently helped to restorea characterful creeper-covered house built in 1910, which serves as the headquarters of herTrue Kyivorganisation and doubles as a film set and museum. The property has a new red door and authentic railings; inside is a period bathroom and antique mirrors.View image in fullscreenChudna is trying to preserve Kyiv’s architecture despite the pressures of war and development.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianThe building’s tenant, artist Yurii Pikul, described his home as “very cool and a little bit cold”. Why do many Ukrainians not value the past? “Unfortunately they lack education and taste. It’s all about business. We are trying as a country to go to the west. But we are still some distance away from civilisation,” he said. Soviet ways of thinking lingered, with people reluctant to take personal responsibility for their built surroundings, he added.Some buildings are collapsing because of official neglect. Chudna pointed to a once-magical villa hidden behind a modern hospital, the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation. Its roof had collapsed; pigeons nested among its broken windows;rubbish lay under a fairytale tower. “Often we don’t win,” she admitted. “Restoration is therapy for us. We are trying to save all this history and beauty.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureUkraine in depthUkraineEuropeHeritagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dologuélé was the runner-up in the last two elections – 2015 and 2020 – while Dondra briefly served under the president.The opposition hopes to tap into the frustrations of people living in a country where conflict is a daily reality. More than half a million people remain internally displaced within CAR, with a similar number living as refugees in neighbouring countries.However, Touadéra, a former mathematics professor who has been in power since 2016, is widely expected to extend his run in office.He went from an academic to a statesman after the then-president, François Bozizé, appointed him prime minister in 2008. Touadéra stayed in that role until 2013, when the administration was toppled by a rebel coalition, as sectarian violence triggered a civil war.After a chaotic three-year transition, Touadéra ran for office, and the perception that he was neutral, independent of the ex-Séléka and anti-Balaka militias, powered his second-round victory.A peace accord was signed in April with the two main rebel groups, and there is hope the country might be slowly stabilising. There had been “tangible progress to establish peace”, said Lewis Mudge, the centralAfricadirector at Human Rights Watch.Abdou Abarry, the head of the UN regional 0ffice for central Africa (Unoca) agreed, although added there were still challenges. “This is an opportunity to commend the remarkable recovery of the country, which is laying the foundations for peace consolidation among domestic actors and has undertaken measures to secure its borders, notably with Chad and Cameroon,” he told the UN security councilthis month.Still, there are concerns that supply-chain issues and violence could disrupt the vote, especially in some rural areas. The UN peacekeeping mission Minusca, whose mandate was recently renewed until next year, is providing the security and logistical support the state’s crumbling infrastructure cannot manage.There are claims the voter list was only published online, and not physically, even though most people have no internet access or electricity. The electoral issues have led to a band of opposition politiciansannouncing a boycott.According to Mudge, the irregularities could “disenfranchise large segments of the population” and undercut the integrity of the process.Many people worry that another Touadéra term – a 2023 constitutional referendum not only scrapped term limits but extended presidential mandates from five to seven years – would mean more free roaming for outside interests.After taking office, Touadéra put faith in the Russian mercenary firm Wagner, which provides part of his private security, while Minusca and Rwandan troops helped secure the countryside. Since its arrival in 2018, Wagner’s influence within CAR has grown such that despite the founder Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death, Touadéra has resisted Moscow’s calls to integrate the military contractors withinAfrica Corps, its successor entity.Rwanda, where the government often mentions the need for “African solutions to African problems”, has takena different approachfrom Russia, focusing on smaller business interests in CAR.In August, a pro-opposition media outlet claimed the government had evicted its own soldiers from a World Bank-funded youth training centre in Nzila, a village on the outskirts of the capital, Bangui, to clear the way for Rwandan troops to engage in a large livestock farming operation.“Touadéra is determined to sell off the country piece by piece and sacrifice the youth of the Central African Republic,” the editorial read.Explore more on these topicsCentral African RepublicAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Large areas of the country are excluded from the voting because they are under the control of anti-junta groups or in thegrip of fierce fighting.The Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP), a military proxy, is fielding the largest number of candidates and expected to emerge as the largest bloc.mapIn locations where the election is taking place, campaigning has been muted – lacking the vibrant, packed rallies that marked past votes. The red flags and signs associated with Aung San Suu Kyi, still the country’s most popular politician, and her party, the National League for Democracy, have been absent. The 80-year-old has beendetained since she was ousted, and herparty has been banned.‘Not for the people’: Myanmar junta prepares for elections designed to legitimise grip on powerRead moreThe election has been condemned by western governments, but has support from China, which is the military’s most important ally. China, Russia, India and Vietnam have sent election observers, according to military-controlled media.The military has rejected criticism of the election, saying it was being conducted with public support. The head of the junta told reporters on Sunday the vote was guaranteed to be a “free and fair” election.“It’s organised by the military; we can’t let our name be tarnished,” said Min Aung Hlaing, who led the coup. “People should vote,” he added. “If they don’t vote, I will have to say they don’t completely understand what democracy really is.”Turnout in Yangon appeared lower than in previous elections. At polling stations, most residents were reluctant to be interviewed, with some saying the election was too sensitive to be discussed publicly.There was little choice on the ballot paper, said a 28-year-old man, who did not give his full name. “We already know about the election, what will happen,” he said of the vote before a relative urged him to stop speaking, warning him police were nearby.Others only shrugged or smiled when asked how they felt about the vote. A 22-year-old, who also spoke anonymously, said young men were anxious about being conscripted into the military, and were anxious not to find themselves on the radar of the authorities during the election period.He added: “Living inMyanmaris a constant worry. Whether we vote or not, the worry is there. The worry is about business, personal lives, everything is very restricted, there is no freedom … There is problem in everything in daily life.”Preliminary results of the first phase of the election will be announced on Sunday, after polling booths closed at 4pm local time, Min Aung Hlaing told reporters.In total, 57 parties are competing, though only six are doing so nationwide. “On paper, voters see a long list of party logos; in reality, meaningful opposition has been banned, jailed, or forced underground,” analysis by the Asian Network for Free Elections, an NGO, said of the vote.Tens of thousands of people have been arrested in Myanmar for expressing political views since the coup, and in July the military introduced a new election protection law that prohibits disruption or criticism of the vote. People have been arrested for putting up anti-election stickers, or for sending private Facebook messages criticising the election. Those prosecuted under the law face a sentence of at least three years in prison, or even the death penalty.In September, a man in Shan state was sentenced to seven years with hard labour under the law for criticising the election in a Facebook post.Myanmar is going to the polls. But it’s not the people who hold the power – it’s ChinaRead more“I fear the nation is falling deeper and deeper into darkness,” said a resident in Yangon, who spoke anonymously before the election. She was not voting, and nor was her family, as they did not want to give the election credibility. Others may do so, she added, but only out of fear. “Some people are so afraid that if they don’t show up, the military will come to their homes and arrest them.”The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said the elections were “clearly taking place in an environment of violence and repression”.The UN rights office said it had received reports from displaced people in several areas of the country, including Mandalay region, who had been warned they would be attacked or their homes seized if they did not return to vote.The military has presented the vote as a return to normality, and on Saturday lifted a long-standing curfew in Yangon. However, intense conflict continues to rage across large areas of the country.In Sagaing region, air and artillery strikes by junta forces continued even as polling stations opened, while attacks were also carried by anti-junta groups, according to the independent outlet Myanmar Now.Myanmar has been gripped by conflict since the coup, which abruptly ended the country’s 10-year democratic transition.The coup initially prompted huge mass protests, which the military responded to with deadly force. In response, people took up arms and joined “people’s defence forces” to fight against the junta, at times in coordination with ethnic armed groups that have long fought for greater autonomy.The conflict has plunged the country into economic turmoil, with half the population now living below the poverty line, and led to “one of the world’s most dire and yet underfunded” humanitarian crises,according to the UN.Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on human rights for Myanmar, described Sunday’s vote as a “theatre of the absurd”. He warned there was a risk it could further entrench the junta’s rule, and represent a “significant step backward for the people of Myanmar”.Campaigners have called on governments to reject the vote. Yadanar Maung, a Justice For Myanmar spokesperson, said the election was an attempt by the military to “manufacture legitimacy while it slaughters civilians with total impunity”.The military has carried out relentless airstrikes as it attempts to regain ground lost to opposition groups since the coup, and has repeatedly been accused of indiscriminately attacking civilians. It has previously denied atrocities and has said any military operations are carried out against terrorists.The second phase of the vote will take place on 11 January, with a final round on 25 January.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaAsia PacificAung San Suu KyinewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing has used border closures to put pressure on powerful ethnic armed groups in the north of the country to agree ceasefires, and even hand back territory to the military, as it has stepped up diplomatic support and continued weapon transfers.“The newer drone technologies [introduced to the military] that’s related to China, the pressure on ethnic armed organisations, reducing the amount of resistance that the junta was facing in the northern part of the country, that’s on China,” he added. China has also introduced the military into platforms such as the Shanghai Cooperation OrganizationSummit, boosting its international standing, added Tower.Civil war continues to rage across much of the country, with the military still unable to control vast areas of territory, but China’s support has at least allowed it to regain some ground.Map of territory lost by the military junta since 2021China is no particular fan of Myanmar’s military, however. While it sells weapons to the junta, it also has ties with armed groups against which the military is fighting. China’s approach to both sides has changed.Beijing’s response to the coup was initially muted, but itbecame increasingly displeased by the conflictand economic chaos that followed, as new pro-democracy groups took up arms to fight the junta, at times in collaboration with more established ethnic armed groups that have long fought for greater autonomy.China, which shares a 2,185km (1,358-mile) border with Myanmar, is a major investor in the country, and has ambitious plans to build a corridor through Myanmar directly connecting south-western China to the Indian Ocean. Its infrastructure projects have been severely disrupted by the post-coup fighting, however.China has grown frustrated not only by the spiralling conflict, but also by the explosion in organised crime. It was anger over theproliferation in scam compoundsin border areas that led China to give its tacit approval to northern-based ethnic armed groups to launch an offensive against the junta in late 2023. Such groups rely on the Chinese border for supplies of weapons.These northern ethnic armed groups entering into the post-coup conflicttook the military by surprise, and vast swathes of territory fell.It was at this point that China “corrected course”, said Morgan Michaels, research fellow for south-east Asian security and defence at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, with China using border closures to push the ethnic armed groups into backing down. “Did China really ever intend to make those groups so strong that they were going to topple the Myanmar state apparatus? I don’t think so – because as soon as that became a possibility, China stepped in,” said Michaels.China disapproved of the coup because of the instability it has brought – but it feared that, were the junta to collapse, even greater chaos could follow.Keeping Beijing happyFor now, China has thrown its weight behind the Myanmar military and its election plans, which have been condemned by monitors and UN experts as a sham. Earlier this year the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, expressed hope the vote would achieve “domestic peace with a cessation of hostilities among parties and national governance based on the will of the people”, as well as national reconciliation and “social harmony”, according to China’s foreign ministry. It will send election observers, alongside countries including Russia and Vietnam.There is no true opposition running in the vote, which will be dominated by the military’s proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development party, which is providing more than a fifth of candidates and running in effect uncontested in some areas. Under the constitution, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing is obliged to assume the role of either the president, commander-in-chief or parliamentary speaker – though many believe he will be unwilling to relinquish power.The military has reassured China, saying that economic projects will go ahead, and has vowed to crack down on scam compounds, after bombing parts of theinfamous KK Park compoundover recent months. It’s unclear whether the military will be able to keep its promises, however.It is possible that, if the military is seen by China as squandering opportunities to form ceasefires with its opponents, or if, in two years’ time there is still no progress on infrastructure projects, Beijing may pivot away from the military again, said Tower.Anti-China sentiment has risen in Myanmar, including a perception that China is stoking conflict to increase its own leverage over the country – a characterisation Yun Sun, senior fellow and director of the China programme at the Stimson Center, disputes.“China doesn’t need a war to exert influence over any of the political players in the country,” she said.“I think what the Chinese will say is that they see the situation as a dynamism, that a balance of power will eventually lead to some stability,” she said. “Neither side is necessarily the horse that China has picked.”Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaChinaAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

The vessel’s operator, Coral Expeditions, said no one was hurt in the incident.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“Coral Adventurer had a grounding incident in coastal Papua New Guinea yesterday. All passengers and crew are safe,” the spokesperson said.“An initial inspection indicates no damage to the vessel. The incident has been reported to authorities and will undergo further official inspections to the hull and marine environment as a standard procedure.”The passengers are on Papua New Guinea while a team tries to refloat the ship and inspects the hull.The Coral Adventurer is under investigation, afterSuzanne Rees, 80, from Sydney,died when she left her hiking group on Lizard Island during an excursion on day two of a planned 60-day luxury circumnavigation of Australia.Her body was found on the island on Sunday 26 October, after a land and sea search was mounted when the ship’s crew realised she was not on board. Rees’ absence was noticed when she did not show up for dinner at about 6pm, with the ship turning round and heading back towards Lizard Island at 8.43pm. According to satellite tracking data, the Coral Adventurer was about 100km away when it turned back for Rees.The cruise company ended the tour early with all passengers flown home from the Torres Strait islands.The company’s chief executive officer, Mark Fifield, said “following the tragic passing of Suzanne Rees and previous mechanical issues, the decision had been made to cancel the remainder of the voyage” and that passengers would receive a full refund.Balcony rooms on the 120-guest cruise are priced at $86,400 a person, according to a listing on Clean Cruising.Explore more on these topicsPapua New GuineaCruisesnewsShareReuse this content"

It also means we need to have a longer, deeper look at arming CSG.“That is a step that we haven’t taken in the past, but the truth of the matter is, when it comes to ensuring that the community, the Jewish community, in this case, feels safe within their own community when they have community events, we need to be able to show and demonstrate that there is going to be security in place to deal with the threat.”Minns has committed to a NSW royal commission into the Bondi terror attack. Police allege father-son duo, Sajid and Naveed Akram, killed 15 people and injured 40 others in an attack on a Jewish festival in religiously motivated extremism “aligned with Islamic State”. Sajid was shot dead at the scene by police, and Naveed has been remanded in custody on 59 charges, including one count of committing a terrorist act.Minns said police would be carrying long-arm rifles at New Year’s Eve celebrations inSydney, adding: “That will be confronting for some people, but the truth is, we want to make sure that they’re in a position to send a message that security is the number one obligation of any government, and that’s what you’re going to see in the weeks ahead.”During last Sunday’s vigil marking a week since the attack – which fell on the last night of Hanukah – police carried long-arm guns and snipers were positioned on top of buildings overlooking Bondi.View image in fullscreenA NSW police sniper in position on the roof of an apartment building on Campbell Parade, Bondi, last Sunday.Photograph: Andrew QuiltyMinns indicated on Sunday he would not rule out requesting army troops be deployed to protect Jewish sites in the wake of the attack, after he was asked by a reporter if he would take this step.“We’re in discussions about it. I’m not prepared to front-run it, because obviously that’s a change for us,” he said. “But I’m just flagging with everyone. I’m not going to rule anything out.”Guardian Australia understands there are no current discussions with the government on whether troops should, or could, be deployed. The premier’s comments were referring to the fact that it is among a number of security options being considered.The prime minister’s office was contacted to seek a response to the premier’s comment.Asked during the press conference what his message would be to Sydneysiders who might feel “disturbed” by seeing police walking around with long-arm rifles, he said: “Look, my sense is, and I haven’t spoken to everybody in Sydney … but I have spoken to a lot of parents, and they would feel far more comfortable if there was a major police presence.”“That includes with the firepower that’s required to confront some evil terrorists on a bridge in Bondi if those circumstances were to repeat.”Explore more on these topicsChris MinnsSydneyNew South WalesBondi beach terror attacknewsShareReuse this content"

It will “impact Queensland at least for the next three to four days”, she said.“We are expecting to pick up a lot more rainfall through that region in the coming days,” she said.Pearce said the system would move farther east on Tuesday and Wednesday.“Seeing totals in excess of 500mm broadly across the region this week is not out of the question,” she said.Pearce said there was a risk to livestock, comparing the rain event to the2019 Townsville flood that caused massive inland flooding.The Queensland police minister, Dan Purdie, said the state disaster coordinator had spent the past week preparing for the potential flood.“The biggest concern in north-west Queensland is livestock and fodder, and the plan is in place to drop fodder [if roads are cut off],” Purdie said.The bureau has issued a moderate flood warning for the town of Winton, with the Diamantina River expected to flood on Sunday.There is also a longer-term major flood warning for Walkers Bend, for the Flinders and Cloncurry catchments. Flooding is expected in Cloncurry today.A second system is expected to cause heavy rain in the coastal regional around Townsville and Cairns. The area has already seen totals of about 100mm in the past day.Peace said the area is likely to see an additional 60 to 80mm today, with up to 200mm in isolated pockets. On Monday it will intensify with totals of 70 to 120mm, with some areas seeing 300mm or more.“At this stage, our flood team is looking at issuing some flood warnings, particularly for the regions around just to the north of Townsville, around the Bohle River,” she said.The wild weather is being driven by a monsoon trough inland and a monsoon low offshore, both driven by very high sea surface temperatures. It’s likely to continue all week, with rain slackening off later in the week, Peace said.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandAustralia weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Indeed,Volodymyr Zelenskyywent into the meeting saying that 90% of the plan was complete and came out of it saying 90% of it was complete, and Trump said only that they were getting “very close” to a deal. Neither offered up a timeline and said only that their teams would meet again in the coming weeks, with a subsequent meeting in Washington alongside European leaders also potentially on the cards.Indeed Trump said “one or two thorny issues remain” and unexpected issues could arise and cause the process to fall apart. Trump called the issue of territory an “unresolved issue” but said he believed it could be resolved, though he didn’t say how. And Zelenskyy made clear that Ukraine’s position on the Donbas remained different to Russia’s. “We have to respect our law and our people and “the territory which we control,” he said.And while the Ukrainian president did describe security guarantees – the “key milestone in achieving lasting peace” – as “100% agreed”, he added that their teams will continue working on this to “finalise all discussed matters”.Trump also said that he believes that that trilateral meeting between Russia, Ukraine and the US could happen “at the right time” and appeared to suggest thatVladimir Putin“wants to see it happen” too. He’s been saying that for a long time and, along with the ending of Russia’s invasion, it doesn’t appear – for now, at least – to be anywhere in sight.Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy hold a joint press conference after their lunch meeting in Florida.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersShareUpdated at18.21 EST"

Bardot was briefly hospitalised in October for what her office called a “minor” procedure.1:07French icon Brigitte Bardot dies aged 91 – video reportThe town hall in Saint-Tropez, where Bardot had holidayed as a child and where she later shot the film And God Created Woman, said the actor had “helped make Saint-Tropez shine across the world”.The town said Bardot was its “most radiant ambassador” and part of “the collective memory of Saint-Tropez, which we must preserve”.Bardot shot to international fame in 1956 with And God Created Woman, written and directed by her then husband, Roger Vadim, and for the next two decades was said to have embodied the idea of the archetypal “sex kitten”. In the early 1970s, however, she announced her retirement from acting and became an outspoken campaigner on animal rights, and increasingly active politically on the far right.Bardot’s incendiary comments about ethnic minorities, immigration, Islam and homosexuality resulted in a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred. French courts fined her six times between 1997 and 2008 for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community. In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 (£13,000) for describing Muslims as “this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts”.Jordan Bardella, the president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party (RN), which Bardot supported, wrote: “Brigitte Bardot was a woman of heart, conviction and character. An ardent patriot, devoted to animals that she protected throughout her life, she embodied a whole French era, but also above all a certain idea of courage and freedom.”View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in 2007.Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty ImagesLe Pen, whom Bardot once described as “the Joan of Arc of the 21st century”, wrote on social media that Bardot was “exceptional for her talent, courage, frankness and beauty”. “She was incredibly French,” she said. “Free, indomitable, whole. She will be hugely missed.”Such was Bardot’s role in the far right’s cultural pantheon that tributes were also paid to her from Italy’s government, where the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, called her “a timeless star, but above all a woman who was free, nonconformist, protagonist of courageous battles in defence of our traditions”.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in 1958.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/AllstarThe Italian culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, said: “Brigitte Bardot was not only one of the great protagonists of world cinema, but also an extraordinary interpreter of western fundamental freedoms.” He said she “resolutely defended her vision of cultural and social values and civic engagement”.Brigitte Bardot – a life in picturesRead moreBorn in 1934 in Paris, Bardot grew up in a prosperous, traditional Catholic family but excelled enough as a dancer to be allowed to study ballet, gaining a place at the prestigious Conservatoire de Paris. At the same time she found work as a model, appearing on the cover of Elle in 1950 while still 15. As a result of her modelling work, she was offered film roles; at one audition she met Vadim, whom she would marry in 1952, after she turned 18. Bardot was cast in small roles, with increasing prominence, playing Dirk Bogarde’s love interest in Doctor at Sea, a big hit in the UK in 1955.But it was Vadim’s And God Created Woman, in which Bardot played an uninhibited teenager in Saint-Tropez, that consolidated her image and turned her into an international icon. The film was a huge hit in France, as well as internationally, and catapulted Bardot into the front rank of French screen performers.As well as for cinema audiences, Bardot swiftly became aninspiration for intellectuals and artists; not least the young John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who demanded their then girlfriends dye their hair blond in imitation of her. The columnist Raymond Cartier wrote a lengthy article about“le cas Bardot”in Paris-Match in 1958, while Simone de Beauvoir published her famous essay Brigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome in 1959, framing the actor as France’s most liberated woman. In 1969, Bardot was chosen as the first real-life model for Marianne, the symbol of the French republic.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in The Bride is Much Too Beautiful from 1956.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesIn the early 1960s, Bardot appeared in a string of high-profile French films, including Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Oscar-nominated drama The Truth, Louis Malle’s Very Private Affair (opposite Marcello Mastroianni) and Jean-Luc Godard’s Contempt. In the second half of the decade, Bardot took up a number of Hollywood offers: these included Viva Maria!, a Mexican-set period comedy with Jeanne Moreau, and Shalako, a western with Sean Connery.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in Doctor At Sea from 1955.Photograph: John Springer Collection/Corbis/Getty ImagesBardot also had a parallel music career, which included recording the original version of Serge Gainsbourg’s Je T’Aime … Moi Non Plus,which Gainsbourg had written for herwhile they were having an extramarital affair. (Afraid of scandal after her then husband, Gunter Sachs, found out, Bardot asked Gainsbourg not to release it. He went on to re-record it with Jane Birkin, to huge commercial success.)Bardot found the pressure of stardom increasingly irksome,telling the Guardian in 1996: “The madness which surrounded me always seemed unreal. I was never really prepared for the life of a star.” She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, after making the historical romance The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot. Her primary focus became animal welfare activism,joining protests against seal hunts in 1977and establishing the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in 1986.Bardot subsequently sent letters of protest to world leaders over issues such as dog extermination in Romania, dolphin killing in the Faroe Islands andcat slaughter in Australia. She also regularly aired outspoken views on religious animal slaughter. In her 2003 bookA Cry in the Silenceshe espoused rightwing politics and took aim at gay men and lesbians, schoolteachers and the so-called “Islamisation of French society”, resulting in a conviction for inciting racial hatred.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot  in 1958.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveBardot was married four times: to Vadim between 1952 and 1957; Jacques Charrier between 1959 and 1962, with whom she had a son, Nicolas, in 1960; Sachs from 1966-69; and to the former Le Pen adviser Bernard d’Ormale, whom she married in 1992. She also embarked on a number of high-profile relationships, including with Jean-Louis Trintignant and Gainsbourg.View image in fullscreenBardot outside court in Edinburgh in 1998 celebrating a reprieve for Woofie the dog, who was due to be put down for chasing a postal worker.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsBrigitte BardotFranceEuropeJean-Luc GodardWorld cinemaSerge GainsbourgAnimal welfarenewsShareReuse this content"

Bardot had an allure that was dazzling in its glamour, yet so natural that to gaze on it felt like a gift from the heavens.In style, as in life, timing is everything – and Bardot became the poster girl for that sweet spot of postwarFrancein which the storied heritage of Gallic culture was electrified by the Bohemian spirit of Paris in the 1950s and 60s.With her penchant for gingham – she famously wore a pink gingham wedding dress for her second marriage, in 1959 – she seemed to sing of the nostalgic, apple pie femininity with which Christian Dior had recently bewitched the world in his New Look of the late 1940s. But there was also a wildness to her. The gap-toothed smile was all wine and Gauloises. The off-the-shoulder necklines that came to be named for her made her look as if she was wrapped loosely in a towel or a bedsheet, rather than fully dressed.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot on the set of Boulevard du Rhum.Photograph: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty ImagesThat Bardot was naturally a brunette, as seen on her first French Elle covers in the 1950s, does not matter. She will always be the ultimate blonde. Her signature look – one that she always said she could do better and faster than any Hollywood hairstylist – was the “choucroute”, a half-up-half-down style. A loosened, bedroomy take on the English “beehive” or the French “chignon – it was sophisticated without being uptight, scene-stealing while apparently effortless.Bardot’s beauty is often described as feline. She was as much big cat as sex kitten, making leopard print one of her style signatures. There is a memorable scene in her 1971 film Boulevard du Rhum in which she wears a leopard print bikini with a matching loincloth. She loved leopard print while off duty, too, and the black-and-gold spots of the leopard car coats she wore around Paris in the 1960s were a perfect match for her golden hair and black eyeliner.Bardot’s best-known fashion legacy is the clavicle-exposing, wide-necked Bardot top. The style now has a sweetly nostalgic air, but was daring when she popularised it in the 50s. Bardot helped bring the sun-worshipping style of Saint-Tropez into the sartorial spotlight. At the Cannes film festival in 1953 she had yet to dye her hair blonde, but she was already in an off-the-shoulder top. That first Bardot top, in blood red, was so rakishly loose so that it appeared at risk of falling down entirely, styled simply with slender gold hoop earrings that almost grazed her naked shoulders.View image in fullscreenThe choucroute hairstyle favoured by Bardot became another of her style legacies.Photograph: AllstarShe helped to invent the bikini – or at least, to make it a phenomenon. In the 1940s, the fashion designer Louis Réard, among others, had noticed women on beaches in southern France knotting their blouses high to tan their stomachs. In 1946, he debuted a new invention – four triangles of fabric, connected by string – which he dubbed “the bikini”. It was Bardot, who wore one in her film Manina, the Girl in the Bikini in 1952, who made the new look an international sensation.View image in fullscreenBardot helped to popularise the bikini.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesBefore she became a model and later an actor, Bardot had trained as a ballerina, and ballet style remained an influence on her look. The posture ingrained in the ballet studio helped imbue her on-screen performances with the magnificence of a goddess. The wide headbands she adopted to pull back her hair when tired of peering beneath her thick fringe were a holdover from her ballet-school days.And Bardot brought into being that perennial staple of French-girl chic, the ballet flat. In the 1950s, she asked Repetto, the maker of ballet shoes for the finest Paris ballet companies, if they would make a version of the shoe with a toughened sole for streetwear. The Cendrillon version went on sale in 1956 and has remained a bestseller ever since.When Bardot walked away from cinema at just 39, she fixed herself in time. Her style legacy is a vision of femininity that felt instinctive, sensual and, above all, unapologetically free.Explore more on these topicsBrigitte BardotFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

When asked about the status of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station – occupied since the start of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion – Trump gave a confused answer and said Putin was no longer bombing it.The meeting took place just hours after Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russia’s president.“The two leaders want it to end,” Trump said, adding: “I think we can move pretty rapidly. Otherwise it’s going to go on for a very long time.” Trump praised Zelenskyy, saying: “This gentleman has worked very hard, and is very brave, and his people are very brave.”He added: “I do think we have the makings of a deal. We have two willing countries. We are in the final stages of talking.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump meets Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside other officials at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesSpeaking to reporters, the two leaders discussed the latest iteration of a20-point peace planand the unresolved question of the future of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Standing next to Trump, Zelenskyy said US and Ukrainian negotiators had made good progress in recent weeks with “90%” of the draft agreed.Writing on Truth Socialbefore the meeting, Trump described his one-hour-15-minute call with Putin as “good and very productive”. Asked if Putin was serious about peace, Trump replied: “I think he is.”There were no signs, however, that Russia was willing to drop any of its maximalist demands. According to Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov, Trump “listened carefully” on Sunday to Russia’s assessment of the conflict. Both sides agreed that a ceasefire proposed by Ukraine andEuropewould only prolong the fighting “and is fraught with renewed hostilities”, Ushakov said.Trump greeted Zelenskyy on the steps of his residence and offered him a businesslike handshake. There was no hug. US officials did not meet Zelenskyy when he arrived at Palm Beach international airport, in contrastto the red carpet reception given to Putin by an applauding Trumpat their summit in August in Alaska.One former Ukrainian diplomat, Maria Drutska, said Putinwas trying to “sabotage things”by ringing Trump before he saw Zelenskyy. During their previous meeting in October in the White House, Trump rowed back on the delivery of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine after a similar call to Moscow.Putin wants Ukraine to hand over territory in the north of Donetsk oblast that his forces have been unable to capture. Zelenskyy’s counter-proposal envisages a demilitarised zone, with both sides withdrawing from the line of contact. The plan could be put to a referendum, providing Moscow first agrees to a ceasefire lasting from 60 to 90 days.But fundamental problems remain, including the issue of security guarantees to prevent Russia from attacking again. Trump has made no military commitment to defend Ukraine. The original 28-point US plan was presented in November after talks with Russia andin effect demanded Ukraine’s capitulation.View image in fullscreenCanada’s prime minister, Mark Carney (left), met Zelenskyy on Saturday.Photograph: Riley Smith/APSpeaking alongside Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, on Saturday in the wake of another large-scale air attack on Kyiv by Russia, Zelenskyy described the onslaught as “Russia’s answer to our peace efforts”. The Ukrainian president said to Carney: “We need two things, pressure on Russia and sufficient strong support for Ukraine.”Ukraine’s capital was hit by more than 500 drones and ballistic missiles across Friday night and Saturday. The 12-hour attack killed four people and left half a million without power. Carney called the bombardment “barbaric”. A “willing Russia” was necessary to create conditions for a just and lasting peace, he said.Trump declined to condemn the latest strikes on Kyiv and did not acknowledge that Russia – unlike, in his view, Ukraine – had deliberately targeted civilians. “I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also. I don’t say that negatively. You probably have to,” he said, speaking outside his estate.0:29Russia strikes Kyiv before Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump – videoSunday’s Mar-a-Lago talks were a moment of high risk for Zelenskyy.In a recent interviewwith the Guardian, Ukraine’s leader said he “wasn’t afraid” of the mercurial US president because both of them had a democratic mandate.In February, Trump and the US vice-president,JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy in a bruising session at the White House. Subsequent meetings have gone better, including at the Vatican in April, and at the White House in October, when Zelenskyy was flanked by European leaders including Keir Starmer.Ukrainian officials have worked hard to repair relations with a Russia-leaning White House, while coordinating closely with European allies.Zelenskyy said he called Starmer on Sunday, informing him about the frontline situation and the consequences of Russian strikes. Trump said European leaders would join Sunday’s talks through a video conference link from Mar-a-Lago.The Ukrainian delegation included Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, the first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, and Ukraine’s new ambassador to Washington, Olha Stefanishyna. Witkoff and Kushner joined from the US side, as well as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, Susie Wiles, the president’s chief of staff, and Gen Dan Caine, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff.Zelenskyy described the meeting with Trump as a bilateral mostly focused on US-Ukraine issues. Key topics include security guarantees from the US and Europe, the military situation and the sequence for implementing agreements.mapSaving Kyiv’s heritage: a city rebuilding itself in the shadow of warRead moreOn Sunday, Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had seized five settlements in eastern and southern Ukraine, including Myrnohrad near the eastern city of Pokrovsk and Huliaipole in the Zaporizhzhia region. The announcement before the Florida talks appeared designed to send a message to Trump that Russia’s victory in Donbas is inevitable.Russian forces have been advancing but they have also suffered setbacks. In recent weeks Ukraine’s defence forces have clawed back control over much of the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, after its infiltration by small groups of Russian infantry. Ukraine dismissed Moscow’s latest claims and said its defences were holding.Its military said it hit the Syzran oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region in an overnight drone attack. The damage was still being assessed, it added. Three civilians were wounded after Russian drone and missile attacks in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s national police said.With Trump unwilling to pressure Russia, observers expect the nearly four-year-old full-scale war to continue. “The fundamental flaw in the current diplomatic push is the absence of the aggressor at the negotiating table,” Yuriy Boyechko, the founder of the charity Hope for Ukraine, said.He added: “Peace is not achieved by one side agreeing to terms with a third party; it requires the principal belligerent, Vladimir Putin, to commit to a ceasefire and withdrawal. As long as Russia is actively launching its heaviest attacks in months, it is signalling that it has no intention of honouring a deal it did not sign.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpEuropeVladimir PutinJD VanceJared KushnernewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday Ukraine’s leading private energy provider said it had restored power to nearly 750,000 households in Kyiv but that the situation remained “more difficult” on the left bank, where emergency outages were still in force.The intense overnight strikes lasted 10 hours and killed one person and wounded two dozen others, came asthe Ukrainian leader headed to Floridafor a the meeting with the US president, who has proposed a plan to end nearly four years of fighting that has killed tens of thousands.Zelenskyy stopped in Canada, where he met the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, who announced an additional $2.5bn (£1.85bn) of economic aid for Ukraine.Carney condemned the latest “barbaric” attack on Kyiv. He said: “We have the conditions, the possibility, for the just and lasting peace,” adding this requires a “willing Russia”.View image in fullscreenUkrainian firefighters work to extinguish a fire in Kyiv.Photograph: Ukrainian emergency service/AFP/Getty ImagesZelenskyy spoke by video call with European allies.Macron highlighted what he called the “contrast” between “the willingness of Ukraine to build a lasting peace and Russia’s determination to prolong the war that it started”, Elysee officials said.The EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa said the European Union’s support for Ukraine would not falter.“In 2026, the EU Commission will continue to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, sustain our support to Ukraine, and work intensely to accompany Ukraine on its path toward EU membership,” von der Leyen said on Saturday.Zelenskyy said he would hold talks with European leaders again after meeting Trump on Sunday.Zelenskyy said the overnight bombings showed international pressure on Russia was insufficient. “If Russia turns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burnt apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps,” he said. “The United States has this capability. Europe has this capability. Many of our partners have this capability. The key is to use it.”View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian firefighter extinguishes a fire in a residential building damaged by a Russian drone and missile attack in Kyiv.Photograph: Ukrainian emergency service/AFP/Getty ImagesRussia’s defence ministry said it had downed 111 Ukrainian drones, in what appeared to be a retaliatory attack.Russia claimed on Saturday to have captured two more towns in eastern Ukraine, Myrnograd and Guliaipole.Zelenskyy has said the meeting with Trump in Florida is “specifically intended to refine things as much as we possibly can”. Speaking on Friday, he added that a proposed 20-point peace plan was “90% ready”. “Our goal is to bring everything to 100%,” Zelenskyy said. “As of today, our teams – the Ukrainian and American negotiating teams – have made significant progress.”Ukraine war briefing: Kim Jong-un celebrates sharing ‘blood, life and death’ with RussiaRead moreZelenskyy has reportedly said he would need to seek the approval of the Ukrainian public if he failed to secure a “strong” position on territory.After the strikes on Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia’s “only response to peace efforts” was “brutal attacks using hundreds of drones and missiles against Kyiv and other cities and regions”. The minister said that a third of the capital was without heating. The temperature in Kyiv was about 0C (32F).The Russian strikes forced Polish fighter jets to scramble, and two airports in south-eastern Poland – Rzeszów and Lublin – were temporarily closed.The latest peace effortsfollow a burst of diplomatic activitylast weekend in Miami, where Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, separately met Russian and Ukrainian representatives.View image in fullscreenUkrainian rescuers look through rubble inside a damaged residential building in Kyiv.Photograph: Serhii Okunev/AFP/Getty ImagesThe plan is considered an updated version of an earlier 28-point document agreed several weeks ago between the US envoys and Russian officials, a proposal widely viewed as skewed towards the Kremlin’s demands.Ukraine has pushed for security guarantees modelled on Nato’s article 5 mutual defence pledge under any proposed peace deal with Russia, though it remains unclear whether Moscow would accept such terms.In aninterview with Politicoon Friday, Trump said he anticipated a “good” meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy’s plan. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told the news website. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, used a Russian television appearance on Friday to criticise Zelenskyy and European allies on their work on the peace plan. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said.He said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy’s input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord,” Ryabkov added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It has been a longstanding priority under successive governments to work for his release from detention, and to see him reunited with his family in the UK. The government condemns Mr el-Fattah’s historic[al] tweets and considers them to be abhorrent.”Both the Labour government and its Tory predecessors are expected to come under pressure to explain why they campaigned for the release of Abd el-Fattah, who has a British-born mother, when his posts were already in the public domain.The postscost him a nominationfor the European parliament’s Sakharov prize in 2014. The group backing him withdrew their nomination for the human rights award, saying they had discovered a tweet from 2012 in which he called for the murder of Israelis.In 2015, Abd el-Fattah claimed his comments had been taken out of context, and that while it had seemed “shocking”, it had been part of a “private conversation” that took place during an Israeli offensive in Gaza.The decision to grant citizenship would have been made by the Home Office, which at that point was led by Priti Patel, advised by the Foreign Office, where Liz Truss was foreign secretary and James Cleverly was the minister for the region.Successive Tory prime ministers have also called for Abd el-Fattah, to be released and reunited with his family, including Rishi Sunak whosaid it was “a priority”for his government in November 2022.When Labour came to power, Starmer continued lobbying the Egyptian president over Abd el-Fattah, ongoing imprisonment,making three calls to his Egyptian counterpart, while the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also personally urged the Egyptians to end the detention.The campaign for the release of one of Egypt’s most prominent political prisonersbecame a cause célèbrein the UK, where his mother, Laila Soueif, almost died whileon hunger strikeover his detention.Abd el-Fattah, finallyarrived in Londonon Friday after Egypt lifted a travel ban it had imposed on him despitereleasing him from jailin September. In 2021, he had been sentenced to five years in prison on charges of “spreading false news” after sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country.After the social media posts emerged, Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, called for Abd el-Fattah, to be stripped of his dual citizenship and deported, adding he should “be made to live in Egypt or frankly anywhere else in the world”.Writing to the prime minister about his words welcoming the activist’s return to the UK, Jenrick said: “Given Mr Abd el-Fattah’s record of extremist statements about violence, Jews and the police, it was a serious error of judgment. Nobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily, nor for peaceful dissent. But neither should the prime minister place the authority of his office behind someone whose own words cross into the language of racism and bloodshed.”Nigel Farage waded into the row, posting on X on Sunday that he had reported Abd el-Fattah to counter-terrorism police over his remarks.“Whilst Robert Jenrick is right to criticise Starmer … we must not forget that it was the Tory government who started this … Labour are only doing the same as the Tories, just worse,” the Reform UK leader said.Several Tory politicians who lobbied for Abd el-Fattah’s release from prison have said they now regret their participation in the campaign. The former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith, who was among those who had pushed for Abd el-Fattah’s return, urged the police to investigate his comments.“I do … regret signing the letter calling for the release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, given his views, that have since come to light, are utterly abhorrent. Had I known of these, I would not have signed the letter. I urge the police to investigate the nature of these extremist comments,” Duncan Smith posted on X.The Tory MP Alicia Kearns, a former chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said: “I trusted the process to give Alaa citizenship, and then supported the campaign for his release. I feel deeply let down, and frankly betrayed, having lent my support to his cause, which I now regret.“It is wholly improper for British citizens to be detained without due process by foreign states; however Alaa must unequivocally apologise and make clear he now wholly rejects the hatred and antisemitism he expressed, which is so wholly incompatible with British values.”The democracy activist was a leading voice in Egypt’s 2011 Arab spring uprising and went on hunger strikes behind bars. His imprisonment was labelled a breach of international law by UN investigators. He was eventually released after being pardoned by the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had raised concerns with the UK government over Abd el-Fattah’s remarks and that there was an “urgent need” to find out whether he still held the views expressed online.The board said: “The social media history that has emerged from Alaa Abd el-Fattah is of profound concern. His previous extremist and violent rhetoric aimed at ‘Zionists’ and white people in general is threatening to British Jews and the wider public.“The cross-party campaign for such a person, and the warm welcome issued by the government, demonstrate a broken system with an astonishing lack of due diligence by the authorities.”Tom Rutland, Labour MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, posted: “It is unclear to me why it has been a priority for successive governments to bring this guy over here. What kind of vetting is routinely done in these cases? His tweets are impressive in how they manage to be vile in such a variety of ways.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsAntisemitismEgyptActivismLabourConservativesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Snowfall totals were expected to exceed a foot across parts of the upper Great Lakes, with up to 2ft (60cm) possible along the south shore of Lake Superior.Southern California cleans up after the wettest recent Christmas seasonRead moreIn the south, meteorologists warned of severe thunderstorms expected to signal the arrival of a sharp cold front – sometimes referred to as a “Blue Norther” – bringing a sudden plunge in temperatures and strong north winds that will end days of record warmth around the region.The snowy holiday season in the upper midwest and north-east comes as springlike warmth continues in much of the nation’s midsection and south, where record high temperatures had Santa sweating in recent days.The high temperature in Atlanta is forecast to be around 72F (22C) on Sunday, continuing a warming trend after climbing to 78F (about 26C) to shatter the city’s record high temperature for Christmas Eve, the NWS said. Numerous other record high temperatures were seen across the south and midwest on the days after Christmas.But that record heat is quickly coming to an end, forecasters say.A cold front is expected to bring rain to much of the south late Sunday night into Monday, bringing much colder weather by Tuesday. The abrupt change will drop the low temperature in Atlanta to 25F (-3.9C) by early Tuesday morning. The colder temperatures in the south are expected to continue through New Year’s Day.In Dallas, Sunday temperatures in the lower 80s (upper 20s C) could drop down to the mid 40s (single digits Celsius). In Little Rock, high temperatures of around 70F (21C) on Sunday could drop down to highs in the mid-30s Monday.“We’re definitely going back towards a more winter pattern,” Oravec said.Over the next 48 hours, the cyclone is expected to produce heavy snow and blizzard conditions in the midwest and Great Lakes, freezing rain in New England, thunderstorms across the eastern US and south, and widespread strong winds.The storm is expected to intensify as it moves east, drawing energy from a sharp clash between frigid air plunging south from Canada and unusually warm air that has lingered across the southern US, according to the NWS.It follows thousands of flight delays and cancellations across the north-east and Great Lakes regions earlier this weekend due to snow, as thousands took to the roads and airports during the busy travel period between Christmas and New Year’s.On the other side of the country, California was experiencing a fairly dry weekend after powerful stormsbattered the statewith heavy rains, flash flooding and mudslides. At least four people were killed, including a man who was found dead Friday in a partially submerged car near Lancaster, the Los Angeles county sheriff’s department reported.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherSnownewsShareReuse this content"

Some of those involved in the alleged scheme are being “referred to immigrations officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible”.Patel’s comments comes after federal prosecutors estimate as much as $9bn has been stolen across schemes linked to thestate’s Somalia population, a figure nearly equivalent to Somalia’s entire GDP.Revealed: FBI opened domestic terrorism investigations into anti-ICE activity across USRead moreThe FBI director also said he was aware of recent social media reports in Minnesota, which appears to refer to anonline reportby independent journalist Nick Shirley about a daycare center in Minneapolis that received $4m despite reportedly having no enrolled kids. The 42-minute video has been viewed 84m times since it was posted on 26 December.Patel said the FBI had surged personnel and resources into the state before the video and attendant conversation escalated online.TheTrump administrationhas portrayed Minnesota’s Somali immigrant community as a locus of widespread fraud, much of it allegedly perpetrated during the Covid pandemic.Last month, Donald Trumpended legal protectionsfor Somalis in Minnesota and accused the state of being “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” under its Democratic governor,Tim Walz.Somali Americans, Trumphas said, “come from hell”, “contribute nothing” and should “go back to where they came from”. He has also described Minnesota’s Democratic representativeIlhan Omaras “garbage” and said “her friends are garbage.”Omarhas calledTrump’s “obsession” with her and Somali Americans “creepy and unhealthy.”“We are not, and I am not, someone to be intimidated,” Omar said earlier this month, “and we are not gonna be scapegoated.”Omar has accused agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of pulling her constituents off the streets, including questioning her son. She has said she is being forced to address questions about her own immigration status.In aninterviewwith the Minnesota Star Tribune published on Friday, Omar called Trump’s immigration policy “cruel” during his first administration, “and now it’s just outright dangerous and severely inhumane” and “geared towards this sort of white supremacist view of what America should be”.And she worries that “we’re not even at the worst yet, that there is probably more to come.”‘Somalis are the scapegoat’: fear rises as Trump targets Minneapolis communityRead moreOmar has come under further pressure from the administration after it was revealed that her husband and former political consultant, Tim Mynett’s, $25m venture capital firm,Rose Lake Capital, recently purged key officer details from its website after questions were raised about the couple’s wealth.The couple’s net worth surged3,500%in just one year,according to reports, and their net worth is now anywhere between $6m and $30m. The venture capital firm alone, per the filing, is worth between $5m and $25m.The firm’s officials and advisors that have been removed from Rose Lake Capital’s website include Adam Ereli, Barack Obama’s former ambassador to Bahrain; Max Baucus, Obama’s ambassador to China; Alex Hoffman, the former finance chair of the Democratic National Committee; and former DNC treasurer William Derrough.Omar has not been accused of wrongdoing, but reports say that three people accused of defrauding the state have alleged ties to the congresswoman.Asked about her support of theMeals Act,a bill that changed school meal reimbursement rules during the pandemic and has been connected to systems of fraud, Omar toldFox News Digital, it has not contributed to the fraud and “it did help feed kids”.Explore more on these topicsFBIMinnesotaUS immigrationTrump administrationSomaliaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Video from the scene shows a helicopter spinning rapidly to the ground. Police and fire crews subsequently extinguished flames that engulfed one of the helicopters.The Federal Aviation Administration described the crash as a midair collision between an Enstrom F-28A helicopter and Enstrom 280C helicopter over Hammonton municipal airport. Only the pilots were on board each aircraft.One person was killed and another was transported to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries. Video from the scene showed a helicopter spinning rapidly to the ground.Sal Silipino, the owner of a cafe near the crash site, said the pilots were regulars at the restaurant and would often have breakfast together. He said he and other customers watched the helicopters take off before one began spiraling downward, followed by the other.“It was shocking,” he said. “I’m still shaking after that happened.”View image in fullscreenAuthorities and investigators work the scene where police are securing wreckage following an inflight collision in Hammonton, New Jersey, on Sunday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating.Hammonton is a town of about 15,000 people located in Atlantic county in the southern part ofNew Jersey, about 35 miles (56km) south-east of Philadelphia. The town has a history of agriculture and is located near the Pine Barrens, a forested wilderness area that covers more than 1m acres (405,000 hectares).Dan Dameshek, a Hammonton resident, told NBC10 that he was leaving a gym when he heard a loud snap and saw two helicopters spinning out of control.“Immediately, the first helicopter went from right side up to upside down and started rapidly spinning, falling out of the air,” Dameshek told the station. “And then it looked like the second helicopter was OK for a second, and then it sounded like another snap or something ... and then that helicopter started rapidly spinning out of the air.”Investigators will likely first look to review any communications between the two pilots and whether they were able to see each other, said Alan Diehl, a former crash investigator for the FAA and NTSB.“Virtually all midair collisions are a failure to what they call ‘see and avoid’,” Diehl said. “Clearly they’ll be looking at the out-of-cockpit views of the two aircraft and seeing if one pilot was approaching from the blind side.”Although it was mostly cloudy at the time of the crash, winds were light and visibility was good, according to the weather forecasting company AccuWeather.Explore more on these topicsNew JerseyHelicopter crashesAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”From shrimp Jesus to erotic tractors: how viral AI slop took over the internetRead moreDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialistZohran Mamdaniinto office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech mogulsElon Musk,Mark Zuckerberg,Jeff Bezosand Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”Sanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”That theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor oflegislationto protect minors from chatbots.The proposedmeasure– the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.Britt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to themaboutsuicide”.She said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”Britt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types ofsensual and sexual relationshipswith young people or encouraging suicide”.From that bird guy to ‘bus aunty’: the real social media personalities rising above AI slopRead moreThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”Explore more on these topicsBernie SandersArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicsUS SenateUS CongressRepublicansComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

You’re seeing it now inNigeria,” Turner said.Turner denied that the strikes represent a different second-term approach to military force. With respect to theIslamic State(IS), he told ABC’s This Week, US policy is “very consistent” in defeating it whether in Iraq, Syria or “here in Nigeria”.Turner said the US is “seeing that [IS] around the world has not been defeated but will continue to be a target and something that, with our allies, we’re going to have to continue to respond to or they’re going to continue to be a threat”.View image in fullscreenMike Turner speaks after a briefing at the US Capitol on 15 February 2024 in Washington DC.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesHis comments came three days after the Pentagonlauncheda cruise missile strike on terrorist camps in north-western Nigeria during what Trump latercalleda “Christmas present” for IS militants in Nigeria.The president later amplified his comments onWABCradio in New York, calling IS “butchers” who “got a very bad Christmas present”. Trump, referring to the persecution of Christians in the region, said he “told Nigeria, and I told the people around Nigeria, that if you do it, you’re going to get hit.”US defense secretaryPete Hegsethsaid on X that Trump had made it clear that “the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end”. He added that the defense department, which the Trump administration hasrebrandedthe war department, “is always ready, so [IS] found out tonight – on Christmas. More to come.”The consistency of the US approach, Turner said, applied to the its position on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Turner said the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s Christmas Day strikes in Ukraine andovernight on Saturdaywere a reminder “that we can’t be for this”.“When we address the issue of whose side we’re on, you can’t be America first and be pro-Russia,” Turner remarked. “Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States. They are mercilessly killing Ukrainians and trying to take Ukrainian land. So, the president has rightly said we need to end this war.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryTrump administrationIslamic StateNigeriaSyriaUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The government’s own official statistics paint amore complicated pictureof 2025.“The Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead,” the president claimed on social media, aftergrowth datafor the third quarter of the year – covering July, August and September – was unexpectedly strong.But other key indicators have been far less robust in 2025. If Trump is right, and an unprecedented economic boom is about to take hold, the foundations appear fragile.InflationThe cost of living – and its sharp rise, for many Americans, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic – was central to Trump’s fight for re-election in 2024. While inflation peaked at its highest level in a generation in 2022,prices remained high.On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to tackle this problem and bring down not only inflation – the rate at which prices rise – but prices themselves.A line chart showing the latest inflation figures in the USBut inflation held firm in 2025, as the White House pressed ahead with Trump’s flagship economic policy. Despite his rhetoric on reducing prices, many economists feared the president’s sweeping tariffs on imports from overseas risked driving them higher.Interest ratesPrice growth fell sharply after policymakers at the US Federal Reserve launched an aggressive campaign to cool theUS economy, rapidly increasing interest rates in an attempt to reduce inflation.A chart showing the federal interest rate in the USBy the turn of the year, the Fed had already started tobring rates downfrom their two-decade high. But policymakers, led by the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell, wanted to tread carefully – and were anxious that cutting rates too aggressively would imperil the progress they had made on inflation.Trump, no careful treader, returned to office demanding a rapid return to low rates to spur economic growth and berating“numbskull”Powell (whom he appointed). His public demands and attacks were coollybrushed offby Powell. But by the end of the year, Trump had tried to bolster the Fed’s rate-setting board with officials who were more in line with his thinking,dividing opinionon the Fed. Next year, he gets to replace Powell.EmploymentA post-pandemic surge in jobs growth was already losing steam by last year. Trump tapped into Americans’ frustrations with the economy, promising a “manufacturing renaissance” that would set the stage for another jobs surge.A chart showing the latest US employment figuresThe renaissance has yet to arrive, however, and over the summer, growth in the labor force appeared to stall altogether. Rather than add jobs, the US economy actually shed them in June and August. And in October, amid thelongest government shutdown in history, it lost an estimated 105,000.US lost 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 in November, according to delayed dataRead moreThe unemployment rate – the percentage of the US labor force that is out of work – has meanwhile been rising throughout the year, and in November scaled its highest level since September 2021.The president tried to push back, claiming “the only reason” unemployment had climbed was because the federal workforce had declined – although the federal workforce has fallen 271,000 since January, while the number of unemployed Americans has risen by about a million.A line chart showing that the unemployment rate in the US has continued to rise“I wish the Fake News would report the 4.5% correctly,” he added on social media earlier this month, after the Bureau of Labor Statistics put November’s unemployment rate at 4.6%.GrowthBy the main measure of economic growth – gross domestic product, or GDP – the US economy has endured a rollercoaster year. Itshrank in the first quarter, amid an influx of imports ahead of Trump’s expected tariff onslaught, before bouncing back in the second and gathering steam in the third.A chart showing GDPAfter growth of 2.8% in 2024, the US economy isexpectedto expand by 2% this year, and 2.1% next year. But many economists did not anticipate such a robust GDP reading for the third quarter, which came ahead of the federal shutdown.The last time growth was this strong, during Joe Biden’s presidency, rising prices and patchy labor growth left many struggling to reconcile the headline figures with the day-to-day reality of their lives.Trump is promising a historic economic boom. Like Biden, he may well find the real task is not just to deliver it – but to ensure Americans feel it, too.Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpInflationEconomicsUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Silver is needed in many industrial processes,” Musk posted on X.Uses for the metal include in electrification, solar power panels, electric vehicles and data centres, all areas in which demand has been rising, eating into silver inventories.But as well as industrial applications, silver has a role as a monetary metal – a store of value.Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, said a “generational bubble” was playing out in silver, as more capital was drawn into the precious metals market.“The rally in precious metals has been supported by expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026, alongside robust central bank and private investor buying. However, the dominant driver of late has been a severe structural supply-demand imbalance in silver, sparking a scramble for physical metal,” Sycamore said.According to Bloomberg, much of the world’s readily available silver is sitting in New York awaiting the outcome of a US commerce department investigation into whether imports of critical minerals pose a national security risk. The review could pave the way for tariffs or other trade curbs on the metal, Bloomberg said.Gold and silver are on track for their best years since 1979. Gold has risen by more than 70% this year to more than $4,500 an ounce, up from $2,623 at the start of 2025.Spot platinum rose 5.3% on Friday to $2,338.20 an ounce, in its strongest weekly rise on record.Both platinum and palladium, which are key components in automotive catalytic converters, have surged on tight supply, tariff uncertainty, and rotation from gold investment demand, with platinum up roughly 170% this year.Explore more on these topicsSilverElon MuskCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s good news for the construction industryGene MarksMore young people are following the money and going into trades like construction where AI can’t easily replace themSun 28 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 17.32 ESTShareWhile standing on the sideline watching a high school soccer game, my friend, who owned a small and successful construction company, complained that his son – a senior – was starting at a respected local university that fall, which would cost roughly $200,000 over the next four years.“I could take the same money and set him up in a contracting business,” he said. “It would be a much better investment.”That was in 2010. The kid did go to that college and graduated four years later with a degree in history. Where do you think he is now? Working in the construction business.Ask anyone in the construction business and they’ll complain about the lack of skilled workers in their trade. The numbers support these concerns. The Associated General Contractors of Americareportedthis past year that 92% of firms have had a hard time filling positions and 45% delayed at least one project due to labor shortages. A worker shortage model from the Associated Builders and Contractorsestimatesthat the industry must attract 499,000 workers in 2026 to meet demand. The National Association of Homebuildersestimatesthe number to be as high as 723,000 annually.Why the shortage? Among the reasons is that younger workers have gravitated away from working with their hands over the past few decades in lieu of office jobs. Older workers are getting older – the National Center for Construction Education and Researchestimatesthat about 41% of the current construction workforce will retire by 2031. And the current administration’simmigration policyhas not only dried up the flow of potential overseas workers but have driven many construction workers – even those with proper documentation – underground.The building of datacentershas surgedover the past few years and construction workers on those projects are in such high in demand they’re seeing pay jumps of 25% to 30% compared to their previous jobs – and in some cases, much more. Good for them, butthat’s not going to lastforever.What will happen very soon is – as interest rates continue to fall and new tax incentives begin to take hold – a new demand from both homebuyers and businesses looking to build and buy properties will – after more than five years – return and return strong. This is a cyclical industry. Things have been in the trough. But when the recovery happens, the peak will be high. Which means there will be an enormous need for new constructions workers.For many in the industry facing such labor shortages, that scenario is daunting. I think the opposite.Thanks to AI, there will be an obliteration of entry-level jobs and the meaningless white-collar work. Where will they go? There will be other opportunities – startups and new jobs we’ve never heard of (20% of today’s jobsdidn’t even existin 2000). But many will gravitate towards the trades – a place where AI can’t replace them.We’re already seeing this trend develop. Trade school enrollment is up significantly since the pandemic and isexpected to increaseas much as 7% annually through 2030, a rate significantly higher than other forms of higher education. The ranks of students studying construction trades alonerose23% over the past year, according to another report. Young people are not stupid. They’re following the money.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessArtificial intelligence (AI)US work & careersConstruction industryYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Chase Brown ran for 101 yards and two touchdowns as the Bengals (6-10) improved to 3-2 since Burrow returned from left toe surgery.Arizona’s Trey McBride had 10 catches, giving him 119 this season to break the NFL single-season record for a tight end, topping Zach Ertz’s 116 in 2018. He also broke DeAndre Hopkins’ Cardinals record of 115 catches, set in 2020.The Cardinals (3-13) had the seventh-ranked pass offense the league, but the improved Bengals defense held them to 233 total yards. Jacoby Brissett threw for 212 yards and two TDs.New England Patriots 42-10 New York JetsDrake Maye threw a career-high five touchdown passes before getting the rest of the game off in the third quarter, New England scored a TD on its first six drives and the Patriots finished the regular season undefeated on the road by dominating the New York Jets 42-10 on Sunday.Rhamondre Stevenson had a TD run and catch for the Patriots (13-3), who moved closer to winning the AFC East title for the first time since 2019. They’ll do so if Buffalo loses or ties against Philadelphia later in the day.Maye was 19 of 21 for 256 yards and a 157.0 quarterback rating with TD tosses to Stevenson, Stefon Diggs, Austin Hooper, Hunter Henry and Efton Chism III before being lifted by coach Mike Vrabel for Joshua Dobbs with 5:31 left in the third quarter. Maye joined Tom Brady (11 times) and Drew Bledsoe (twice) as the only New England quarterbacks to reach 4,000 yards passing in a season.Dobbs’ first drive ended the Patriots’ touchdown run, with New England settling for a field goal on its seventh possession – but Andy Borregales clanked the 41-yard attempt off the right upright.It didn’t matter much by then, though, as the Patriots cruised to their eighth 13-win season in team history. Only San Francisco has more with 11.View image in fullscreenNew England’s Drake Maye threw a career-high five touchdown passes in Sunday’s win at New York.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APPittsburgh Steelers 6-13 Cleveland BrownsShedeur Sanders threw for 186 yards and a touchdown, Cleveland’s defense kept Pittsburgh out of the end zone and the Browns held on for a 13-6 victory on Sunday, preventing the Steelers from clinching the AFC North.Pittsburgh (9-7) came into the weekend needing either a win or loss by Baltimore for their first division title since 2020.Instead, the Steelers will host the Ravens to close the regular season the winner getting the division and the AFC’s fourth seed in the playoffs.The Browns (4-12) snapped a four-game losing streak, along with a seven-game skid in division games. It is the first time since 10 December 2009 that the Browns defeated the Steelers and held them without a touchdown.Cleveland scored on their first two possessions and jumped out to a 10-0 lead.Jacksonville Jaguars 23-17 Indianapolis ColtsTrevor Lawrence ran for two scores, Cam Little kicked a tiebreaking 42-yard field goal with 6:58 left, and the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Indianapolis Colts 23-17 on Sunday, moving within one victory of their first AFC South title since 2022.The Jags (12-4) won their seventh straight game one day after two-time defending division champ Houston beat the Los Angeles Chargers to remain in contention for the title. The Texans’ victory also eliminated the Colts from playoff contention.Jacksonville’s Liam Coen became the first coach in NFL history to take over a four-win team and win 12 games the next season.Lawrence went 23 of 37 for 263 yards, though his streak of consecutive games with at least 225 yards passing, two TDs and a passer rating over 100 ended at four. He did not have a touchdown pass and he threw his first interception in five weeks.The Jags kept 44-year-old Colts quarterback Philip Rivers winless in three games since he returned to the league following a five-year retirement.New Orleans Saints 34-26 Tennessee TitansTyler Shough threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Austin Jr with 6:22 left to put New Orleans Saints ahead to stay as they rallied from a 13-point deficit to beat the Tennessee Titans 34-26 Sunday.Shough improved to 5-3 as a starter, helping the Saints (6-10) win their fourth straight. He outplayed Cam Ward, the No 1 overall pick in the draft, in this NFL’s third game between starting rookie quarterbacks this season. Shough was 22 of 27 for a career-best 333 yards and two touchdowns with a 142.7 passer rating.Audric Estime added a 32-yard TD run with 3:44 left as New Orleans dominated the second half. The Saints both outscored the Titans 24-6 and outgained them 331-152 after halftime.Chase Young had one and a half of the Saints’ four sacks and also stripped Ward and returned the fumble 33 yards for a touchdown. Charlie Smyth kicked a pair of field goals. Young got a half-sack with 5:16 left to force the Titans in a three-and-out.The Titans (3-13) now go into the 2026 season trying to string together consecutive wins. That’s something this franchise hasn’t done since 13 November and 17 November of the 2022 season. They are 1-8 at home this season.Philadelphia Eagles 13-12 Buffalo BillsJosh Allen sailed a two-point conversion attempt wide of open receiver Khalil Shakir in the back of the end zone with 5 seconds remaining, and the Philadelphia Eagles hung on for a 13-12 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.Dallas Goedert caught a 1-yard touchdown pass, Jake Elliott hit field goals of 28 and 47 yards, and the Super Bowl champion Eagles barely avoided squandering a 13-0 fourth-quarter lead. Linebacker Jalyx Hunt had two of Philadelphia’s four sacks and a team-leading three quarterback hits.Defensive tackle Jalen Carter made a major contribution in his return after missing three games with a injuries to both shoulders. Carter got his hand up to block Michael Badgley’s extra-point attempt after Allen’s two-yard touchdown run with 5:11 left.Allen scored on a tush push on fourth-and-goal to pull the Bills within one point with 5 seconds remaining. The Bills thought they had a touchdown one play earlier, but Dawson Knox was ruled short of the goal line after a replay review.Rather than playing for overtime, coach Sean McDermott opted to go for two. Allen dropped back in the pocket and had a defender in his face when he let loose a pass that was about a foot wide of Shakir. The Bills then tried an onside kick that Goedert recovered.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsSeattle SeahawksCarolina PanthersShareReuse this content"

Albania’s Italian-born prodigy Lara Colturi, 19, was 0.57 seconds back in third.Lindsey Vonn, 41, adds yet another podium to blistering comeback startRead moreShiffrin, who started fourth on the first run, was more than half a second off the pace on a rapidly deteriorating Panorama course, where mild weather forced organizers to inject water and salt into the snow. Despite those measures, the surface broke apart in multiple sections during the afternoon session, which began at 2.15pm local time.“I have to say this: It was not safe to ski for the girls,” Shiffrin told Austrian television. “For me, bib four on the first run, it’s not a problem. But for these women starting bib 13, 15, 18, in the 60s, this is not OK.”Only 40 of the 77 starters completed the opening run, and a deficit of nearly six seconds was still enough to qualify for the final. Conditions improved slightly for the night session, held three and a half hours later as temperatures dropped.“It was a very challenging and distracting day,” Shiffrin said. “My understanding is there were no big injuries, but the way the surface was breaking … the second run was a bit better, for sure, but I am frustrated with how that went for these women.”View image in fullscreenMikaela Shiffrin was fastest in the second run to edge Swiss skier Camille Rast by 0.09sec.Photograph: Millo Moravski/Agence Zoom/Getty ImagesShiffrin was narrowly ahead of Rast halfway through the first run but lost significant time in the lower section, later admitting she had overskied the course. “It’s a pretty tough one,” she said. “Probably a little bit like overskiing – too round compared to what’s possible.”She corrected those mistakes under pressure in the second run, securing her 106th career World Cup victory and extending her dominance in slalom. “It was a really hard day, tough conditions, a really big fight,” Shiffrin said. “It didn’t feel good. I didn’t expect to come down with the green light.”The win marked Shiffrin’s fifth straight victory to begin the season, matching her best-ever start from 2018–19. She closed last season with a win and then dominated the first four slaloms of the current Olympic campaign by an average margin of 1.5 seconds before Sunday’s narrow success.Shiffrin extended her lead in the slalom standings to 220 points over Colturi, with three more races scheduled in January and two in March ahead of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. A race win is worth 100 points.Croatia’s Zrinka Ljutic, last season’s winner at Semmering and the reigning slalom globe holder, finished eighth, 3.75 seconds behind. Shiffrin’s teammate Paula Moltzan, seventh after the first run, straddled a gate in the second a day after crashing heavily in the giant slalom on the same hill.The women’s World Cup now moves to Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, for a giant slalom and slalom next weekend.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Yet to no one’s great surprise, the extreme power of his serve, combined with the spin and velocity of his groundstrokes, proved too much for the women’s No 1 player.New Battle of the Sexes is cynical bid for attention and own goal for SabalenkaRead more“It was a really tough match,” the 30-year-old Kyrgios insisted after his 6-3, 6-3 victory. “ I didn’t know what to expect. She broke my serve numerous times and honestly she was hitting some amazing shots. She is a hell of a competitor. It could have gone either way.”Not many saw it that way. For while the modified rules of this contest meant that Sabalenka’s side of the court was 9% smaller, that advantage was nullified by both players also being limited to one serve, a change that significantly favoured Kyrgios. Almost every time the Australian fizzed down one of his howitzers, Sabalenka was left scrambling on the baseline. And while she hit plenty of winners, and often moved better than her opponent, there was always a sense that Kyrgios could step up whenever he wanted.View image in fullscreenNick Kyrgios serves to Aryna Sabalenka on the unusually sized court.Photograph: Getty ImagesIn the first set, the crucial moment came with the Belarusian serving at 40-15 up with the score level at 3-3. From looking in control, she served two faults in a row. Kyrgios sensed blood. Soon he had broken, held serve, and seen out the set.Kyrgios then appeared distracted as he went 3-1 down in the second set. But despite not moving well, he was able to gain control with a mix of power and junk tennis – especially through his sliced forehands that often had the 27-year-old rushing uncomfortably to the net. And in no time at all, he was able to win five games in a row to wrap things up.But mostly this was a tennis match for those who have only a passing interest in tennis. During one timeout in the second set, Sabalenka did the Macarena. On another occasion, the public announcer threw tennis balls from a Ralph Lauren bag. Meanwhile on match point, Kyrgios used his 60-second timeout just to get his breath back.Earlier there was also a delay while the stadium PA announced that the former Brazil footballers Kaká and Ronaldo were making their entrance. For a contest that was expressly designed to appeal to the TikTok crowd it seemed a curious choice.It was all a far cry from the famous Battle of the Sexes match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs in 1973. True, Riggs was 55 and a long way past his prime. But the stakes couldn’t have been much higher.King feared that if she lost it would push women’s tennis back 50 years. Yet with every swish of her Wilson Autograph racket, King struck a mighty blow for fairness, equality and social justice.The Guardian called it “the kind of crushing, tactical, technical and psychological victory that ought to keep the male chauvinists quiet for a long time”. It also popularised tennis in a way that no ordinary match could.The reaction on social media after Kyrgios’s victory suggested that this latest match had done quite the opposite. The misogynists and incels were delighted.Tennispurists appalled.However Kyrgios, whose fitness looked short of what will be required to play five-setters in the Australian Open, insisted that it would help grow the game.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka makes her way to the court.Photograph: Amr Alfiky/AP“This is a great stepping stone for the sport of tennis,” he said, before floating the idea of a rematch. “This was all the world was talking about for six months.”Sabalenka also indicated she would like to do it again. “I feel I put on a great fight,” she said. “He was struggling, he was getting really tired. I feel like next time I play him, I know the tactics, and his strengths and weaknesses.”But ultimately the match told us what we know already. Men have enormous advantages due to puberty, and are faster, stronger and more powerful as a result.Curiously, it was shown live on the BBC, which apologised three times for loss of pictures in the second set. Beforehand, its analysts, ­Russell Fuller and Annabel Croft, also sounded defensive when ­talking about the exhibition nature of the match, Kyrgios’s past – including an assault on a previous girlfriend – and the fact it was promoted by the Evolve player agency, which represents Kyrgios and Sabalenka.This match, they suggested, was more about fun and entertainment than “going toe-to-toe as if it was a grand slam”. Those words were to prove prophetic. Although it did also make you wonder why the BBC had acquired the rights in the first place.Explore more on these topicsTennisAryna SabalenkaNick KyrgiosAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With Thomas Frank already showing signs of not being the first Spurs ­manager to have been overwhelmed by ­expectations, after a run of just one win in their previous eight ­Premier League matches, Gray’s scrappy header in the first half ensured a topsy-turvy year ended with a ­victory that lifts his side to within one point of Crystal Palace in the table.Crystal Palace v Tottenham: Premier League – liveRead moreThe 19-year-old midfielder left the pitch to a standing ovation and a big hug from Frank after becoming the youngest Englishman to score for Tottenham in the Premier League since Dele Alliat the same ground in January 2016.“I think Archie is growing,” said his delighted manager after also praising his side’s resilience. “Talking about resilience he made the mistake in the ­Nottingham [Forest] game and played another good game against Liverpool. He is growing as a young man. And I loved that goal, because he was alert.”The victory could have been more comprehensive if two Richarlison strikes had not been disallowed for offside but Palace could not stop Spurs from recording their first away winsince they beat Leedsat the start of November.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s Justin Devenny battles for possession with Tottenham’s Micky van de Ven (right).Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesWith the Spurs chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, watching on from the stands, Frank came into this match ­having presided over Tottenham’s worst start to a league campaign since 2008-09 but, as well as Gray, there were plenty of positives in this battling display. A defence that was well marshalled by Micky van den Ven kept Palace at arm’s length, although Jean-Phillippe Mateta, ­Justin Devenny and Maxence Lacroix all passed up good chances to equalise. Of the 20 goals that Oliver Glasner’s side have conceded this season in the league, 12 have come from set pieces and Palace have now failed to win any of their last five matches as a packed schedule has finally caught up with them in their 30th fixture of the campaign.Tottenham’s chances of picking up a morale-boosting victory looked to have been seriously hampered by the absence of their captain, ­Cristian Romero, and playmaker Xavi Simons after theirred cards against Liverpoollast week, not to mention a long injury list.But at least they escaped another early dismissal here when Romero’s replacement, Kevin Danso, tripped Devenny just outside the penalty area after four minutes when the Northern Irishman was through on goal. The referee, Jarred Gillett, immediately showed him a yellow card because Pedro Porro was deemed to be covering back.There was another big decision to be made by the officials when ­Richarlison touched in Porro’s cross at the far post in the 16th minute. Yet despite the confidence of the snazzy green and black boot-wearing assistant referee Scott Ledger, who wagged his finger to suggest Lucas Bergvall had not been offside in the move that led to the goal, replays showed he was beyond the last man.Even with the sublime Adam Wharton pulling the strings in midfield, Palace had to wait until midway through the first 45 minutes to register their first real chance when Mateta’s driven effort midway whistled past the post. A delightful cross from Wharton then picked out Lacroix at the far post and Mateta was inches away from ­converting when the defender headed back across goal.View image in fullscreenTottenham manager Thomas Frank gestures on the touchline during his side’s 1-0 win.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersInstead it was Palace’s shortcomings from set pieces that were exposed when Tottenham took the lead just before half-time. Six of the nine Premier League goalsCrystal Palacehave conceded in December have been from set pieces. With the dependable Chris Richards missing after requiring stitches in a foot injury, somehow Randal Kolo Muani, Richarlison and finally Gray were all allowed to win headers inside the six-yard box after a corner was whipped to the back post. Cue massive celebrations from Frank on the Spurs bench and in the away section.Palace should have equalised 10 minutes into the second half when Yéremy Pino’s cross was headed straight into Devenny’s path. But a moment’s hesitation meant he had to improvise and could only lift his shot over the crossbar from close range. Lacroix then rose to meet Jefferson Lerma’s header from another excellent Wharton cross and could only direct his effort wide of the target.Spurs thought they had sealed the win when Richarlison tapped in a Mohammed Kudus cross but once again the video assistant referee came to Palace’s rescue. Substitute Wilson Odobert struck the post after a quick break downfield involving Brennan Johnson, who is a target for Palace in January. The closest they came to rescuing a point came when Marc Guéhi headed over in the dying moments but this is a team in serious need of reinforcements.“If you watched our game today then it’s pretty clear what we need,” said the Palace manager. “Then it’s a decision of Crystal Palace, and if you’re constantly underperforming in scoring goals, again, what I can do, what we can do is encourage the players, support them and be positive.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

On this exhilarating evidence this pair are not only more than good enough to stay up but thePremier Leaguewould be a poorer place without them.“We showed great mentality to come back from a losing position,” said Farke, who saw Leeds fall behind to Simon Adingra’s 28th-minute opener before recovering to extend their undefeated league run to five games. “Sunderland are difficult to open up so it’s a good point on the road but I had a gut feeling we could win and, if we’d been a bit more clinical, we would have done.“It’s another step forward but we could have made it a huge step forward. That’s why I’m not dancing on the table tonight.”Régis Le Bris seemed content enough with a point which means his side remain seventh in the table. “It was very tough,” said the Sunderland manager. “Leeds are in great form and they showed great quality.”View image in fullscreenSimon Adingra (right) curls home his first Sunderland goal.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesThe home side started well and when Nordi Mukiele’s long throw worked its way to Granit Xhaka, the Sunderland captain’s pass found Adingra on the left. The unpromising angle was awkward but the former Brighton winger opted to shoot and such ambition paid off as his strike swerved into the gap just between the diving Lucas Perri and the far post.It was Adingra’s first goal in a Sunderland shirt and perhaps helped erase some of the winger’s disappointment at being omitted from the Côte d’Ivoire squad currently competing at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.Le Bris has lost six Sunderland players to Afcon but the absence of regular starters such as Reinildo, Noah Sadiki and Chemsdine Talbi offered Dennis Cirkin, Chris Rigg and Adingra rare opportunities they seemed determined to make the most of.Ditto Trai Hume. The Northern Ireland defender often starts on the bench but the achilles injury that dictates the influential Dan Ballard will be absent for around five weeks meant Hume was back in his favourite berth. Tellingly it was his goalline clearance that prevented Leeds equalising as half-time beckoned. When Calvert-Lewin volleyed a cross into the danger area, Brenden Aaronson’s shot looked to have beaten Robin Roefs but, heroically, Hume intercepted to divert the danger.An injury to Joe Rodon that left him limping and playing Adingra onside as Sunderland scored, eventually forced Farke to withdraw his key central defender, introduce Ao Tanaka and switch to 4-4-2.This abandonment of the 3-5-2 system that has so revived Leeds in recent weeks was perhaps informed by the need for more control of a midfield dominated by Xhaka and, generally, it worked a treat.View image in fullscreenDominic Calvert-Lewin scores Leeds’ equaliser after a move where all 11 players touched the ball.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersSuddenly Sunderland’s high press was largely stymied, their attacking options restricted and they had reason to rue missing two late first-half chances. First a rearguard-confounding through ball lifted expertly over the top by Enzo Le Fée put Brian Brobbey clean through but, although the former Ajax striker knocked the ball beyond Lucas Perri, his connection was poor and Jaka Bijol was able to clear. Almost immediately Farke’s team were reprieved once more when Adingra crossed from the left and Brobbey’s header rebounded off the crossbar.The scene was set for Calvert-Lewin to begin the second half by demonstrating precisely how to finish. The Leeds equaliser was swept into the net by a striker starting to compile quite some case for inclusion in England’s World Cup squad at the end of a gloriously fluent passing move that started with Perri, involved all 11 Leeds players and concluded with a low right- wing cross from the impressive Aaronson.Like his manager the United States attacking midfielder is delighting in confounding the Elland Road doubters but it helps that Calvert-Lewin is around to polish off his crosses.“I’m not surprised by Dominic’s run of goals,” said Farke. “He’s one of the best strikers in this league.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

City finished without a major trophy for the first time since 2016-17, Guardiola’s first in charge, but are hunting a seventh Premier League title under him after six straight wins.Rayan Cherkistruck late on at Nottingham Foreston Saturday to maintain City’s impressive winning run, which extends to eight in all competitions.

Asked what changed in the US, where they exited at the last-16 stage, the City manager laboured his point. “Energy, energy, energy,” he said. “Me first. We lost it last season. We started to train better, to compete better. After that we can talk about three at the back, four at the back, wingers or full-backs – that is all bullshit. We needed to get energy back, and then you have a good environment.”Guardiola acknowledged he was personally drained last season. “It was something … something was in the fog in Manchester, surrounding our training centre. We missed something. It is not switching on or off [energy]. Managers are not magicians, click your fingers and everything is clear. Sometimes you need time. Winning helps to advance this process.”During the off-season Guardiola also reshaped his coaching staff, with Jürgen Klopp’s former assistant Pep Lijnders, the club’s former defender Kolo Touré and the set-piece coach James French, also formerly of Liverpool, forming a new-look setup.View image in fullscreenJames French (far left), Kolo Touré (centre, left) and Pep Lijnders (centre, right) were appointed to Pep Guardiola’s backroom staff this summer.Photograph: MB Media/Getty Images“Everyone was happy,” the City manager said. “[We] made a lot of dinners, a lot of talks, [about] what we have to do next season. We wanted to extend it, just to live that. I think there, after talking with Pep and James, Manel [Estiarte, a longtime adviser to Guardiola], Hugo [Viana, City’s director of football], Txiki [Begiristain, their former director of football], we turned around and said something changed. Something [you can feel],” Guardiola said, rubbing his thumb against his index finger.“It doesn’t mean you are going to win but that you are able to recognise the team. Now it is eight victories in a row [in all competitions]. It is not easy but we compete in the way we do. We have to improve, absolutely, but this mindset is better.”Asked if he was concerned his vigour may not return, the 54-year-old replied: “No. Energy can go down but energy can go up. Never in our lives is it the same. In [our] professional or personal [lives], you’ll never be happy or sad all the time. You have to realise why, to realise what we missed, to come back. Everything in life … there is the sentence, right? ‘This too shall pass.’”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolanewsShareReuse this content"

Atalanta felt a similar sense of frustration soon after the restart when Nicola Zalewski broke through one-on-one with Yann Sommer, only for the Inter goalkeeper to produce a spectacular leg save.Atalanta thought they had struck again when Gianluca Scamacca broke clear, getting around Sommer and finishing calmly, but the offside flag was already raised. It took until the 65th minute for a goal to stand, as Pio Esposito pounced on a defensive error and squared the ball to Martínez who made no mistake to fire Inter into the lead.The match lost momentum in the closing stages, Lazar Samardzic coming closest to scoring when he missed a clear chance to equalise.MilanbeatVerona3-0 having struggled to break down a disciplined Verona side in the first half but made the breakthrough from a corner in added time when Christian Pulisic volleyed home at the far post.View image in fullscreenChristopher Nkunku celebrates his opening goal against Verona by blowing up a balloon.Photograph: Image Photo Agency/Getty ImagesChristopher Nkunku then scored twice in five minutes in the second half, first from the penalty spot after he was fouled and then again when he pounced on a rebound from a Luka Modric shot that came off the post.“For us today it was important to win against a tricky, fast team,” the Milan manager, Massimiliano Allegri, said to Dazn. “At the moment the Scudetto target will be between 82 and 84 points.

The German newspaper Bild reported on 23 December that the Frauen-Bundesliga was losing one of its top strikers and, according to multiple sources, all the paperwork is now finalised for the transfer.The 28-year-old’s arrival should represent a significant boost to United’s forward line. She has been very consistent in front of goal in Germany’s top flight – for seven consecutive seasons up to and including last term, Schüller reached at least a double-figures tally of league goals, winning the Golden Boot in 2021-22 with 16 goals.Securing Schüller’s signature comes at a time when United appear to be gathering momentum.After qualifyingfor the Champions League knockout phase playoffs in a seeded position thanks to an away victory over Juventus, they beat Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals. So far during the WSL’s winter break they have announced the signing of the Sweden right-back Hanna Lundkvist on a three-and-a-half-year deal and on Sunday they confirmed that the Japan midfielder Hinata Miyazawa has signed a new contract at the club.On extending the contract of Miyazawa, who has become something of a fan favourite since arriving in 2023, United’s director of football, Matt Johnson, told the club’s media channels: “She has become a critical component to the way we play. Her footballing intelligence and technical ability enables her and the team to control and dictate play from central areas.”Lundkvist, who has joined from the NWSL side San Diego Wave, said: “You can feel how much they [United] have grown in the last few years, competing in one of the strongest leagues in the world and performing in the Champions League.”Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenBayern Munich WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Provider of the cross forTrevor Francisto head the winning goal in the first of those matches, he scored the winner himself in the second.A world class left-winger in his prime, with dazzling dribbling skills, Robertson was the creative heart of the Forest team and the fulcrum of many of their moves. He was once described by their managerBrian Cloughas a “Picasso” of the game, such was his artistic flair. He was generally considered the best player Forest have ever fielded, and one of the finest British footballers of the second half of the 20th century.From something of an ugly duckling, Robertson developed into an elegant swan under Clough’s motivational leadership as Forest progressed from obscurity to greatness in double-quick time, epitomising the way in which the charismatic manager and his assistant, Peter Taylor, could uncover and burnish qualities in previously under-appreciated players.View image in fullscreenRobertson in 2006, when he was assistant manager at Aston Villa.Photograph: Malcolm Couzens/PADuring his main spell at Forest, from 1970 to 1983, Robertson also won the First Division Championship and two League Cups before moving to Derby County, after which he returned briefly to Forest. Later he embarked on a successful coaching career with his old Forest team-mate and friend Martin O’Neill, who used him with success as an assistant manager at Wycombe Wanderers, Norwich, Leicester, Celtic and Aston Villa.Born in Viewpark, on the outskirts of Glasgow, Robertson was the youngest, by some distance, of the three children of Hughie, a coalminer, and his wife, a biscuit factory worker. Brought up in nearby Uddingston, he went to Hozier secondary school, where he played age group football for Lanarkshire, Scotland and Drumchapel Amateurs.Attracting interest from scouts atNottingham Forest, he accepted an offer to join the club as a 15-year-old amateur in 1968, having just finished school. Living in digs in Nottingham, he took on a supplementary job as a messenger boy at a printing firm until he was signed as a full-time professional, making his debut at 17 in the First Division against Blackpool in 1970.Forest had been doing relatively well in the top flight up to that point, but their fortunes began to fade around the time Robertson joined, ending with relegation to the Second Division in 1972. For five seasons they remained in the second tier, where despite his great promise Robertson struggled to make an impact, dropping in and out of the side while developing a reputation for laziness, sullenness and a general lack of self-belief.However, the arrival in 1975 of Clough and, a bit later, Taylor, led to a sea change in Robertson’s fortunes. With characteristic hyperbole, Clough described Robertson at that point as a “scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time”. Nonetheless, he saw potential in the underperforming 22-year-old, who became his all-time favourite player. Clough and Taylor swiftly managed to uncover the best of his talent, including by switching him from central midfield to the left wing.Stocky and not especially quick, Robertson was able to make up for his lack of burning pace with a sharp footballing brain, wonderful footwork and a consistently good end-product in the form of accurately flighted crosses into the penalty box. From 1976 onwards he became a linchpin of the side, playing 243 consecutive matches at one stage.With Robertson finally hitting his straps, Forest were promoted to the First Division in 1977, securing the League Championship the following season by a comfortable margin, having also won the League Cup final 1-0 against Liverpool in a replay in which Robertson scored from a penalty.After he picked up another League Cup winners’ medal the following year (a 3-2 victory over Southampton), in the European Cup campaign of 1978-79 Robertson made a decisive intervention in the final in Munich against Malmö, skinning two defenders to reach the byline before delivering a perfectly looped ball to the back post, where Francis stole in for a header that led to a 1-0 victory.Defending their title the next season, Forest again won 1-0 in the final, this time against Hamburg in Madrid, where on 20 minutes Robertson cut in from the left to curl a right-footed shot past the goalkeeper for the winner. Earlier in the competition he had showed great fortitude after his brother, Hughie, and sister-in-law Isobel were killed in a car crash; he attended the funeral shortly before the first leg of the semi-final against Cologne, yet managed to stay focused enough to score with a diving header in a 3-3 draw.After the high points in Europe, Forest experienced a gradual falling away in achievement, and in 1983 Robertson left Clough to join Second Division Derby, who were by then being managed by Taylor – a signing that fuelled a longstanding rift between the two former managerial partners and did little to profit Robertson, who had two uninspiring seasons there, disrupted by injury. He went back to Forest – and Clough – in 1985, but was unable to last much longer.As a Scotland player Robertson had made his debut in May 1978, subsequently playing one game, against Iran, at that year’s World Cup finals in Argentina before appearing in three matches in a rather more successful World Cup campaign at the 1982 finals in Spain. He made the last of his 28 international appearances in 1983, while at Derby.View image in fullscreenRobertson, right, with Trevor Francis, left, and Brian Clough in Amsterdam before Nottingham Forest’s European Cup semi-final against Ajax in 1980.Photograph: AlamyRobertson ended his career playing non-league football with Corby Town, Stamford and then, as assistant player-manager, at non-league Grantham Town, who were managed by O’Neill. The connection between the two endured, and after a period as landlord of the Greyhound pub in Aslockton, Nottinghamshire, from 1990 onwards he spent two decades in tandem with O’Neill in management.Robertson’s warm, self-effacing personality and generosity of spirit made him a popular, trusted coach and a well-liked figure in general. An astute judge of players, like Clough he preferred a simple approach to coaching that was unclouded by mystique. With O’Neill his chief triumphs were to bring Wycombe into theFootball Leaguein 1993, to win the League Cup twice with Leicester, in 1997 and 2000, and to help Celtic to three Premier league titles, in 2001, 2002 and 2004. He retired while at Aston Villa in 2010.In his final years Robertson was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.He is survived by his second wife, Sharyl, and their children, Andrew and Mark; by a daughter, Liz, from his first marriage, to Sally, which ended in divorce; and by two granddaughters, Jess and Phoebe. Another daughter, Jessica, from his first marriage, died in 1996.John Neilson Robertson, footballer, born 20 January 1953; died 25 December 2025Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestFootball LeagueFootball politicsBrian CloughobituariesShareReuse this content"

Campbell Ridl and Will Goodrick-Clarke both dropped balls over the line but even without them their side now sit only a point behind leaders Northampton, with next week’s visit to Bath looming as a significant game for both sides.Northampton’s fabulous weekend performance at the Rec will already have provided food for thought for those in contention. Bath still have a hefty international contingent and it could be that sides like Exeter will be fresher than others over the season’s closing months. Rob Baxter is no one’s fool and already looks to be ahead of schedule in terms of reconstructing another squad capable of winning major titles.The latest template is not entirely unfamiliar: the marauding Fisilau, scorer of his side’s opening try after just seven minutes, could be a spiritual descendent of Sam Simmonds or Thomas Waldrom, while the box-office, tackle-busting energy of Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has echoes of prime Jack Nowell.Quick GuideExeter 24-10 Leicester: teams and scorersShowExeter Chiefs:Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Rigg (Haydon-Wood, 72), Ridl; Skinner, Varney; Sio (Goodrick-Clarke, 58), Dweba (Yeandle, 58), Tchumbadze (J Roots, 69), Jenkins (capt), Zambonin (Tuima, 69), Hooper (James, 60), E Roots, Fisilau.Replacements (not used):Chapman, JohnTries:Fisilau, Ridl, Varney.Cons:Slade 3.Pen:Slade.Sin-bin:Tuima, 75.Leicester:Steward; Radwan, Perese (Hamer-Webb, 60), Kata (Bailey, 32), Hassell-Collins; Searle, Whiteley (Van Poortvliet, 32); Smith (Haffar, 63), Blamire (Theobold-Thomas, 72), Heyes (Hurd, 50), Henderson, O Chessum (capt), Moro, Reffell (S Williams, 39), Cracknell (Thompson, 50).Try:Henderson.Con:Searle.Pen:Searle.Sin-bin:Searle, 61.Referee:A Woodthorpe (RFU).Att:15,000.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Perhaps most tellingly of all, though, the physical crunch is back. In place of the old family firm led by Dave Ewers et al there is now a new-look heavy mob fronted by Ethan Roots and that kind of hard-nosed mindset tends to be infectious. One seriously big tackle from Feyi-Waboso on his opposite winger, Ollie Hassell-Collins, certainly dislodged a lot of hyphens.Baxter also remains good at spotting raw talent, planing away the rough edges and unleashing it without great fanfare. The latest off the production line is the 20-year-old Ridl, born in Tooting but reared in South Africa, who has come through the ranks at Exeter University and represented England at U20 level.View image in fullscreenExeter’s promising Campbell Ridl flies over the line against Leicester.Photograph: David Davies/PAChiefs already have some eye-catching wingers but any of them would have been proud of the spectacular solo try that Ridl contributed to extend Exeter’s lead to 14-0 after 25 minutes. Turnover ball offered the rangy Ridl some broken-field space and a chip over the top and impressive acceleration turned a half-chance into a 50-metre cracker.A properly one-sided contest looked possible following another sharp chip-and-chase effort by Harvey Skinner, only for it to be ruled out for an off-the-ball push in the buildup. For the first time Exeter sat back momentarily andLeicestertook advantage, a midfield linebreak resulting in Cameron Henderson bursting clear to score.With Henry Slade also denied inches from the line by a last-gasp Jack van Poortvliet intervention, the half-time score of 14-7 did not remotely reflect the balance of play. Leicester under Geoff Parling, once an Exeter player, can also be a hard side to shake off and the first-half withdrawal of scrum-half Tom Whiteley, who had been ill overnight, and the hamstrung Solomone Kata also seemed to stiffen their resolve.Exeter’s bench, though, also gave them renewed impetus, along with a penalty from Slade. Another Ridl surge set up Skinner for a scything break that, again, was halted fractionally short of the whitewash, with Billy Searle subsequently earning a yellow card. Leicester did their best to cling on in his absence but a 71st-minute breakaway by Stephen Varney, teed up by Fisilau, effectively put the game to bed.Parling, in his first season as the Tigers’ head coach, was not happy. “For the first time this season we lacked a bit of edge in the first 30 minutes. That wasn’t our DNA today. We’re not good enough yet to have those off days.” His Exeter counterpart, Dave Walder, would also have preferred Chiefs to collect an extra point – “Deep down we’re a little bit disappointed with our accuracy” – but if they retain this level of physical appetite there will be plenty more good days to come.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyExeterLeicesterRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

He worked the other day and worked the sight out of your eyes, he was unbelievable.”The Gold Cup market is unusually open after Sunday’s race, with Inothewayurthinkin and Galopin Des Champs top-priced at 6-1 and 7-1 respectively, and Jango Baie (8-1), The Jukebox Man (8-1) and Gaelic Warrior (10-1) – the fourth, first and third home in Friday’s King George VI Chase at Kempton – next in the list.The shortest-priced favourite for any race at the Cheltenham festival after the first three days of the Christmas programme is Mullins’s Final Demand, who continued his flawless transition from hurdling to chasing with an effortless success in the Grade One Faugheen Novice Chase at Limerick.Final Demand was a creditable third after setting off as the 6-4 favourite for last season’s Baring Bingham Novice Hurdle at the festival but clearly had the physical scope to be better still over fences and scarcely came off the bridle on the way to an eight-length success.He was immediately cut to around even-money for the Brown Advisory Novice Chase, over three miles, at Cheltenham on 11 March.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

A Steelers victory in Cleveland would end Baltimore’s playoff hopes. If the Browns win that game, the Ravens could win the AFC North by beating the Steelers in Pittsburgh on 4 January.Green Bay (9-6-1) lost their third straight, enabling the Chicago Bears to clinch the NFC North title. The Packers already clinched a playoff berth on Thursday when the Detroit Lions lost 23-10 at Minnesota.Both teams were missing their starting quarterbacks as Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson deals with a back injury while Green Bay’s Jordan Love is in concussion protocol. The two replacement starters – Baltimore’s Tyler Huntley and Green Bay’s Malik Willis – were both effective in a game that featured only one punt.Willis went 18 of 21 for a career-high 288 yards and one touchdown, and he also rushed for 60 yards and two touchdowns before leaving after aggravating a shoulder injury midway through the fourth quarter. Huntley was 16 of 20 for 107 yards with one touchdown.The difference in the game was Green Bay’s inability to slow down Henry, who helped the Ravens outrush the Packers 307-79.Henry didn’t touch the ball in Baltimore’s final two series last weekend as the Ravens blew an 11-point, fourth quarter in a 28-24 loss to New England that put their playoff hopes on life support. The veteran running back’s lack of fourth-quarter usage was a hot topic around Baltimore all week.The Ravens made sure he got the ball early and often Saturday. Henry’s dominance enabled the Ravens to score on their first five possessions and take a 27-14 halftime lead over Green Bay, which hadn’t allowed more than 24 points in 14 straight home games.Henry totaled 15 carries in Baltimore’s first two series and capped each of them with touchdown runs, from three yards and one yard away. He was the first player to have at least 15 carries in his team’s first two offensive series since Denver’s Olandis Gary against Green Bay in 1999.He added another three-yard touchdown with 10 seconds left in the second quarter.Green Bay got back into the game by outscoring Baltimore 10-0 in the third quarter.After Brandon McManus kicked a 24-yard field goal, the Packers forced the first punt of the night. Willis then ran around right end for an 11-yard touchdown to make it 27-24 with 2:02 left in the third.But the Ravens responded on their next series.Henry ran for a nine-yard gain on third-and-5 from Baltimore’s 20. He closed the third quarter with a 30-yard burst up the right sideline. Those two plays set up Huntley’s 10-yard touchdown pass to Zay Flowers, which came on a third-and-8 play with 10:10 left.Willis drove the Packers into Baltimore territory before hurting his shoulder and heading to the locker room. Clayton Tune took over, and his only pass was intercepted by Marlon Humphrey.Houston Texans 20-16 Los Angeles ChargersCJ Stroud threw for two long touchdowns on Houston’s first two drives of the game, and the Texans went on to beat theLos Angeles Chargers20-16 on Saturday and clinch a third consecutive playoff berth for the first time in franchise history.The Texans (11-5) won their eighth in a row, their longest such streak since winning nine straight in 2018.The Chargers (11-5) had their four-game winning streak snapped and handed the AFC West title to idle Denver.

On his first pass of the game, he hit Jayden Higgins for a 75-yard score against busted coverage. Stroud wasn’t pressured when he threw a 43-yard TD to Jaylin Noel, who wasn’t covered.The Chargers had allowed just one TD pass of 40 or more yards in their last 15 games.Stroud completed his first six throws of the game. He finished 16 of 28 for 244 yards and two interceptions.Houston’s defense forced third-down sacks of Justin Herbert on the Chargers’ first two possessions. They were three-and-out on three of their first four possessions, quieting the SoFi Stadium crowd.Playing his third game with a broken left (non-throwing) hand, Herbert was 21 for 32 for 236 yards, with one touchdown and one interception. He was sacked five times.Derwin James Jr intercepted Stroud in the second quarter, but the Chargers only managed a 27-yard field goal by Cameron Dicker on the turnover to trail 14-3. Another interception of Stroud failed to produce any points despite both miscues coming in Houston territory.Herbert was intercepted by Azeez Al-Shaair at the Houston 1-yard line. The ball, intended for Oronde Gadsden, popped off his hands and Al-Shaair came down with it for his second interception of the season. Gadsden held his face in his hands on the bench.Dicker missed a field goal from under 40 yards for the first time in his career just before halftime, leaving the Chargers trailing 14-3. He later was wide left to miss his first point after attempt of the season on the Chargers’ final drive after Omarion Hamption’s five-yard TD run made it 20-16.Ka’imi Fairbairn had field goals of 41 and 44 yards for Houston.Explore more on these topicsNFLHouston TexansLos Angeles ChargersUS sportsBaltimore RavensGreen Bay PackersShareReuse this content"

The phrase “AI psychosis” has been used to describe the plight ofpeople experiencing delusions, paranoia or dissociation after talking to large language models (LLMs). Our collective anxiety has been compounded by studies showing that young people are increasingly embracing the idea of AI relationships; half of teens chat with an AI companion at least a few times a month, with one in three finding conversations with AI “to be as satisfying or more satisfying than those with real‑life friends”.But we need to pump the brakes on the panic. The dangersarereal, but so too are the potential benefits. In fact, there’s an argument to be made that – depending on what future scientific research reveals – AI relationships could actually be a boon for humanity.Consider how ubiquitous nonhuman relationships have always been for our species. We have a long history of engaging in healthy interactions with nonhumans, whether they be pets, stuffed animals or beloved objects or machines – think of the person in your life who is fully obsessed with their car, to the point of naming it. In the case of pets, these arerealrelationships insofar as our cats and dogs understand that they are in a relationship with us. But the one‑sided, parasocial relationships we have with stuffed animals or cars happen without those things knowing that we exist. Only in the rarest of cases do these relationships devolve into something pathological. Parasociality is, for the most part, normal and healthy.And yet, there is something unsettling about AI  relationships. Because they are fluent language users, LLMs generate the uncanny feeling that they have human-like thoughts, feelings and intentions. They also generate sycophantic responses that reinforce our points of view, rarely challenging our thinking. This combination can easily lead people down a path of delusion. This isnotsomething that happens when we interact with cats, dogs or inanimate objects. But the question remains: even in cases where people are unable to see through the illusion that AIs are real people that actually care about us, is that always a problem?The emergence of AI is not unlike the discovery of the analgesic properties of opiumConsider loneliness:one in six people on this planet experienceit, and it’s associated with a26% increase in premature death; the equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.Research is emergingthat suggests AI companions are effective at reducing feelings of loneliness – andnot just by functioning as a form of distraction, but as a result of the parasocial relationship itself. For many people, an AI chatbot is the only friendship option available to them, however hollow it might seem. As the journalist Sangita Lalrecently explainedin a report on those turning to AI for companionship, we should not be so quick to judge. “If you don’t understand why subscribers want and seek and need this connection,” said Lal, “you’re lucky enough to not have experienced loneliness.”To be fair, there is an argument to be made that the rise of new tech and social media has itself played a role in driving the loneliness epidemic. That’s why Mark Zuckerberggot flakfor his glowing endorsement of AI as a solution to a problem he might be partly responsible for creating. But if the reality is that it helps, this cannot be dismissed out of hand.There’s also research to show that AI can be used as an effective psychotherapy tool.In one study, patients who chatted with an AI-powered therapy chatbot showed a 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms. Not as effective as human therapists, who generated a 45% reduction, but still better than nothing. This utilitarian argument is worth considering; there are millions of people who are, for whatever reason, unable to access a therapist. And in those cases, turning to an AI is probably preferable to not seeking any help at all.But one study isn’t proof of anything. And there’s the rub. We are at the early stages of research into the potential benefits or harms of AI companionship. It’s easy to focus on the handful of studies that support our preconceived notions about the dangers or benefits of this technology.It’s in this research vacuum that the true dangers of AI are revealed. Most of the entities deploying AI companions are for-profit companies. And if there’s one thing we know about for-profit companies, it’s that they are keen to avoid regulations and eschew evidence that could hurt their bottom line. They are incentivised to downplay risks, cherrypick evidence and tout only benefits.The emergence of AI is not unlike the discovery of the analgesic properties of opium; if harnessed by responsible parties with the goal of relieving pain and suffering, both AI and opioids can be a legitimate tool for healing. But if bad actors exploit their addictive properties to enrich themselves, the result is either dependency or death.I remain hopeful that there is a place for AI companionship. But only if it’s backed by robust science, and deployed by organisations that exist for the public good. AIs must avoid the sycophancy problem that leads vulnerable people to delusion. This can only be achieved if they are explicitly trained to do so, even if it makes them less attractive as a potential companion; a notion that is anathema to companies that want you to pay a monthly subscription, without which you lose access to your “friend”. They must also be designed to help the user develop the social skills they need to engage with actual humans in the real world.The ultimate goal of AI companions should be to make themselves obsolete. No matter how useful they might be in plugging the gaps in therapy access or alleviating loneliness, it will always be better to talk to a real human.Justin Gregg is a biologist and author of Humanish (Oneworld).Further readingCode Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AIby Madhumita Murgia (Picador, £20)The Coming Wave: AI, Power and Our Futureby Mustafa Suleyman (Vintage, £10.99)Supremacy: AI, ChatGPT and the Race That Will Change the Worldby Parmy Olson (Macmillan, £10.99)Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The big ideaRelationshipsComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gerald Stratford, who has 370,000 followers, has starred in a photoshoot forGuccioff the back of his grassroots success.View image in fullscreenGerald Stratford, who is a fan of red cabbage.Photograph: @stratfordgerald/InstagramRowland Smith, the creative director at Billion Dollar Boy, a UK-based advertising agency thatworks with creators, says Stratford is an example of the authenticity and passion that online audiences are seeking as their channels become overwhelmed withAI-generated “slop”.Pointing out that the demand for everyday content appears to have increased this year, he says: “We are getting a lot of AI content on social media and I think this is an antidote to that. A lot of material like Gerald’s has an educational element as well. Audiences are wanting to get more out of their feeds than just scrolling every three seconds.”TikTok is viewed as a good platform for lesser known creators because its algorithm prioritises relevance and resonance over celebrity, according to Smith.“Audiences are becoming quite fatigued with polished, overly stylised creator content. We are starting to see a push away from it.”At this year’s TikTok awards for UK and Ireland, the platform handed the Voice for Change gong to Tola and Kevin Andu, a mother and son, for their@raisingkevin_account, which documents Kevin’s journey as a young autistic man. Badged “autism joy”, the videos detailing 20-year-old Kevin’s daily experiences, fromtrying new foodstohaving a job, receive millions of views.

Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.But the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.Nowworth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world’s AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.This year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging froma $5bn investment into Intel– to facilitate its access to the PC market – to$100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.But even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executiveJensen Huang’s energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.The start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing:Nvidialending money to customers so they can buy its products.The largest of these is its deal withOpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia’s chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia’s chips.The circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.View image in fullscreenThe tech investor James Anderson has expressed concern about Nvidia’s deal with OpenAI.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianJames Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, butsaid this year that the OpenAI dealpresented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.He added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”Other high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMDsigned a multibillion-dollar chip dealthat also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.There is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”All these moves form part of OpenAI’s $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies –and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.Graphic showing the companies Nvidia has deals with and the types of deals they areNvidia has also used structures calledspecial-purpose vehicles(SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk’s xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia’s chips.This drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.Nvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.The journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidiais not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent’s dotcom bubble partners. And it isn’t like Enron, Zitron argues, because it’s being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.So what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”Essentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia’s customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.Approached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.In particular, Kress argued that Nvidia’s recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.There is another complexity, which is that Nvidia’s health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.View image in fullscreenHuang signs autographs at a summit in Gyeongju. Nvidia’s deal with the South Korean government is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.Photograph: Lee Jin-man/APAdd to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and South Korean companies. Thevalue of this dealwas not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.Likewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.Governments are likely to pay. There’s nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia’s revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”Explore more on these topicsNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingOpenAIfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whether you’re hitting the pavements for the first time, running with a club or racing for personal glory, the ability to track your workouts has become an essential part of any training regime. Not only can it help you improve, but you can also use it to avoid injury and share in the social experience. A running watch isn’t the only way to do this, but it is a pretty effective option.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But with the market flooded with options, offering an array of features, you might find it difficult to answer all the questions that arise. Do you need offline maps? Do you want to listen to music while you run? Which brand is best, and how much do you really need to spend?Since a running watch is likely to last for far longer than most other bits of tech, you’ll want to make a smart investment – and I’m here to help you do just that.I ran more than 1,000km to guide you through my tried-and-tested options, so you can pick up the best running watch for you.At a glanceBest running watch for beginners:Garmin Forerunner 55£122 at AmazonBestbudget running watch:Suunto Run£174.99 at SportsShoesBest mid-range running watch:Coros Pace Pro£299 at HealfBest-looking mid-range running watch:Suunto Race 2£429 at SportsShoesThe best running watch money can buy:Garmin Forerunner 970£579 at BlacksBest running watch for battery life:Garmin Enduro 3£615.99 at SportsShoesBest running watch with LTE/satellite:Garmin Fenix 8 Pro£875.49 at SportsShoesWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, watched cutting-edge technology become mainstream commodities, used my body as a test bench for hundreds of watches, rings, glasses, goggles and other wearable devices, and covered thousands of kilometres as a keen club runner.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I ran well over 1,000km’: our writer wearing the Garmin Forerunner 970.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianTo really determine whether a running watch goes beyond the basics, you have to use it for some time. I ran well over 1,000km, testing each watch on its own and in pairs, wearing the devices for short and long runs, across different urban and wooded environments. I wore them for club runs and on solo efforts, for training, workouts and races, plus during the day and night, to fully evaluate their capability to track metrics and analyse data.I’ve poked and prodded them, updated them, tested their maps and navigation, and monitored their stamina. I’ve compared readings from the wrist-based optical heart-rate sensors to more accurate chest straps, compared pace and cadence readings, splits and total distances, routes and traces. And since GPS accuracy is so important and varies between watches, I put the top contenders through two different urban stress test routes to see which devices were reliable and which lost the plot. The first saw me weave between the tallest buildings in the City of London, while the other was around the notorious Canary Wharf loop of the London marathon, which tends to send racers’ watches wild.Do you need a running watch?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: alvarez/Getty ImagesJust starting out? Use your phone for freeIf your running journey is just beginning, then it’s likely you already have a device to track your workouts. Your smartphone will be able to track your route, distance and pace; you just need the right app to do it.If you’re an iPhone user, Apple’s built-inFitness appcan track runs and other workouts, too. Android phones usually arrive with a workout-tracking app installed; which one will depend on the brand of your phone.Samsung’s Health,Google’s FitorFitbit, for example, can all track the basics.One of the most popular free, cross-platform apps isStrava. It not only tracks your workouts but also enables you to share them with friends and family through its integrated social features for support and encouragement.Do you already own a smartwatch?Similar to phone-based tracking, practically any smartwatch can be used for tracking runs. Even older versions of theApple Watch,Google Pixel Watchand theSamsung Galaxy Watchwill work great, with built-in GPS and heart-rate monitors, and many of them track far more than the basics.The downside is relatively short battery life, but they should be fine for runs under marathon distances. All models should come pre-loaded with fitness-tracking apps that can record your runs, butStrava also has free appsfor the Apple Watch and Google’s Wear OS.The best running watches for 2026View image in fullscreen‘If you want the very best running watch there is, there’s one clear winner’: the Garmin Forerunner 970.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest running watch for beginners:Garmin Forerunner 55GarminForerunner 55from£122.49£179.99 at Decathlon£122.49 at Amazon£179.99 at Decathlon£122 at AmazonThe Forerunner 55 is the cheapest in market-leader Garmin’s running watch lineup, and covers more than the essentials.As well as 20 hours of workout battery life, this compact watch offers solid heart-rate tracking and can monitor cadence, pace and other essential metrics. It connects to the excellentGarmin Connect appon your phone via Bluetooth orcomputer via USB, which can then send the data to Strava and other third-party apps.Using Garmin’s Coach feature, you can leave the watch to automatically create a training plan for you, or load your own structured workouts such as intervals. Sleep tracking and recovery tools help you figure out whether you should step up a gear or if you should be taking it easy. Plus, it has race-time predictions and a race planner, so you can pre-program the route and see what’s coming up around the bend.What sets the Forerunner 55 apart from the competition at this price, however, is the speed and accuracy of its GPS tracking. Despite lacking the more advanced dual-band GPS of pricier models, it proved surprisingly reliable during testing, even in the most built-up areas of central London.However, the Forerunner 55 is now a fairly old watch with a tiny low-res LCD screen and button-only functionality. It also lacks offline maps, music, contactless payments and many of the more advanced metrics that have become increasingly useful training aids on more modern and expensive watches.Screen:1.04in LCDWeight:37gWater resistance:5 ATMGarminForerunner 55from£122.49£179.99 at Decathlon£122.49 at AmazonBest budget running watch:Suunto RunSuuntoRunfrom£174.99£174.99 at SportsShoes£199 at Suunto£174.99 at SportsShoes£199 at SuuntoThe Run is a surprise budget hit from longtime Finnish GPS-maker Suunto, which takes the best bits of its pricey models and condenses them into a super-light, bright running watch for under £200.The good-size 1.3in OLED touchscreen is crisp and looks great, while the body of the watch is neat and slim on the wrist. It arrives with two lengths of a quick-release nylon band, but is also compatible with standard 22mm straps, should you prefer a silicone one.Heart-rate monitoring is solid, and the dual-band GPS achieves a lock quickly, outclassing many of its rivals for accuracy in our urban stress tests. The Run records most of the advanced metrics you’d need, including the usual pace, heart-rate zones, cadence, running power and dynamics, plus it has solid VO2max, training load and recovery tracking viewable on the watch or in thedecent Suunto phone app.The Run lasts a good 20 hours of tracking at its highest accuracy level, and has profiles for workouts on outdoor running tracks, multisport for triathlons and many other modes. It also supports structured workouts and interval training when things get a bit more serious.While the screen is bright enough to see in direct sunlight, some of the dim grey fonts were a struggle to read at a glance. Some of the metrics looked a little too similar when four were on the screen at the same time, too. But the two buttons and crown make navigating, starting and pausing the watch easy, and it’s useful to be able to disable the touchscreen during workouts to prevent accidental presses.The Suunto app, whether on an Android or iPhone, is fairly simple, displaying decent maps and graphs, plus daily health and sleep tracking. But the Run lacks offline maps, restricted to simple breadcrumb navigation – a line with no underlying map tiles – if you sync routes from your phone beforehand. It supports offline music via Bluetooth headphones, but only with MP3s; there’s no support for Spotify or other streaming services. The USB-C charging puck is a bit flimsy with weak magnets, too, so you have to be careful to keep the watch charging.Screen:1.3in OLED touchscreenWeight:36gWater resistance:5 ATMSuuntoRunfrom£174.99£174.99 at SportsShoes£199 at SuuntoAlternative:Coros Pace 3CorosPace 3from£178.99£178.99 at SportsShoes£199 at Amazon£178.99 at SportsShoes£199 at AmazonCoros’s Pace 3 is a popular budget running watch for good reason: it packs a lot in for the price. But for GPS accuracy, it was beaten by the Suunto Run in our urban stress tests. Its battery life is shorter, too, and it has an older-style LCD screen. It has similar limitations with offline music and no maps.A great option if the Suunto Run isn’t for you.Screen:1.2in LCDWeight:30g (nylon band)Water resistance:5 ATMCorosPace 3from£178.99£178.99 at SportsShoes£199 at AmazonBest mid-range running watch:Coros Pace ProCorosPace Profrom£299£299 at Healf£299 at Myprotein£299 at Healf£299 at MyproteinWith highly capable budget watches champing at their heels, mid-range running watches essentially add one thing: offline maps.One of the best in a crowded pack is the Coros Pace Pro, which offers a lot while costing less than rivals. It has a bright and crisp OLED touchscreen, a button and crown on the side for control, as well as decent haptics and beeps to let you know what’s happening.The interface is fairly basic but responsive, with the watch tracking a wide array of sports, including a triathlon. Its heart-rate tracking is solid, and the dual-band GPS got a lock quickly and performed well in our urban stress tests. Battery life is up to 31 hours in its highest accuracy mode, which is very good. It even ships with a natty little keyring charging adapter that you plug into your own USB-C cable and then into the back of the watch.The Coros tracks all the metrics you probably want, too, with a decent set of training and analysis tools. However, I did find its recovery metrics a little optimistic – and, bizarrely, its training load tools reset every Monday rather than using a seven-day rolling average, which make them a bit useless.Nevertheless, there are plenty of workout configuration options, with up to eight metrics on display per screen. They’re only accessible from theCoros appon your phone, though. That app is a little basic, but it gets the job done, displaying your data, routes and maps well.This app is also where you plan and send routes to your watch – you can’t create routes directly on the device. Browsing a map on the watch is fast and responsive via touch, as is zooming into road names using the crown. But if you do happen to veer off course, the watch can’t automatically re-route you back to the correct path.The Coros offers support for offline music, but it’s only of the MP3 variety, which is less useful when you use streaming services. It lacks contactless payment support, and while the Pace Pro is light and comfortable, it doesn’t look or feel as premium as some more expensive rivals.Screen:1.3in OLED touchscreenWeight:37g (nylon band)Water resistance:5 ATMCorosPace Profrom£299£299 at Healf£299 at MyproteinBest-looking mid-range running watch:Suunto Race 2SuuntoRace 2from£429£429 at SportsShoes£429 at Suunto£429 at SportsShoes£429 at SuuntoThe Suunto Race 2 just misses out on being the top mid-range pick: it’s significantly more expensive than the Coros Pace Pro, yet didn’t perform quite as well in our urban GPS stress tests.This watch has plenty going for it, though. It’s good-looking, with a solid, premium feel, while the large, crisp 1.5in OLED touchscreen is bright and covered in super scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. The crown and two buttons make it easy to control the device during workouts, and the excellent rubber straps give a secure fit.The Race 2 tracks more than 110 different sports, including multisport and triathlons, and the collection of free apps in the SuuntoPlus store can add extra elements to each sport profile, such as a cadence coach or a climb app. It tracks every running metric you’re likely to need, with a new decent heart-rate sensor and dual-band GPS traces, support for structured workouts and external sensors such as footpods. It also has a decent set of training and analysis tools, some of which are from leading training firmTrainingPeaks.Battery life is impressive, with an outstanding 55 hours of tracking at the highest accuracy levels. That figure drops if you turn on the always-on screen option, though. Its offline maps look great on the big touchscreen, but like the Coros Pace Pro and other non-Garmin watches, you have to set routes on your phone first or rely on manual navigation.The companion app on your phone is a little basic-looking but has decent maps, stats, data and graphs, plus daily health and sleep tracking. Compared with a Coros or Garmin, the watch is a little short on different faces and customisations, but the ones included look good. It doesn’t have contactless payments or offline music, either.Screen:1.5in OLED touchscreenWeight:76g (steel); 65g (titanium)Water resistance:10 ATMSuuntoRace 2from£429£429 at SportsShoes£429 at SuuntoThe best running watch money can buy:Garmin Forerunner 970GarminForerunner 970from£579£579 at Blacks£629.99 at Cotswold OutdoorPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£579 at Blacks£629.99 at Cotswold OutdoorIf you want the very best running watch there is, there’s one clear winner: the Garmin Forerunner 970. It tracks every metric and statistic you could possibly want, both on the run and after the fact, and looks the business doing it.Alongside a compact and comfortable fit, the watch has a large and crisp OLED touchscreen, protected by super-hard sapphire crystal. There are five buttons for when you don’t want to use the touchscreen; contactless payments; and a built-in speaker and microphone for calls, voice commands and accessing your phone’s voice assistant. The Forerunner 970 even has an extremely useful built-in torch, which can be used as a strobe light for running or for just illuminating your way at night.On a run, the watch can clearly show up to eight different metrics onscreen at once and has excellent, highly detailed built-in offline maps. Unlike competitors, Garmin’s maps are routable, which means you can plan routes on the watch itself, and it can re-route you like a car’s GPS if you veer off course. It also supports offline music from various streaming services, including Spotify, Amazon and YouTube Music, or your own MP3s.Garmin’s dual-band GPS with best-in-class tracking accuracy did very well in our urban stress tests. Plus, its battery lasts a solid 23 hours of tracking – or more, if you turn down the screen’s brightness, or switch to less power-hungry GPS modes. The heart-rate sensor remains consistent even in difficult conditions and takes ECGs for monitoring arrhythmia, similar to the best health-tracking watches.The Forerunner 970 comes with the full suite of Garmin’s industry-leading fitness tracking, training and recovery tools. That includes the new impact load and running tolerance metrics that help you avoid injury by more accurately measuring the strain each run puts on your body, while keeping a rolling seven-day log of distance and impact, so you don’t overdo it.If you want to track more than running, the watch is fully triathlon-ready and tracks 30-plus sports of all guises. It’s great at general health and activity tracking, too, with various coaches for sleep, training and recovery. Garmin’s excellent automatic workout plans can be tailored to upcoming races or can be replaced by your own or third-party plans just as easily.TheGarmin Connectapp is the best in the business, with every stat, analyses and metric you’re likely to want to deep dive into; solid route planning and built-in social features, including options to share the data to Strava or other platforms; plus a good website for big-screen interrogation.Read our fullGarmin Forerunner 970 review: the new benchmark for running watchesScreen:1.4in OLED touchscreenWeight:56gWater resistance:5 ATMGarminForerunner 970from£579£579 at Blacks£629.99 at Cotswold OutdoorAlternative:Garmin Fenix 8GarminFenix 8from£692£769.99 at Argos£692 at AmazonPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£769.99 at Argos£692 at AmazonIf you like the sound of the Forerunner 970 but want a watch that looks more like a traditional timepiece, the Fenix 8 has all the same features and more.

And if you really have to go the distance, switch to a special “expedition GPS mode” and it will manage up to 77 days.This level of stamina does come with a few drawbacks, though. The first is its sheer size: the Enduro 3 is massive all round, and uses a low-power LCD screen rather than the fancy OLEDs equipped to Garmin’s other watches.Otherwise, it has most of the same features and high accuracy levels as the Forerunner 970 and Fenix 8, including offline maps and a torch.Screen:1.4in LCDWeight:63gWater resistance:10 ATMGarminEnduro 3from£615.99£615.99 at SportsShoes£649 at MilletsBest running watch with LTE/satellite:Garmin Fenix 8 ProGarminFenix 8 Profrom£875.49£875.49 at SportsShoes£991.57 at John LewisPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£875.49 at SportsShoes£991.57 at John LewisAll running watches have at least a guide or a map to help you out in tricky situations, but a new breed of devices has recently upped the game by adding cellular and satellite connectivity – which could help save your life in an emergency.At the top of the game is the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, which takes the excellent regular Fenix 8 and adds LTE and satellite connectivity. If it has mobile signal, it can keep you in contact and share your location with loved ones without you having to carry a phone. More importantly, you can contact the emergency services via satellite if you find yourself without reception in Europe and North America.Coupled with its full offline mapping, including re-routing on the watch, and the fact it tracks every metric under the sun, it’s a killer go-anywhere, do-anything device.However, for all this functionality, you’ll need to part with the big bucks. In addition to the cost of the watch, you’ll have to subscribe to Garmin inReach for the phone-free communications features, which costs from £7.99 a month.Read our fullGarmin Fenix 8 Pro review: built-in LTE and satellite for phone-free messagingScreen:1.4in OLED touchscreenWeight:77g (47mm); 90g(51mm)Water resistance:10 ATMGarminFenix 8 Profrom£875.49£875.49 at SportsShoes£991.57 at John LewisAlternative:Apple Watch Ultra 3AppleWatch Ultra 3from£719£719 at John Lewis£719 at ArgosPhotograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian£719 at John Lewis£719 at ArgosIt may not be a dedicated running watch, but the Apple Watch Ultra 3 ticks almost every box for running if you’re an iPhone user, including a dual-band GPS that was one of the most accurate in our urban stress tests.The latest model adds emergency satellite communications to its existing cellular connectivity, so like the Fenix 8 Pro, it can help you seek rescue if you find yourself in a sticky situation off-grid.Elsewhere, it tracks almost every running metric you could need, has a big and bright screen, an accurate heart-rate monitor and a durable body made of titanium and sapphire. Battery life isn’t quite as long as proper running watches when tracking, but it will manage a marathon or two. And it comes with all the trappings of a true smartwatch, including offline maps, music, Apple Pay, notifications and Siri.The Apple Watch only works with an iPhone, and while the satellite SOS feature is free, using 4G or 5G requires a compatible plan with your phone provider.Read our fullApple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhoneScreen:1.93in OLED touchscreen;weight:61.6g (natural titanium strap);water resistance:WR100AppleWatch Ultra 3from£719£719 at John Lewis£719 at ArgosOthers worth consideringView image in fullscreen‘Remains extremely capable’: the Garmin Forerunner 965.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianGarmin Forerunner 570– a really great running watch that’s just a little too expensive for what it offers, in particular, the lack of offline maps. A great option at a discounted price, though.Suunto Race– software updates see the predecessor to the great Race 2 gain most of the new features of recent models. It’s a smart buy at a good discount.Garmin Forerunner 165– Garmin’s entry-level OLED running watch is great, but it costs a bit too much to be a budget pick and lacks dual-band GPS. Look for a deal.Garmin Forerunner 265– the older-generation mid-range Garmin was one of the best with dual-band GPS, an OLED screen and multiple sizes, but was quite expensive at launch without maps and has since been phased out.Garmin Forerunner 965– Garmin’s previous top-of-the-line Forerunner remains extremely capable, missing only a few of the Forerunner 970’s features. A good buy at a steep discount.How I pickedGo to the effort of buying a dedicated running watch and you want the device on your wrist to at least work as hard as you are, pounding the pavements. So while practically any watch with a GPS will get the job done to some extent, it’s the features below that I considered alongside when selecting models for this test:Screen– it has to be bright, crisp and clear enough to view and understand at a glance during the run.Fit and profile– it has to sit on the wrist comfortably and securely, neither moving about during vigorous exercise, nor being too tight as you become warm due to activity.Strap replacement– straps become sweaty, smelly and wear out, so being able to replace them easily is essential, either with a like for like, or with different options for different occasions.Ease of use on the run– do the buttons work, can you lock the touchscreen, are the haptics strong enough, and can you hear the beeps and chimes while pushing for that next PB?Heart-rate accuracy– accurate and consistent heart-rate tracking is essential for using heart-rate zones for training, as well as evaluating effort, fitness and recovery.GPS accuracy– how long does the watch’s GPS take to get a lock and how well does it hold on to it in difficult forested or urban conditions? This is vital for accurate traces, distances, paces and various other metrics.Battery life– will it last long enough for all your weekly runs, and how often will you have to charge the device?Water resistance and durability– a running watch should be able to take some punishment and survive rain, wind, mud, snow, sleet, swims, freezing temperatures and baking summer days – anything you can cope with, it should do too.Companion app and data export– a good cross-platform app is essential, offering reliable syncing, plenty of stats, graphs and maps, as well as the ability to send your data to Strava, other services, or export it to industry-standard files such as GPX or FIT for use elsewhere.Training and analysis– how good is the data analysis of your training, fitness and recovery? Is it representative and will it adapt to your progress?Software support– a running watch isn’t a huge target for cybercriminals, but since it and the connected service contain a lot of sensitive data, it should be secure and kept up to date for an extended period.For more:The best running shoes for men and womenThe best treadmills, testedThe best fitness tech and gadgets, according to expertsSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editorExplore more on these topicsSmartwatchesThe FilterRunningHobbiesHealth & wellbeingGadgetsbest ofShareReuse this content"

But Donald Trump’s words bolster narratives of foreign ‘crusader’ aggressionSun 28 Dec 2025 09.32 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 10.04 ESTShareThe response of Nigerians to theairstrikesagainst Islamic State (IS) targets in Sokoto state, north-western Nigeria are complicated. The rationale behind them has been widely opposed, but the strikes themselves have been welcomed.The airstrikes were framed as a response to what have been described as genocidalattacks on Christiansin the country. But the Nigerian authorities have consistentlyrejectedthis narrative, arguing that armed groups in the country do not discriminate based on religion, and that Christians and Muslims largely coexist peacefully. Ironically, it was Trump’s redesignation of Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” in November that deepened Muslim-Christian tensions. Many northerners, who are predominantly Muslim, blamed southern Nigerians for championing a narrative that ultimately resulted in US sanctions and international stigma.The geographic and operational focus of the strikes has complicated the “Christian genocide” framing. Sokoto is the spiritual heartland of Islam in Nigeria, but armed violence in the area disproportionately affects Muslim communities. By contrast, attacks against Christian farmers are most prevalent in north-central states such as Benue and Plateau, where violence is often linked to armed Fulani herders rather than explicitly jihadist groups. The strikes targeted IS elements, not herder militias. Whilesome reportssuggest tactical collaboration between jihadist groups in the north-west and armed herders, the mismatch between the stated justification and the operational target raises questions about whether Washington fully understands the local drivers of violence it has labelled genocidal.Despite there being opposition to – and confusion over – the rationale behind the strikes, they have been broadly welcomed, cutting across religious, ethnic and social divides.Earlier fearswere shaped by the spectre of the prolonged US occupations in Libya, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, cases frequently cited in Nigerian media. By contrast, the Sokoto operation was a limited, targeted precision strike. Moreover, there have so far been no credible reports of civilian casualties, alleviating a major concern in a country where Nigerian air force operations have, on several occasions, accidentally killed hundreds of civilians.The strikes against IS came at a time of public fatigue with insecurity caused by insurgency, terrorism, banditry and communal violence. Nigerians were ready to accept almost any intervention that promised relief. As terrorist networks become increasingly interconnected across the Sahel and West Africa, Nigerian security forces have become overstretched. Persistent corruption, inadequate training and equipment shortages continue to undermine counterinsurgency efforts. In some theatres, groups such asBoko Haramand its splinter factions now wield more sophisticated weaponry than state forces.Why has Trump ordered strikes in Nigeria and what has it got to do with the persecution of Christians?Read moreThe Nigerian authorities have confirmed that theyendorsed the operation. The minister of foreign affairs, Yusuf Tuggar, acknowledged that Abuja provided intelligence that enabled the strikes and Nigerian officials remained in communication with US forces until minutes before execution. This joint counter-terrorism action, rather than a unilateral violation of Nigerian sovereignty, eased concerns about territorial integrity and external military overreach.Despite the support, Nigeria’s insecurity will not be resolved through airpower alone. Airstrikes may yield short-term tactical gains, but they risk generating longer-term strategic setbacks. Framing the intervention as the defence of persecuted Christians may strengthen extremist narratives of foreign “crusader” aggression, potentially attracting more external funding and support for jihadist groups. Organisations such as Isis-Sahel and emerging groups such as Lakurawa thrive on such symbolism.The durable solution lies in starving violence of its fuel by addressing its structural drivers: deep socioeconomic inequality (Sokoto has one of the highest numbers of out-of-schoolchildren in Nigeria), desertification and climate stress, weak state presence in rural areas, porous borders and fragile security institutions. Strengthening state capacity to manage grievances, regulate competition over land and resources, and counter extremism remains the only sustainable path to peace.Onyedikachi Madueke is a security analyst at the University of AberdeenDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The sinister watch towers with their searchlights and armed guards, the minefields in no-man’s land, the notorious Checkpoint Charlie border post, and the Wall itself –all were swept asidein an extraordinary, popular lunge for freedom.Less than a month later, on 3 December 1989, at a summit in Malta, US president George HW Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev declared that after more than 40 years,the cold war was over. All agreed it was a historic turning point.Yet fast forward to December 2025, and one question persists: did the cold war – the west’s many-fronted, global confrontation with Moscow and its allies – ever truly end? Led byVladimir Putinfor the past 25 years, Russia has resumed the familiar role of an aggressive, expansionist power stalking Europe’s borderlands. Ukraine, the Baltic republics, Georgia, Moldova, even Poland, are again treated as property or prey.With hindsight, it seems that 1989 “turning point” was less than wholly decisive. In fact, it has been turned on its head.This phenomenon is nothing new. Successive generations typically believe their experience is unique – yet, historically, factually, ideologically, they are usually wrong. When major geopolitical shifts occur, they are breathlessly described as “historic” and “unparalleled”. Because history is insufficiently studied, because perspectives are limited by human lifespans, because the same mistakes are repeated over and over, momentous events are hailed as watersheds, landmarks and epochal inflection points. Almost invariably, they’re not.Think of theArab Spring of 2010-11, a series of uprisings hailed as a Middle Eastern democratic renaissance. Those hopes were soon dashed. Think of 9/11, which led the US to declare a “global war on terror”. That, too, was deemed unprecedented at the time. Yet if any lasting change occurred, it was in the damage done to international law, respect for sovereignty and human rights. Think Afghanistan. ThinkIraq. Both invasions are now widely viewed as mistakes.In a world fixated on sensational, ostensibly seismic upheavals, the realisation that many such events are false dawns – products of national delusions, strategic miscalculations and ahistorical misperceptions – is salutary and reassuring. Putin’s 2022 Ukraine invasion isa disaster for Russia. Brexit is proving chastening and instructive. Now – too slowly – it’s beingpainfully reversed.There’s a lot to be said for continuity, and there’s a lot more geopolitical continuity around than is generally allowed. Despite the disruption, schisms and confusioncaused by hard-right politicianspromoting nationalist-populist panaceas, culture warriors campaigning to change the world and unregulated online media hyping flashpoints and spreading disinformation, the basics don’t change that much.Revolutions are overrated, intrinsically unpredictable and typically followed by counter-revolutions. True turning points in history are actually quite rare – and difficult to spot. Even rarer are genuinely world-changing leaders.Donald Trumppresents a case study.The way Trump tells it, he’s Alexander, Charlemagne, George Washington, Napoleon and Mahatma Gandhi all rolled into one. Yet after a decade at the top of US politics, solid achievements are few. His peacemaking flounders, his economic and trade tariff policies falter, his personal approval ratingtumbles. Towering ego, ignorance,vulgarityand bottomless narcissism are Trump’s only exceptional traits.Right now, the global and domestic upheavals triggered by Trump and Maga seem transformational. They are symbolised by the new US national security strategy – an authoritarian,anti-European, transatlantic alliance-rupturing charter. On all sides the cry is heard: “The old order perishes. Chaos looms!” Yet looked at in the round, the Trumpian moment is fleeting. Trump, 79, has three years remaining in power, at most. Even if a loyalist wins in 2028 – a huge “if” – no heir can match his monstrous appeal. His Maga coalition isfracturing.It’s claimed Trump has permanently changed how Americans view the world. But they said that about 1930s America First isolationism, and that didn’t last, either. Time will show the Trump era to be less turning point, more freakish aberration – a sort of Prohibition for populists. In history’s bigger picture, Trump is a blotch, an unsightly smear on the canvas.When Putin, Xi Jinping and Netanyahu go, successor governments may opt for reform, as was the case post-Stalin and post-MaoAt an unsettling moment in world affairs when the tectonic plates are shifting (to recycle another melodramatic cliche), it’s important to stay grounded, to maintain perspective. As 2026 trepidatiously creeps through the door, nursing hangovers from the tumultuous year just ending, try counting the continuities and bridges rather than dwelling on earthquakes and chasms.Given a free choice (which is the whole point), democracy, for all its flaws, continues to be thepreferred system of governanceworldwide. Divisive hard-right and neo-fascist parties remain, mostly, on the fringe; they do not rule. Authoritarian leaders such as Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu have no recognised successors, not least because they fear usurpers. When they go – and it won’t be long – successor governments may opt for reform, as was the case post-Stalin and post-Mao.Most countries still support the UN and respect international law. Music, film, theatre and the arts continue, overall, to connect and bind the peoples of the world, as does sport, the great global leveller.Religious faith, broadly defined, acts as a timeless, superhuman unifying force, despite the distortions of extremists. And the quest for knowledge and understanding, pursued through schools, universities, scholarship, historical research, books, scientific inquiry and technological innovation, inexorably advances with each new generation.If one is allowed a wish for 2026, it’s that there be no great geopolitical turning points, no epic spasms or watersheds (with possible exceptions for Putin’s defeat and Trump’s resignation). Most people, given the option, would surely prefer to live their lives peacefully, striving to improve their lot and that of others, free from importunate, lying politicians, divisive dogmas, shaming bigotry, competing great power hegemonies and renewed conflicts.Que no haya novedad–let no new thing arise, as the old, wistful Spanish saying has it. For a still hopeful, vibrant world haunted by fear of another cold (or hot) war, it would be a gift and a blessing.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsRussiaVladimir PutinChinaAsia PacificEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It was a few months after my second baby was born and a month beforeChristmas. She was the last in the generation above me, and this fact reordered things in ways that are only just revealing themselves.This time last year, I was still unravelling – months of hospitals, grief and the unmanageable weight of suffering pressing into my postpartum body.Roshi Joan Halifax, a Buddhist teacher, once said that grief, particularly that for a parent,scours the heart. The life I once had was disintegrating. Yet what I found at the bottom was not pessimism or despair but rather a softening. A welcome and changing sense of who I was in the world.The late psychologistJames Hillmancalled this kind of season the process ofgrowing down– sinking deep into the roots of things, relaxing into the life we are given, not the one we imagined.In my growing down, what once felt urgent no longer felt compelling. I stopped fretting over the small stuff and I started to notice that the present carried all sorts of offerings I had been too distracted to savour. It felt like a kind of effortless mindfulness, a natural consequence of a directencounter with impermanence.A hidden life in the era of social media can still change history, as the story of Jesus shows | Justine TohRead moreGone are the years of racing from shop to shop, collecting toys, vouchers, last-minute gifts and those very particular treats for a new year’s party. I still do those things, of course, but more as a dawdle. And I catch myself muttering, “Who cares about lunch! To hell with gifts.”Don’t get me wrong, I look back on those frenzied preparations with fondness and I don’t rule out their return. My mother spent her whole working life in retail and, when I was a child, department stores felt magical, full of possibility and aliveness.But this year I don’t feel the need to curate my holidays into an “experience”, an “event” or even something special. Instead I find myself open to what greets me through the senses – taste, touch, sight, scent – and through memory and imagination. All freely given and undemanding in their nature.I remember the muggy Australian summer air as I make Turkish coffee in my mother’s kitchen, stirring heaped sugar into her tiny copper pot. The quiet of early morning streets. The magpie’s call. My partner thumbing through records, knowing he is about to choose Paul Kelly. My kids’ thrill at the resident Christmas elf, their squeals of rapture.It seems my centre of gravity has shifted. The holidays are no longer something to construct but something to receive.The Buddha taught that it isgrasping that leads to sufferingand that meeting things as they are leads to spaciousness, room to breathe. In Buddhist thought, when grasping falls away the world takes on greater clarity and vividness.Themiddle wayis a guide here. It invites balance and cautions against the extremes – the overindulgence of December or the punitive approach to new year resolutions. It also warns against rigid either/or thinking.So we approach our holidays tenderly, not overindulging and not denying ourselves necessary and small delights. And these small delights are unfolding right now if we care to look.As the Buddhist teacherJack Kornfieldexplains, this is a path “of balance and care, where the heart’s natural awareness and practical compassion can grow. Through this, we become gracious and free.”How can we navigate difficult conversations these holidays? Buddhism offers some guidance | Making sense of itRead moreOf course, for many, the period after Christmas can be stressful, painful or overwhelming. And choosing to pause is not available to everyone; the holidays can easily be overshadowed by financial stress, caring responsibilities or sheer exhaustion. I don’t mean to romanticise very real moments of suffering.But this receptive awareness can hold what is difficult as well as what is sublime.Thich Nhat Hanhsaid the most precious gift we can offer – to ourselves and others – is presence itself. And sometimes it takes difficulty, held with tenderness, to finally notice what has been in front of us all along.I have never related to the idea that life is a gift but maybe I was missing something crucial. Perhaps it is not one grand present tied in a bow but rather a series of small gifts being offered continually, ordinary yet beautiful in their ephemerality and particularity.I often imagine this is what Derek Walcott summons in the title of his poemLove after Love, which speaks to the moment we stop turning away from life and its unexpected splendour. He writes:The time will comewhen, with elation,you will greet yourself arrivingat your own door, in your own mirrorand each will smile at the other’s welcome,and say, sit here. Eat …The poem ends:“Sit. Feast on your life.”May it be so for you in these suspended, in-between days.Explore more on these topicsBuddhismMaking sense of itNew yearChristmasBereavementParents and parentingFamilyReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

I may have just the story you’re looking forMartin KettleA single act of kindness reminded me that, despite so much evidence to the contrary, the better angels of our nature are not necessarily doomedSun 28 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 13.41 ESTSharePerhaps you are searching for reasons to be cheerful at the end of what has been a particularly dispiriting year? In that case, read on. In November, I was on a train travelling into London. When I got off the train and headed for the ticket barrier, I realised I didn’t have my wallet. I knew that I had it when I boarded. I made an undignified scrabble and search through my coat, jacket and trouser pockets that deserved the comic skills of a Charlie Chaplin or Jacques Tati. There was, though, no mistake. I had somehow managed to leave my wallet on the train.A nice station attendant took the details and said he would pass the message down the line. I left him my mobile number. But it was rush hour, the man pointed out, and the chances of getting the wallet back had probably vanished with the departing train. Meanwhile I rang my bank and eventually succeeded in cancelling my cards. I felt horribly stupid, old and embarrassed. I went for a drink with friends and felt sorry for myself.A couple of hours later, I looked at my phone. Among my emails was one from a woman called Natalya. She had found my wallet on the train, she explained, and had already dropped it off with the security people at the Guardian’s office. Everything was intact, including the cards and some cash. She had seen the Guardian connection because of my National Union of Journalists card, and had taken the not inconsiderable trouble to go to the office and hand the wallet in.One of my friends is prone to ask people if, in these dark political times, they can nominate three things that should give us all cause for optimism. You might want to try it, because it’s a harder exercise than it sounds, but for me, the story of Natalya’s kindness offers a reassuring start. I imagine Shakespeare must have had a story of this sort in mind when he wrote that lovely line in the Merchant of Venice about the candle whose beam shines like a good deed in a naughty world.Cheeringly, I am not alone. Only a couple of weeks after I got my wallet back, I read an article by the Belfast Telegraph’s excellent journalist Sam McBride, which began: “Last week I was about to get on a bus in Belfast city centre when I realised that the wallet I thought was in my hip pocket wasn’t there, wasn’t in my bag, wasn’t in my coat – wasn’t anywhere on my person.” And, yes, you guessed the rest. A little while later, Sam’s phone had rung with the news that the bus driver had handed the wallet in, cash untouched.Perhaps McBride’s experience and mine were just a coincidence – two journalists separated by the Irish Sea experiencing the same good fortune at the same time. Perhaps, if so, they illustrate a version of Rupert Sheldrake’s deeply controversial theory of formative causation, or so-called morphic resonance, in which humans in different places somehow learn to behave differently without anyone urging them to do so or without anyone orchestrating it.The safer explanation, however, is simply that there are more Natalyas than you may think. Maybe alotmore. I’m not saying that if you lose your wallet, I can guarantee you an observant good citizen who will ensure you get it back. Like Shakespeare, we live in a naughty world. But I am prepared to say that the chances of you encountering the kindness of strangers, as I did, are quite a bit higher than the unremitting bleakness of an all too common view of Britain in 2025 might lead you to believe.There is no way around the fact that the media – traditional and social alike – are sleepless drivers of our reflexive collective pessimism. We live in a country where failure, risk and danger are deemed ever present and on the increase. Our media endlessly reports terrible cases of cruelty, exploitation, greed and anger. As a result, no one in my profession would ever think my wallet story was worth sharing, except perhaps at Christmas.Of course, in the wider scheme of things, my wallet story was trivial. But reflexive pessimism is a big issue for modern societies, not a little one. Here’s a wider illustration of how it can work. When Andy Burnham was health secretary in the Gordon Brown government, he invited a group of us into Whitehall to share some private polling that was worrying the government. The polling showed public expectations of the NHS were getting lower, driven largely by repeated news of healthcare crises. At the same time, however, the public’s own personal experiences of the NHS, and the experience of their closest relatives, remained almost uniformly excellent.I remember feeling sceptical about these findings. I knew too many bad NHS stories, even back then, as well as some better ones. But the questions Burnham posed in the light of the department’s own focus groups remained valid. How do we get past the public’s conviction that the macro-NHS was in decline, and that they had simply been lucky? How do we get people to see that their own good experiences were not freak good fortune, and to have confidence that the NHS – or a myriad other embodiments of the common good – could deliver for all?In essence, this is the same possibility that is posed by Natalya’s single act of kindness. You can put it in various ways. Maybe all of us, and our media and our politicians in particular, are too quick to believe the worst. Maybe our social and moral norms are more decent and resilient than we assume. Maybe we live in a better country than we all seem to think. Maybe we should be less angry.If even some of this is true, the questions that follow from Natalya’s decency are ones such as these. What can we get beyond the belief, fired by so much political and media exaggeration, that we all inhabit a howling wilderness of incivility, misbehaviour and ineffectiveness from which our only refuge is either fear or repression? What can we do to help ourselves see that individual experiences of kindness, politeness and decency are not random oases of good fortune in a desert of general nastiness?The answers are obviously not easy.

It’s lonely being the only person who cares about something. It’s even lonelier when the thing you care about makes you want to stamp your feet, tear your hair out and run naked into the streets while making the face of Edvard Munch’s The Scream. And so it is for me whenever I see a film poster, headline, book cover or screen caption featuring the incorrect use of the Cyrillic alphabet.You might think this is a niche preoccupation. But you would be surprised how many times the name of “STДLIN” pops up in poster designs, supposedly representing “STALIN”. This phenomenon annoys me most when the entity depicted is not fictional. If you write the (nonexistent-in-any-language) word “STДLIN” instead of “STALIN” you are writing “STDLIN”. Which would be fine if you were attempting some kind of wordplay comparing the impact of the one-time Soviet leader to a sexually transmitted disease. But clever wordplay is not the intention of these designs. The intention of the incorrect use of the Cyrillic alphabet is to indicate one thing and one thing alone: “This is about something that is happening east of Warsaw! It is probably connected to the former Soviet Union! It should give you a frisson of creepy exoticism!”The most famous of these alphabetical abominations include the opening credits for Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Red Heat (where his name is given in Cyrillic as “Lyaiold Schwlyazeieggeya”) and the posters for the moviesThe Death of Stalin,Chernobyl Diariesand Borat. The name of the eponymous fake Kazakh, for example, is rendered as “ВОRДT”. This reads clearly as “Voyadt” in Cyrillic. I did not suffer decades of learning Russian and Ukrainian to deserve this cerebral meltdown. It is equally undeserved by the 250 million global users of Cyrillic, from Azeris and Bulgarians to Macedonians, Serbians and numerous other nationalities, not least the 20 million entirely non-fake Kazakhs.Faux Cyrillic is prevalent enough in everyday design to have its own Wikipedia page where the phenomenon is described as “mimicry typeface” and rendered – painfully literally and truly horrifically – as “Fдцx Cчrillic”. This reads, in the most mind-boggling brain-bleed of them all, as “Fdtsx Schrillic”. I can just see someone like Elon Musk taking the name “Fdtsx Schrillic” and thinking: “That is a great brand name for my next metaversal AI interface venture.” Which is yet more proof that this typographical travesty has no place in a world where we want to encourage people to be more, not less, sane.Despite the many millions of potential fellow sufferers of faux-Cyrillic-phobia, I do recognise that I plough a lonely furrow. The only place in the universe where I have found any solidarity is, sadly, Reddit. Typical responses to the use of pseudo-Cyrillic: “My eyes are bleeding.” “Another Hollywood film-maker trying to make something look ‘Russian’ without paying someone who actually knows Russian.” “It’s annoying and maybe even a little bit racist.” “Bad design. Bad colours. Everything bad.” That’s exactly it: everything bad. These are my people.To my great joy, though, I have recently discovered a subset of my tribe: German speakers who object to the gratuitous use of the umlaut. This is commonly – cömmonly? – used in the world of heavy metal, the chief offenders being Blue Öyster Cult, Mötley Crüe and Motörhead. (See Kerrang’s gloriousBrief History of Heavy Metal Umlautsfor the full hall of shame.) In the case of Motörhead, there is no grammatical or linguistic reason for the second “o” to have the umlaut any more than the first “o” to have it. But that’s the whole point: the reason is not to do with logic, reason or the laws of any known alphabet, it is to do with implication. It is about the shared emotional language of the onlookers: “We don’t care if this looks weird to you, it means something to us. And you are not one of us.”I suspect the same is happening with Fdtsx Schrillic. As Motörhead’s Lemmy said of his umlaut: “I only put it there to look mean.” The misuse of language is there to menace, to emphasise the “other”, to suggest the exotic, the foreign, the “enemy”, to separate “them” and “us”. But it isn’t mean or scary. It is just very, very silly indeed.Viv Groskop is a comedian and author ofOne Ukrainian SummerExplore more on these topicsLanguageThe hill I will die onGraphic designLanguagescommentShareReuse this content"

Today we look skyward, where a new lunar contest mirrors humanity’s struggle to live within planetary limitsSun 28 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 28 Dec 2025 15.04 ESTShareDuring the cold war’s space race, the Apollo moon missions were driven by the need to prove American superiority. Having made that political and technological point with the 1969 moon landing, the contest between Moscow and Washington petered out. A new dash across the skies kicks off in2026, reigniting geopolitical competition under the guise of “peaceful exploration”. The moon’s south pole is emerging as the most valuablereal estatein the solar system, offering “peaks of eternal light” for solar arrays andice depositsin craters shielded from the sun.The US and a China-led bloc are eyeing the lunar surface and its potential to control a post-terrestrial economy. Space had been humanity’s last commons, supposedly shielded by the 1967 UN outer space treaty that bans state exploitation of the heavens. It is vague, however, on private claims – a loophole that is now fuelling a tycoon-led scramble for the stars. The aim is obvious: to act first, shape norms and dare others to object. Two lunar missions launching next year– Nasa’sArtemis IIand China’sChang’e 7– are competing for strategic supremacy.To hasten the commercialisation of space, Donald Trump isshrinkingstate support for Nasa, which will have its smallest budget since 1961. Washington wants space exploration to be led by the private sector, a wish anchored in the Artemis accords. Signed by more than 40 nations, the accords are a vision of extending earthly ownership structures into space – and one embraced by tech moguls such asElon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Little wonder, then, that Mr Musk aims to float his space exploration firmSpaceXin 2026 for $1.5tn.By contrast, the International Lunar Research Station – China’s joint effort with Russia and global-south partners – embodies a state-led approach that seeks to escape an American-led system. China and Russia say that they are complying with UN rules because their lunar bases will be under an international “collaborative” consortium not any one state’s control.Superpower rivalryThe result is a rivalry with two camps both publicly invoking “peaceful exploration” while engaging in strategic competition for lunar resources. Already there are claims thatwatercould produce rocket fuel and sustain life. Others speculate whethermoon rockmight be useful for construction. These are essentially rhetorical claims – like the oft-repeated assertion that space’shelium-3is a potential fusion fuel. These are arguments, however thin, for governments to justify lunar spending with the promise of future potential.Nuclear fission on the moon, by contrast, is a concrete engineering race, with the US andChina-Russiaalready funding reactor designs necessary to support human lunar colonies. Nasa intends to do so withinfive years; China and Russia say theirs will be running by2035. The technology is not new: small fission reactors inspacewere part of cold war duelling. But the moon looks like a proving ground. Reliable nuclear power during the 14-day lunar night would be needed for permanent human bases. Once solved, the same power technology can be taken toMars. Mr Trump has alreadysaidUS astronauts will plant the stars and stripes on Mars.The1992 UN principlesrelevant to the use of nuclear power sources in outer space provide a framework for safety and risk reduction, but not a regulator. The nation that works out how to achieve reliable off-world energy systems could determine the balance of industrial and digital power for the next century.The drive to leave Earth is often characterised as humans’ need for discovery and exploration. But there may be something more pressing: humanity is using up natural resources1.7 times fasterthan our planet’s biocapacity can regenerate them. There are essentially three ways out: become more efficient by squeezing more GDP per unit of energy; green the production, distribution and consumption of the economy to bring capitalism in line with ecological limits; or move energy-intensive processes off-world.Much ofSilicon Valleyfavours the last techno-optimist option rather than the first two Earth-based approaches. Google wantsdatacentres in orbitpowered by solar energy. Energy and computer arms races have merged in a startling admission that Earth-based datacentres are approaching ecological and political limits. The answer: Google is to put them in the skies. As artificial-intelligence demand and electrification accelerate faster than terrestrial grids can decarbonise, the incentive for off-Earth, continuous solar energy will grow stronger. What begins as pragmatic innovation could end as a new phase of extraction: a search for energy and compute capacity once Earth’s limits have been reached.Red MarsLife may be imitating art. Kim Stanley Robinson’s classicsci-fi Mars trilogyopens in 2026 with humanity’s first colonial voyage to the planet. In its first book, Red Mars shows Earth’s nations and corporations over decades compete to control the new frontier. Robinson’s “Transnats” foreshadow today’s private contractors and state conglomerates. Echoes of the novel’s debates – nuclear versus solar, terraforming versus preservation – can be found in the real space race today. And just as the colonisation of Mars was justified by Earth’s ecological decline, today’s lunar exploration is rationalised by “resource utilisation” – using the moon’s resources to reduce dependence on the home planet. The logic subtly inverts the problem: planetary overshoot becomes a licence to expand it.Red Mars ultimately warns that humanity would export its old politics to new worlds with disastrous results. Before occupying another planet, the novel’s message is that we must first learn to live sustainably on our own. We can escape Earth but, the novel asks, can we escape ourselves? Yet today, space law is being fashioned to allow appropriation under the guise of peaceful, commercial activity. The US’s2015 Space Actpermits the mining of asteroids as if they were open seams of ore. Nasa’s moon rock returns helped the US Congress justify space property rights – opening the door for humanity’s last commons to slide into corporate hands.In the last instalment of Robinson’s trilogy,Blue Mars, by the year 2225 settlers are living in harmony with the world they have made. Humans terraform Mars andbegin, at last, to inhabit it responsibly. One can only hope we understand that far sooner.Explore more on these topicsSpaceOpinionThe moonMarsUnited NationsRussiaChinaElon MuskeditorialsShareReuse this content"

French headline-writers loved calling the world’s most desirable film star by her initials: “BB”, that is:bébé, a bit of weirdly infantilised tabloid pillow-talk. When Brigitte Bardot retired from the movies in the mid-70s, taking up the cause of animal rights and a ban on the import of baby seals, the French press took to calling herBB-phoque, a homophone of the French for “baby seal” with a nasty hint of an Anglo pun. But France’s love affair with Bardot was to curdle, despite her fierce patriotism and admiration for Charles de Gaulle (the feeling was reciprocated). As her animal rights campaigning morphed in the 21st century into an attack on halal meat, and then intoshrill attackson the alleged “Islamicisation” of France, her relations with the modern world curdled even more.View image in fullscreenMaking her debut at Cannes in 1953.Photograph: SIPA/Rex/ShutterstockIn the 1950s, before the sexual revolution, before the New Wave, before feminism, there was Bardot: she was sex, she was youth, and, more to the point, Bardot was modernity. She was the unacknowledged zeitgeist force that stirred cinema’s young lions such as François Truffaut against the old order. Bardot was the country’s most sensational cultural export; she was in effect the French Beatles, a liberated, deliciously shameless screen siren who made male American moviegoers gulp and goggle with desire in that puritan land where sex on screen was still not commonplace, and in which sexiness had to be presented in a demure solvent of comedy. Bardot may not have had the comedy skills of a Marilyn Monroe, but she had ingenuous charm and real charisma, a gentleness and sweetness, largely overlooked in the avalanche of prurience and sexist condescension.Brigitte Bardot – a life in picturesRead moreShe drove a hungry media industry as a supposed man-eater, whose lovers and ex-husbands obligingly brawled over her in the Paris streets in front of press photographers. But Bardot was driven half- or three-quarters mad with the relentless intrusion. She was a public figure whose image was consumed not only through movies but magazine covers, paparazzi shots and gloating press stories. Perhaps onlyJennifer Aniston, in our own time, has endured something similar.View image in fullscreenAnd God Created Woman (1965), Bardot’s breakthrough.Photograph: Vestron/Sportsphoto Ltd/AllstarAfter a number of gamine roles in which her hair was mousy brown, Bardot made her spectacular breakthrough in 1956, at age 22, in a now very genteel-looking Technicolor romantic comedy knowingly titled And God Created Woman. She played a devastatingly desirable blonde, doing the wasp-waisted, derriere-wiggling walk that was the last word in 50s sexiness. Her character attracted the self-destructive obsession of an older man – which became a bit of a trope in Bardot movies – and was desired by younger types, including, in an early role, the sobersided young Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was destined to be Bardot’s lover in real life. It was directed by Bardot’s Svengali-like then husbandRoger Vadim, who controlled her personal and professional life.Bardot did work with serious film-makers. Louis Malle directed her inVie Privée, or Private Life (1961), in which she plays a version of herself, the epicentre of hysterical celebrity and voyeuristic disapproval, with blond Bardot-clones everywhere on the Paris streets, and her character heading for an awful, Princess Diana-type nemesis at the hands of the media. But it was Bardot’s unhappy fate to be patronised by the biggest name of all: Jean-Luc Godard. In Le Mépris, or Contempt (1963), she plays Camille, the beautiful wife of Michel Piccoli’s troubled screenwriter. Bardot’s nakedness is displayed as the very epitome of cinema’s tacky commercialism, but there is something cynical and misogynist in Godard’s approach.A wittier and more playful response to Bardot’s colossal celebrity came from Agnès Varda in her 1965 film Le Bonheur, or Happiness. A carpenter and his wife are thinking of going to see a film starring Bardot and Jeanne Moreau (presumably Louis Malle’s Viva Maria!, for which Bardot got a Bafta nomination). His wife asks him whom he prefers: Bardot or Moreau? Gallantly, he replies that he prefers her to either of the two film stars. Then Varda does a hard cut to his workplace locker – covered in Bardot pictures. Of course he prefers Bardot! Who didn’t?View image in fullscreenPreparing to meet the press in London, 1959.Photograph: Larry BurrowsAs the 60s continued, Bardot did an awful lot of ropey films, although fans have a soft spot forShalako(1968), a somewhat bizarre western she did with Sean Connery, whose hairpiece she reportedly found disconcerting. But then she made her move into political activism, one of the most intensely French moments in the country’s postwar history. While skiing in Meribel in 1965, Bardot was mortified when Charly, a German shepherd belonging to Alain Delon that she was looking after, bit a fellow skier on the leg: the victim was none other than French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, who was entranced by Bardot’s extravagant apologies and the way she slathered ointment on his leg – she turned him into an unlikely political ally. Bardot was, however, teased for her animal campaigns, even before she went full-time with them. Her home in Bazoches, near Paris (now the home of theBrigitte Bardot Foundation), was a place where animals were allowed to wander indoors: six goats, a dozen cats, a rabbit, 20 ducks, a donkey and some sheep. The aroma was distinct.Bardot made some great films. La Vérité, or The Truth (1960), directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a rip-roaring courtroom drama with Bardot’s character in the dock on a charge of murder. If her defence lawyer can prove it wasn’t premeditated, then she can get off on the Frenchcrimepassionnelclause. Flashbacks show her desolate life as a runaway, obsessed with men who had been obsessed with her, semi-homeless, drifting into prostitution. Her character scandalises the court by having read Simone De Beauvoir’s racy novel The Mandarins. (De Beauvoir was a Bardot fan.) It is gripping stuff, with a barnstormingly defiant final speech from Bardot, denouncing the hypocrisy and cruelty of the censorious older generation.View image in fullscreenAnimal lover … Bardot in 2005, with two puppies rescued after being seized by French customs officers.Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/Getty ImagesBut my favourite isEn Cas de Malheur, or In Case of Emergency (1958), a terrific crime melodrama adapted from a Georges Simenon thriller and directed by Claude Autant-Lara. Bardot plays a woman accused of violent robbery who seduces her middle-aged lawyer into fabricating evidence that will acquit her. The lawyer is played by Jean Gabin, and there is a real, crackling chemistry between these two icons of French cinema, old and new. Their scenes together have a real tenderness and wonderful poignancy, especially when Bardot’s character believes herself to be in love with her kindly but cynical older man – a great role for Gabin. “On est heureuse!”she declaims to the heavens: We are happy! Watching Bardot in this film is enough to make you happy.Explore more on these topicsBrigitte BardotAnimal welfareAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, he says, his country feels more empowered than ever beforeSun 28 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareÉanna Hardwicke cannot really remember Saipan. Not Saipan the place, a small Pacific Island 200km north-east of Guam. Nor, thankfully, Saipan the film, in which he stars, and which I’m hoping to discuss with him at length this afternoon. No, he means Saipan the incident, Saipan the event, Saipan the crisis that has baffled and incensed Ireland’s population for a quarter of a century.We are sitting in a pleasantly boxy meeting room deep within the lungs of the NationalTheatre, a space so starkly concrete that the current king of England once described it as a clever way of building a nuclear power plant in the middle of London without anyone objecting. Hardwicke himself sports the quiet, thoughtful presence of a literature student, at times speaking like a particularly articulate MA who’s popped round to deliver a treatise on some dramatic works he just happens to be starring in. He’s here rehearsing a play that forms another contentious landmark in Ireland’s cultural history, but we’ll get to that once we move past the summer he turned five.“I remember colours and shapes,” he says of June 2002, “sticker books and jerseys, Roberto Carlos taking a free kick.” That, and one other recollection. “I have a vivid memory of someone from Cork coaxing me to say a certain thing aboutRoy Keane,” he says. “She said: ‘He’s a disgrace to his country!’ and it’s only come back to me now, since I’ve done the film. I didn’t understand what she was talking about, only that people were incensed.”View image in fullscreenTaking the Mick … Steve Coogan as McCarthy and Éanna Hardwicke in Saipan.Photograph: Aidan MonaghanThe cause of this fissure was that Ireland’s football squad, having qualified for just the third World Cup in their history, took off for a pre-tournament trip to a sunny island none of them had heard of. Within days, a massive fallout between captain Keane and managerMick McCarthy(played in the film, with weary brio, by Steve Coogan) caused the former to exit the squad with a notorious rant that culminated in the line “you can stick it up your bollocks”. To say this prompted grief and horror back home would undersell things a tad. Saipan immediately became the number one story on every Irish news bulletin, uniting the front and back pages of every newspaper and prompting an anguished primetime press conference from football-loving taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who made it known there was a jet, fuelled, ready and waiting, to ferry Keane back to the fold should the fracture be healed. No such healing came to pass, for ever rendering Saipan the one island in the Northern Marianas archipelago that every Irish person still knows by name to this day.Having been 17 when Saipan occurred, I tell him I felt vaguely retraumatised by the film, not least the strong yearning it gave me for everything to have happened differently. “Well,” he says, amused, “when we screened it in Cork and Belfast, the biggest reaction we had was that feeling: of willing the end not to happen.”Hardwicke doesn’t know if either Keane or McCarthy has seen the film – “I believe both have been offered a chance to watch it, but no idea if they have” – but is aware of how live an issue it remains, 23 years later. He doesn’t, it must be said, look much like Keane, a man Alan Bennett once described as having the face of a mercenary. (“Meet him before the walls of 15th-century Florence” Bennett wrote in a 2005 diary entry, “and one’s heart would sink”.) Beyond his Ireland team garb, and a subtle widow’s peak shaved into his hairline, everything that makes Hardwicke’s scorching, seething performance so ... Keane is internal.For the first two months of drama school I felt it wasn’t right. I had this idea that acting was a bit bullshitty, not a real job“If there’s one thing I needed to carry in,” he says, of playing such an intense figure, “it’s this feeling that you never change or adapt yourself to the environment or its energy. You’re always Roy. I think that’s a brilliant quality in anyone who has it. I certainly don’t. I’ll blow with any wind, depending on who I’m with.”Even now, Keane’s supporters will stress he had a point in objecting to world-class athletes training in blazing heat on laughably hard pitches, during sessions where no sunscreen, or even footballs, were provided. McCarthyites might reply that none of that justifies briefing against the team to the press, or calling into question the national allegiance of McCarthy who – in common with Coogan, and more than half of Keane’s own squadmates – is an English-born man of Irish heritage.“I definitely come from a family where Keane looms large,” Hardwicke says, when I ask where he fell within this national schism. “In Cork, he’s a massive figure, from a city just small enough that those people can shape its identity. I was a huge fan of his, so I probably agreed with him, that it’s all about striving for the best and self-actualising that. In some ways, doing the film only made that sense stronger.”Saipan – which its star is at pains to tell me is “not a biopic” – nevertheless treads this line with a tact I hadn’t expected. Hardwicke’s Keane is compelling and persuasive in pursuit of excellence, but also cold and contemptuous around his colleagues. Coogan’s McCarthy, on the other hand, has the bluff and bluster Keane’s camp has long accused him of, but also a deep well of warmth and decency which his own supporters have always emphasised.“What I love about the story,” Hardwicke says, “is it never feels like it’s asking which ideology do you subscribe to? Mick clearly has such a love of the game and a sense that, when you play sport, you’re sharing that with your country. What comes across in the film, and from Steve’s performance, is the great pathos of that. Personally, I feel closer to that at this stage of my life; that it isn’t about winning, that it’s about something harder to put your finger on than winning.”Hardwicke’s own life saw him catch the acting bug young, encouraged by his mum to actively pursue drama as a career – “She told me to throw the kitchen sink at it” – an inducement that may have carried more weight than your typical supportive parent, given her lifelong job as a career-guidance counsellor. Not that he didn’t harbour any doubts. “For the first two months of drama school I felt like it wasn’t right,” he says. “I think I had this idea that acting was a bit bullshitty or something, like not a real job, and not a very noble job.“For some reason, my antidote to that was I should have gone to university and studied classics,” he tells me, becoming perhaps the first person in history to consider that a stable and secure career path. Thankfully, Plan A appears to be delivering the goods. Prior to Saipan, most may recognise Hardwicke as Connell’s troubled pal Rob in Normal People, or his terrifying turn as murderer Ben Fields in true-crime drama The Sixth Commandment, for which he won a Royal Television Society Award in 2024.It’s hard to know what it would take now to get people jumping out of their seats and shouting, storming the stageNow, he’s at the National Theatre in Catriona McLaughlin’s new run of John Millington Synge’s 1907 masterwork, The Playboy of the Western World. Hardwicke plays Christy Mahon, the charismatic stranger who enters a rural Mayo tavern and tells its patrons he’s just killed his father. For this, he is initially celebrated, impressing the men with his storytelling and earning amorous attention from the womenfolk, before his story unravels and all must contend with his deceptions, and the messiness of real-life violence intruding on fanciful tales of the same.“It’s hard to know what it would take now to get people jumping out of their seats and shouting, storming the stage,” Hardwicke says. “What would do that these days?” He’s referring to the notorious rioting that accompanied Playboys’s original run in the Abbey theatre in Dublin, where it was brigaded from within by angry audience members, and from without by hundreds more who’d never seen the production. Some considered its depiction of drinking and lasciviousness an insult to moral decency. Others decreed it nothing less than a crime against Ireland herself; an English-language account – by a Protestant, no less – showcasing Irish peasants as simplistic, violent fools. Even now, with its reputation much rehabilitated, Hardwicke feels some misconceptions persist.“I think some people have a sense of the play’s language as hokey,” says Hardwicke, a notion he rejects. “This play takes place in the west of Ireland,” he says. “There was so much music and wildness and laughter, and one of the things I love about Catriona’s perspective on it is that in the darkest reaches of the country, going into public spaces around a fire and having a really good time is essential to life. The pub gets a bad press sometimes, but these were places where you could tell stories as a way of lifting yourselves out of the doldrums and transport yourself to a different place. I think that’s what the characters in the story are doing for each other.”Never scared of tying a clumsy ribbon around things, I ask him whether he sees any connection between public rejection of Synge’s most famous work, and the rending of garments over Keane’s departure 95 years later.“I do think there’s something there,” he says. “Something about people riding high that we begrudge. But there is a funny thing right now, where it does feel like Irish artists have a sense of themselves on that global stage.” He points to the festival-conquering Fontaines DC and CMAT, the wave of “phenomenal novelists working today”, or his Playboy co-star Nicola Coughlan: “People doing incredible work at huge moments in their careers, and choosing to use that platform for things they passionately believe.”‘We’ve got to release the dead hand of the past’: how Ireland created the world’s best alternative music sceneRead moreHardwicke wonders if this flowering has something to do with Ireland having a “more unified voice” than in other parts of the world. “You see that politically with Gaza over the past two years, and the way that people of Ireland are united across lots of different divides by our solidarity there,” he says. “I don’t want to try any clumsy parallels but there’s something I’m very inspired by in terms of the art that comes out of the country now. Its outward looking, it’s not apologising.”Has Ireland, then, moved past tearing down its greatest exports for saying the unsayable, or hectoring them for doing the country down?“I think now,” Hardwicke says, “there’s a sense of Irish people taking stage in the world and not playing down their culture. Maybe that has something to do with the fact we come from an island that’s been colonised and denied its own language and culture for many centuries, so now there’s a sense of: fuck it. We’re emboldened now. We’re empowered.”Saipan is inIrish cinemas from New Year’s Day andUK cinemas23 January; The Playboy of the Western World is at the National Theatre: Lyttelton, London, to 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmTheatreRoy KeaneMick McCarthyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The crudely animated Canadiandocumentary, directed by two half-brothers occupying separate worlds between Toronto and Shamattawa First Nation, lives in and finds its voice in the ellipses between typical narrative beats. A fart, a toilet flush, mumbling asides and the squabble of children sharing the same room as Seth Scriver (who is white) he interviews his Indigenous brother Pete are among the overlooked moments that are usually left on a cutting-room floor. But they resonate in Endless Cookie, like life refusing to be silenced in a surrealist self-portraiture that delights in colouring outside the lines. Institutional violence and neglect, intergenerational trauma and over-policing in Indigenous communities are all visible, but often kept at bay. Endless Cookie instead finds its strength and joys in the ebb and flow of community, the humour of its digressions and the dreams these characters latch on to and empower amid the harsh realities surrounding them. These are the things we often miss; the reasons to seek out Endless Cookie.Radheyan SimonpillaiThe Unholy TrinityThe Unholy Trinity review – Samuel L Jackson and Pierce Brosnan shine in bubbling potboiler of a westernRead moreYou may not know this unless you’re a hardcore fan of a particular actor, or ride-or-die for the genre overall, but the streaming era seems to have brought out a strange Hollywood side rustle: making low-budget, old-fashioned westerns with ageing stars, primarily intended to mosey from streamer to streamer after a brief theatrical run (if any at all). You may not be surprised to learn thatNicolas Cagehas made about three of these, to little attention or acclaim. Even for a non-aficionado like me, there is something appealing about checking out an under-hyped oater featuring big-name but past-peak stars, especially if you can catch those wide-open vistas and gloriously grizzled faces on a big screen. That’s exactly what I did withThe Unholy Trinity, a pulpily satisfying western thriller starring Pierce Brosnan and Samuel L Jackson. Neither of them are the nominal lead; that’s a young actor by the comically on-the-nose name of Brandon Lessard, who plays a young man out to avenge the hanging death of his father. He encounters a well-intentioned sheriff (Brosnan), his dad’s less-well-intentioned former associate (Jackson), and a tough Blackfoot woman (Q’orianka Kilcher, from The New World) along the way. The story’s various twists and shootouts give the cast plenty of red meat; Jackson seems particularly excited to play his part as if relishing a part in a third, lost Quentin Tarantino western. The director, Richard Gray, has improved since making the less-accomplished Murder at Yellowstone City a few years earlier, shooting cleanly exciting action and wringing proper tension from quieter scenes, and getting it all done in about 90 minutes – perhaps assisted by editor Lee Smith, who has worked closely with Christopher Nolan, Peter Weir and Sam Mendes. The Unholy Trinity isn’t a great movie by any measure – except the measure of how satisfied I was by my afternoon at the multiplex, where it outshone any number of higher-profile offerings.Jesse HassengerThe Wedding BanquetFollowing up 2022’s raunchyFire Islandwith this openhearted feature, director Andrew Ahn has quietly been making a name for himself with emotionally complex, fantastically witty, and relationally layered queer romcoms. A remake of the 1993Ang Leefilm of the same name,The Wedding Banquetfollows the intersecting lives of two couples – one gay and one lesbian – cohabitating together in a Seattle home. When Korean immigrant Min’s “tiger mom”-esque grandmother – head of the family business – declares that Min must return to Korea and prove his scion mettle, the problem is resolved by having Min propose to his housemate Angela. But when Min’s grandmother arrives in the US for the wedding festivities, things quickly unravel, as Min and Angela make very unbelievable heterosexuals, and everyone has to come to terms with the realities of queer family. As with Fire Island, Ahn is working on many different levels, including class, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, deftly handling the complex inter-relationships that occur when trying to manage multiple different, intersecting conceptions of family. The Wedding Banquet is full of so many honestly won moments of tearful emotion, and it’s studded with outstanding performances by its chemistry-laden ensemble cast and plenty of in-group gags that are validating treats to its core audiences, all the while demonstrating with authenticity and sincerity the way that queer relationships continue to evolve and find spaces in this world. Maybe in a less heteronormative world it would have gotten 10 times the viewership it managed this year.Veronica EspositoHomeboundThisMartin-Scorsese-produced Bollywood drama has a Big Movie sheen but is quite approachable, beginning with two childhood best friends in a rural north Indian town eagerly anticipating the results of their police academy exams. Director Neeraj Ghaywan (who made his debut with the 2015 critically acclaimedMasaan) confidently and sweetly embeds a deep male friendship within the muddy waters of caste and religion in India; Chandan Kumar (Vishal Jethwa) is a Dalit, what used to be called the “untouchable” caste, and Mohammed Shoaib Ali (Ishaan Khatter) is Muslim. It’s not a perfect movie, but it’s powerful: without flinching,Homeboundpoints directly at the unrelenting cancer of casteism and Islamophobia. You see how the system feigns support for marginalized communities and what new and blistering damage reverberates from such posturing – and still Chandan and Mohammed brim with joy, love their home, tease each other, sit by the water and talk in earnest about how their fidelity and efforts might propel them and their families forward. And then somewhere in the latter half of the movie, in the world’s most populated country, the pandemic hits, and you might start to cry.Tammy TarngGrand Theft HamletAKA the PlayStation’s the thing. I was hooked as soon as I heard aboutGrand Theft Hamlet, a documentary and attempt by two friends to stage Shakespeare’s most famous tragedy inside the digital world of Grand Theft Auto Online with the avatars they met there, during the Covid lockdown. It’s a virtual premise, with a real-world basis. Our Player Kings are two actor friends, out of work for as long as the theatres stayed closed. Grand Theft Hamlet is often profoundly moving, digging right into the heart of our pandemic isolation and the consolations offered by poetry, friendship and the time-honoured cinematic joy of putting-on-the-show-right-here. But it is also hilarious, with bizarrely augmented but emotionally honest avatars gamely getting to grips with the iambic pentameter in unlikely locations around Los Santos. Not to mention the fact that both soliloquies and heart-to-heart chats between cast members are liable to be disrupted by a passing player seeking their own kind of catharsis with a spray of pixelated bullets.Pamela HutchinsonA Little PrayerThe 50 best movies of 2025 in the USRead moreIt’s easy to pick the types of films they just don’t make any more – the legal thriller, the studio comedy, the A-lister romcom – but it’s often harder to pick the ones they might make but no one gets to see. A film such as A Little Prayer, a quiet yet emotionally stirring indie populated by that-one-from-that-thing actors, would have definitely made more of an impact had it premiered at Sundance in the 2000s. It was, after all, the same decade that saw the film’s writer-director Angus MacLachlan score a minor hit with his screenplay forJunebug, a similarly pitched charmer that scored an Oscar nod for then little-known Amy Adams. But this time, the film was unveiled in January 2023 and didn’t even get released until August 2025, its rollout so quiet then no one even knew it existed (it was dropped by one bigger distributor before landing at a considerably smaller one). It’s a great shame, as it’s one of the films I’ve thought about the most this year, a delicately told yet absolutely captivating family drama offering a rare lead for a wonderfully understatedDavid Strathairnas a man questioning his worth as a father when he finds his son has been cheating on his wife, played by a revelatory Jane Levy. It’s about a specifically interesting relationship, between a parent and daughter-in-law, that we just don’t get to see. Their final scene together, an open-hearted and piercingly tender conversation on a bench, wrecked me like no other final scene this year.Benjamin LeeEbony & IvoryHand up, I have never seenThe Greasy StranglerorAn Evening with Beverly LuffLinn, the pair of films that made the name of lo-fi Brit surrealist Jim Hosking. But when I saw his new one was apparently a new entry in the Paul McCartney cinematic universe, I thought I would give it a whirl. I’m glad I did because I can report it’s probably the weirdest film I’ve ever seen – notEraserheadweird, but weird in the sense you can’t believe someone had the conviction and self-belief to get this stuff on film. Here’s what happens: a blind Black musician called Stevie turns up in a rowing boat at the island cottage of a white, mulleted, thumbs-up character called Paul (who is forever promoting a range of vegetarian meals branded “By the Wife”); the title clues you in to who they might be and what they might be doing together. Needless to say, nothing gets done, apart from dressing up as sheep and jumping into the sea. The repetitive, inane dialogue might drive you insane, but it has something of Waiting for Godot about it. This film is a genuine, unrepeatable one-off, worth seeing for its sheer bloodymindedness alone.Andrew PulverGriffin in SummerThe coming-out genre is rife with cliche, so many stories playing out in exactly the expected way. Writer-director Nicholas Colia alters that hoary structure by placing the narrative of his film somewhere in the margins of self-realization. Fourteen-year-old Griffin (the remarkable Everett Blunck) isn’t quite in the closet, but he’s not out of it either. He is, in all the wonderful complexity of a real person, simply himself, a theater-obsessed type-A achiever who is hurrying to grow up so that he can realize his artistic dreams. A great distraction from that mission comes in the form of an older guy, played with soft-spoken allure by Owen Teague, on whom young Griffin develops his first massive crush. Colia’s film is a sweet, aching assessment of that seismic life event, gently prodding Griffin toward the rest of his life without rushing him. If only more films about queer youth were made with such specific delicacy and insight.Richard LawsonLove, BrooklynLove, Brooklyn wasn’t in theaters long, about six weeks in fall altogether, and recouped less than a fifth of its $255,000 budget – more of an indictment of the film business than the quality of the product. It’s a throwback to the airy, lyrical daydreams that Hollywood used to churn out all the time back when films were something to discover in the middle of the day, at a video rental shop or on premium cable totally at random. It follows Roger (Moonlight’s André Holland) as he struggles with his feelings for love interest Nicole (a saturnine DeWanda Wise) and gal-pal Casey (a capricious Nicole Beharie) in between the stress of a looming magazine deadline. Come for director Rachael Holder’s lush, Spike Lee-coded shots of Brooklyn in full splendor, stay for the rare film opportunity to see Black people just be (young, vibrant, striving, whimsical) asRoy Wood Jr(Roger’s clumsy sounding board, Alan) gets These Jokes off.Andrew LawrenceEephusThere have been an abundance of finebaseball movies– it probably has the edge on any other sport – but Carson Lund’s debut feature immediately joinsBull Durhamat the top and for similar reasons. Both have a special appreciation for the game when it’s played at the sub-pro level, when the stakes are lower. The quirks are higher and there’s more attention paid to offbeat comedy and the easy, laconic rhythm between pitches. Set on the last game at a decrepit, soon-to-be-demolished stadium in small-town Massachusetts in the 1990s, Eephus is about middle-aged rivals squaring off for the last time, which is to say that it is ultimately a film about death and a spirited effort to stave it off for a while. (When the sun goes down, the men illuminate the field with car headlights.) But it’s also hugely entertaining and full of fun details, like the need to root through the nearly woods for foul balls because the guys don’t have enough in stock.Scott TobiasSongs from the Hole‘Death always feels imminent’: a moving Netflix documentary on prison, music and forgivenessRead moreIn my years as a critic, I have watched many, many commendable films on the US carceral system – some, likeSing Sing, arescripted explorationsof efforts to reclaim dignity in prison. Others, like Oscar-tippedThe Alabama Solution, are searing, undeniable portraits of an inhumane system. But nothing has quite bridged the gap, or been as startlingly memorable, asSongs from the Hole, a collaboration between director Contessa Gayles and musician James “JJ’88” Jacobs, given a double life sentence at age 15 for shooting a fellow teenager. The underappreciated Netflix documentary is unlike anything else I have seen – part narrative visual album, based on the lyrics and video treatments written by JJ’88 during solitary confinement (the reason for such torture, as usual, is beyond galling), and part nonfiction meditation on the situational nature of criminality and the work of forgiveness. A pivotal late scene, involving JJ’88 and his brother’s killer, left my jaw on the floor, both at mankind’s capacity for compassion despite everything, and the prison system’s complete lack of interest in it. Above all, it’s a portrait of vulnerable, resilient, honest, hard-won hope. After this wretched year, we all could use some.Adrian HortonExplore more on these topicsFilm2025 in cultureSamuel L JacksonPierce BrosnanComedy filmsWesternsComedyRomance filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From the ascent of the young, Grammy-nominated bandsTurnstileandKnocked Looseto the comeback ofDeftonesand their fresh grip on gen Z, as well as the growth of the UK festival Outbreak, heavy guitar music is enjoying a renaissance. After releasing their debut album, Faded Intentions, in November, False Reality might seem like a new name to watch in this world – but they have deep roots.Vocalist Rachel Rigby started out as a teenage gig promoter in Essex and London before putting on festivals in her early 20s. After a decade of witnessing a chronic lack of female representation among the countless bands she saw live, she decided to give fronting her own a shot. “I felt that it was important to send a message,” she says. “I’ve made most of my friends through hardcore; the only thing I hadn’t done was be in a band.” Her voice is a ripper: raw and upfront in the album mix, it makes the tracks feel as close to live as possible.Guitarist Dave Connolly, the oldest member, earned his stripes in crews like Ironed Out, 50 Caliber and Bun Dem Out. They all orbit Rucktion Records, a London label that started in the late 1990s, aiming to form a comparative scene to that of New York City. London bands such as Knuckledust became local versions of New Yorkers like Madball; all in, the musical equivalent of a roundhouse kick to the head.Drummer Louis Dale credits the Rucktion universe as his teenage entry point into the sound. “The physicality and precision of the music blew my face off, and there was also, frankly, a level of violence that I just was really interested in,” he says. “It’s dangerous and exciting.” Meanwhile, the true love of bassist Joe Cornwell, who fizzes with the energy of a kid who never grew up, is melodic metalcore by bands such as Poison the Well.As a DIY sound that thrives off hungry newcomers, hardcore, in principle, doesn’t tend to over-prioritise legacy. But the cumulative effect of False Reality’s previous bands and their years being steeped in the sound gives Faded Intentions a real edge. After playing and moshing at thousands of shows between them, the four of them have an ear for what makes a track rip through a room with maximum impact, and a learned musicality that goes beyond the classic three-chords and beatdown formula of some of the tougher music they grew up on.‘Pepper-spraying a 15 year old is cowardly’: Turnstile on hostile cops, playing through pain and taking hardcore punk globalRead moreFaded Intentions is full of playful, dynamic shifts. For metalheads, there are thrash guitar solos reminiscent of early Metallica, Slayer and Arcangel, and for hardcore lifers, there are plenty of two-step parts. The music’s toughness is charged by Rigby’s ferocity. On Cost of Spite, her lyrics tear through the noise: “Suffer, set it off, trapped in unequal life.” She says it’s about “feeling anger when your hard work and passions are boiled down to your gender, skin colour or sexuality, but then breaking from that, not diluting yourself to make others comfortable.”The most distinctive, surprising element of their music is how they bring shoegaze into the mix. Shoegaze can be crushingly loud, of course, but it’s not necessarily heavy. On tracks such as Sonder, they flood the beatdowns with distortion and melodic vocal chains. “We love that Deftones sound and worked it into our world,” says Dale. “Having an interlude is one thing, but turning shoegaze into a False Reality song is another. We want to subvert expectations of what a hardcore band should be doing. We wanted to come out with something unexpected on our debut album – and we’re proud of it.”Explore more on these topicsMusicNew music for 2026Pop and rockMetalinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Bardot was briefly hospitalised in October for what her office called a “minor” procedure.1:07French icon Brigitte Bardot dies aged 91 – video reportThe town hall in Saint-Tropez, where Bardot had holidayed as a child and where she later shot the film And God Created Woman, said the actor had “helped make Saint-Tropez shine across the world”.The town said Bardot was its “most radiant ambassador” and part of “the collective memory of Saint-Tropez, which we must preserve”.Bardot shot to international fame in 1956 with And God Created Woman, written and directed by her then husband, Roger Vadim, and for the next two decades was said to have embodied the idea of the archetypal “sex kitten”. In the early 1970s, however, she announced her retirement from acting and became an outspoken campaigner on animal rights, and increasingly active politically on the far right.Bardot’s incendiary comments about ethnic minorities, immigration, Islam and homosexuality resulted in a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred. French courts fined her six times between 1997 and 2008 for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community. In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 (£13,000) for describing Muslims as “this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts”.Jordan Bardella, the president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party (RN), which Bardot supported, wrote: “Brigitte Bardot was a woman of heart, conviction and character. An ardent patriot, devoted to animals that she protected throughout her life, she embodied a whole French era, but also above all a certain idea of courage and freedom.”View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in 2007.Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty ImagesLe Pen, whom Bardot once described as “the Joan of Arc of the 21st century”, wrote on social media that Bardot was “exceptional for her talent, courage, frankness and beauty”. “She was incredibly French,” she said. “Free, indomitable, whole. She will be hugely missed.”Such was Bardot’s role in the far right’s cultural pantheon that tributes were also paid to her from Italy’s government, where the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, called her “a timeless star, but above all a woman who was free, nonconformist, protagonist of courageous battles in defence of our traditions”.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in 1958.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/AllstarThe Italian culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, said: “Brigitte Bardot was not only one of the great protagonists of world cinema, but also an extraordinary interpreter of western fundamental freedoms.” He said she “resolutely defended her vision of cultural and social values and civic engagement”.Brigitte Bardot – a life in picturesRead moreBorn in 1934 in Paris, Bardot grew up in a prosperous, traditional Catholic family but excelled enough as a dancer to be allowed to study ballet, gaining a place at the prestigious Conservatoire de Paris. At the same time she found work as a model, appearing on the cover of Elle in 1950 while still 15. As a result of her modelling work, she was offered film roles; at one audition she met Vadim, whom she would marry in 1952, after she turned 18. Bardot was cast in small roles, with increasing prominence, playing Dirk Bogarde’s love interest in Doctor at Sea, a big hit in the UK in 1955.But it was Vadim’s And God Created Woman, in which Bardot played an uninhibited teenager in Saint-Tropez, that consolidated her image and turned her into an international icon. The film was a huge hit in France, as well as internationally, and catapulted Bardot into the front rank of French screen performers.As well as for cinema audiences, Bardot swiftly became aninspiration for intellectuals and artists; not least the young John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who demanded their then girlfriends dye their hair blond in imitation of her. The columnist Raymond Cartier wrote a lengthy article about“le cas Bardot”in Paris-Match in 1958, while Simone de Beauvoir published her famous essay Brigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome in 1959, framing the actor as France’s most liberated woman. In 1969, Bardot was chosen as the first real-life model for Marianne, the symbol of the French republic.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in The Bride is Much Too Beautiful from 1956.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesIn the early 1960s, Bardot appeared in a string of high-profile French films, including Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Oscar-nominated drama The Truth, Louis Malle’s Very Private Affair (opposite Marcello Mastroianni) and Jean-Luc Godard’s Contempt. In the second half of the decade, Bardot took up a number of Hollywood offers: these included Viva Maria!, a Mexican-set period comedy with Jeanne Moreau, and Shalako, a western with Sean Connery.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot in Doctor At Sea from 1955.Photograph: John Springer Collection/Corbis/Getty ImagesBardot also had a parallel music career, which included recording the original version of Serge Gainsbourg’s Je T’Aime … Moi Non Plus,which Gainsbourg had written for herwhile they were having an extramarital affair. (Afraid of scandal after her then husband, Gunter Sachs, found out, Bardot asked Gainsbourg not to release it. He went on to re-record it with Jane Birkin, to huge commercial success.)Bardot found the pressure of stardom increasingly irksome,telling the Guardian in 1996: “The madness which surrounded me always seemed unreal. I was never really prepared for the life of a star.” She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, after making the historical romance The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot. Her primary focus became animal welfare activism,joining protests against seal hunts in 1977and establishing the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in 1986.Bardot subsequently sent letters of protest to world leaders over issues such as dog extermination in Romania, dolphin killing in the Faroe Islands andcat slaughter in Australia. She also regularly aired outspoken views on religious animal slaughter. In her 2003 bookA Cry in the Silenceshe espoused rightwing politics and took aim at gay men and lesbians, schoolteachers and the so-called “Islamisation of French society”, resulting in a conviction for inciting racial hatred.View image in fullscreenBrigitte Bardot  in 1958.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveBardot was married four times: to Vadim between 1952 and 1957; Jacques Charrier between 1959 and 1962, with whom she had a son, Nicolas, in 1960; Sachs from 1966-69; and to the former Le Pen adviser Bernard d’Ormale, whom she married in 1992. She also embarked on a number of high-profile relationships, including with Jean-Louis Trintignant and Gainsbourg.View image in fullscreenBardot outside court in Edinburgh in 1998 celebrating a reprieve for Woofie the dog, who was due to be put down for chasing a postal worker.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsBrigitte BardotFranceEuropeJean-Luc GodardWorld cinemaSerge GainsbourgAnimal welfarenewsShareReuse this content"

For some audiences, that’s quite an interesting gateway.”Asked if she considered streaming services such as Netflix as a direct competitor to theatre, Dawson said: “There’s a competition for people’s time and people’s money.“People are really excited by going to the theatre and coming out but it’s good for organisations to take a moment to think ‘Are we doing things that are interesting to our community? How do we fit in this space, both locally, regionally and nationally?’.”Dawson said audiences were less predictable than they used to be and larger commercial theatres had realised that a starry lead in a play could help them predict the demand for the show.However, she added: “The important thing is that they’re good productions, it’s about talent rather than getting to a point where it’s just a celebrity badge.”Another advantage was big stars’ attraction to theatre, with many seeking credibility, which again helped against “digital competitors”, Dawson said.Theatre was dealing with the “long tail” of Covid, Brexit and austerity, while also battling with cost of living, she said.But Dawson argued in support of increasing public subsidy for the theatre and arts, despite the headwinds faced by the UK government. She said Arts Council England grants had been at a standstill since about 2012, which in real terms equates to a near 50% cut.“The government is clearly having to make lots of decisions where they find public funds and there are absolutely vital parts of our society which needs investment, life and death parts, about dignity and care.“But I think, interestingly, the arts is a really important part of that picture. They can, if they’re properly resourced, add so much value.”Theatres were not political organisations but there was an expectation for them to reflect their values through their output, on the stage, Dawson said.“It’s about universal stories with themes that are relevant, that are important, and might make you think differently, might make you question something that you’d always thought and we want to get as many people through the door to come and see that.”Despite the challenges, Dawson is optimistic about the industry. “The arts in general and theatre is incredibly resilient. They are creative for a living, and they respond very well to challenging circumstances, and sometimes it generates really interesting new ideas. There’s room for creative risk that establishes Bristol Old Vic for the future.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreBristolnewsShareReuse this content"

His novels, most of them composed in a week or two, are simple, straightforward, shallow-seeming even, but below the surface lie dark and fathomless depths.Many readers will know him as the creator of Commissioner Jules Maigret of the Paris Police Judiciaire, the most unpretentious, humane and convincing of the great fictional detectives. However, his finest work is to be found in what he called hisromans durs, or hard novels, including such masterpieces as Dirty Snow, Monsieur Monde Vanishes and the jauntily horrifying The Man Who Watched the Trains Go By. Now, Penguin Classics has launched a series of 20 of theromans dursin new translations, starting with The Cat, originally published in French in 1967.The plot focuses on a Parisian couple, the retired builder Émile Bouin and his wife, Marguerite. Both were widowed, and remarried in their 60s. Theirs is not a match made in heaven. Indeed, they inhabit a domestic hell in a claustrophobic Parisian cul-de-sac, where they spend their days devising means of taunting and tormenting each other in a battle of wills that can only end in tragedy. They are no longer on speaking terms, and only communicate, if that is the word, by exchanging the briefest of notes.The cat of the title was a stray that Émile rescued from a building site. The creature afforded him a little warmth and companionship in the melancholy of his days, until Marguerite poisoned it, or so he is convinced. In response, he mutilated Marguerite’s pet parrot so badly that it died. Now the bird, stuffed and mounted in its cage, presides over their living room, a standing rebuke to Émile, and a grotesque assertion of his wife’s unrelenting animosity and vengefulness.The couple spend their days devising means of tormenting each other in a battle of wills that can only end in tragedyWe first meet them seated by the fire of an evening. Émile writes a couple of words into a notebook he keeps for the purpose, and tears out the page. “He rolled the paper between his thumb and index finger. He curled back his thumb and released it rapidly, flicking the message into Marguerite’s lap. He never missed his target, as it were, inwardly jubilant each time.” Marguerite pretends not to notice, but in the end she opens the note and reads the message:The cat. In retaliation, “she answered him wordlessly:The parrot”.Their predicament is hideous and hideously comic, yet the tale overall is deeply sad, and becomes increasingly so as it progresses. Much of the sadness is generated out of remembrances of things and times past. Émile’s first wife, Angèle, was a jolly farm girl with red hands and a raucous sense of humour. Also she loved to make love: “I don’t know who invented this thing, but whoever it was deserves a statue.” Then one day on the Boulevard Saint-Michel she was run down by a bus, and lived on, disabled, for two painful years before dying.Marguerite is made of steelier stuff than her predecessor. She comes from a wealthy middle-class family – her father built and owned all the houses in the cul-de-sac where she and Émile live – and her late husband played first violin in the orchestra of the Paris Opera. She despises Émile for his working-class origins, and besides, her passions all are spent, except her passion for revenge. They married in their 60s, and even at the start, when they were still speaking, “they were awkward with each other, more inhibited than very young lovers”.Inevitably, Émile seeks solace elsewhere – though the idyll cannot last. When he returns to his old life in the cul-de-sac, relations between the couple are more vindictive than ever. And yet The Cat, for all its bleakness, is, in a strange, Simenonian fashion, a  kind of love story. Only an artist of genius could have wrought pathos out of the ghastly plight of Émile and Marguerite, lost souls clinging to the raft of their mutual dependence.The Cat by Georges Simenon, translated by Ros Schwartz, is published by Penguin Classics (12.99).

From BTS conquering global charts to Parasitesweeping the Oscarsin 2020 and Korean dramastopping Netflix, Korean popular culture has never been more visible. Exports driven by the country’s artshit a record$15.18bn (£11bn) in 2024, cementing the country’s reputation as a cultural superpower.But inside South Korea, the two industries that helped build the Korean Wave – cinema andK-pop– are now experiencing fundamental transformations, with their survival strategies potentially undermining the creative foundations of their success.The decline in cinema is the most dramatic. Admissions – for Korean and international films –have fallen45% since 2019, from about 226 million to 123 million, while box office revenue has dropped from $1.3bn to $812m.With investment slowing sharply, Korean distributors that once released more than 40 locally produced films a year are expected to put out about only 20 in 2025, and warn that 2026 could be “even more serious” as the pandemic-era backlogruns outand new productions are not coming fast enough.Kim Han-min, director of the Yi Sun-sin trilogy, delivered the bluntest warning when hetold lawmakerslast year that the sector had “almost collapsed”.View image in fullscreenA scene from Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar award-winning film Parasite.Photograph: BFA/AlamyJason Bechervaise, a professor of Korean film at Hanyang University, sees not a short-term slump but a structural weakening. “Years of tightening margins and rising costs have thinned out the mid-budget productions where new directors once developed and established film-makers experimented,” he says. “Much of the talent pipeline is now moving toward streaming platforms, where investment is steadier and production schedules more predictable.”Korean cinema in ‘precarious period’ due to Netflix, says Jang Joon-hwanRead moreThe theatrical “holdback window” – the period between a cinema release and a film’s arrival on streaming – has also shortened to just a few weeks for many titles, leaving audiences with little reason to buy a ticket. The strain has already triggered historic consolidation, with the operators of the Lotte Cinema and Megabox chainsplanning to mergetheir 1,682 screens.Cinemas areinvesting heavilyin premium formats such as Imax and Dolby, but without a reliable flow of domestic films, industry insiders say such upgrades cannot deliver a sustained recovery.K-pop’s reckoningCinema is not the only pillar under strain. K-pop, long considered one of South Korea’s strongest cultural exports, is also entering a period of uncertainty.Physical albumsales fell19.5% in 2024 – the first decline in a decade – dropping from 115.2m units to 92.7m, with the dropprojectedto continue by the end of 2025. This includes international releases, but few make major inroads into the Korean charts.Yet major agencies have found their salvation elsewhere, with concert revenues now surging past traditional album sales as theypivot to global touring.Areum Jeong, a professor of Korean studies at Arizona State University, says companies have increasingly prioritised their mostdedicated fans. “K-pop companies began catering mainly to the core fandom, and kind of forwent the idea of being widely known to the public,” she says. “When companies cater to the core fandom’s needs, the core fandom will spend and support.”This narrow focus, she argues, has influenced how idols are recruited, trained and marketed, and the superfan-centred model is now being copied by industries outside Korea. Yet questions remain about whether this approach can produce the kind of breakthrough global phenomena that defined K-pop’s golden era, such asBTSor Blackpink.View image in fullscreenBTS performing in Busan, South Korea, in October 2022.Photograph: Bighit Music/EPAMeanwhile, smaller agencies, once vital for experimentation and diversity,have struggledto survive, squeezed by rising production costs and a shrinking share of fan spending.At the same time, the global success of Korean cultural ideas no longer guarantees that Korean companies will be the ones profiting.‘It’s ended up being nothing to no one’: can K-pop overcome crisis?Read moreNetflix’s animated hitKPop Demon Huntersbecame the platform’smost-watched animated film. The film was co-directed by the Korean-Canadian Maggie Kang, and included several Korean/Korean-American voice actors, but was an American production based on Korean aesthetics.Jeong describes it as a “de-territorialised, hybrid idea ofK-pop[rather] than an authentic K-pop product”, suggesting that Korean cultural concepts have become portable enough to be reproduced internationally without Korean participation. Similar groups trained in Korean methods are now emerging in Japan and south-east Asia, creating direct competition.Yet she says audiences still seekreal-world encounterswith Korean culture. After the film’s release,museums,food brandsandcosmetics companiesexperienced renewed interest in items featured onscreen.Bechervaise notes how creative dynamics have shifted. As domestic productions became more formulaic, American studios and Korean-diaspora creators began drawing on Korean cultural elements in works such as Minari, Beef and Demon Hunters. “Korea had beaten Hollywood at its own game,” he says, “but now it’s as though Hollywood’s beating Korea at its own game.”View image in fullscreenThe singing voices of HUNTR/X from KPop Demon Hunters performing onstage in Los Angeles, California, in December.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartRadioThe governmenthas respondedwith a sweeping five-year, 51.4tn won (£26bn) cultural investment plan, aimed at expanding South Korea’s global cultural footprint and strengthening broader cultural industries, from content exports to arts training, tourism and sports.President Lee Jae Myung has also appointed the JYP Entertainment founder and K-pop mogul Park Jin-young toco-chair a new presidential cultural committeeto promote the spread of Korean pop culture internationally.Major agencies such as HYBE and SM Entertainment are opening new subsidiaries insouth-east Asia,IndiaandChina. But critics say the focus on overseas expansion risks overlooking the infrastructure at home that once powered South Korea’s cultural ascent and eroding the cultural authenticity that originally attracted international audiences.Jeong believes the industries will continue to earn money but warns that financial success alone cannot guarantee creative renewal. “The Korean entertainment industry will continue to profit this way,” she says, “but I think it will be difficult to create something likeKPop Demon Huntersthat has won over so many people worldwide.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaK-popKPop Demon HuntersPop and rockAsia PacificNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were coming all the way from Albany in Western Australia and drove across the Nullarbor to get there – not exactly a “lap of the map”, but still a big trip. We’d packed our bikes, surfboards and our kelpie, Anzac.It was all going beautifully until we got to St Helens in Tasmania. We were looking forward to hitting the bike trails and the beach. But what was meant to be a fun day of mountain biking quickly turned into a stressful, late-night rescue when my husband broke his leg on the trail.Thanks to the incredible local emergency services, he was located, rescued and airlifted to hospital. As I watched him being flown off the mountain by helicopter, relief flooded through me – and then reality hit. I was now solely responsible for the dog, the vehicle and the camper trailer still set up back at the caravan park. Packing up the trailer was a two-person job. Hobart was four hours’ drive from here. My family and friends were 4,000km away in Western Australia. And Anzac needed a walk!The kindness of strangers: a boy picked up my spilled shopping when I was too pregnant to reach the groundRead moreThe next day, new neighbours arrived at the campsite. Exhausted and worried, I managed a small smile as a man named Sam said hello and began setting up with his partner. I wondered what they thought – a solo woman with a dog, no partner in sight, and a camper full of gear.Eventually, Sam’s curiosity got the better of him. He asked a few gentle questions and, after two days of silent stress, the whole story poured out.Sam listened patiently, kindly. He nodded, said little, and returned to his own camp. That evening, he and his wife, Hillary, did something extraordinary. With no fuss and no hesitation, they told me they’d pack everything up for me. “Tasmania has given us a warm hug,” they said. “Now we want to pass that hug on.”They invited me to join them for dinner and a seat at their campfire, sharing their food, their warmth and their company. I hadn’t realised how much I needed that simple kindness. It felt like the first deep breath I’d taken in days.The next morning, true to their word, they arrived ready to help. And what followed was no small task. My husband, still in a hospital bed, talked us through the process over the phone. It was fiddly, complex and physically demanding. Piece by piece, with calm and methodical care, Sam worked it all out, while Hillary offered encouragement, guidance and good humour. It would have taken me days on my own and, even then, I’m not sure I could have done it.But their kindness didn’t stop there. It would take weeks of recovery before my husband’s leg was stabilised enough for us to begin the drive home, with him in the passenger seat the whole way. Sam and Hillary helped me find an Airbnb close to the hospital in Hobart to stay in and made sure I had everything I needed to get through the next part of the journey. They checked in with us along the whole drive home to make sure we got back to WA safely.I will never forget that holiday. Not just because of the accident, or the brilliance of the emergency services, but because of Sam and Hillary. When you’re thousands of kilometres away from family and friends, you realise that all that matters in the end is our relationships with others. Sam and Hillary stepped in when there was no one else around to offer support, steadiness and invaluable practical help. They gave me a warm Tasmanian hug – just when I needed it most.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

In a fever dream perhaps, but also here, in theBlackpoolIlluminations storehouse.Inside this nondescript building, close to Blackpool airport, is where the magic is made.A team of just 35 staff design, build and maintain theLancashiretown’s annual light display, which has endured for almost 150 years.View image in fullscreenNew displays need to be more resilient to strong winds and wintry weather.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIt is where the modern meets the traditional; a huge black cast iron drill dating back to 1937 is still used to construct the illuminations, but it sits alongside a cutting-edge 3D printer.“We don’t buy illuminations at all,” head of illuminations, Richard Williams, said. “We manufacture absolutely everything.”One of the biggest drivers for changes to their manufacturing process in recent years has been climate change. The designers have been forced to adapt the displays so they can withstand stronger winds, while also reducing their own energy output to avoid exacerbating the very problem they are trying to mitigate against.View image in fullscreenA team of 35 maintain the annual light display.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAgainst a wall in the storehouse is one of the most famous “heritage” illuminations, Hickory Dickory Dock, a huge tableau where a mouse runs up and down a grandfather clock. It has been badly damaged by strong winds.Now, rather than being constructed from solid blocks of wood, tableaux are designed in a trellis style, to allow the wind to rush through the gaps.“We’ve had to adapt more of [the manufacturing] now, because with the climate change, the winds have got a lot stronger, a real lot stronger, and we do get things that blow down occasionally,” Williams added.View image in fullscreenThe head of illuminations, Richard Williams.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIf there is a yellow wind warning in place, there will be someone on call to attend to any reports of falling lights; with an amber or red, staff patrol the seafront.While until recently the Illuminations season ran from late summer until early November, during Covid the season was extended until just after Christmas to boost the local economy. This time, it runs until 4 January.Many of the displays are decades old, but they are rebuilt, repurposed and modernised. “We started investing in LED technology back in 1999 and we’ve reduced our power consumption by 85% which is huge,” Williams said.“So it’s paid off for us. Even the last couple of years, because LED technology moves on all the time, we reduced our consumption by 1% each year for the last two years. So it’s still going, [and] really important.”View image in fullscreenOld displays are repurposed to create something new.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“Some [illuminations] are a lot older than me,” Williams said. “It’s really great for parents and grandparents to come back and see things that they remember.” And when an illumination is eventually retired, he said, “we’ll use everything that we can, and redesign it to something”.“Everyone loves the heritage, don’t they?” he added. “And I think there’s room for absolutely everything. So there’s room for new, but also room for traditional. I think that’s quite a challenge, getting that balance just right.”Throughout the season, lights are rotated in and out of the six-mile trail to encourage repeat visits. It means visitors could come two or three times during a season and see a different display each time.In recent years, they have moved to more interactive lights along the seafront; tunnels to walk through, and baubles to pose for a photograph inside.View image in fullscreenThe light display can also be explored by foot.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“That’s one of things we’ve tried to do now, is to get people out of their cars,” Williams said. “Obviously it’s better for them to be walking, but also better for us and the economy, because you might go and buy a cup of coffee and things like that. Because ultimately, that’s what we are, an economic tool.”In 2029, Blackpool Illuminations will mark its 150-year anniversary. “I’ve always said I feel like a custodian, I’m pretty honoured to look after it,” Williams said. “You always like to think you leave it in a better place than where it was, and then hand over to someone else for the next 150 years.”While there are now festive light trails in parks and tourist attractions all over the country, Blackpool is still the original, and, Williams would argue, the best. It is also free of charge – although public donations typically amount to £90,000 per year. “I think we can safely say we’re the capital of light now,” Williams said.And does he think the appeal will endure for the next 150 years? “I think it will, I think there’s always tradition,” he said. “Everyone might not have seen them, but they’ve heard of them.”Explore more on these topicsBlackpoolBlackpool holidaysLancashireUnited Kingdom holidaysUK weatherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not because of the drink, or the fireworks, or the pressure of staying awake past midnight (although that alone should qualify as an endurance sport). Like Valentine’s Day and your birthday, what makes New Year’s Eve perilous is the collective insistence that this night has to deliver: the best meal, the best party, the best version of ourselves. High expectations that will inevitably lead to disappointment, and haven’t we had our fair share of that already?There was one year in the restaurant when we convinced ourselves that the only way to rise to the occasion was a set menu of showstoppers. We thought we had predicted everything, and we assumed (boldly, wrongly) that everyone would choose the chocolate dessert. It made sense: who wouldn’t want chocolate on the most celebratory night of the year? So the tarte tatin went on the menu as a polite alternative, a back-up singer, not the star. Except, of course, everyone wanted the tarte tatin.What followed was a caramel-slicked nightmare. We were making individual tarte tatins to order; the kitchen turned into a quagmire of apple peel and sugar, with bubbling pans of molten sugar, apples wedges threatening to leap out, and warm, buttery pastry sliding around like a mischievous toddler on an ice rink. Caramel burns, panicking chefs, hot trays hitting the pass with a slap. Happy customers, though.Another year, we convinced ourselves to go “high concept” with a surprise menu: mysterious, ambitious, theatrical. We loved the idea so much that we forgot to do the sensible thing: plan, prep and test it properly. The kitchen degenerated so quickly that it felt as if we were trapped inside a live-action cautionary tale, except this time the customers were not happy at all. I was working the floor that night, and even though I knew what things were like in the kitchen, I’d have given anything to have a door between me and the angry mob in the dining room. That was more than a decade ago, but the experience is still too raw and the details too embarrassing to share, even in therapy. Let’s just say that one table was so upset that I offered to order them a pizza. Or sushi. Or whatever they wanted. Anything to make them happy, and anything that did not involve us.After that, we swore (loudly, dramatically) that we were done with New Year’s Eve – and, for a while, we were. One of those quiet years coincided with the first NYE in our current flat. We managed to forget all about it and went to bed early, only to be woken by loud explosions and a glow flashing through the curtains. We sat up and realised we could see fireworks from our bed – proper London fireworks, the big ones, with the city lit up like a giant glitter bomb. It turned out that you can see the fireworks from almost every window in our flat. From the front you get Battersea, Clapham and Brockwell Park – multiple displays at slightly different rhythms, like a pyrotechnic conversation. From the back you get Waterloo and London Bridge, and those enormous coordinated shows that shake the sky. For those, though, you have to stand in the bathtub, which feels ridiculous until the first golden chrysanthemum explodes over the river and suddenly it feels like the most magical place in the world. It’s probably the reason we’ll never move.Such a treasure must be shared, so now we do – when we can bear it. And because we always invite too many people, and because the flat is small and the bathtub not big enough to hold everyone, we stick to the only NYE strategy that actually works: something simple, abundant and forgiving. A buffet-style situation with one big, generous dish and plenty of bits to pile on top and around it.Our favourite is a chicken-and-rice number withamba, an Iraqi condiment that should win some kind of global diplomacy award for making everything taste better. Made from fermented sour mangoes and spices, amba is tangy, funky and bright, a bit like a firework for your palate. If you know it, you know how good it is; if you don’t, treat yourself to something that will make the coming year that much more delicious. If you can’t find it or can’t be bothered to look, use piccalilli instead: same spices, different fermented biomass.We lay out pickles, chilli sauce, a fresh chopped salad and a bowl of tahini sauce (our never-fail default). People scoop rice into their bowls, pile some chicken on top with zigzags of amba and tahini, plus pickles for crunch, freshness and heat. It’s perfect when you have more bodies than chairs and no chance of sitting down, and it’s the right pitch for our kind of NYE: festive without fuss, domestic comfort – but with fireworks.Chicken with amba or piccalilli one-pot wonderServes4, or 8 as part of a larger spreadFor seasoning the chicken1kg bonelesschicken thighs(about 8 pieces), ideally with the skin on1 tbsp ground cumin1 tsp paprika1 tsp turmeric2 tbsp flaky sea salt2 tbsp olive oil(if using skinless chicken)3-4 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced (250g)3 carrots, peeled and thinly sliced (250g)2 fennel bulbs, trimmed, halved and thinly sliced (250g)4garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushedFor the amba rice1 tbsp olive oil2 shallots, peeled and finely diced (120g)3 carrots, peeled and grated on a corse grater (250g)500g jasmine rice400ml boiling water100g ambaor 100g chunky piccalilliTo serveChopped flat-leaf parsleyLemon wedgesMix the chicken pieces with the spices and salt to coat, then place skin-side down in a large ovenproof saute pan with a lid. If you are using skinless chicken, add two tablespoons of olive oil to the pan before adding the chicken. Place on a medium-low heat and fry for eight to 10 minutes, until the skin is golden all over; remove the chicken with a pair of tongs to a bowl.Add all the sliced vegetables and crushed garlic to the pan, mix well and saute over a low heat for six minutes. Empty into the bowl with the chicken.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Return the pan to the heat, add the tablespoon of olive oil and the diced shallot and grated carrots. Mix well and cook over a medium-high heat for about five minutes, until the carrots start to collapse. Add the rice and mix well to coat, then return the content of the chicken bowl to the pan, with all the juices – this is very important because this is the only salt and flavouring you are adding to the dish. Mix a little to bury the vegetables and chicken in among the rice kernels.Mix the boiling water with the amba or piccalilli, and pour over the rice. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, cover first with a sheet of baking paper, then a lid (or silver foil), and transfer to the oven for 25 minutes.Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 minutes, before uncovering and serving with plenty of freshly chopped parsley, plus a few lemon wedges.Explore more on these topicsFoodNew yearChickenMeatMiddle Eastern food and drinkVegetablesStewrecipesShareReuse this content"

MasterChef, despite being one of the most exhilarating jobs a girl can do, sucked up most of my waking hours this year, and made my free time extra-precious. So the very best restaurants I found this year – those with zinging hospitality and heart-thumpingly good food – became equally extra-crucial.I’m talking about the likes ofTropea in Harborne, just down the road from the TV studio, and where I’ve spent a fair few Saturdays eating butternut squash arancini, fresh tagliolini and whopping great deep-fried salted cannoli. Over in Bristol, meanwhile, two absolute gems revealed themselves on the very same trip:RagùandLapin, both in Wapping Wharf and both in repurposed shipping containers, but entirely different creatures. Lapin I described as a “peculiar, meta, slightly earnest and definitely delicious” slice of France that serves asparagus with sauce gribiche, gnocchi Parisienne and, well, lapin itself whenever local hunters manage to bag some bunnies. Lapin will add caviar to any dish, if you ask for it, they play 80s French pop and serve a mint-green, menthe-over-club-soda diabolo for those French exchange school trip vibes. Ragù, meanwhile, may quite simply be one of the greatest dinners I’ve eaten this decade: crespelle in rich tomato brodo, artichoke fritti and chocolate budino with sour cherries and amaretti – flawless cooking in completely understated surroundings.View image in fullscreen‘Fancily plated’: ackee and saltfish spring roll at 2210 By Natty Can Cook in south-east London.Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianLargely because of those telly commitments, I made it to Manchester only a couple of times this year, but those visits gleanedBangkok Diners ClubandWinsome, both of which are terrifically good ways to fill your stomach and leave jolly. Bangkok Diners Club, in Ancoats, is a Thai restaurant tucked upstairs at the Edinburgh Castle, an elegantly restored, 19th-century pub where rich, golden beetroot massaman curry is served with decadent chicken-fat rice and where delicate plates of raw bass come with calamansinam jimand rice bran before a round of fruity rice ice-cream lollies. Winsome, on the other hand, is a stonkingly good modern British restaurant with a wonderful, warm, devoted crew led by Shaun Moffat, whose food is “a scoop ofFergus Henderson, a nod toMark Hix, a dash of London’sQuality Chop Houseand a teeny touch ofToby Carvery”. They serve roast dinners, wild mushrooms with pease pudding and rhubarb jelly with custard.View image in fullscreen‘Worth the bunfight to get in’: hake with squid ink at Belotta in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.Photograph: Cristian Barnett/The GuardianAnother fabulous night spent expanding my waistline was atBellotain Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, a Spanish tasting menu experience where seats are limited but well worth the bunfight to get in. Elsewhere, I was bowled over byJulietin Stroud, where the local boho community of artists and eccentric toffs currently celebrate their high days and holidays. And, just last month, IlovedDave Hart and Polly Pleasence’s new place,Franc, where simple French cooking and a very limited menu are the order of the day: we had world-class duck breast with caramelised endive and a big bowl of fresh chips. Another great dinner in 2025 involved a trip to the blustery British seaside for hake with orange-y sauce Maltaise atHarry’s in Camber Sands.Back in the capital, however, many over-hyped London restaurants left me cold, though there were the odd moments of greatness. The Ukrainian restaurantTatar Bunarin Shoreditch, for instance, is fabulous for plump mushroomvarenykyand borscht, plus I’d advise you to run, not walk to the newKuduin Marylebone, London’s prettiest new restaurant this year, for its confit trout braai and the “Kudu kit kat”. Or even just for a loaf of its warm fresh bread with a bowl of obscenely good curry-leaf butter. It would be remiss of me not to remind you aboutTownin Covent Garden, either, which I still recommend to everyone to solve their dinner-scheduling woes – it’s big, bold, deliciousandglamorous; take a date, take a client.View image in fullscreen‘A whopping great deep-fried tube stuffed with cream, salted caramel and chocolate sauce’: Tropea in Birmingham’s fried lemon cannolo.Photograph: Jack Spicer Adams/The GuardianI’m also guilty of harping on aboutOsteria Angelina, a Japanese-Italian hybrid in Shoreditch, and the wilfully eccentric, mock-historical pleasure palace that isLilibet’sin Mayfair, which will discombobulate you with its wild, monarchical, faux olde-worldeness, and then delight you with an exemplary Dover sole with Café de Paris butter and piles of profiteroles. Finally, creeping in at the end of the year, there was for fancy Caribbean at2210 Natty Can Cookin south London – think ackee and saltfish spring rolls and deep-fried apple crumble.Yes, time might have been a bit tight this year for lounging about in restaurants, but I gave it a damned good go and can confirm that the scene out there is roaring. Bring on 2026: the future looks delicious.Explore more on these topicsFoodGrace Dent on restaurantsRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"
