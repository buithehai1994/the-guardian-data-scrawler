Most recently, Labour had offered to purchase the necessary raw materials for the blast furnaces, the last primary virgin steel-making facilities in the UK, but this had been met with a counter offer from Jingye demanding “an excessive amount” of support.Reynolds continued: “Over the last few days, it became clear that the intention of Jingye was to refuse to purchase sufficient raw material to keep the blast furnaces running; in fact, their intention was to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders. The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steelmaking at British Steel.“We could not, will not and never will stand idly by while heat seeps from the UK’s remaining blast furnaces without any planning, any due process orany respect for the consequences. And that is why I needed colleagues here today.”Earlier, steelworkers at Scunthorpe blocked a group of Jingye executives who were trying to access parts of the plant on Saturday yesterday morning. Humberside police confirmed they attended the site and no arrests were made.View image in fullscreenJonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, speaking during the debate in the Commons on Saturday.Photograph: House of Commons/PAStarmer headed to Lincolnshire to meet steelworkers near Scunthorpe shortly after the bill passed the House of Commons unopposed, telling them: “You are the people who have kept this going. You and your colleagues for years have been the backbone of British Steel, and it’s really important that we recognise that.“And I felt it was really important today, having been in parliament this morning, to come straight up here to see you face to face to have that discussion with you. This shouldn’t be a remote thing that’s happening down in Westminster, in parliament, it should be something that’s living and breathing. It’s your jobs, your lives, your communities, your families.”Even some Conservatives spoke out in favour of the bill. Writing for theObserveronline, the Tory MP for Brigg and Immingham, Martin Vickers, whose constituency includes parts of the Scunthorpe works, saidthat he and his constituents would back outright nationalisation even though his party has always opposed such a policy.‘I have spent my life in this corner of Lincolnshire and witnessed how such job losses affect every part of a community’Read more“The government must nationalise the industry, to give it breathing space, to attract new private-sector investment and to keep the jobs of those thousands of people. What we have heard from the secretary of state means that they are edging ever closer to full-scale nationalisation and if that is eventually proposed, they will have the full support of the local community and, as their representative, they can rely on my support.”Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said that the government was seeking a “blank cheque”, while Tory leader Kemi Badenoch claimed Labour had “botched” a deal she had negotiated with British Steel while business secretary. She Badenoch was, however, unable to provide details of such a deal, saying negotiations were still ongoing when the last year’s election was called, but adding it “would have succeeded better” than Reynolds’s plan.The legislation stops short of full nationalisation of British Steel, and ministers remain hopeful that they can secure private investment to save the plant. But there is currently no private company willing to invest in the firm meaning, as Reynolds conceded, that public ownership remained the “likely option”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer meeting British Steel workers in Appleby Village Hall near Scunthorpe.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PARichard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK – which is hoping to win the contest for the first ever Lincolnshire mayor on 1 May – urged the government to “show your cojones” and go further by fully nationalising British Steel “this weekend”.Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said recalling parliament had been “absolutely the right thing to do”. But ministers were criticised for acting to save the Scunthorpe plant having not done the same when the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot were threatened with closure last year. Liberal Democrat Wales spokesperson David Chadwick said workers in south Wales “will be asking themselves how this unjust situation was ever allowed to occur”. Industry minister Sarah Jones said the different approach was due to Tata’s willingness to invest in Port Talbot, and the changed global circumstances making it necessary to protect the UK’s primary steel-making capacity.Sangeeth Selvaraju, policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, London School of Economics, and an expert on the steel industry told theObserverthat nationalisation, “while politically expedient, is not a long-term solution”.He said: “Blast furnaces in the UK have been loss-making for the better part of a decade and been economically unviable due to competition from Chinese and Indian blast furnaces, along with rising energy costs in the UK.”TUC general secretary Paul Nowak welcomed the bill but urged the government to go further.He said: “Today’s announcement is the first step towards ensuring we can modernise and decarbonise steel-making in this country – reducing our reliance on foreign imports and ensuring we stay competitive on the global stage.“But the government should not stop there. We need to ensure British Steel is used in British infrastructure projects to boost local economies up and down the country.“That’s how you protect steelworkers’ jobs through the transition, and put UK steel-making on a firm footing for the future.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelThe ObserverSteel industryChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump wants Kyiv to hand over its natural resources as “payback” in return for weapons delivered by the previous Biden administration.Talks have become increasingly acrimonious, Reuters said. The latest US draft is more “maximalist” than the original version from February,which proposed giving Washington $500bn worthof rare metals, as well as oil and gas.Citing a source close to the talks, the news agency said the most recent document includes a demand that the US government’s International Development Finance Corporation take control of the natural gas pipeline.It runs from the town of Sudzha in westernRussiato the Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod, about 750 miles (1,200km) away, on the border with the EU and Slovakia. Built in Soviet times, the pipeline is a key piece of national infrastructure and a major energy route.On 1 January, Ukrainecut off the supply of gaswhen its five-year contract with the Russian state energy company Gazprom expired. Both countries had previously earned hundreds of millions of euros in transit fees, including during the first three years of full-scale war.Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy, a Kyiv thinktank, said the Americans were out for “all they can get”. Theirbullying “colonial-type” demandshad little chance of being accepted by Kyiv, he predicted.Last autumn, Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed giving the US access to Ukraine’s underdeveloped mineral sector. He envisaged a deal that would see the incoming Trump administration supply Ukraine with weapons, in return for future profits from joint investments.Instead, Trump has refused to give security commitments or military support but wants the minerals anyway. Last week he complained Zelenskyy was trying to “back out of an agreement” and said Ukraine’s president would have “big problems” if he failed to sign.Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Zelenskyy said he was ready to do a deal to modernise his country but that Ukraine could only agree if there was “parity” between the two sides, with revenues split “50-50”.“I am just defending what belongs to Ukraine. It should be beneficial for both the United States and Ukraine. This is the right thing to do,” Zelenskyy said. The US Treasury confirmed “technical” talks were ongoing.Meanwhile, the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said hisremarks over a possible partition of Ukrainehad been misinterpreted. In an interview with the Times, Kellogg said the country could be divided “almost like the Berlin after world war two” as part of a peace deal.Writing on X, Kellogg said he was referring to “a post-cease fire resiliency force in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty”. Under this plan, Russian troops would remain in territory already seized by Moscow, with British and French forces stationed in Kyiv and in other parts of the country.On Friday, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Witkoff’s reported solution to the conflict was to give Russia the four Ukrainian provinces it is demanding – including territory that Ukraine controls, and which is home to 1 million people.Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group on Friday, Kyiv’s alliesannounced a record €21bn (£18.2bn) in additional militaryhelp. They accused Putin of dragging his feet over a 30-day ceasefire deal which Ukraine has accepted.Early on Saturday, Russia carried out further air attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets.Three warehouses were destroyed in Kyiv, with two people injured. The Kremlin has fired 70 missiles and 2,200 drones at Ukraine since the 11 March US ceasefire proposal, Ukrainian officials said.Zelenskyypaid tributeon Saturday to a 26-year-old pilot, captain Pavlo Ivanov, who was killed during an F-16 combat mission. Ukraine’s small air force “heroically” defends the country from Russian missiles and drones, and supported ground operations, he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaEuropeGasEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In turn, 68% believed better relations with the EU would boost UK/EU trade in a clearly positive way.Asked what they believed Keir Starmer’s priorities should be for a UK-EU summit in May, at which the prime minister and EU leaders will discuss moves to increase post-Brexit cooperation, the most popular answer was “trade between the UK and the EU”, which came out narrowly ahead of “illegal immigration across the channel” and, in third place, “improving the UK’s and EU’s defence and security”. Even among people who said they would consider voting for Reform UK at the next election, half (48%) said closer EU ties would have a positive impact on trade, with the same number saying it would make travel for Britons easier acrossEurope. This compares with one in 10 (11%) potential Reform voters who said it would have a negative impact on either.View image in fullscreenKim Darroch, former UK ambassador to the US, says ‘the US has shown little interest in doing favours for anyone, friend or foe’.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhen voters were given 20 options and asked to choose four that the government should focus on improving, “the UK’s ability to sign new trade deals with the USA” came 17th. The cost of living came top, followed by immigration and asylum, the UK economy and economic growth, energy costs, UK defence, and trade between the UK and was EU in sixth place.The study also found that a majority (62%) understand that the government is seeking a closer relationship with the EU. Far more people also thought the government was not going far enough to rebuild ties (35%) than those who thought the current approach was correct (15%). Among Labour’s winning coalition at the last election, a clear majority believed the government was not going far enough (54%).A sample of 4,703 people responded to YouGov between 31 March and 2 April, just as Trump was beginning to unveil his tariff plans, which have panicked the global final financial markets and opened the prospect of a bitter and prolonged trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the US and China.Last week, Trump was forced by the meltdown on the financial markets to announce a 90-day pause in the introduction of his higher “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on dozens of countries – with the notable exception of China. Keir Starmer’s public line is that he still hopes to gain an exemption from the 10% base tariffs imposed on the UK by signing a wider UK/US economic deal in the coming weeks.Recentindependent economic analysisby Frontier Economics found that even in the face of Trump’s trade war, acommonsense dealwith the EU that included deeper alignment on goods and services would secure economic growth of up to 1.5% to UK GDP, offsetting the impact of US tariffs completely for the UK and by a third for the EU.View image in fullscreenNaomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, says voters want Keir Starmer ‘to prioritise removing trade barriers in the interests of bringing costs down and getting growth’.Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, said: “Voters expect the prime minister to come away with more than just a defence pact when he hosts EU leaders in May and want him to prioritise removing trade barriers in the interests of bringing costs down and getting growth. They want trade before defence, trade before Channel crossings, and definitely trade with the EU before trade with Donald Trump.”Much of the analysis was based on the “Max-Diff” method, which is regarded as suitable when a range of options need to be put to respondents in order to gain a full and meaningful set of responses. Under this methodology, priorities are scored by asking people to choose their top three preferred options and their bottom three to provide a representative result.Peter Norris, chair of Virgin Group said: “As the last week has so painfully demonstrated, Trump is bad for business, consumers and savers. He has wreaked havoc in international markets and left us all on the precipice of a global recession that would mean real pain for people in the UK.Gordon Brown calls for ‘economic coalition of the willing’ to tackle Trump tariffsRead more“It is of the utmost urgency that our UK government work with our reliable partners in the EU to remove the artificial trade barriers between us so that both British and European businesses are in the best position to succeed in these extremely challenging conditions and so shield consumers from the worst effects.”Former British ambassador to the US Kim (now Lord) Darroch said: “Under the current administration at least, the US has shown little interest in doing favours for anyone, friend or foe.“The global order which has been in place for almost 80 years is changing by the hour and it makes sense for the UK to find stability through deeper cooperation with our allies in Europe while maintaining good relations with Washington.”Explore more on these topicsOpinion pollsThe ObserverEuropean UnionEuropeUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He was understood to still have been undergoing tests on Saturday afternoon.‘Tainted victory’: Newcastle’s Saudi influence still divisive after successRead moreHowe had felt unwell for most of last week following Monday night’swin at Leicester. The previous Thursday he had undergone prolonged dental treatment and warned journalists attending the next day’s weekly press conference that they might struggle to understand him following a “day at the dentist”.In a statement released on Saturday afternoon afternoon Newcastle said the manager who led his players to last month’s Carabao Cup win over Liverpool at Wembley – the club’s first major piece of domestic silverware since 1955 – was “conscious, talking with his family and continuing to receive expert medical care”. The statement added that “everyone atNewcastle Unitedextends their best wishes to Eddie for a speedy recovery and further updates will follow in due course.”It leaves Jason Tindall, Howe’s long-serving assistant, in control against Ruben Amorim’s 13th-placed side at St James’ Park as Newcastle continue their push for Champions League qualification. Tindall took charge of the first match of Howe’s tenure – a 3-3 draw with Brentford in November 2021 – from the St James’ Park technical area after the manager tested positive for Covid and was forced to watch the game on television from his Tyneside hotel room.Tindall deputised for Howe at Friday’s press conference and expressed surprise at the absence of his workaholic friend. “It’s really unusual for Eddie not to be well enough to come to work,” he said before adding that, despite being bedridden and “really poorly”, Howe had phoned him “three or four times a day” to discuss preparations for Manchester United’s visit.Although they have a game in hand on their rivals for a top‑five finish, Newcastle dropped to seventh on Saturday. They are one point behind fifth-placed Aston Villa and behind sixth-placed Chelsea – who face Ipswich at Stamford Bridge on Sunday – on goal difference. After the Manchester United game, Newcastle host Crystal Palace on Wednesday night before travelling to Aston Villa next Saturday.Explore more on these topicsEddie HoweThe ObserverNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the peer had been contacting a friend about a prostate cancer test during an event to support the Railway Family charity.A spokesperson for Hendy said: “Last month Peter Hendy used his phone while driving. He has apologised in full for this error of judgment and has contacted the police.”The Metropolitan police confirmed the case had initially been closed due to lack of evidence but was later reopened after Lord Hendy admitted to using his phone behind the wheel. He is expected to receive six points on his driving licence and a fine.The organisers of the Railway Family fundraiser said they had not received any formal complaint at the time of the incident.They said: “Since then, the organisers have only had one conversation from the complainant in the form of a text message, which he sent on 2 April, where he informed us that he’d reported Lord Hendy to the Metropolitan police.“The Railway Family fundraiser is run by railway professionals, all of whom work with safe systems of work and rules and regulations about safe practice. None of us would advocate or condone unsafe practices. However, we reiterate that we are not aware of the whole situation, and affirm our hope that any investigation is able to be conducted fairly.“The organisers regret that a positive and enjoyable event ended in this way and would once again like to express our thanks to Lord Hendy for his support for our event and fundraising.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Reuters reported that Turkish military teams had scoped out the main airport in Hama province as well as the T4 and Palmyra air bases in Homs, assessing the runways, hangars and infrastructure to see if forces and military hardware could be deployed there as part of a planned joint defence pact between Ankara and Damascus.The defence minister Israel Katz called airstrikes “a clear message and warning for the future”.Israel has struck military sites in Syria hundreds of timessince Assad fled to Moscow four months ago, destroying military assets including missile systems and air defences that the transitional government in Damascus had hoped to inherit.Assad’s overthrow marked the end of over 50 years of dictatorial rule by his family, as well as a halt to a decade-long civil war that became a frozen proxy conflict. The former autocrat’s backers Russia and Iran faced off against forces supported by Ankara in northern Syria, and an American military presence in the east and south.View image in fullscreenPresident Erdogan with Syria’s president Ahmed al-Sharaa at the Antalya diplomacy forum.Photograph: Murat Cetinmuhurdar/PPO/ReutersAfter an insurgency spearheaded by Sharaa’s forces took power in Damascus, Ankara emerged as the most significant regional backer of Syria’s nascent transitional government.Turkish officials have established fast ties with Damascus, while negotiating a reported defence pact that could see Turkish forces using Syrian airspace and establishing bases on the ground. Israel meanwhile moved to expand its decades-old occupation of the Golan Heights into a designated buffer zone following Assad’s departure.“Assad had Russia as his protector in the second half of the Syrian civil war. If Turkey comes in and begins installing air defence systems or introducing jets into Syrian airspace, that limits Israel’s freedom of action significantly,” said Aron Lund, an analyst with the New York thinktank Century International.“For Turkey, the problem now is not just Israel objecting to their military presence but doing things that by design or default are weakening or preventing the emergence of a functioning government in Syria, such as saying the new Sharaa government can’t have forces south of Damascus,” he said.Israeli military forces infiltrated a remote town in the Daraa countryside south of Damascus earlier this month, with Syrian state media saying nine civilians were killed in shelling during the deepest Israeli incursion into Syria.Amid few signs that Israeli forces intend to leave the area around Mount Hermon, an Israeli tour company hasreportedlybegun offering twice-daily hiking tours of the area in cooperation with troops stationed there.Less than a week after Israel struck three airbases in Syria, the two sides held talks in Azerbaijan aimed at finding ways to defuse growing tensions in Syria. The office of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a delegation composed of top security and diplomatic officials met their Turkish counterparts, with the two sides agreeing “to continue on the path of dialogue in order to maintain regional stability.”The Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told local broadcaster CNN Türk that “while we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia.”Fidan added that technical teams from both sides are in contact “when needed”, in order “to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other”.Lund labelled the talks “a very positive thing”, given the risk of a clash between the two powers in Syria, amid regional conflict including Israel’s 18-month assault on Gaza.“They will be both be military involved in Syria, and this could spiral in a number of different ways. So some form of red lines or communication channels are essential to managing that tension, and this seems to be a step in that direction,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaTurkeyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsShareReuse this content"

Shoppers bought an extra 45.4m packs of chocolate, cakes and crisps from the top-selling brands.The spending bonanza came as campaigners said food corporations were switching tactics to circumvent the impact of the upcoming regulations, which will bring in a 9pm watershed for TV commercials showing unhealthy food products, and ban them online from October, after five years of delays.Outdoor posters, audio advertising on podcasts and streaming services such as Spotify, and partnerships with social media influencers are not covered by the regulations.The increase in spending and the suggestion it may have led to an increase in sales may fuel calls for further restrictions. James McDonald, the director of data, intelligence and forecasting at WARC Media, which monitors ad spend and recorded the 26% increase, said it was “not surprising that we saw sales lift in line with spend”. He added: “I think the timing is interesting, given the introduction of HFSS [foods high in fat, salt or sugar] regulation this year.”New unpublished data analysed by academics at University College London and the Pan American Health Organization, including Chris van Tulleken, the NHS doctor and broadcaster, and shared with theObserver, found that the junk food ad regulations would only cover less than two-thirds of foods that could be considered unhealthy according to government nutrition guidelines.Health campaigners say food companies are adopting tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in the battle over cigarette advertising, by focusing on brands and logos rather than products. The advertising industry has argued that uncertainty over regulations threatens the sector and said ministers should legislate to exempt brand-only ads from the regulations.A battleground has opened up over whether the rules should cover adverts that only feature a brand name such as McDonald’s or Cadbury without showing an “identifiable” product.Allowing brand ads would mean that Cadbury could run its memorable drumming gorilla ad, for example, before the watershed so long as there were no images of chocolate bars.TheAdvertisingStandards Authority (ASA) is about to issue guidelines for advertisers clarifying issues like this, after suggesting that it would examine adverts on a case-by-case basis. Ahead of this crucial decision, both sides have ramped up their messaging.Archie Norman, the Marks and Spencer chair,told theFinancial Timesearlier this month that the regulations would “stop people talking about mince pies” and threaten future Christmas ads.Bite Back 2030, a youth activist group fighting the influence of junk food, surveyed 859 poster sites in Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle and Southwark in London and found nearly half were for food and drink. They also found that 44% of all HFSS food ads were in the most deprived areas, while only 4% were in the least deprived.View image in fullscreenDr Chris van Tulleken says he is not convinced the new regulations will work.Photograph: TT News Agency/AlamyThe government appeared to come down on the side of advertisers last week. Ashley Dalton, a junior health minister, issued astatementsaying “pure brand advertising” should not be restricted, and that the government did “not expect the perception or association of a corporate brand with less healthy products to automatically bring an advert into scope of the restrictions”.Last week an investigation by theBMJfound that local authorities were shelving restrictions on junk-food poster adverts in their areas after warnings from ad companies that they would lose revenue.“The only foods that are marketed in this country, almost without exception, are high in fat, salt or sugar,” Van Tulleken told theObserver. He said there were “no really functional marketing restrictions” for children on harmful food brands. “And I’m not enormously optimistic that anything that’s going to happen in October will significantly change that, because companies advertise on bus tickets … they have billboards advertising the brand, if not the product, up and down the street,” he added.Van Tulleken said there was “saturation” of unhealthy food brands across the country. “They’re in every shop, at every convenience store, in every supermarket, at every petrol station. They have complete 360 degree coverage, and the alternatives are inaccessible and unavailable and unaffordable for many, many, many people.”Curbing advertising on less healthy food products has long been considered a key part of tackling the UK’s obesity crisis.In 1980, only 6% of men and 9% of women were obese, according to theNational Heights and Weights Survey, while processed food made up 26% of kitchen groceries and families spent 57% of their food budgets on ingredients, according toresearchby the Institute for Fiscal Studies.By 2022, 28% of adults in England were classed as obese by the NHS, with two-thirds of all calories in UK diets coming from processed or ultra-processed food.The first government restrictions on ads for less healthy foods arrived in 2007, with some commercials banned during children’s TV shows. In 2018, after mounting evidence that children were still seeing junk food commercials, Theresa May bowed to pressure from campaigners such as Jamie Oliver to introduce a 9pm watershed for ads.Legislation was eventually passed in 2023 and the Advertising (Less Healthy Food Definitions and Exemptions) Regulations 2024 will come into effect on 1 October, with the aim, like thesoft drinks levy, of encouraging food brands to ­reformulate their products or introduce new ones.Rob Newman, the director of public affairs at ISBA, which represents brands advertising in the UK, said they were “extremely concerned” about the implications of the new restrictions and said the ASA was “caught on the horns of dilemma”.“The impact of brand ads being caught … could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds of lost revenue, redirection of spend outside the UK, or the inability to use ad campaigns which have already been prepared on the basis of what was understood to be the legislative position,” Newman said.Nicki Whiteman, Bite Back 2030’s chief brand officer, said: “The echoes of tobacco are everywhere. Instead of acknowledging and taking accountability for the extraordinary power these companies have over children’s health, what they do instead, just like Big Tobacco did, is look for ways around it.“Children across the world, all you [need] to do is show them a yellow M and they’ll know exactly what that stands for.”McDonald’s and Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment.Katharine Jenner, director of theObesityHealth Alliance, said food companies use “sophisticated techniques to keep unhealthy products in the spotlight” and exposure to unhealthy food marketing influences children’s preferences.“We now appear to be witnessing a final surge in less healthy food advertising before the rules come in, underlining why voluntary approaches have repeatedly failed and will continue to do so,” she said. “These long-delayed restrictions are sensible, proportionate, and evidence-based. Most importantly, they are a crucial step towards protecting children’s health.”Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthThe ObserverObesityFoodFood & drink industryAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

All three officers were treated in hospital, with one female officer discharged by 4pm on Saturday.Abedi was jailed for life in August 2020 for assisting his brother, Salman Abedi, in carrying out the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena in 2017. The attack killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.Responding to the assault, the secretary of state for justice,Shabana Mahmood, wrote on X: “I am appalled by the attack of three brave officers at HMP Frankland today. My thoughts are with them and their families.“The police are now investigating. I will be pushing for the strongest possible punishment. Violence against our staff will never be tolerated.”HMP Frankland is a category A prison, the highest level of security. It is understood the incident took place inside a separation centre – a special facility that aims to isolate prisoners with extreme views.Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the POA, said: “Separation centres hold the most dangerous terrorist offenders who simply do not wish to alter their ideology, and, as this event confirms, are determined to inflict violence on those who hold them securely.”He called for an urgent review of the privileges available to terrorist offenders in custody: “We must now review the freedoms we allow separation centre prisoners to have.”“I am of the opinion that allowing access to cooking facilities and items that can threaten the lives of staff should be removed immediately.“These prisoners need only receive their basic entitlements and we should concentrate on control and containment instead of attempting to appease them. Things have to change.”A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Three prison officers have been treated in hospital after an attack by a prisoner at HMP Frankland. Police are now investigating so it would be inappropriate to comment further.“Violence in prison will not be tolerated, and we will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hard-working staff.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationManchesterManchester Arena attackUK criminal justiceCounty DurhamShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being banned by the BBC, the song became a UK Top 10 single and spent 25 weeks in the charts, cementing his legacy as one of the world’s most recognisable reggae voices.View image in fullscreenMax Romeo performing at Park West in Chicago in 1981.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images“To hear of his passing is quite shocking,” said Max Romeo’s lawyer, Errol Michael Henry. “He was a perfect gentleman, and a gentle soul. He had great love for his family, and he was a legend in his own right. You couldn’t meet a nicer person – which makes the loss more difficult.”Romeo began his career in 1965 as the lead vocalist for the Emotions, before his music became synonymous with the Jamaican social democracy movement of the 1970s. His song Let the Power Fall on I became a ballad for Jamaica’s People’s National party during its successful 1972 election campaign.His 1976 album War Ina Babylon, released on Island Records and backed by Jamaican band the Upsetters, is widely regarded as a classic of the roots reggae era. It featured Chase the Devil, a song that has since been sampled by artists across genres, including the Prodigy and Kanye West.Romeo later moved to New York in 1978, where he co-wrote and starred in the musicalReggae, while he went on to perform backing vocals on the Rolling Stones’ track Dance on their Emotional Rescue album.Explore more on these topicsReggaeJamaicaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the March dip may be simply an early warning of a bigger fall in the summer, because tourists typically book holidays months in advance.“Once we get into July, August, September, most of those trips will have been booked,” said David Edwards, founder of the Scattered Clouds travel consultancy.“But if there is less global trade, there will be less international business travel. Business travel is booked with a much shorter lead time so if there is uncertainty, business travel could take a swifter hit.”Spring is difficult for travel companies to analyse because Easter moves in the calendar. So could the comparative drop simply be the effect of the Easter school holidays falling in March 2024? It seems unlikely, Edwards said, because the figures from the USNational Travel and Tourism Officeshow an even bigger drop, of 16%, compared with March 2019 when Easter was on 21 April and Trump was nearing the end of his first term.Travellers from other countries also seemed to avoid the US in March – visitors from western Europe who stayed at least one night in the US were down 17% in March, year-on-year. German visitors were down 28.2% and Spanish ones down 24.6% compared with 2024. Overall, global travel to the US was down 11.6%. UK residents make up the largest number of overseas visitors to the US, with 3.9 million a year.View image in fullscreenThere are concerns that Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric is making tourists feel less welcome in the US.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesTTG, the travel industry magazine, published a poll last week showing that two-thirds of travel agents it contacted believed there had been a downturn in bookings, while only 12% of operators said their business had not been affected. Demand for hotel rooms in the US may also be falling. Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality ­analytics at CoStar, which tracks hotel room occupancy, said that the strong dollar had led to an 8% fall in visitors in 2024.“So now with the rhetoric that’s going on, I’m super worried that we’re going to continue to see travel numbers below 2019, maybe even decelerating from 2024,” he said. “Saying ‘you’re cheating us, you have a ­surplus, so we’re going to put a ­tariff on you’ – that rhetoric is not very welcoming.”Research by VisitBritain in 2022 showed that international ­travellers ranked“destination is a ­welcoming place to visit”as the second most important factor in choosing a holiday.View image in fullscreenBritish backpacker Rebecca Burke was locked up for nearly three weeks by US immigration officials.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverAfter publicity around deportations of tourists, including Germans and Australians, the UK and German governments have updated their travel advice to warn citizens of the risk. The incidents may also harm the appeal of the 2026 World Cup – currently due to take place in the US, Canada and Mexico, with the later knockout stages entirely in the US – and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, Freitag said.“Next year will be very big … If I’m a German father with two boys and I want to show them the World Cup, am I really going to spend $1,000 a pop on an airfare, plus hotel, plus the ticket, if there’s even a remote chance that I will not be able to make it into the country? I’m not going to take that risk. Not everyone will think that, but probably some people will.”Clare Collins, co-founder and chief operations officer for CT Business Travel, said that she expected there would be a decline in leisure travel to the US in the summer, but had not yet seen an impact on business travel.“We’re not seeing any dramatic effects yet for business travel, but that could change in two weeks,” she said. “I think [in] the long-term leisure market, people will choose to spend their money elsewhere.”If the March dip turns into a major fall in travellers from the UK, some airlines may start cutting routes, Edwards said, and that could have an impact on the British economy.The UK travel industry recovered from the Covid pandemic mostly because American tourists flocked to Europe, buoyed by a strong dollar that made hotels more affordable in London and Paris.“Europeans may be thinking ‘I’m not so sure that the US is a welcoming place to visit’,” Edwards said. “Equally, it might be that Americans are thinking ‘how welcome would I be if I go to Europe this year?’”Explore more on these topicsTravelThe ObserverUS politicsDonald TrumpImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Pictures byJulia KochetovaSat 12 Apr 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 14.16 EDTShareIt is 11.20pm, and in an instant the emergency centre comes alive. Doctors and medics are conjured up from somewhere nearby to treat two wounded Ukrainian soldiers who have arrived together – one with serious shrapnel injuries to his right eye, the other who had a pile of bricks fall on his chest after a drone strike.Yet it is the third, who arrives on a stretcher shortly after, who is the worst affected. The dark “panda eyes” signify a brain injury, while his back is also studded with bloody red wounds from drone or mortar fire. He has to be stabilised by half a dozen medics before being transported to a hospital in the rear.Though the US is trying to broker a ceasefire to end thefull-scale warthat has run on for more than three years, there is no sign of a slackening of Russian aggression on the ground as the steady stream of night-time ­arrivals demonstrates. At around 2am, half a dozen lightly wounded appear, their hands and faces dirty and their eyes wide in an exhausted look only possessed by those who have spent days at the front.Oleskii, who immediately prior to becoming a combat medic last spring had a spell working in the digital department of Ukraine’s public broadcaster doing “all the Facebook, YouTube shit”, says that on a typical night this facility, a mid-point on a wounded soldier’s journey to safety deep in the rear, might treat “five or seven” heavy casualties spread over the night.UkraineIf that does not sound excessively busy, consider that the centre has been relocated back and is nominally intended only to treat members of a single unit, theDa Vinci Wolves’ battalion. Its fighters have spent the past 10 months defending the strategic town of Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s east, perhaps the hottest front in the war.A previous site, Oleskii recalls, was shared with 15 other units. There it was not uncommon to have “100 to 120 patients a night” and he says he was lucky when he got more than 15 minutes’ sleep at a stretch. The work is unrelenting, even after more than three years of full-scale war, but Oleskii says he can cope.“I have learned that I am very OK with doing this job, because shit happens – that is war. We either fight or we are dead,” he said. It is a feeling he says has been familiar with since February 2022. At that point, he was a soldier in Ukraine’s territorial defence force. “We were thinking: ‘Probably we will be dead in two weeks,’” waiting “on a toss of a coin” in trenches to see if the artillery would hit them.View image in fullscreenA wounded soldier at a stabilisation point at the Pokrovsk front.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The ObserverThere are two beds for emergency operations, two more for normal treatment and plenty of modern equipment, including a handheld X-ray unit. After all three are stabilised and moved on, Azizbek Pakhlavonovych, the lead doctor, describes the work that has taken place. Does he need anything more for the medical facility? “Russia to fall apart,” is the unexpected reply.There is no sign of that, however, and instead every night Ukraine is coming under attack, with several dozen drones and, often, one or two high-speed ballistic missiles. Theworst attackcame on 4 April, when 19 people, including nine children, were killed after a ballistic missile struck near apartments and a playground at Kryvyi Rih. The youngest was just three years old.“People were burned alive in their cars near their homes,” a first responder from medical charityMédecins Sans Frontières(MSF) said. But when the US said the strike demonstrated that the war must end, ambassador Bridget Brink would not say the missile was Russian. That prompted a complaint from Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but a fortnight of US yo-yo focus on tariffs meant there has been little diplomatic progress.A family of three was killed in their house on 21 March in Zaporizhzhia when a Shahed drone, one of a swarm that struck the city that night, smashed into the back of the property, whose large fertile garden overlooked a valley below. A next door neighbour, Larisa, said one of the noisy drones was circling overhead before it struck shortly after 9pm. “Why strike a house? Who knows what they are thinking? Maybe they think I will flee? Where would I go? This house was built by my parents.”View image in fullscreenOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems at Da Vinci Wolves battalion.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The ObserverAt a newly built subterranean school, cut two storeys below ground so children are safe from attack, Ivan Fedorov, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, describes a Russian attack on an electricity site south of Zaporizhzhia city on the morning of 2 April, when 2,000 homes lost power – despite the fact that the Kremlin has publicly signed up to stopping attacking energy infrastructure. Russian attacks are relentless, Fedorov says: “Every few minutes they attack our territory. Every few minutes.”In Kyiv, Zelenskyy has started holding regular press briefings, perhaps in anticipation of a post-ceasefire election. Tired but relaxed, the leader takes multiple questions as he seeks to explain the diplomatic manoeuvrings. This week, he acknowledged he had little choice but to play a longer game. The Russians, he said, had “a deceitful approach”, targeting the power network with smaller kamikaze drones, and the grim attack in Kryvyi Rih “came as a shock to many in America”.View image in fullscreenOleksii at the medical services stabilisation point, where soldiers at the Pokrovsk front are treated.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The ObserverHe told a group of reporters that his core belief was that “I think that President Trump will at some point be able to react to the fact that it is impossible to trust Putin” and said he hoped this would lead to “some decisive steps”. After the debacle of his trip to the Oval Office in early March, where he was berated by Trump, Zelenskyy has little choice but to try to demonstrate that Russia is insincere.“Fuck Trump,” says Serhiy Filimonov, the commander of the Da Vinci battalion, in English. In Ukrainian he argues that the US appears to be acting as if “Ukraine lost the war and it’s lost the war to the Americans and we have to pay reparations” – despite the fact that, apart from in Kursk in Russia, the front lines are practically stable. Ukraine only lost a modest 133 sq km of its own territory in March, the least for nine months, according to the Deep State group that maps the front lines.Though the Russian invaders are trying to encircle Pokrovsk, progress has stalled. Improvements to Ukrainian jamming, or electronic warfare, mean that once-deadly glide bombs are far less accurate, while Filimonov says the military high command had finally concluded that “the most powerful units have to [be defending] on the main direction of Russian attacks”, and that the best approach is to let Ukraine’s best run brigades expand rather than creating new units from recruits.View image in fullscreenSerhii Filimonov, commander of Da Vinci Wolves battalion.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The ObserverBut even a seasoned commander like Filimonov, who has been fighting against Russia since 2014, acknowledged there was no prospect of a dramatic Ukrainian victory on the battlefield, as had been hoped for before thecounteroffensive failedin 2023. “I’m more interested in security guarantees. We need to have a united security system with Europe,” he said, arguing that if a ceasefire were to emerge, bringing with it a European-led “reassurance force”, there would have to be a tightening of security relationships on the continent because otherwise “Russia will prepare for a bigger offensive”.Ukraine allies promise €21bn in military support for KyivRead moreOvernight, Ukraine’s military reported that Russians engaged in 40 combat offensives around Pokrovsk, and with the war not stopping, at least yet, units like Da Vinci prepare for the future. One part of the battalion is focused on developing land drones – remotely controlled bombs that crawl forward on tracked wheels; remotely controlled guns mounted on mobile carriages, and flat trolleys to ferry the dead and wounded from the front line without others having to carry them. The systems are experimental, costing upwards of $1,000 a time, and it is uncertain how far they will be successful.Oleksandr Yabchanka is Da Vinci’s head of robotic systems, though his background is medical – he worked as a paediatrician before 2014 and in the health ministry thereafter. Already the war in the air has been taken over by drones, causing, on western estimates, 70-80% of all casualties.Now Yabchanka says he is aiming for a time when, for Ukraine, “robotic systems take over from people on the zero line”. The prospect may be some way off, even unachievable. But Kyiv’s military can do little more than continue developing while peace negotiations drift.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverRussiaDrones (military)Volodymyr ZelenskyyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It should, in theory, be a hub for the more than 2 million people a year who come to explore the bogs, granite tors and windswept moorland that in part inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to writeThe Hound of the Baskervilles.Today it more closely resembles a mining community after the pits closed. Dartmoor prison, which provided jobs for many residents, has been closed since last summer after the discovery of dangerous levels of radon gas. The prison museum, a former tourist attraction, is also closed, and the prison officers’ club is derelict. Quiet streets bear testimony to the ghostly finger of financial fate.mapThe fate of the prison has not dented the profits of theDuchy of Cornwall, however, which owns the land the village sits on. The taxpayer is still paying Prince William’s estate £1.5m a year to lease the abandoned prison, and is set to do so for another 24 years.The government may soon face an even bigger bill: about 500 former inmates and staff who worked at the jail are planning to sue the Ministry of Justice, alleging they have been exposed to radon levels up to 14 times the legal limit, theObservercan reveal.Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas in soil and rocks, is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is conservatively linked to about 5% of lung cancer cases in the UK a year,causing more than 1,100 deaths, 3.1% of the total annually.Solicitor Mladen Kesar is representing the group. Of those bringing the case, 10 people have had cancer and, of those, two have since died. Others report symptoms they believe are linked to radon poisoning, including shortness of breath, wheezing and nosebleeds. Many worry that it may take several years for potential health effects to show, including lung cancer, stomach cancer and emphysema.Kesar compared his clients’ time in the jail to sitting inside the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. “I can’t prove causation yet, but that doesn’t mean I won’t be able to prove it,” he said.Lindon Ball, 31, from Torquay, who was already asthmatic, has suffered more severe lung and heart problems since serving time in Dartmoor in 2019 and 2020 for possessing an unlicensed firearm. During the Covid pandemic, he and other prisoners were locked up for more than 23 hours a day. “The prison is a bad, bad place,” he said. “They treat you like a dog. I’ve had breathing problems. I feel like I’ve got lumps in my lungs. I’ve got heart problems as well.”View image in fullscreenFormer Dartmoor inmate Lindon Ball.Photograph: Karen Robinson/the ObserverAnother man, who asked to remain anonymous, described cell windows which had been smashed out to let more air in because of the radon, heating that worked only intermittently, mist rolling into the damp cells and mould everywhere that had to be regularly scrubbed off. “My cell, I think, was 14 times over the legal limit [for radon]. I went there as a well man and came out ill,” he said. “I’m a scaffolder but I can’t work now. I’m signed off sick.”Joe Priscott, 27, from northDevon, who was in Dartmoor for dangerous driving and actual bodily harm from July 2021 to May 2023, developed nosebleeds for the only time in his life while he was there. “My solicitor sent me a list of the cells with the highest radon readings – and four of the highest were the ones I’d been in,” he said. MPs first began discussing high radon levels on Dartmoor in 1987. Staff at the prison began monitoring levels in 2010, say former inmates, but the last of the 640 prisoners and 159 staff were not moved out until July 2024.Villagers, who have dealt with their own radon problems by installing ventilation systems, doubt that the jail will ever reopen because of the complications of fixing such an old building. However, Amy Rees, the head of the prison and probation service, told the justice parliamentary select committee last month that it would still be cheaper to install protective equipment in Dartmoor than to build a new prison.A grey granite fortress built from 1806-09 to house French prisoners of the Napoleonic wars, the empty category C jail casts a shadow over increasingly worried neighbours looking out at disused buildings.The village – which is owned by William’s £1.1bnDuchy of Cornwallestate and stands as the highest settlement on the moor at 1,430ft above sea level – and its surrounding area have suffered an estimated £30m hit to the local economy after a disastrous combination of events.Many of them stem from the prison closure but there are other factors too, including financial cuts at the national park authority. The national park’s visitor centre, housed in the historic former Duchy Hotel where Conan Doyle stayed and started writingThe Hound of the Baskervilles, is due to close later this year because of a cash crisis at the park authority and mounting repair bills for the building. The youth centre has run into financial problems, the arts festival has been cancelled, and a long-promised new tourist attraction, a distillery, has failed to materialise and is still short of £5m in startup cash.View image in fullscreenThe visitor centre, formerly the Duchy Hotel, where Arthur Conan Doyle wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles, is due to close.Photograph: Karen Robinson/the ObserverLocals believe tens of thousands of tourist visits have been lost, despite the raw beauty of the surroundings, and local businesses are reporting a subsequent drop in trade. Rory Atton, who owns the Dewerstone organic clothing and coffee shop in the village centre, sees one common problem: nearly all the affected buildings and organisations are on leases from the duchy, requiring them, rather than the duchy, to pay for any repairs or improvements. Villagers have questions for William, who became Duke of Cornwall when his father acceded the throne and thus took over the duchy. “I think he might have been to some surrounding farms, but he’s not been to the village to talk to us,” Atton said. “Many people around here are ex-services and tend to be supportive of the monarchy, but they are growing increasingly frustrated withPrince William. What is his plan? Is there a plan? Because right now no one can see it.”Mark Renders, a local councillor, member of the Dartmoor National Park Authority and village postmaster in Princetown, worries that the shops may have to close eventually if nothing is done. He shares some similar criticisms of the duchy but also points out that many organisations have been paying only £100 rent, heavily subsidised by the duchy, and could have chosen to pay higher sums in return for making the duchy responsible for repairs under their tenancy agreements.“They’ve had 30 years paying £100 a year in rent,” he said.Prince William to end feudal restrictions on his Duchy of Cornwall estateRead moreThe duchy, for its part, appears to be putting together a plan to revitalise the village. It has given the youth club money for six months while it searches for alternative funding and is understood to be developing a wider strategy for the area. A spokesperson said it was working with the national park on a plan to turn the visitor centre into something that would support the local tourist industry. “We take our role seriously,” she said.Neither the duchy nor the national park would give further details about the plan for the visitor centre, one of three on Dartmoor, but theObserverunderstands that they may turn it into a youth hostel.The prison service, meanwhile, said it was still monitoring radon levels at Dartmoor prison and would not comment on the legal action. “We continue to take advice from specialists to explore how it can be reopened as quickly as possible,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationThe ObserverPrince WilliamDuchy of CornwallDevonMonarchyUK criminal justiceCancerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a moment that Mary* can see clearly without ever looking at the screen. She’s seen Coco more than a thousand times, easy.Mary’s sons, Ryder* and Murphy*, adore it. They light up when watching the film, pretzels in hand, and they stay, transfixed, right through to the end – the very end – every time. “My kids absolutely love credits,” Mary laughs.At a very young age Ryder, her eldest, was diagnosed with “non-verbal autism-spectrum disorder level three”, which requires a high level of support. Her second son, Murphy*, was diagnosed with the same condition as a toddler. The children, now 6 and 4, have never spoken to their parents. They’ve never been able to vocalise that love of Coco, of pretzels, or of their parents. Not being able to communicate with her children is a challenge that, in a cruel irony, is hard for Mary to put into words.My child has autism. Trump and RFK Jr linking it to vaccines scares parents like meRead more“What I deal with on a daily basis,” she says, pausing. “It can break you.”For the past six years, Mary’s life has been dedicated to supporting her two boys. When her mother died in an ICU in Sydney a few years ago, she barely had time to grieve. She drove back to her home in regional New South Wales, just hours after leaving her mother’s side, then removed all of the photos of her in the home. It was difficult to explain to Ryder and Murphy why they could see her in a picture frame but no longer FaceTime with their grandmother.Mary speaks of the fear of leaving her home, her sons being excluded or whispered about. If they do make it to a shopping centre or a park, often their senses can be overwhelmed and they melt down. Mary’s arms and legs bear bruises from trying to protect her sons from self-harming. The exhaustion is constant –one studyshows stress levels in parents of autistic individuals are similar to those of combat soldiers and Holocaust survivors – and the lack of sleep leads to caregiver burnout.This is a reality that Mary says impacts her family “every moment of every day”. And her family is not alone. It is a reality lived in homes the whole world over.It is into this reality that a new podcast, The Telepathy Tapes, appears. The 10-part series, which rocketed up both the Apple and Spotify charts at the end of 2024, offers an alternate reality for these parents, one in which autistic children who speak few or no words “possess gifts that defy conventional understanding, from telepathy to otherworldly perceptions, challenging the limits of what we believe to be real”.At first blush, The Telepathy Tapesseems exactly like the kind of hope Mary might be looking for, presenting a way to communicate with a child she has never heard speak. The Guardian spoke with seven parents and caregivers of autistic children. Two were excited by the podcast and hoped it would – at least – spark further curiosity and research.However when Mary first heard The Telepathy Tapes, she was horrified. “For something like this to exist is devastating and alarming,” she says.As hopeful as The Telepathy Tapes sounds, the Guardian also spoke with seven prominent autism researchers and clinicians. All were resolute in their analysis of the podcast: it is based on a long discredited methodology, they said.‘We are talking about telepathy’The Telepathy Tapesis a slick, modern production, structured like some of the best first-person, investigative podcasts of the last decade. It has the DNA of Serial,with a sprinkle of something like Casefile. The host, Ky Dickens, is an American film-maker and self-proclaimed “science nerd” and she places herself in the role of investigator, attempting to unearth the truth about telepathic powers in autistic individuals.In her pursuit, she teams up with Diane Hennacy Powell, a psychiatrist and longtime advocate of psychic phenomena. Powell has long believed autistic spellers, with savant skills, wouldbe able to prove telepathy. In The Telepathy Tapes, Dickens and Powell embark on a global tour that sees them meet a handful of autistic people with high support needs – Mia, Houston, Akhil and more – and put their abilities to the test.Take Mia, a 12-year-old Mexican girl who listeners meet in the first episode. Powell first hears of Mia’s ability to read minds through an email from Mia’s cousin, Sofia. Before long, Dickens and Powell have flown the family in from Mexico to the US, set up cameras in an Airbnb and started testing Mia’s ability.They put a blindfold on Mia, then show her mother a random number between 100 and 999, generated on a smartphone app. Powell shows the mother the first number: 698. Dickens narrates as Mia takes her blindfold off, then types the numbers out on a letter board. 6-9-8. Dickens is stunned. Another test follows: Mia’s mother opens a book to a random page, without Mia seeing. Mia types out a character presented on the page: a pirate. Another perfect result.Programs like The Telepathy Tapes steal time, attention and energy away from what truly mattersAndrew WhitehouseWhat Dickens doesn’t explain to listeners of the podcast is how Mia performs these feats. Fortunately, the whole thing was filmed, though that video is behind a $9.99 paywall on The Telepathy Tapes website. It’s in those videos that the methodology of The Telepathy Tapes becomes clear.Mia is a “speller”, a term used to describe those who communicate with the help of a letter board or other device in which they can tap out words letter by letter. Typically, this type of communication requires a partner, someone to hold the letter board and assist the speller. This type of communication is known as “spelling to communicate” (S2C) or the “rapid prompting method” (RPM).Both S2C and RPM are considered evolutions of facilitated communication (FC) – a 50-year-old practice that has been roundly discredited. “In the peer-reviewed, published research, it’s been pretty thoroughly debunked over and over again,” says Dr Jessica Paynter, associate professor in the school of psychology at Griffith University.The chief problem researchers and experts have with FC and its offshoots regard authorship. Rigorous, controlled scientific studies have found it’s typically not the autistic person who is writing or typing the messages – it is the facilitator or assistant. In some cases, this assistance requires holding the autistic person’s hand or shoulder or arm. In other cases, like with Mia, it involves them holding the letter board, and parts of Mia’s face, such as her chin.Many professional health organisations around the world have denounced the use of FC.Raising Children, an Australian government-funded website for parents, classifies FC as “ineffective or harmful”. The American Psychological Association (APA)adopted a positionthat FC is “a controversial and unproved communicative procedure” in 1994. The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says parents and caregivers should not be offered FC because “there is no evidence that it helps people with autism”. Though advocates of S2C and RPM suggest methodologies have come a long way in the past 30 years, there remains a lack of robust evidence that FC is reliably producing the words of the autistic person, rather than their facilitator.“There’s no strong evidence or rigorous, double-blinded checks that it is the person’s true communication,” Paynter says.Dickens suggests newer methodologies lead to independent communication. “Many of the critiques being levelled at spellers rely on outdated studies or methods that don’t reflect how spelling looks today,” she wrote in an email to the Guardian.“Many spellers now type independently or with minimal support, across contexts, with their own language and personality shining through.”‘He nails it on the first take’: how the Beatles helped my autistic son find his voiceRead moreThree of the clinicians and researchers we spoke with are concerned focusing on the methods platformed in The Telepathy Tapes could limit the use of evidence-based approaches.“I firmly believe we can achieve all of the same outcomes proponents of FC/RPM are seeing without the fundamental risks to human rights, health, learning, participation and wellbeing these approaches pose,” says David Trembath, a professor of speech pathology at Griffith University.When we speak with Andrew Whitehouse, a professor at The Kids Research Institute and one of Australia’s foremost autism researchers, he has just finished a session with a family whose autistic child with high support needs wears a helmet because he often bangs his head against the wall.“This wonderful child and his family are in such distress, and they need support. Instead, we are talking about telepathy,” he says.“Programs like The Telepathy Tapes steal time, attention and energy away from what truly matters – valuing children and families as they are, and doing all we can to support them to live their best lives.”Dickens says she takes the concerns of clinicians seriously and appreciates that many have dedicated their lives to supporting nonspeaking people. “I did speak with scientists – cognitive neuroscientists, speech pathologists, linguists and even sceptics,” she says, and notes some declined to go on the record. But she sees spelling as a positive.“Many of these families havegainedresources – hope, connection and joy – through spelling. We should ask why that’s happening, be in conversation with spellers themselves and not assume it’s all delusion or deception,” she says.A ‘fad magnet’There is no single identifiable cause of autism. It follows, given the varied experience and impairment of autistic individuals, there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. Clinicians and therapists are trained to select the best evidence-based methods for supporting individual clients, but they often take time and energy to implement.Parents often live in a perpetual state of exhaustion and are easy prey for people who promise the worldJoe and Paige, parentsAgainst this backdrop, misinformation proliferates – so much so that autism has been labelled a “fad magnet”. Dolphin-assisted therapy, chelation, the use of essential oils, magnets and a host of special diets have been touted to help autistic people; these are often marketed with emotional anecdotes or endorsed by celebrities.Howard Shane, a practising clinician at Boston Children’s hospital, has worked with autistic children since 1975 and currently sees almost 300 autistic individuals every year. He has seen fads come and go, but notes facilitated communication has been particularly persistent.“You look at all of the different pseudoscientific strategies [that] have been thrown at these individuals for decades and decades – it’s one thing after another,” says Shane. “I think we’ve come to the height of it with The Telepathy Tapes.”Joe and Paige*, parents to a profoundly autistic son, say they’ve often seen parents of autistic children with high support needs tempted to try anything that might help because they’ve been let down by healthcare, education and social security systems that are not built to support them or their children. “Parents often live in a perpetual state of exhaustion and are easy prey for people who promise the world and the glimpse of hope that might ease the suffering,” they say. This is something Mary echoes; she has to constantly prove her sons are worthy of support from the NDIS, Australia’s national disability support scheme.In contrast to this dismissal, Dickens says her podcast centres autistic individuals “voices, autonomy and humanity”. “To me recognising someone’s full personhood means being open to their version of the truth, even if it disrupts our assumptions.”Three parents who had listened to the Telepathy Tapes did not wish to speak on record. Several said they were wary of experts who dismissed The Telepathy Tapes, FC or S2C and their own lived experience. They also accused opponents of the practice as being ableist and not presuming competence in autistic individuals. Two had used spelling to communicate with their children and suggested those who criticised or dismissed the technique have a financial incentive to discredit the practice.Paynter, who researches misinformation surrounding autism treatments and sees autistic clients in private practice, has seen this argument before; but says specialists are in no need of more business. “There’s more than enough work for everyone.”She says specialists have no incentive in debunking treatments – if something worked, she’d want to see it put into practice.“All of us working in the field, we want to do anything that could help autistic children to communicate, to self-advocate and to have their needs met,” Paynter says.Parents, too, will do anything to help their children communicate, to self-advocate, to help them achieve independence. That unites those who champion spelling to communicate and those who use evidence-based approaches. All these parents strive, constantly exhausted, to support the people they love most.Dickens, too, appears eager to help the families she has met. Her podcast, she says, is “an invitation to re-examine long-held assumptions, and to listen – deeply – to people whose voices have been silenced for too long.”Explore more on these topicsAutismMedical researchHealthHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Everyone but Jonathan ReynoldsSat 12 Apr 2025 11.23 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 14.13 EDTShareIf the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has a fault – and it’s by no means clear that Jonny thinks he does have a fault – it’s that he’s too trusting. Who wouldn’t have believed that Jingye, the Chinese owners ofBritish Steel, had been just too busy to get round to doing a deal to keep open the Scunthorpe blast furnaces? That they had been out and about enjoying the good weather and had missed the government’s increasingly desperate calls. After all, the Chinese government has never had anything but the interests of the British people at heart.To say that the recall of parliament was a sign of panic is something of an understatement. This was thefirst Saturday the Commons had been summonedback from recess since the Falklands war in 1982. You couldn’t help feeling this was a crisis that could have been dealt with much earlier.Fears that the Chinese were planning to close the Scunthorpe steelworks were first raised last September. There had been two urgent questions on the matter in the last couple of weeks. There had been backbench challenges at prime minister’s questions. But the government had been certain everything was under control. Everything was fine until suddenly it wasn’t.But we were where we were and at 11am on Saturday morning, the Labour benches were packed as the government proceeded to pass the steel industry (special measures) bill in a day. Standing room only. The opposition benches, not so much. There was plenty of green leather on view. Only a few Tory and Lib Dems had made the effort to turn up. The rest had gardening to do. Turning swords into ploughshares. Everyone had their own way of celebrating the first step in what was likely to be the nationalisation of British Steel. Comrades in arms.First up was leader of the house, Lucy Powell, to thank the Commons staff for accommodating the recall that was not at all panicky and had been planned months in advance. In reply, Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office secretary – there was no sign of shadow leader of the Commons, Jesse Norman: he was busy controlling his own means of production – accused the government of making a pig’s breakfast of the whole thing. Presumably a pig’s breakfast is a dog’s dinner of a dog’s dinner.Then came Reynolds. The recall had not been taken lightly. But he had offered Jingye an extremely generous deal which, to his astonishment, they had refused. So he had been left no choice but to put British Steel under government control.It has to be said that Jonny looked fairly ropey. Not getting much sleep in the last few days, I guess. But he was bewildered by the irrationality of the Chinese. The rest of us were bewildered by Reynolds’ own shortsightedness. Surely it was completely rational of the Chinese to do everything in their power to de-industrialise a rival country. To make the UK the only member of the G7 without the capacity to make its own virgin steel is the stuff of dreams for Beijing. Making the business secretary look like an innocent abroad.There were numerous interventions. David Davis wanted to make sure we weren’t going to pay Jingye for an asset that was effectively worthless. Iain Duncan Smith wanted a sunset clause to time-limit the government’s control. Reynolds declined. He didn’t want the powers any longer than necessary but he would fight anyone who tried to take them away from him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parliament sometimes throws up some odd bedfellows. There again, Reform are shape-shifters. Their motto is never to believe anything too strongly. Rather just drift wherever public opinion lands. And right now most of the country favours nationalisation of British Steel.The opening speech ended with a fight as Reynolds observed that it was a pity the Tories hadn’t done more to protect British Steel over the 14 years they were in power. Production had fallen 42% and as business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, had only had three meetings with the steel operators during her 18 months in office. How come she had never tried to broker a better deal with Jingye? The Chinese had not provided any cashflow statements for years. Surely someone must have thought something dodgy was going on?This was a red rag to KemiKase. She can’t resist any provocation. No fight is too small for her. She bounced to her feet – fire up the blast furnace!Kemi reminded us she had been negotiating a deal with the Chinese and it had been all set to go through when Rishi Sunak had called the election last July. Mmm. Yesterday she had put out a statement saying she had negotiated a deal. Make your mind up. But it was all terribly Top Secret so she couldn’t possibly say what the deal had been. She sat down in a temper and started scribbling on a piece of paper. THE VERY VERY IMPORTANT DEAL THAT I CAN’T TELL ANYONE ABOUT.In reply, shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith was all confected outrage. The worst deal ever! Unbecoming of a parish council! All of which might have sounded more convincing if it had come from someone else’s mouth but his own. Griffith had been Boris Johnson’s business adviser when the prime minister sold British Steel to the Chinese for £1 back in 2020. He also got rather confused about tariffs. Somehow blaming Labour for Trump’s madness. Luckily, no one was really listening. We were all waiting to see if Kemi would implode.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelThe politics sketchSteel industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Belinda’s decision to send a signal that will summon the robots, knowing it might bring death to all those around her, felt like one of the most dangerous things a companion has done since Clara was travelling with the Time Lord.View image in fullscreen‘Transmat initiated’ … the Doctor and Belinda with some fancy robot tech.Photograph: Alistair Heap/BBC Studios/Bad WolfThe running joke of everything being somehow named after Belinda raised a smile, as did the unexpected death of the cat. One difference between the way this second era of Davies is written, compared to the first, is that you can imagine a more character-driven version of this story – one where we actually get toseeBelinda’s relationship with Alan Budd (Jonny Green) gradually deteriorate, and experience her suffering as he gradually begins to assert coercive control.Instead what we got was a villain reveal up in space, followed by a very quick flashback to him obviously being a massive jerk on Earth, and then on with the show. It was a superficial way to deal with a serious issue, although the bait and switch of thinking the story was going to be about the risks of AI, to being a metaphor for controlling relationships, did give the third act a kickstart.Sum it up in one sentence?What if Doctor Who was likeAdolescence?Life aboard the TardisWe could be in for a spikier relationship between Doctor and companion than we saw with Gatwa and Millie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday last time out. Belinda, at least so far, is more than insistent that she wants to be returned straight home rather than take a jaunt round the stars, even one named after her. She definitely does not take kindly to being condescended to or having her DNA tested. The Doctor and Ruby acted like best buddies from the off, but Belinda has already declared: “I am not one of your adventures”. This pairing could be more of a slow burn thing.Fear factorThe robots from Missbelindachandra One may have had a mean streak, but they also had a pleasingly retro-futuristic 1950s look about them, along with their rocket.View image in fullscreenRetro threat … Varada Sethu and one of the robots from Missbelindachandra One.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfThe little robot vacuum was the opposite of fear, though. It was the very epitome of the cute factor. Who wouldn’t want a small robot whizzing around excitedly shouting “Polish polish!” as it cleaned your floor?Mysteries and questions“You ain’t seen me” was another genius little fourth-wall breaking cameo from Anita Dobson’s mischievous Mrs Flood, who appears to have a habit of living next door to the 15th Doctor’s companions. We are guaranteed to see more of her this season. The duplicate diploma MacGuffin is no doubt propelling the Tardis towards the big bad, and as for the significance of the date 24 May? Well, for one thing, the date the Tardis keeps bouncing off is the day that episode seven of this season, Wish World, is released.View image in fullscreenBelinda (Varada Sethu) with her copy of the diploma that appears to be causing space-time to ‘schwup’.Photograph: James Pardon/BBC Studios/Bad WolfDeeper into the vortexFrom our point of view, this is the second consecutive story where the 15th Doctor has lost access to the Tardis for multiple months, gets stuck, and makes a new potential companion friend (Sasha 55 played by Evelyn Miller in this, Steph de Whalley’s Anita Benn inJoy to the World)The Doctor saying “Padam padam” after revealing his two hearts to Belinda with the X-ray blanket is another nod in this era to the 2007 Christmas special Voyage of the Damned guest star Kylie Minogue. Gatwa’s Doctor madeRogue’s spaceship playCan’t Get You Out of My Headlast yearThe show makes an explicit plot point out of Seethu having acted as Mundy Flynn in last year’sBoombefore taking on her new role as companion. This has happened before, when Freema Agyeman’s Martha mentioned that her cousin, who she had also played, had been killed in an earlier alien battle. The 10th Doctor and Rose explained Torchwood’s Gwen Cooper and The Unquiet Dead’s Gwyneth both looking like Eve Myles as “spatial genetic multiplicity”. And perhaps most famously, Peter Capaldi’s 12th Doctor explained inThe Girl Who Diedthat his latest face looking like Capaldi’s character Lucius Caecilius fromFires of Pompeiia few years earlier was a way “to remind him” to show mercy and do the right thingDoctor Who has often had an erratic approach to what happens when the same people and things from different bits of their timeline interact. In 1983’sMawdryn UndeadtheBlinovitch Limitation Effectcaused an energy discharge when two versions of the Brigadier met. In 2005’sFather’s Day, the presence of Rose at two different ages changing her own history lets the reapers into the universe, while in 2013’sJourney to the Centre of the Tardis, the Doctor was able to throw a big red reset button to his younger self, preventing the whole episode happening in the first place. Confused? You will beBelinda feels patronised and says “Am I six?” after the Doctor uses the phrase “timey-wimey”. If you are a longtime fan and don’t want to feel old, look away now. In real life Sethu would have been 15 when David Tennant’s Doctor first used that phrase inBlink, just under 18 years agoNext timeThe 1950s! Miami! Some sharp fashion! The dark of the matinee!

Photograph: Pablo Xavier/MidjourneyFrom the pope in a puffer to the Princess of Wales and family, baby Hitler to Mussolini on horseback, people have always manipulated photographs, whether for political power, image control – or just for fun …ByJonathan FreedlandSat 12 Apr 2025 02.02 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 09.16 EDTShare“Pictures or it didn’t happen.” So runs the immediate social media retort to any claim deemed too extraordinary to be true. Carried within it is an assumption shared across the globe which has held firm almost since the invention of the camera: that the ultimate form of proof is the photograph. The idea is so strongly fixed in the human mind, it has acquired the status of a law of nature, one obvious even to a child: the camera never lies.Except it does, as the images collected here vividly attest. We may think of AI deepfakes, and their Photoshop predecessors, as thoroughly modern menaces, corrupting a previously innocent, reliable medium, but we would be wrong. It turns out people have been doctoring photos, manipulating and meddling, from the start. “Honest” Abe Lincoln was not only thefirst sitting president to be photographed, but the first to be the subject of a photo fake.It’s not hard to fathom why those in the darkroom were tempted to play tricks with the technology as soon as they learned that they could. The most obvious motive is the one that fuelled so much early photographic output: PR, or propaganda. It must have seemed only natural to superimpose Lincoln’s head on to the body of another man – an enslaver, as irony would have it – if that would yield a more heroic image of the president. The same goes for the portrait of civil war general Ulysses S Grant, depicted at the centre of a military scene that was in fact three scenes combined into one. You want the leader to look as strong and noble as possible. If that means showing him on horseback, while quietly removing the handler who kept the animal under control as the snap was taken, you’ll do it – or at least you will if you’re in charge of optics forBenito Mussolini.The beauty of photo manipulation for those practising politics’ black arts is it can be deployed both to make your side look better and to make the other side look worse. The North Koreans could add extra hovercraft to make their military appear more lethal, while Republicans in the 2004 US presidential campaign could put Democratic contender John Kerry alongside “Hanoi Jane” Fonda, as if the two had appeared on a platform together, denouncing the Vietnam war, a generation earlier. It never happened, but the picture says it did – and, as we all know, a picture is worth a thousand-word correction.Politics is never far away, even when those in the frame are not politicians. Look no further than the darkened image ofOJ Simpsonthat appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1994, when the former sports star became a murder suspect, the picture seemingly altered to make a Black man look blacker.‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on cameraRead moreLess than a decade later, the then editor of the Daily Mirror,Piers Morgan, resigned after the paper ran staged photographs that purported to show the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. It seemed clear that the source of the pictures was motivated by opposition to the war, but that same sentiment surely also explained Morgan’s readiness to be taken in by them. After all, British soldiershadcommitted abuses in Iraq. Sometimes, that’s how fakes sneak through: though false, they point to a truth.But if the political benefits, and dangers, of fakery are obvious, more intriguing are the manipulated images that serve no such clear purpose. Vanity can play a role – including that of the photographers, seeking acclaim as even more accomplished artists than they already are. Witness the forensic evidence suggesting Robert Capa’s stunning image of a falling soldier is likely to have been posed.Money is a factor, naturally. The bigfoot footage might have been a commercial scam, although if it was, it was one that required an almost obsessive commitment. Even revenge can drive someone to concoct an optical illusion: think of the hunter of the Loch Ness monster who, humiliated by the Daily Mail, got his own back by duping them with an image of the sea monster that was too good to be true.But more mysterious are those fakes that have no clear explanation. The prankster who concocted a snap of himself on the roof of one of the twin towers just before a plane crashed into the building did it as a poor taste joke, to be circulated among his friends. Yet we know there are others who claimed, falsely but in earnest, thatthey survived 9/11or other terror attacks. What accounts for that, beyond the desire for attention, to be at the centre of a historic event?Of course, none of it would work without us, the viewer. Fake images proliferate and endure because they show us what we want to see. Posters ofUFOswere captioned “I want to believe” for a reason. They realise fantasies, or dreads, that would otherwise linger only in our imaginations. They make our dreams – or our nightmares – come true.Picture captions by Felix Bazalgette, Gabrielle Schwarz and Emma LoffhagenLeap into the Void, 1960ByYves KleinView image in fullscreenThe image the world saw …Photograph: Metropolitan Museum/Art Resource/ScalaView image in fullscreen… and the one it didn’t.Photograph: Shunk-Kender © J Paul Getty Trust/Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2014.R.20), gift of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation in memory of Harry Shunk and János KenderIn 1960, French artist Yves Klein stunned the world withLeap into the Void, an image that appeared to capture him mid-flight, fearlessly leaping from a rooftop in Paris. In reality, it was two negatives combined – and the tarpaulin held by friends was removed in post-production.Klein forbade photographers Harry Shunk and János Kender from revealing how they had created the photos, with Shunk claiming he was threatened with legal action. It wasn’t until 50 years later that the mechanics of the leap were fully revealed.ELWales family photograph, 2024Edited by thePrincess of WalesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kensington Palace/Reuters“Like many amateur photographers,” the Princess of Wales said, “I do occasionally experiment with editing.” This inexpert attempt at Photoshopping might have been a mildly embarrassing royal footnote last year, were it not for the fevered context in which it was released. The princess had made unusually few public appearances in late 2023 and early 2024; a palace announcement that she was recovering from abdominal surgery did not quieten public curiosity as to her whereabouts. When this family photograph was released to mark Mother’s Day, several news agencies quickly issued a dramatic “kill notice” for it, identifying several signs of heavy editing, including around Princess Charlotte’s hand, contrary to guidelines for news images. The princess apologised “for any confusion” and later that month announced she had been diagnosed with cancer, dampening the speculation that had gripped the press.FBOJ Simpson on the cover of Time, 1994ByLAPD/Matt MahurinView image in fullscreenOJ Simpson as seen on the cover of Time …View image in fullscreen… and NewsweekAfter American football star OJ Simpson was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Time and Newsweek both made his mugshot their cover. But while Newsweek used the original image, Time showed Simpson’s skin drastically darkened – done, critics claimed, to make a Black man appear more threatening. Time apologised, but insisted the alteration was simply an artistic decision.ELMussolini on horseback, 1937ByLuigi LeoniView image in fullscreenPhotograph:  FAF/Toscana/Fondazione Alinari per la Fotografia/akgWhen Italy first invaded and occupied Libya in 1911, Benito Mussolini, at the time a socialist, publicly opposed the colonial attack. Two decades later, the fascist Mussolini would declare himself ruler of “Italian Libya” and a “Protector of Islam”, to mark which title he was photographed in 1937 holding aloft the sword of Islam, a ceremonial weapon.The original image, taken by photojournalist Luigi Leoni and showing a groom dutifully holding the leader’s horse, initially appeared on newspaper front pages – but editors soon learned to crop and airbrush out the groom, to better foster the image of an independent, aristocratic, warlike leader. By the 1940s, the image without the groom had become the standard version, and it created the enduring visual signs of the strongman leader – when Nigel Farage makes a speech atop a tank, or Vladimir Putin displays his bare chest, both are drawing on iconography developed by the Italian fascist.FBFrame 352 of the bigfoot film, 1967ByRoger Patterson and Bob GimlinView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Science Source/akg-imagesNo other scrap of film – apart from perhaps the Zapruder footage showing JFK’s assassination – has been so exhaustively analysed as the Patterson-Gimlin film, named for the two cowboys who shot it, Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin. In October 1967 the two men rode into the woods of northern California with a camera after a number of sasquatch, or bigfoot, sightings in the area. As the hairy figure emerged, Patterson said, his horse panicked and reared up; after a few seconds, he was able to grab his camera from a saddlebag and record a short snatch of footage, before the creature disappeared into the tree line. Frame 352, of the figure turning to look at the camera, remains the iconic image of the bigfoot movement.“The Patterson-Gimlin film stands at a crucial place in photographic history,” says Steven Streufert, who has made a long-term study of the footage. “It’s either the greatest hoax ever or a stunning piece of wildlife imagery.” Streufert co-led an expedition in 2011 to identify the film’s remote wooded location, an effort that led to him being named Bigfoot Times’s Bigfooter of the Year.For Streufert, the film stands “closer to the moon landing than the Cottingley fairies” as, unlike the latter, it has never been conclusively debunked and still inspires obsessive study. Patterson died a few years after it was filmed, while Gimlin, now in his 90s, maintains that the footage shows a real sasquatch.To true believers (and some scientifically trained commentators), the figure has inhuman proportions, a distinct gait and visible muscle mass moving beneath its fur, all of which would be difficult to achieve if it was a person wearing a furry suit. Comparisons with the unconvincing costumes in the Planet of the Apes, released a year later, suggest that if they were faking it, Patterson and Gimlin – both rodeo riders and horse wranglers – were highly skilled costume designers for their time.“I’m a sceptic,” Streufert says, reflecting on his lifelong engagement with the film, “but to me that means being curious.” The footage, and the culture around it, is compelling to him because of the broader question it poses: “Why do humans believe in things that are not supposed to exist?”FBThe Book of Veles, 2021ByJonas BendiksenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonas Bendiksen/Magnum PhotosPhotojournalist Jonas Bendiksen first heard about the run-down North Macedonian city of Veles in 2016, when it was identified as a hub for fake news production in the US presidential election. Around then, he also became aware of computer-generated images, and “wanted to test whether we were prepared for a world where we cannot tell CGI from photojournalism”.TheBook of Veles(a title borrowed from a known literary forgery, which purported to be an ancient Slavic text) is the result. Using 3D modelling tools, Bendiksen inserted digital avatars into empty backdrops shot in Veles, claiming they were real portraits of tech-savvy local youths who had found an unlikely source of income operating websites that churned out pro-Trump stories. He published the images in a photobook alongside an essay written with a prototype of ChatGPT.To Bendiksen’s surprise, no one clocked him – on the contrary, he was invited to present the project at a prestigious photojournalism festival. So he decided to drop clues on social media, creating a fake user who accused him of paying his subjects. Eventually a real user, Benjamin Chesterton, noticed that the fake account’s profile picture looked like one of the avatars in the book.“It shows we see what we want to see,” says Bendiksen. “If something is packaged up in the right way and conforms to what we expect, we are at risk of buying into anything.”GSAbraham Lincoln portrait, 1865ByWilliam PateView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Library of CongressThe US president’s assassination in 1865 led to demand for heroic portraits of him – and to one printmaker getting a little too creative. In this print, attributed to engraver William Pate, the Great Emancipator’s head is superimposed on to an engraving of John C Calhoun, a political rival and supporter of slavery. The source photo was flipped, so Lincoln’s mole appears on the wrong side of his face.GSAlpine UFOS, 1970sByBilly MeierView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty ImagesIn 1976 the unusual claims of a Swiss man began to appear in the press. Eduard “Billy” Meier maintained he had made contact with a race of aliens hailing from the Pleiades, and offered as proof dreamy images of their spaceships over rolling alpine landscapes – supposedly taken with their permission. In the coming decades, Meier would release a flood of such images, write bestselling books about his alien friends and become a media fixture and countercultural icon. Mulder’s office in The X-Files features one of his images, with the slogan “I want to believe”.Julio Rojas, a writer and film-maker who has spent the last two years making adocumentary about Meier, says the pictures are “possibly the most beautiful ever captured of an unidentified flying object”. Though many, including Meier’s ex-wife, have observed that some of the UFOs are clearly household objects such as bin lids, Rojas finds the images fascinating – not only because they “established the visual canon” of flying saucer imagery, but also for their beauty and variety, “ranging from technical awe to deliberately careless and mocking images”, which seem to taunt the viewer.Meier, now 88, insists his images depict a race of aliens who have been in contact with him for decades. Interviewing him, Rojas thought he perceived “a quiet certainty” rather than an intention to deceive. “His world – whether real or false to us – is entirely real to him.”FBBaby Hitler, 1933ByAcme NewspicturesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Warren family collection“They’ve made a sourpuss out of my son,” complained Harriet May Warren Downs to Life magazine on 2 May 1938. Five years earlier, doctored images of her baby, purporting to show the newly elected fuhrer as a one-year-old, had been distributed by Acme Newspictures. “This is a picture of a man who controls the destiny of a mighty nation,” said the Winnipeg Free Press, while the Chicago Tribune ran the picture next to one of Hitler as an adult, addressing a meeting of farmers.The latter caused a diplomatic scandal, with the German consulate complaining of blatant “falsification”. The Tribune blamed the picture agency, which “insisted the original came from Austria”, according to Life. Downs’s letter, about “the dreadful monstrosity”, would finally confirm the true identity of the baby, but the hoaxer who stole and doctored the image remains a mystery.FBNorth Korean hovercraft, 2013ByKorean Central News AgencyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: KCNA via KNS/AFP/Getty ImagesAmid heightened tensions, with the US and South Korea carrying out military drills, the North Koreans released a series of photos of a hovercraft assault drill on a desolate, snowy beach. The images had already been distributed by some western news agencies, including AFP and Getty, before Alan Taylor, an editor at the Atlantic, spotted some“digital twins”, cloned by a photo editor to create a more menacing impression of multiple hovercraft bearing down on the beach.FBRalph Lauren Blue Label jeans poster, 2009By Ralph LaurenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Universal News and Sport (Scotland)While photo editing has long been standard practice in fashion, one 2009 incident broke the unspoken boundaries of acceptability. In a poster for Ralph Lauren Blue Label jeans, the fashion house so severely slimmed a photo of 23-year-old Swedish-French model Filippa Hamilton (a UK size eight) that her head ended up appearing bigger than her pelvis.The results were ridiculed online, and Ralph Lauren was forced to apologise, saying, “We have learned that we are responsible for the poor imaging and retouching that resulted in a very distorted image of a woman’s body.”The saga took another turn when Hamilton claimed she had been fired by Ralph Lauren for being“too fat”. On the US TV show Today,she said she had received a letter stating, “We’re terminating your services because you don’t fit into the sample clothes you need to wear.”Hamilton said of the Photoshop debacle, “They owe American women an apology … I’m very proud of what I look like, and a role model should look healthy.”ELThe Cottingley fairies, 1920ByFrances Griffiths and Elsie WrightView image in fullscreenPhotograph: SSPL/Getty ImagesOne day in the summer of 1917, nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her 16-year-old cousin Elsie Wright went down to the stream at the foot of their family garden in West Yorkshire. They took a camera – to get proof, they said, that fairies lived there, as Frances had always told her parents that was the reason she kept coming home with wet shoes. This is the fourth of five images the girls captured over a few years at Cottingley Beck – in some you can almost detect a mischievous glint in Frances’s eyes.Merrick Burrow, an academic and curator of an exhibition of the Cottingley fairy photos, describes them as an “accidental hoax”. “The prank was intended only for their immediate family, and it was only after Arthur Conan Doyle got wind of the photos that they reached wider attention.” Doyle was (somewhat incongruously, as creator of the arch-rationalist detective Sherlock Holmes) a dedicated spiritualist – these photos, he argued, clearly established the reality of the supernatural realm.Amazingly, they weren’t conclusively debunked until the 1980s, when the cousins finally admitted they had staged the scenes using hatpins to prop up cut-out drawings of fairies based on children’s book illustrations, then disposed of the evidence in a stream. Until her death, however, Frances still claimed that the last photograph the pair took was real.GSElvis gets a buzzcut, 1957ByUnited PressView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Metropolitan Museum/Art Resource/ScalaWhen it was announced in 1957 that, at the height of his fame, Elvis was to be drafted into the US army, it was his hair that quickly became the focus of media attention. His legions of fans were so worried about him having to shave his signature pompadour and sideburns that some politicians even investigated whether he could get an exemption from military buzzcut regulations.Amid the furore, the United Press agency decided to create a mock-up of what the king of rock’n’roll might look like with the typical GI hairstyle, retouching a photo of the singer to remove his quiff (and leaving him with a somewhat disfigured head). “Not all manipulated photographs are intended to deceive,” notes Mia Fineman, a curator at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and author of Faking It: ManipulatedPhotographybefore Photoshop.The following year, hordes of photographers and reporters gathered at an army training centre in Arkansas to document the real thing. The widely circulated photographs of Presley’s actual army haircut have long since eclipsed the imagined version.ELGeneral Grant at City Point, 1902By LC HandyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AlamyThis one-time historical document, depicting Union forces commander Ulysses S Grant at City Point, Virginia, during the American civil war, sat quietly in the US Library of Congress for more than a hundred years before a reference assistant at the prints and photographs division raised questions about it in 2007. Kathryn Blackwell noticed a number of anomalies: the strange angle of the famous general’sneck; the stiff, uncertain pose for someone known to be an expert rider; the horse that does not resemble any of Grant’s known horses; and the uniform, which did not reflect Grant’s rank. Blackwell established that the image was actually a composite of three photographs – the general’s head, a major general’s body and horse, and a background of Confederate prisoners – probably produced by photographer LC Handy for commercial purposes in 1902, well after the American civil war.FBRoosevelt on a moose, 1912ByUnderwood and UnderwoodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty ImagesTeddy Roosevelt was famously outdoorsy, but this cut-and-paste image was debunked soon after it appeared online 15 years ago, when the archives of the photography firm that produced it, Underwood and Underwood, were digitised. It was part of a triptych of 1912’s presidential candidates, each atop the animal associated with their party; Roosevelt’s new Progressives were nicknamed the Bull Moose party.Going Places, 1998Bythe Leeds 13View image in fullscreenPhotograph: courtesy of the Leeds 13In May 1998, art students from the University of Leeds, later dubbed the Leeds 13, pulled off one of the most notorious media hoaxes in British history. As part of a conceptual art project, they documented a fake luxury holiday to Spain, photographing themselves sunbathing, swimming and sipping cocktails, supposedly on the Costa del Sol, in a trip funded by a university grant.In reality, the group never left the UK. Using inflatable paddling pools, sunbed tans and carefully angled shots, they staged the photos in a project titled Going Places, even going so far as to film themselves coming through arrivals at Leeds Bradford airport.Sensationalist headlines followed, with tabloids condemning the group’s supposed misuse of taxpayers’ money. A few days later, they revealed live on Radio 4 that the whole thing had been staged. “We had to disappear for a week, laying low in our student houses and only nipping to the corner shop in disguise,” recalls one member of the group, who wants to remain anonymous. “Until the moment we walked out of arrivals, hauling luggage and gifts supposedly from the Costa del Sol, we lived in a perpetual state of paranoia.” All the Leeds 13 received a first for their final exams.ELAbraham Lincoln’s ghost, 1870By William H MumlerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Indian State MuseumBefore “ghosts” started to appear on William H Mumler’s photographic plates in the early 1860s, spiritualism had been a religious movement defined by knocks and taps, seances and mediums. Now spirit photography spread around the world. Mumler credited the images to the “wonderful magnetic powers” of his wife, a medium, but sceptics claimed they were simple double exposures, and Mumler was hauled into court in the late 1860s, after he had made a fortune selling his images to Americans grieving after the civil war. He was ultimately acquitted for lack of evidence, but not before his reputation had been ruined.After the trial, Mary Todd Lincoln, the famous spiritualist and widow ofAbraham Lincoln, visited Mumler to test his powers, leading to his most famous image. According to his autobiography, she used a false name and hid her identity with a veil up until the moment the photograph was taken. When the figure of her husband appeared on the plate, Mumler’s wife reported that Mary wept “tears of joy”.FBFalling Soldier, 1936ByRobert CapaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Robert Capa/ICP/Magnum Photos“It happened in Spain,” Robert Capa recalled in a radio interview 11 years after the photograph was taken. “It was very much at the beginning of my career.” He recalled how he huddled in a trench with Republican soldiers, taking cover from fascist machine-gun fire. As a few doomed soldiers tried to charge the enemy, Capa held his camera above his head and snapped a picture without looking; he sent the undeveloped films straight to an editor in France, never seeing the image of a soldier at the moment he was shot until he returned from the war months later. By then it had been published in the French magazine Vu to great acclaim, establishing his reputation at just 22.That, at least, was Capa’s story. After his death in 1954, people began to ask questions about the image – was it really taken at the Battle of Cerro Muriano on 5 September 1936? Does it really show someone being shot? For Professor José Manuel Susperregui, at the University of the Basque Country, study of the image has become his life’s work. “What caught my attention,” Susperregui says over email, “was the geometric shape of light-coloured terrain in the lower right corner. It seemed strange to me, and became my main reference for locating the photograph.”Susperregui couldn’t find this distinctive form in the landscape of Cerro Muriano, so he assembled a wider panorama of the area from other photos Capa took on the same day, and circulated it to town halls across the country, asking for assistance. Eventually a student recognised it as a piece of open ground known locally as Llano de Vanda – 55km south of the frontline at the time the image was supposed to have been taken. This cast doubt on Capa’s tales of trenches and machine gunners.Susperregui’s work has brought him into conflict with powerful photography institutions, including Magnum, the agency founded by Capa, and the International Centre of Photography in New York. The image still provokes debate; some argue its symbolic value is more important than whether it was staged. Susperregui is not convinced: “According to press photography association statutes, no staging or falsification is allowed.”FBIraqi detainee, 2004Hoaxer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Bebber/ReutersOn 1 May 2004, the Daily Mirror published a series of incendiary images apparently depicting the abuse of an Iraqi detainee by the Queen’s Lancashire regiment in Basra. The photographs, published just days after the infamous images of abuse by the US army in Abu Ghraib, seemed to show British soldiers beating a handcuffed prisoner and urinating on him. Prime minister Tony Blair condemned the images as “utterly unacceptable” and foreign secretary Jack Straw promised a thorough investigation.Within two weeks, however, the editor who had published them – one Piers Morgan – would be leaving in disgrace, after military sources insisted the images were fake: the rifle seen was not issued to soldiers in Iraq, nor were the hats they wore, and the truck shown was not used there at the time. They argued, therefore, that the images were staged. Morgan was sacked on 14 May.The furore threatened to overshadow the fact that regiment members were linked to horrific abuses in Iraq, including the torture of 26-year-old hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, who later died of his injuries. Though nobody was convicted, an inquiry found serious failings in army leadership, planning and training had led to the abuse, with British soldiers inflicting “violent and cowardly” assaults on Iraqi civilians. Morgan has continued to stand by his decision to publish the images,telling Politico in 2013, “I refuse to apologise. And to accept they were necessarily fakes.”FBThe doomed tourist on 9/11, 2001ByPeter GuzliIn the days after the September 11 attacks, a chain email with a photograph of a man on the observation deck of the World Trade Center, seemingly moments before one of the planes hit, started doing the rounds. “This was from a camera found in the wreckage,” the message claimed. “The guy still has no name and is missing.” Soon he was identified asPeter Guzli, a very much alive Hungarian tourist who had digitally edited a holiday snap taken four years earlier (a “joke intended for my friends only”, he later insisted).In retrospect there were obvious clues of fakery, not least the heavy coat worn by Guzli on a warm September day. “Tourist Guy” soon became a meme, appearing in online images at the sites of other historical disasters, from the sinking of the Titanic to JFK’s assassination.GSSnowball the giant cat, 2000ByCordell HauglieView image in fullscreen“My daughter wanted to send an electronic photo of her cat to her friend,” Cordell Hauglie told reporters. “I got a little carried away.” The image, a modest experiment with Photoshop, spread across the internet, often with a tongue-in-cheek report blaming atomic radiation. It sparked arguments online and was even featured on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Good Morning America. The experience led Hauglie to warn about “the dangers of email … if some dumb guy and his dumb cat can go around the world, you’ve got to be careful”.FBJohn Kerry and Jane Fonda, 2004ByRichard TaylorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: newsmax.comThis image, appearing to show presidential candidate John Kerry next to Jane Fonda at an anti-Vietnam war rally in the 1970s, was part of arightwing smear campaignfocused on his military record. Kerry, a Vietnam vet,hadspoken out against the war – but this scene linking him to “Hanoi Jane” never happened. A man called Richard Taylor had digitally spliced together two photos and added a fake headline and credit to create the look of an old newspaper clipping. Several media outlets, including The New York Times, ran the image before it was debunked.Photographer Ken Light, who shot the original Kerry photo in 1971, was “incredibly upset” and, looking back, thinks this image influenced the election: “A colleague told me his father was going to vote for Bush because of it.”His advice for spotting fake images today? “Trust the photographer, know the source. Look closely – if photos seem too fantastic, they probably are.”GSHelicopter Shark, 2001Hoaxer unknownView image in fullscreenHelicopter Shark spread like wildfire across the internet in 2001, the text assuring viewers that “although this looks like a picture taken from a Hollywood movie, it is in fact a real photo”. It was in fact two real photos: Charles Maxwell’s shark and Lance Cheung’s US air force helicopter. The text also stated this was National Geographic’s photograph of the year, a claim the magazine had to publicly deny.To this day the hoaxer is unknown. “I’d like to make contact,” Maxwell said at the time, “not to get him or her into trouble, but because it’s fun and a good job.”FBJennifer in Paradise, 1987By John KnollView image in fullscreenThe original image …View image in fullscreen… and after Photoshopping. Photographs: © 1987 John Knoll, all rights reservedJohn Knoll took this photograph of his future wife Jennifer (“The next day I proposed to her”) on a beach on the South Pacific island of Bora Bora in 1987. Back home, he and his brother Thomas started using “Jennifer in Paradise” to demo the new image-editing software they were developing, doing things like cloning her figure or adding another island. “It presented good opportunities to show the capabilities of the tool we were building and I found it pleasant to look at,” says Knoll, who keeps a copy of the first test image – untampered with – as a personal memento. After Adobe bought Photoshop in 1988 and released it in 1990, the brothers’ creation went on to became a worldwide phenomenon.GSSelf-Portrait as a Drowned Man, 1840ByHippolyte BayardView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AlamyIn 1839, to much fanfare, the French government announced it had obtained the rights to the daguerreotype – and would give it “free to the world”. Billed as the first viable photographic process, it was named for inventor Louis Daguerre. But fellow Frenchman Hippolyte Bayard felt unjustly overlooked as creator of the equally viable “direct positive” process. In response, he staged this dark joke: an image of himself apparently driven to suicide by neglect of his work. “The corpse you see here is Monsieur Bayard, inventor of the process you have just seen,” he wrote on the back of the print.GSThe Balenciaga pope, 2023ByPablo XavierView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pablo Xavier/MidjourneyThe danger of deepfake tech was memorably demonstrated when this shot of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket wentviralin March 2023. It was made using Midjourney, an AI tool that turns text prompts into images. The eagle-eyed may spot clues to its origins, such as the wonky shadow cast by the pope’s glasses and the strange grip of his hand – not to mention the unlikelihood of his flashy attire. But many were fooled.The image’s creator, a man from Chicago called Pablo Xavier (he withheld his surname, fearing a backlash), told reporters he’d been messing around with Midjourney for a laugh: “I just thought it was funny to see the Pope in a funny jacket.”GSThe Loch Ness monster, 1934ByRobert Kenneth WilsonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AllstarAmong more than1,100reported sightings of the monster said to inhabit the Scottish Highlands loch – including one in January this year – none has made as big a splash as the “surgeon’s photograph”, credited to a physician named Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail in 1934.Many were sceptical, but no one could explain the photo either – until the 1990s, when retired art teacher Alastair Boyd unearthed a little-read article from 1975 in which a man called Ian Wetherell admitted helping stage the image. His father Marmaduke, a big-game hunter, had wanted to get back at the Mail after they debunked his previous claim to have found Nessie’s footprints (actually from a cast made of a hippo’s feet). The long-necked creature seen here was fabricated from wood putty attached to a toy submarine – later sunk in the mud when a water bailiff approached – and Wilson was recruited as a frontman to submit the photos.Despite what he’d uncovered, Boyd remained convinced of Nessie’s existence: “I would stake my life on it,” he said.GSStalin and Nikolai Yezhov, 1937Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenNow you see Nikolai Yezhov …View image in fullscreen… now you don’t. Photographs: Samuel Cole/David King Collection/Tate ImagesThe era of Stalinist purges in the late 1930s, with its dizzying re-evaluation of political figures and past events, was a busy time for photo retouchers. “So much falsification took place during the Stalin years,” wrote the author and collector David King, “that it is possible to tell the story of the Soviet era through retouched photographs.” King’s book from 1997, The Commissar Vanishes, documents how retouchers – working by hand, using brushes, scissors and glue – diligently removed from the historical record figures who had fallen out of favour (they even smoothed out Stalin’s pockmarks).Leon Trotsky was a common target, systematically erased from many photographs documenting his prominent role in the Russian Revolution of 1917. Another famous victim was Nikolai Yezhov, Stalin’s one-time confidant, who went from being head of the NKVD, the secret police, to execution in little more than three years. In the original of this image, Stalin walks with Yezhov next to the Moscow-Volga canal; after his fall from favour, he was scrubbed out.FBThese 28 images show photographic fakes that have fooled the world.

But it was not until hisso-called “liberation day”on 2 April – where the president announced sweeping duties on incoming goods, punishing competitors, allies and small and developing countries alike – that hespooked global financial marketsand provoked fears of spiralling inflation and stagnant growth.Amid a US government bond sell-off, the presidentpaused his most eye-watering tariffsfor 90 days, apart from China, whose goods are set to behit with a 145% levy.Hundreds of Americans got in touch with the Guardian to share how the uncertainty is affecting their consumption habits.Dane, who is retired, worked as an entrepreneur with his wife most of his career before later becoming an English teacher. He said he was a Republican in the 1980s but is fearful about how the US is “not going the right way” under Trump, and is unhappy with his “dystopian” policies towards global allies, the economy, education, scientific research and more.View image in fullscreenDane, 73, ran a printing shop before becoming an English teacher.Photograph: Dane/Guardian CommunityCurrently, Dane is on a trip to Paris and plans to bring home consumer goods potentially hit by 10% tariffs on European Union imports.“We’ll probably be getting tea, bringing back some cheese, some butter,” he said. “I would love tobring back eggsbut that would be a disaster. I’d have scrambled eggs in my suitcase.”Amid tariff uncertainty, Heather, a 61-year-old college professor in Texas, said she and her husband can mostly weather food cost fluctuations, but brought forward the purchase of anew car “inanticipation of price hikes”.She said they owned a 14-year-old Mini Cooper, which ran on gas, that they planned to replace with a hybrid vehicle at some point. They decided to replace their car now to avoid potential inflation – and reduce expenditure on gas.“The economic instability of theTrump administrationcertainly gives one pause,” she said. “It’s just so much instability, chaos and [the] unknown.”It’s a similar story for Stefanie, a 56-year-old educator and former tech worker in Nevada, who bought a Toyota Tacoma to replace her old Jeep as well as converting some investments into cash.Stefanie began strategizing about being more resilient to tariffs as soon as Trump was elected.“The one thing I learned in the first administration is to believe him: he says bizarre things, and then hedoesbizarre things,” she said.I really resent being drafted into this mad trade war, but if there is a silver lining ... people like me will question their unsustainable capitalistic practicesChristine, 41She’s cutting back on subscriptions and future travel plans, while stockpiling kitchen staples such as rice, cooking oils, vinegar and flour and replacing worn-out clothes including shoes and jeans, “before inflation hits”.“The supply chain is so globalized that tariffs really hit everything,” Stefanie said.But for Ishaan*, a 51-year-old engineer in Texas, the economic picture means he is abstaining from major purchases.“Everyone I know has started tightening their belts,” he said. “I am cutting out unnecessary expenses, cancelled my gym membership, focusing on savings.”The focus for Ishaan, who fears higher prices and an economic slowdown, is to build up his savings in cash. He feels “scared to invest in any stocks or bonds right now” amid market volatility.Likewise for Jonathan*, a 70-year-old in New Jersey, the financial fallout from Trump’s trade wars means he has been forced to rule out planned purchases and strip consumption back to the essentials.Jonathan said his individual retirement account (IRA) was initially “decimated” – although it ticked up slightly after Trump paused his tariffs on Wednesday. He said it was currently down about 15%.That means cancelling plans to redo the carpet in his house and replace two old televisions, Jonathan said. “In short, we’ll buy only necessities and pay bills until this stupidity ends.”‘The damage is done’: Trump’s tariffs put the dollar’s safe haven status in jeopardyRead moreRuss a 35-year-old physicist in New Mexico, said the Trump administration’s policies were “causing me to think about what kinds of spending behavior I could have done without this whole time”.He has an eight-year-old phone and nine-year-old MacBook computer that still work fine, which he will not be replacing. The prospect of runaway price rises for consumer electronics, often from China, have led him to reconsider: “Do I really need this, or do I just want this?“I see these things as being as much toys as necessities,” he said. “Maybe I’ll just go back to adumbphoneor something like that – I fantasize sometimes about not getting all these notifications all the time, like thephones we had back in 2005. But maybe that’s a Luddite fantasy.”Russ said that he was already boycotting Amazon and Target – companies that many feel have aligned themselves with Trump’s agenda such asrolling back their own DEI schemes. He’s trying to shop more at local, independent shops rather than “everything stores”, which he notes is more expensive and time consuming but ultimately worth it.“As an American citizen and registered voter, nobody really cares what you think until November of every other year, you feel kind of voiceless,” he said. “You think, well, if dollars are the only tools we have any more, then damn it, I’m going to cast those votes and allocate my spending accordingly.”View image in fullscreenChristine, 41, said she had already seen an impact on her acupuncture business from the economic uncertainty.Photograph: Christine/Guardian CommunityLikewise,small business ownerChristine* said the disruption could cause a wider re-evaluation of US consumer habits.Amid the uncertainty, Christine, 41, stocked up on supplies for her Miami acupuncture business for two years, and bought her son’s fifth birthday present – a bike – early for July. But she said she had already noticed less demand for her work.More broadly, the prospect of inflationary tariffs is accelerating Christine’s reconsideration of how much “stuff” she needs. She’s recently attended “these lovely parties” where friends bring unwanted clothes and they “switch it all around” rather than buying fast fashion.“I really resent being drafted into this mad trade war,” Christine said, “but if there is a silver lining, maybe it’s that at least some people like me will question their unsustainable capitalistic practices.”*Some names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationConsumer spendingUS economyDonald TrumpUS politicsTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So how do you teach kindness to kids?Rhiannon EvansSat 12 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 19.10 EDTShareIn a hostile world, many parents might be anxious about how to raise a kinder generation – and if so, science backs you. Children who are more empathetic “tend to have more positive interactions and more satisfying relationships with friends and family,” says Jessica Rolph, co-founder of early childhood development companyLovevery.Studies showthat kids who can form strong relationships do better in school, she adds.And Jaime Thurston, chief executive of theSchool of Kindness,says it’s “the most important thing we can teach children”. She adds: “Kindness doesn’t just benefit the person we’re kind to, it has a positive impact on our own physical and mental wellbeing. Kindness can be a simple but powerful way to help children feel calmer and happier.”“Children are growing up in a world where they will witness conflict, misinformation and unfiltered emotions,” says psychotherapistAnna Mathur, who insists kindness is “about resilience, critical thinking and understanding they can be kind without being passive. It’s about equipping them to engage with the world thoughtfully, stand up for what’s right, and contribute to a culture of respect and compassion.” So how best to raise kind children?Be a role modelDon’t fear if your kid displays all the tenderness of Hannibal Lecter – kindnesscanbe taught. Experts almost unanimously agree that role-modelling is key – in play, but also in real life. “Our studies show children are strongly influenced by what they observe adults doing,” says Bruce Hood, developmental psychologist and author ofThe Science of Happiness. “If we model sharing, kindness and generosity to others, children will instinctually copy this behaviour. Likewise, if they see adults modelling greed and cruelty, these will be considered normal.”Kindness is contagious … the person you are kind to feels happier, so is more likely to be kindMathur suggests letting your child see kindness as part of daily life by encouraging anything from opening a door to sharing a snack. “Kids are always watching, and when they see us speak kindly they take it in. They also witness the response, be it a de-escalation, or seeing someone comforted, so they see the benefits.”Practise your Ps and QsIt’s not all about big gestures, the child psychologist Laverne Antrobus says. “Please” and “thank you” – and, yes, modelling it – are important. “Those are the words that really start the building blocks of kindness,” she says, branding them “the oil in the engine” of kindness and consideration.Conversations are key“What kind thing did you do or see today?” is one to add to post-school conversations, suggests Thurston. “My son said there was a boy being mean to him,” she adds. “We chatted about what might be going on in that boy’s mind. Maybe he feels sad or angry, doesn’t have many friends, or no one is kind to him. We don’t know what caused that boy to act that way, but people who are happy and confident don’t tend to be mean.”These conversations help children understand kindness is a choice, something Liz Bates, author ofCool to Be Kind,says is key. She suggests asking: “Why might someone choose to be unkind if they could choose to be kind? If children aren’t asked that, they never get an opportunity to think about it or question behaviours.”Acknowledge and praise“Praise the effort, not just the outcome,” advises Mathur, by saying things such as: “It was so kind of you to ask your sister if she was OK when she fell over.” This gently affirms and encourages empathy and kindness.Antrobus agrees that children need to see the benefits of kindness – which requires feedback. “Good nursery teachers say things like ‘That was kind, you really thought about that person,’ and you just see the child’s face light up. They’re thinking: ‘I’m the most special person in the world, because not only have I done something good, it’s also benefited somebody else.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sementsova Lesia/Getty Images PlusFailing that, go literalWhen she started to fear an empathy gap in her own pre-teen children, Lorraine Candy, a podcaster and author ofMum, What’s Wrong With You? 101 Things Only the Mothers of Teenage Girls Know,took the advice of a family therapist: “I put a note on the inside of our front door that read: ‘Do one kind thing today’. It was a neurological reminder or mantra to be kind – I ignored the teen eye-rolling because I saw it as part of my own parental role-modelling.”It’s natural for kids to seem unkind“Young children are naturally egocentric,” says Rolph. “This is a normal part of their development, as they must first make sense of the world around them through their own eyes, before they can see it through someone else’s. In fact, until they approach preschool age, they have little reason to believe that others might have feelings or thoughts different from their own.”Melanie Fisher, the wellbeing and early help specialist at the nursery chain Bright Horizons, says children’s demonstrations of empathy can be largely inconsistent until they are about six. “This isn’t selfishness because it isn’t yet conscious behaviour,” she says. “The part of young children’s brains in control during ‘stressful’ moments is the emotional/survival brain. They do not have the ability to think first then choose their behaviour. In distress, children are only concerned with their own feelings and do not have the capacity to show kindness or care for others. This isn’t selfishness – it’s survival.”Don’t fear ‘unkindness’ when it happensSeeing your kid lash out can feel like a dagger to the heart. But it’s important not to panic or act negatively. Instead, Antrobus advises reassurance: “Our job is to help them know they can recover from the situation and that we don’t think that’s them, full stop.”“It’s important to step back from fear,” says Mathur. “Unkind moments don’t mean your child is an unkind person … Unkindness often stems from unmet needs: fatigue, hunger, overwhelm or feeling out of control.” She advises using those moments as a gentle teaching point, rather than just correcting – for example saying: “I know it didn’t feel fair that Jonny jumped the queue for the swing. But hitting him isn’t the answer. How else might we tell someone that something isn’t fair?”Put yourself in their position says Fisher: “Being kind doesn’t always come naturally, even to adults.”Teach them to be kind to themselves“I think unkindness is the sign of a young person not valuing themselves, or feeling they are worth being kind to,” says Bates. “It’s important to help children to develop a sense that we all have good bits and not so good bits.”As early as five or six, introduce the idea of “Mean Mate” and “Patient Pal”. Get kids to imagine they’re playing a game with two friends and when they make a mistake, what reactions those friends might have. “Mean Mate” might say: “You’re stupid”. “Patient Pal” will understand it wasn’t deliberate, be calm and say: “It’s OK, try again”. Introduce the idea that we all have both characters inside our heads, but can decide which one to spend time with and listen to.It’s never too early to startAs soon as children can listen or observe you, they can take in role-modelling of kindness. Fisher adds: “Babies do reflect the emotional state of those around them: they may become distressed when another baby cries or smile back when their parent smiles. As they do this, ‘mirror neurons’ in the brain are at work, and are creating the foundation for the development of empathy.”Stealth …Books are a stealth tool for parents. “Children are more likely to help and comfort others when their parents talk about emotions while reading stories,” says Rolph. “During storytime, talk about the characters’ feelings and connect them to your child’s experiences.” Two books that Mathur recommends areHave You Filled a Bucket Today?by Carol McCloud andThe Invisible Boyby Trudy Ludwig.… and games“Co-operative play starts around the age of three when children are learning the concepts of sharing, turn-taking, winning and losing,” says Fisher. She says board games, creative activities, folding washing or even cooking together can be opportunities to role model and practise kindness.Rolph suggests using dolls and toys to model empathy: “Take turns to wash their baby doll and pretend water gets in the doll’s eyes. When the baby ‘cries’, model how to respond: ‘Oh, the baby is sad. I wonder what we should do?’” Show your child how to wipe the doll’s eyes and give it a comforting hug.Lots of people say I want my child to be happy, but what if your child doesn’t encounter another young person who is being kind to them?Exploit the bonds of friendshipIn researching her book, Candy learned that the vital work teens do to form an identity separate from their parents can leave little time to think about others. She notes, “Their peers were the most important people in their lives – for their friends, nothing was too much trouble. But parents can make a difference teaching kindness and empathy. I offered my elder daughters a go at critical thinking: ‘I wonder why your mate is being mean to you?’ I would say. ‘Maybe something has happened?’ I would suggest without judgment to look beneath things emotionally.”Help to create a kind societyWe want our child to be kind, but we also want our kid to be treated kindly – and for that we need other parents to teach their kids kindness. “Lots of people say I want my child to be happy, but what if your child doesn’t encounter another young person who is being kind to them?” says Antrobus. “Happiness doesn’t just appear by itself, does it?”Thurston shares a nice snippet to tell older children: “One thing we teach in our workshops is that kindness is contagious,” he says. “When we’re kind to someone, that kind act can positively affect up to 125 people. Because the person you’re kind to feels happier, so is more likely to be kind, and so on.”Kind kidsdon’t have to be people pleasersSome may fear that prioritising kindness creates anxious people pleasers. Not so, says Mathur: “True kindness comes from authenticity, not obligation. It’s important to let children see kindness happen in limited time. Model by saying things like ‘I can’t help right now, but I care about you’.”“Encourage genuine giving, not forced politeness,” she adds. And instead of insisting kids share, help them understand why, by saying things like: “How would it feel if your friend shared their toy with you?” You can also check they don’t feel pressured into kindness by asking: “Do you want to do this, or do you feel like you have to?”Learn from man’s best friend“If all else fails, you can get a dog,” says Candy. “Nothing teaches teens more about caring and kindness than loving a dog.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingChildrenPsychologyFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gaga’s replacement performance, in her country-tinged Joanne era – as usual, she was years ahead of the pop curve – more than sufficed; perhaps only Beyoncé can hold a candle to her in terms of true-blue live performance ability, and shedelivered the setof a consummate entertainer and generational talent. But Gaga felt that she had unfinished business. “I’ve had a vision I’ve never been able to fully realize at Coachella for reasons beyond our control,” she wrote in anInstagram postannouncing her return to the desert for another headliner slot this spring. “I have been wanting to go back and do it right, and I am.”Coachella 2025: desert festival balances the new and the nostalgiaRead moreDid she ever. Gaga, more than any other contemporary pop star, has approached pop as transmogrification, live performance like a hunter – the piercing gaze, transparent hunger and annihilating focus of an apex predator. And with Gagachella, as her fans have already termed a thesis statement of a set, she goes in for the kill. You knew from the minute she appeared in full deranged queen regalia, the head of a multi-story hoop skirt that opened to reveal a birdcage prison of backup dancers, that the vision was nigh. The nearly two-hour performance, covering 22 songs from her dance pop catalogue, joins Beyoncé’s postponed Homecoming in the pantheon of groundbreakingCoachellaheadliner sets – a fully realized vision of a pop master, a testament to years of hard-earned experience at the highest level, and a banger dance party with production and delivery in a league above her peers.At 38, Gaga reigns as a monarch in pop music, a fact she wielded to stupefying effect on Friday evening to a crowd that extended far beyond any eye could see. “Welcome to my house,” she intoned before opener Bloody Mary – understatement of the month, as her house was the sprawling skeleton of a neoclassical opera house, her domain an arresting realm of elaborate make-believe. For the purpose ofMayhem, the new album that returns to her original principles of pounding volume, dirty synths, high theatrics and irresistible hooks, Gaga conjures an entire fantasy of witches and queens, a typically twisted, self-referential fairytale of literal dark and light told in five acts.View image in fullscreenLady Gaga at Coachella.Photograph: YouTubeGagachella was notably not a full career retrospective – no tracks from Artpop, Joanne or Chromatica, with just A Star Is Born’s Shallow as the lone representative of Gaga’s decade-long pivot away from gritty, sticky music that makes you want to move. Yet it still felt comprehensive, all-encompassing, by seamlessly braiding her foundational texts – The Fame, Born This Way – with her latest one. Mayhem is easily Gaga’s best album since Artpop, both a return to form and a hard-won study of warring personas contained in one self, pop music with sharp teeth and beastly desire. Ever the visionary and literalist, she rendered her internal strife as a court battle between a domineering queen in black and an innocent in white, with full wig changes from black bob to blond ringlets necessitating long, pulsating transitions that lavished attention on her army of backup dancers and, frankly, metal instrumentalists.Gagachella, too, marks a return to form – from the outset of her career, Gaga has treated pop music as possession, her spasmodic dance style like an exorcism, more refreshingly loose and instinctual than her peers. The Mother Monster’s visions – a chess battle to the death (Poker Face), rage at fame sung to a skeleton (Perfect Celebrity), new Gaga strangled by 2009 VMAs Gaga in a zombie-filled grave (Disease, the concert high point that left me agape) – possessed Coachella with an unstoppable need to dance, primal screams of the gagged.Gaga’s voice, honed with time, was more dextrous and luminous than ever, and though she didn’t miss a note, the performance was as much a feat of acting as singing – Gaga the possessed, the haughty, the hunted, the strangled, the Oscar nominee. Her performances often have the feeling of life-or-death stakes; even a track as sinuously groovy as Killah gets the embodiment of a demonic fever, accompanied by French producer Gesaffelstein entombed in black, the oil-slicked phantom of Gaga’s twisted opera.But in the spirit of duality, she also broke character just enough – to salute her fans, her fiance, her spiritual belief of interconnectedness. “The truth is we’re all one. It’s all just one big fucking thing,” she said before the triumphant victory lap of Born This Way. “I love you so much.” The mayhem carried through a transcendent finale of Bad Romance staged, naturally, as a Frankenstein-esque revivification with plague masks, Gaga’s face at the conclusion shifting between performance snarl and personal joy. With both, she led not one but two extended curtain calls with the full cast and crew – unusual for a music festival, but fitting for an all-timer night of pop theater in the desert.Explore more on these topicsCoachellaLady GagaFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Surely it is now or never.Rory McIlroy will take a lead into the closing round of the Masters for the first time since 2011. That sentence barely does justice to a Saturday of high drama at Augusta National where McIlroy created history then threatened to feature in his own Shakespearean tragedy once more before re-establishing daylight between himself and the field. That sentence barely does justice, either, to what McIlroy is on the verge of. We are now in the position of fearing what on earth the impact will be on him should he not prevail.The stresses, strains, pressure and pains associated with McIlroy’s quest to win a career grand slam were perfectly obvious on day three in Georgia. Yet by the end of it, McIlroy stood tall. Whisper it, but he looks to have comprehensively conquered what demons this major has tended to throw in his way. Abundantly clear, too, was the scale of support McIlroy has at Augusta. There must be people in the galleries who do not want him to don a Green Jacket, it is just that you cannot hear any of them.The Masters 2025: day three updates from Augusta – liveRead moreMcIlroy’s second successive 66 means that at 12 under par, he has two shots to spare overBryson DeChambeau. Corey Conners is two further back. An added layer of poetry here is provided by DeChambeau’s presence. It was DeChambeau who broke McIlroy’s heart at the US Open last year. McIlroy will take nothing for granted – and his focus has been so striking this week – but the potential to level that score with DeChambeau cannot be ignored. This has scope to be a Masters conclusion for the ages. In the third day’s final act, DeChambeau holed out from 16 yards and off the 18th green to complete his 69.Those who insist the Masters only gets under way on the back nine on Sunday have it badly wrong. The scale of sporting drama on Saturday was from the finest of scriptwriters. McIlroy opened with five threes in a row, the first time that had ever been done in a Masters round. He added a sixth for good measure. McIlroy was dominant; at 2.53pm, having chipped in for an eagle from behind the 2nd green, he snatched the tournament lead for the first time in this edition. In a stretch of 13 holes, McIlroy was to go from seven adrift of the lead to the owner of that by two.McIlroy’s advantage was four as he strode from the 8th tee – 11 played seven under – as DeChambeau bogeyed the 7th. This felt straightforward. Too straightforward.View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau will play alongside Rory McIlroy in the final round.Photograph: David Cannon/Getty ImagesMcIlroy’s dropped shot at the 8th was a ragged one. Conners, his playing partner, produced stunning birdies at the 9th and 10th. McIlroy three putted the latter. His leeway was now just one. The McIlroy of old may have wobbled. The McIlroy of cliche would be influenced by scar tissue. Instead, this version of the 35-year-old birdied the 13th and played a glorious second to the par five 15th. With a 6ft eagle putt converted, McIlroy was a quartet of strokes ahead once again.DeChambeau ramped up the crowd either side of a tap-in birdie at the 16th. The Californian looked ready to chase McIlroy down the penultimate hole. McIlroy had 10ft for birdie there, his chance missing to the left. The Northern Irishman was fortunate at the last, his drive cracked right before rebounding onto safe ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Swede is six under after a 69. Åberg had the opportunity to put further pressure on those above him at the last but pushed his birdie putt. Should he fall one shot short here, that moment will be a point of reference. Åberg, a Ryder Cup team-mate of McIlroy, knows all about the leader’s strength. “I think when he plays his best golf, it’s hard to catch him,” Åberg said. “I don’t think there’s a lot of guys in this world that can catch him when he plays at his best. You can just tell that he trusts his game so much, that knowing that at any time he can make six birdies in a row.He can hit it as high as anyone and he can stop it on a dime. He knows that and he definitely uses that to his advantage.”Scottie Scheffler failed to make expected headway, a 72 leaving him at five under. Patrick Reed did, his 69 also moving him to a shot ahead of the world No 1. Discount Reed, a former Masters champion, at your peril. Another past winner, Zach Johnson, lurks at four under after a 66. The Open and US PGA champion Xander Schauffele sits on the same aggregate as Johnson. Jason Day’s 71 nudged him to minus five. Shane Lowry bogeyed the last for an identical position. Tyrrell Hatton’s love-hate relationship with Augusta National is again heading for the divorce courts.Amid the chaos, Min Woo Lee was handed a one-shot penalty after it was decided he caused his ball to move – and not when hitting a golf shot – on the 13th fairway. Jordan Spieth complained about mud balls, a theme the Masters organisers would probably rather all of us ignore. Augusta National announced a record prize fund for this year’s tournament, meaning $4.2m will be bestowed on the winner. McIlroy stopped caring about the money long ago.He admitted he barely slept before a Sawgrass playoff in March, JJ Spaun eventually seen off as the Players Championship was claimed. More tossing and turning awaits. But it could be worth it. My goodness, it could be worth it.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersThe ObserverRory McIlroyBryson DeChambeauPGA TourEuropean TourUS sportsGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

The 3-0 win over Real Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final will live forever; the return is eagerly awaited on Wednesday.It was always likely to be lower-key here, Mikel Arteta making five changes to his team and watching them labour. The blood and thunder of the Madrid tie was missing; the do-or-die imperatives. It was a slog for Arsenal and as the hour mark approached, Arteta knew he had to do something. He readied three stellar substitutes – Myles Lewis-Skelly, Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka.Arsenal v Brentford: Premier League – liveRead morePerhaps, it was their presence on the touchline that provided the inspiration. Or maybe it was just that Declan Rice is having the week of his life. His two free-kick goals against Madrid had even got the royal seal of approval, Prince William backing him to take over as England’s set-piece taker. Either way, Arsenal were in front before Arteta could make the triple change.David Raya claimed aBrentfordcorner and when he threw out to Rice, the midfielder was just outside his own area. What followed was a devastating run to the edge of the Brentford box, Rice getting into that lengthy stride before drawing the chasing defender, Yoane Wissa, and playing in the overlapping Thomas Partey, who did the rest.Arsenal could not see it through. On the balance of the chances, they deserved to win but not by dint of the entertainment they provided or the intensity they brought. Brentford have been impressive on their travels in recent weeks, winning five of their previous six matches, even if the one before this had been the defeat at Newcastle. It would go down as their latest fine result away from the Gtech Stadium.Brentford do not have anything to distract them. Thomas Frank was entitled to say his team were “excellent defensively” and Wissa was the hero, punishing Arsenal when they failed to defend properly after clearing a corner. They were exposed when Bryan Mbeumo released the substitute, Michael Kayode, up the right and his cross picked out Nathan Collins, who headed back from the far post. Wissa was alive to the bounce, spinning to lash home his 15th goal of thePremier Leagueseason.Arsenal would finish with 10 men, Jorginho departing in the 85th minute after a heavy fall that looked to wind him; Arteta had already made his five changes. One of them was to remove Partey, who the manager said had “felt something so we didn’t want to take any risks”. Arteta was asked whether Partey would be OK for the second leg against Madrid. “We don’t know,” he replied. “The doctors will check him.”The Arsenal manager was desperate to avoid any injuries and it was why he reacted so explosively to Christian Nørgaard’s scissors-style foul on Gabriel Martinelli in the 28th minute, for which the Brentford captain was booked. Arteta ranted at the fourth official and Martinelli would later describe it as a potential leg-breaker. Nørgaard attempted to apologise in the tunnel at half-time only for Martinelli to wave him away. “I thought it was a strong yellow but it was yellow,” Frank said.View image in fullscreenThomas Partey’s shot beats Mark Flekken to give Arsenal the lead.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAArteta was always going to rotate; Jurrien Timber and Mikel Merino were also used only as substitutes. And if there were huge cheers for Rice at the outset, the Arsenal support were otherwise subdued. “The atmosphere was different to Tuesday, that’s for sure,” Arteta said. “I don’t know if it [the Madrid tie] was playing in the back of the [minds of the] crowd.”Arteta started with Partey at right-back, Kieran Tierney at left-back and Oleksandr Zinchenko as a No 8/No 10. There was a surge of excitement on 26 minutes when Tierney flicked home a fine header from an Ethan Nwaneri cross but he was clearly in an offside position, which was confirmed by the VAR.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was the sum total of their attacking threat before the interval. William Saliba released Martinelli with a fizzed ball over the top towards the end of the first half, which the Arsenal winger killed with a good first touch and Brentford were grateful to Ajer for a saving tackle.The visitors were comfortable and so the nature of the concession had to gall Frank. It was not a part of his defensive plan to be caught out on an end-to-end counter. Rice just had to be the driver of it, leaving Mikkel Damsgaard in his wake but credit, as well, to Partey for his support run.Saka had Arsenal’s best chance after Wissa’s equaliser, robbing Mark Flekken after the goalkeeper had taken a poor touch.

Instead of the doubles specialist, Olivia Nicholls, present in The Hague precisely for these matches and with Harriet Dart positioned as the first-choice doubles team, the British captain chose to rely on the pure firepower provided by her singles players.It turned out to be a stroke of genius.Katie Boulterand Jodie Burrage, both ranked outside the top 250 in doubles and with minimal experience together, produced an inspired performance to lead their team to victory with a dominant 6-2, 6-2 win over Suzan Lamens and Demi Schuurs.After defeating Germany 2-1 on Friday, Great Britain’s 2-1 win over the Netherlands qualified them for the Billie Jean King Cup Finals, an eight-team knockout tournament that takes place in Shenzhen, China after the US Open in September.“Today, they executed the game plan as well as they could have done and just overpowered the opposition,” said Keothavong. “In terms of the decision-making process, it was always an option for us which I had up my sleeve and they went out there and did the job.”In the absence of Emma Raducanu, Sonay Kartal opened the tie with another assured performance by defeating Eva Vedder 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. This week has marked another step forward in her evolution after a career-best year in which the 23-year-old has established herself inside the top 100 at No 60.View image in fullscreenSonay Kartal won singles rubbers in each of Great Britain’s victories against Germany and the Netherlands.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images for LTAKartal’s victory set the stage for a battle of the No 1 singles players. Lamens, ranked No 70, has quickly established herself as a tough opponent for all. While Boulter has made improvements on clay, an in-form, top-100 opponent is still a significant challenge for her on a surface that blunts her power and often exposes her lack of adaptability. On this occasion, Lamens was a step too far as she fell 6-4, 6-3.Great Britain boast a solid pool of singles players, but their doubles lineups had become a notable weakness. Last year, Nicholls and Heather Watson were flattened in the decisive doubles rubber of the BJK Cup semi-finals against Slovakia. On Friday, Nicholls, the doubles No 31, and Dart were similarly dominated by a German team that had been defeated ˆby Lamens and Schuurs one night earlier.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Instead of relying on the same duo, Keothavong opted to take a risk. Although Boulter and Burrage are close friends, this decisive rubber marked just the second time that they had ever played together, their only other match a first-round loss at Nottingham in 2021.

In 2024 the Red Roses led Ireland 38-3 at the break.In the second half in CorkEngland shifted through the gearsand they blew their opposition away to extend their winning run in the Six Nations to 32 games.England outlast Ireland’s resistance and stay on course for grand slamRead moreThe head coach thought the second-half performance was outstanding, saying: “The girls are really good at resolving issues. They remained really calm and as much as Ireland tackled really well in the first half, we probably put ourselves into the washing machine hence the reason it required a little bit of adjustment at half-time.“In the second half we got more momentum. When we get momentum you see our intuitive skills come out. We are ruthless when we get momentum. We crushed their lineout, their lineout went nowhere. Their attack went nowhere in the second half. I think they only got out of their half through kick-off [in the second 40] so we were pretty ruthless, There were a couple of team tries – [Meg] Jones’ and one of [Sarah] Bern’s – they were beautiful tries.”The Red Roses have outlined clear plans in team selection in their opening three Six Nations games and Mitchell says their next one is no different. They will play Scotland in Leicester next Saturday and he confirmed the team has already been named for that encounter.He said: “We want to keep getting better so we have to keep asking questions of ourselves, where can we get better? The girls are good at that, we have a very good leadership group. We have a squad that is definitely focused.“You get three jobs within a team [starter, finisher and non-playing] and the girls at the moment are definitely focused on that. Not everyone plays but everyone wins if they do their job well and raise the training level.”From an Irish perspective, Scott Bemand said it was tough to let a game get away. “As we pick through the bones of it, there were questions asked of an English team that have not been asked of them recently,” the head coach said. “We got them under pressure, they’ve had to go back into the dressing room and rediscover how they play the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a harsh punishment for an error made by the team rather than drivers.In the end the gap at the Sakhir Circuit over the single lap was not quite as cavernous as practice had suggested, with Russell only a tenth and a half back. However, the only driver who has still managed to stay in touch with McLaren in championship terms, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who won at thelast round in Japanwhere conditions favoured him, was left floundering in the desert heat in seventh.Red Bull made a setup change going into qualifying but Verstappen was far from happy with the result and he was fighting it to try and wrestle out a decent lap, struggling with the understeer he dislikes. “There’s something really wrong with the car,” he told the team. Later he added that his brakes were “terrible”.TheMcLarenalso remains tricky in qualifying, a little unstable in the rear which can be testing over a single lap on low fuel but is at its best in race pace, where the ease with which it works the tyres lends it even more of an advantage.Having been on top in every practice session and now qualifying, the prospects for how well it might run on Sunday are daunting indeed. The team having claimed their first pole in Bahrain are now in every position to convert it to their debut win at the circuit.“I felt confident out there pretty much all weekend,” said Piastri. “The others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted but I still delivered the laps when it mattered, which is the most important thing.”Norris, however, was unsurprisingly disappointed with his final run, dropping crucial time in the first sector that has left him with a huge challenge on Sunday while his teammate and title rival can make hay with pole. “No idea what happened, just not quick enough,” a clearly unhappy Norris said.The British driver has conceded recently that there are certain phases the car goes through with which he is not entirely comfortable, where he feels it is not responding as predictably as he would hope, which he and the team had been looking to address this weekend. It is clearly not quite there yet as Piastri very much had the edge at the Sakhir Circuit.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri saw off the challenge of George Russell, who was later given a one-place grid penalty, to take pole position at the Bahrain GP.Photograph: Darko Bandić/APMcLaren had expected to run well in Bahrain, where they had shown such promise in testing and in the heat and high degradation surface that suits the MCL39 so well, with the circuit offering very little grip to sit uncomfortably alongside its brutal tyre wear. This will induce variables on Sunday that will be a world away from the single-stop procession in Japan last weekend.Qualifying will not decide all then but whether anyone can come close enough to Piastri to involve him in a fight is a different question altogether. Norris, in contrast, must hope at best to move through the field and claim a podium place.Thus far Verstappen has clung on to McLaren with great determination and grit, currently trailing Norris by only one point in the championship, with Piastri 13 points down in third. But while the world champion pulled off a coup to win in Suzuka, the limitations of the Red Bull were once more exposed in Bahrain, indicating quite how far they have yet to go.Equally, just as the McLaren might expect even more in the race, the Red Bull fell away in similar hot, high-degradation conditions at the opening two rounds in Australia and Japan and may well be similarly under the cosh on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was only a year ago that Gary O’Neil seemed one of the brightest young managers in the Premier League, butby December it was over. This is how football is: when a blip becomes a slump becomes a spiral, the only solution is the sacrifice of the manager. It often works: Wolves have improved dramatically under Vítor Pereira and, while they may not yet be mathematically safe from relegation, they surely soon will be.The life of man,the folk carol reminds us, is but a span; the life of a manager is even shorter (but a spanager?). O’Neil had replaced Scott Parker at Bournemouth four games into 2022-23, after their9-0 defeat by Liverpool, and had kept them up comfortably, only to be jettisoned for Andoni Iraola. He took over Wolves less than a week before last season began and had them in the top half in March.Potter’s lack of impact at West Ham is all down to disastrous succession plan | Jacob SteinbergRead moreBut form collapsed last season after anFA Cup quarter-final defeat by Coventryand they finished 14th. When O’Neil wasdismissed in December,Wolves lay second-bottom, five points from the last safe spot, having won three of his final 26 league games.He had begun almost visibly to unravel, the intense gaze developing an unnerving wildness as he discussed another video assistant referee outrage. There was a period when it felt the main justification for keeping VAR was as a morally dubious psychological experiment in just how far one man could be pushed, O’Neil as a modern-day Job but with poverty and boils replaced by Howard Webb and inconsistent interpretations of what it is to be interfering.How could he pick up 1.24 points per game in the first 62 Premier League games of his managerial career and then crash to 0.54 points per game in their next 26? It’s not just O’Neil; plenty of other managers have followed a similar trajectory. Is it just regression to the mean, as those who deny the phenomenon of the new-manager bounce would claim?Can it really just be confidence, that once opposing sides start to work a manager out and results begin to falter, players lose faith and need a new messiah? This is such a familiar phenomenon, it’s perhaps overlooked how strange it is, the way it’s almost accepted in the lower reaches of the Premier League that after 18 months or so a manager’s usefulness is somehow spent and he must be replaced. Perhaps it is even true. Perhaps there is a limit to how many defeats, how much pressure, any one manager can take. Perhaps players need the change to break the routine.View image in fullscreenGary O’Neil shows his frustration on the Molineux touchline against Manchester City in October.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesFor Wolves, replacing O’Neil was the only realistic step afterlosing at home to Ipswichin a game when their players lost all discipline, with Rayan Aït-Nouri sent off during a post-match confrontation when Matheus Cunha stole a pair of glasses from a member of the opposing staff.As Southampton and Leicester have shown, while it may be straightforward enough to work out when a manager has to be jettisoned, finding the right replacement is far harder. While the huge gulf that exists between the Premier League and the Championship is clearly a major factor, none of what has happened in the past four months has been inevitable.In fairness, Ivan Juric, appointed four days after Pereira, had an almost impossible task, one he took on with an admirably sanguine attitude. As he gave detailed instructions to his substitutesat Tottenham last Sundaywith his side 2-0 down and about to be relegated, it was possible to believe he had somehow managed to miss Southampton’s results for the previous months. But fair play for the seriousness with which he took the task of trying to avert the earliest relegation in Premier League history.Leicester’s decision to turn to Ruud van Nistelrooyat the end of November, though, looks deeply flawed. However unpopular Steve Cooper was, with his Nottingham Forest connections and the perception he played negative football, under him Leicester were not losing eight successive home games without scoring; the last time they scored a home goal O’Neil was still manager of Wolves and Russell Martin was still at Southampton.Wolves, though, do seem to have found the right man in Pereira. They go into Sunday’s game at home to Tottenham having taken 23 points from 15 games under him. They began the weekend 12 points clear of the drop zone, having gained 20 on Leicester, 18 on Southampton and 15 on Ipswich in just over three months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It helps that there is a worldliness to him, having coached in eight countries, and that he has historically been the volatile one. This was not the earnest O’Neil with his neat haircut appealing for order, it was somebody familiar with chaos, somebody who has at times been its agent. When you have returned to Fenerbahce after taking them to court, or used your mother‑in‑law’s health as an excuse to quit Corinthians only to take over at Flamengo a month later, some post‑match argy-bargy and spectacle theft probably does not feel that significant.View image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen (left) has eased the goalscoring burden on Matheus Cunha.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockHe has been very astute in getting fans on board, not just in what he has said, his talk of the great Wolves family, but in visiting pubs, drinking pints and eating pies. At the same time, Wolves look better organised and are conceding fewer. Cunha has scored some vital goals and in his absence Jørgen Strand Larsen, a very different type of forward, has stepped up with four goals in three games.But those are details. The most important aspect is the mood Pereira has created, partly through his personality, partly through well-chosen gimmicks and partly through his organisational capacity. That will change at some point, perhaps in a few months, perhaps in a few years. He will be ousted, and the next messiah will come in.That is how football is. The life of managers is as grass, they flourish like a flower of the field; the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.Explore more on these topicsWolverhampton WanderersThe ObservercommentShareReuse this content"

They are targeting the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 so may not return to a race where the result is the only thing that counts.“The Boat Race has always been on my bucket list,” says Collins, who has added even more strength to a Cambridge crew that have won the past seven women’s races. “It’s an incredible event, with a unique mix of athletes in terms of their age and experience. You have athletes coming from the Olympics rowing alongside students who’ve learned to row at either Oxford or Cambridge in their colleges. And together we have to form a team, which is a real challenge and great fun.“I’ve really enjoyed the whole experience, particularly meeting Heidi again and getting to know her over the past few days. There are usually 10 or 20 teams in the mix, but this time it’s just two teams so we’ve had time to talk properly. We didn’t even realise we had the same birthday until this year, things like that. It’s pretty crazy that we’ve had these parallel journeys, but it’s super‑cool.”Oxford’s Long chips in: “I was looking back to see when we first raced each other and it was 11 years ago at the junior world championships in Hamburg. We probably learned to row around a similar time and made similar decisions to go to collegiate rowing programs, go for the Olympics and now come back to university.View image in fullscreenClaire Collins is hoping for a eighth successive Cambridge win.Photograph: John Walton/PA“I want to continue representing Great Britain internationally and still dream of winning an Olympic gold medal, so that is going to be a priority the closer it gets to LA. But for now this experience has been unbelievable. I am super-excited to race and will take it where it comes after Monday morning.”Talk of their first meeting in Hamburg reminds Long that when she first applied to Oxford as an undergraduate the women’s Boat Race did not take place on the same course as the men’s race and was hidden away in Henley with little media interest. Given the gradual move towards greater parity between the sexes in sport, it seems incredible that Sunday is just the 10th time the women’s race will be held on the Thames with equal billing and live TV coverage on the BBC.While the 100th anniversary of the women’s event in two years’ time will be a cause for big celebrations, the smaller landmark this weekend should be the source of some embarrassment given how slow these old institutions were to adapt, although Long takes heart from how much has changed during her career.“When I was applying to Oxford there was no women’s Boat Race on the championship course,” she says. “So in my university lifetime it has completely changed and women are now able to go out there and compete in exactly the same format as the men.“I remember when I first watched the Boat Race you just watched the men. The sad thing was I didn’t realise there was anything wrong with that, it was just the norm. You just would go and watch men’s sport.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sport gives you so much more than just some physicality – the friends you make and the lessons you learn are one of a kind.”Long’s friendship with Collins is testament to that, but while the rivalry between the crews is friendly enough Cambridge remain deeply aggrieved that Molly Foxell and Kate Crowley, plus Matt Heywood from the men’s club, are unable to race after Oxford successfully petitioned for aban on students studying for postgraduate certificatesin education, rather than degrees, competing.All three have remained with the squad in London this week and will join the celebrations if Cambridge maintain their recent dominance. As well as winning seven women’s races in succession the Light Blues have won five of the past six men’s races and are seeking three in a row.“At this point we’re really excited for the team, for the whole team, to be able to enjoy the whole day and compete,” Collins says of the controversy. “It really does take a whole team to compete, so while I’m quite sad that some people on our team can’t race it doesn’t mean they haven’t contributed to what’s going to happen on race day.“It is sport, so what happens on the day is what people will remember, but the journey that gets you there is also important. Like in the buildup to an Olympics, the Boat Race is very much a journey, and those teammates of ours are very much a part of that.“They’re very impressive athletes, they’re very impressive students, very impressive human beings.

Financial markets and nation states responding to the dawn of a new economic era and the reality of new barriers to trade. I am in no doubt that the imposition of tariffs will have a profound impact on the global economy and the economy at home.This change can be unsettling for families who are worried about the cost of living and businesses concerned about what it means for them. But our task as a government is not to be knocked off course or to take rash action which risks undermining people’s security. Instead, we must rise to meet the moment and do what is right in Britain’s national interest.That’s why we’re taking action. On Monday we announced plans to ease pressure on British car manufacturers by easing theEV mandate. On Wednesday we announced abrand-new theme parkto be built in Bedfordshire – raking in £50bn for the economy. On Thursday the prime minister confirmed £30m to reopen Doncaster airport. And on Friday we sawgrowth tick up by 0.5%– the biggest rise since last June.This is the plan for change in action – driving infrastructure projects that will lead to the growth we need to improve living standards for everyone.For too long the global economy has not worked for working people. Industries have been allowed to decline or to disappear. The cost of living crisis has exposed our vulnerability to the actions of Vladimir Putin, who has used energy prices as a weapon of war. And economic mismanagement has left countries more exposed to global shocks.Insecurity has become a virus plaguing our economies, with an endemic of low pay and poor working conditionsInsecurity has become a virus plaguing our economies, with an endemic of low pay, poor working conditions and inactivity. And Britain has not been alone in this. That’s why our response must be guided by our national interest and security for working people.Let’s start with stability. Economic stability is the precondition of growth. At a time of global uncertainty, businesses will rightly be looking to countries that can provide them with the confidence to invest and to grow. It’s why we took the decision at the autumn budget last year to fix the foundations of our economy and to put our public finances back on a firm footing after years of vandalism under the Conservatives.Because with that stability comes security. It is not enough for the state to simply get out of the way and to leave markets to their own devices. Our economy is too exposed to global disruption and supply shocks, as recent events have shown. Instead, we need a strong, smart and agile state to support key industries and back those sectors of the economy particularly affected by tariffs. This isn’t about picking winners or losers. It is about using the power of government to back those sectors of the economy that can provide security for working people, whether that is in jobs or investment, and can compete in a global marketplace.That is why the prime minister and I stepped in last week to back British car manufacturers to decarbonise in a way that is sustainable, helping the transition to electric vehicles and giving them greater flexibility to hit the 2030 target. It is why this Labour government acted in parliament tosave British steelproduction for the future. And it’s why I am announcing a new package of support for thousands of British exporters that are set to be affected by tariffs by extending loans, guarantees and insurance to those companies facing significant short-term strain. The promise of security backed up by the actions necessary to deliver that security.But we must double down on our plan for growth. People are impatient for change. I am impatient. We cannot afford to sit still. We must go further and faster, with every part of the state – from Whitehall to Cardiff, Edinburgh to Belfast, Manchester to Sheffield – working together in our collective endeavour. So, in the coming weeks, working with cabinet colleagues across government, we will bring forward action from our industrial strategy to support our economy and take down the barriers to growth.I will be holding further talks with business leaders about how we will accelerate our plans. How we can demonstrate Britain’s place as a safe haven to live, invest and to do business. And how we can seize the opportunities that are ahead of us. Economic growth will be hardwired into the spending review too, with a laser focus on ensuring the investments we make now – whether that is in energy, transport or digital – deliver prosperity tomorrow.And finally, there is Britain’s place in the world. The Labour party is an internationalist party. We understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world but to face forward. The prime minister has shown that leadership when it comes to our country’s response to the war on Ukraine and the increase in defence spending. He has shown the calm and considered leadership that is needed at moments like this.We continue to pursue the best possible deal with the US. At the same time, we will continue to pursue future trade agreements with other economies,including India, and secure an ambitious new relationship with the EU that deepens ties with our largest trading partners and delivers for Britain.And later this month, I will travel to Washington for the IMF spring meetings, where I will make clear the UK’s support for institutions that underpin global economic stability. But I will also make the argument for a more balanced global economic and trading system that supports national economies to become more resilient. One that recognises the benefits of free and fair trade but also seeks to address the challenges of this new era.I am under no illusion about the difficulties that lie ahead. Change can be unsettling. But, this is a government that is on your side and will continue to act in our national interest. We have a plan for change that is delivering on the promise of a better future. Security for working people and renewal for Britain. More pounds in people’s pockets. That is our promise and, together, that is what we will deliver.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesThe ObserverEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

The steelworks site defines the area. It is huge, the equivalent of 1,133 Wembley football pitches. It extends well beyond the bounds of Scunthorpe itself, into my constituency, and employs hundreds of my constituents and many more beyond. The raw materials that feed the blast furnaces come in through the port of Immingham, which I represent at Westminster.I have spent all my life living in this corner of Lincolnshire and am old enough to have witnessed the decline of Grimsby following the loss of its deep-sea fishing industry. Such losses affect every part of a community. When such industries decline and disappear people feel cut off from their heritage, their culture and so much more. The health of the local community deteriorates, chronic illnesses increase, there is lower life expectancy, reduced productivity, increased healthcare costs and lower community cohesion.View image in fullscreenMartin Vickers: ‘Politics must not get in the way.’Photograph: Joel Goodman/The ObserverThe world market in steel is broken and has been for many years. The present chaotic events that have followed from President Trump triggering a trade war have exacerbated an already difficult situation, and when that occurs, governments must step in. That doesn’t come easy to me or my party but if we are to maintain a steel industry, as we must, there is going to be a cost to the taxpayer whether that is through nationalisation or support for private owners. Governments of whatever colour must recognise this. Politics must not get in the way.It appears to have come late to this government that the Chinese owners Jingye have apparently lost interest in maintaining production in Scunthorpe. It is, however, understandable if, as they claim, they are losing £700,000 every day the furnaces are operating. The owners have cancelled orders for raw materials and now hold all the aces.This brinkmanship should not have come as a surprise to anyone. I first raised my concerns in Parliament on 5 September last year. Hansard records that I said: “There have been widespread media reports suggesting that coke will stop being imported from October, which would mean production would stop in Scunthorpe by Christmas. There are rumours concerning the fact that employees will be given notice very soon.”On 16 October I repeated these worries in a Westminster Hall debate and yet, even allowing for the intransigence of the owners, ministers allowed things to drift to the point where Parliament has had to be recalled for this 11th-hour intervention.The truth is that ministers should have clarified the legal position months ago.I know the government does not want Scunthorpe to close the steelworks on its watch. They are vital for the nation’s security, apart from anything else. Unless action is taken in the very near future, I am afraid 2,700 direct job losses could occur, with thousands more in the supply chain. Do we, as a still significant manufacturing nation, an advanced economy, want to lose the capacity to produce our own steel and become the only G7 country in that position?Emergency law passed to force loss-making steel companies  to keep operatingRead moreNorth Lincolnshire council, ably led by Councillor Rob Waltham, who has been to China to meet the owners, has put together contingency plans including the creation of an AI growth zone and a green growth zone. This will cost the taxpayer but it is the way forward as we transition to new steel production methods.As I said in my urgent question last Monday, the government must nationalise the industry, to give it breathing space, to attract new private sector investment and to keep the jobs of those thousands of people. What we have heard from the secretary of state means that they are edging ever closer to full-scale nationalisation and if that is eventually proposed they will have the full support of the local community and, as their representative, they can rely on my support.Martin Vickers is the Conservative MP for Brigg and ImminghamExplore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryManufacturing sectorUnemploymentcommentShareReuse this content"

Europe and the UK can seize an advantageWill HuttonIt’s time to fashion a new global trade order without the USSat 12 Apr 2025 14.35 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 15.31 EDTShareThe game-changing geopolitical event last week was thenear collapse of the immense $29tn ­market in US government debt,threatening the stability of the American and global financial system and the safe-haven status of dollar assets.The US president boasted as the collapse unfolded that world leaders were queueing to “kiss his arse”.Twelve hours later, he was in the same humiliatingly weak position as the then British prime minister Liz Truss found herself after her tax-slashing “mini-budget” in 2022. The markets had forced him to pause for 90 days the swingeing range of “reciprocal” tariffs that he announced on what he proclaimed “liberation day”; instead he lowered all of them, bar that on China, to 10%.The markets sighed relief, but “liberation’” had boomeranged. It was Trump who was imprisoned. He and his sycophants insisted it was all part of a grand plan. Nonsense – he is economically and politically gored.He dare not risk reimposing the same tariffs when the “pause” ends without risking an even worse US debt crisis. Worse, he has killed the prospect of the rest of the world buying the avalanche of new US government debt that will follow from the huge tax cuts he plans in the autumn. The US Federal Reserve has been forced to reassure the markets, still weak, that it will do anything necessary to ensure their stability – another sign of how power is draining from Trump.The EU, Britain and other rule-of-law capitalist democracies now have the balance of advantage. But they need to recognise it and work together to capitalise on the opportunity, rather than each sue for the most advantageous deal possible in their limited “national interest”.This is a moment when the national interest is best pursued by hanging together. The situation remains dangerous. The US’s average tariff, including the 145% on Chinese imports, is the highest for a century. China, with its technological and financial power plus leverage over key raw materials, is on manoeuvres, trying to put itself at the centre of a new order.The EU, Britain and other rule-of-law democracies need to work together rather than pursue their ‘national interest’The democracies must find a common front over the next 90 days as an exercise in damage limitation, and then go beyond that tofashion a new trade order from the ruins of the old– but necessarily without the US. Equally, they must have their eyes wide open about China. While it must be engaged with, it is not a benevolent power. Rather, it is the lynchpin of what author Anne Applebaum has called “Autocracy Inc”, a network of countries including Russia whose aim is to undermine rule-of-law democratic societies, human rights and political pluralism.Britain’s Brexiters – as wilfully ignorant about the damage they have caused and today’s realities asDonald Trump– will vociferously complain, but the EU has to be Europe’s vehicle for the task ahead. Its current stance is an excellent starting point. Its goal is to remove all tariffs and, while it is prepared to negotiate on genuine US trade complaints and buy more US gas, it will use its heft to resist extra-territorial American claims on sovereignty, tax policies or regulation, calmly reserving the right for targeted retaliation if need be. It will certainly defend EU product standards across the board – from digital services to food. And it is open to a closer trade relationship with Canada.But the EU needs to use the 90-day “pause” to get beyond that and ambitiously form a coalition of the willing to create a global pact not to pursue beggar-my-neighbour trade policies, and launch the basis for a global customs union. It would recruit from the G20, extending the invitation to Asia’s Trans Pacific Partnership, the Gulf Co-operation Council, South America’s Mercosur and the Southern African Customs Union. It could be done in parallel with the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a new Global Customs Union Council, aiming ultimately to extend any agreement into common technical and safety standards, and perhaps use the WTO to police its rules and arbitrate disputes. China could join if it accepted the rules.Being outside the EU, Britain cannot be the lead playmaker in this effort, but it must indicate it will play ball – and initiate what it can. Rachel Reeves, writing in theObserverthis week, signals a first step in this direction.Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world but to face forwardRead moreTo be effective, Britain should ally itself with the EU in its negotiations with Trump and go for a much more expansive trade deal with the EU – to include agreement on technical standards – than the timorous one to be unveiled at the joint UK-EU summit in May, even suggesting Gordon Brown, internationally respected for his role in the debt crisis, as the lead sherpa, to show its good faith and commitment to the cause.Any doubts should be dispelled by the numbers. The draft head of terms for the UK-US trade deal ispathetic: minimal concessions from the US while the UK is being forced to shrink its red lines on food standards, product regulation and digital services. The independent forecaster Frontier Economics reckons that the impact of US tariffs will shrink UK GDP by 0.7%, while a deeper deal with the EU could instead lift GDP by 1.5%, despite US tariffs.So what is it to be? Bail out a stricken Trump with a third-rate trade deal on which he will boast Britain has kissed his arse? Or make common cause with the EU to boost our growth and fashion a new global free-trade architecture?Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe ObserverTariffsForeign policyEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

By learning the lessons of 2008, we can still prevent itSat 12 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 11.58 EDTShareAfter a week that started with the worst financial volatility in recent history and ended with the most serious escalation so far of the China-US conflict, it is time to distinguish the tectonic shifts from the tremors. If nothing changes, the 2020s risks being remembered as this century’s devil’s decade – the term historians once used for the 1930s. It will be defined not just byseven million peoplewho have died of Covid-19 and rising global poverty and inequality – but also by a dismembered Ukraine, a burnt-out Gaza and little-reported atrocities inAfricaand Asia, each testimony to the violent displacement of a rules-based global order by a power-based one.Indeed, before our eyes, every single pillar of the old order is under assault – not just free trade but therule of lawand the primacy we have long attached to human rights and democracy, the self-determination of peoples, and multilateral cooperation between nations, including the humanitarian and environmental responsibilities we once accepted as citizens of the world.Power shifts are, of course, the stuff of history. Within the space of two centuries, four world orders have risen and fallen. The first two – the balance of power that emerged after the defeat of Napoleon in the early 19th century, and the post-1918 Treaty of Versailles system born after four dynastic empires collapsed – ultimately ended in the carnage of world wars. Then came the post-1945 architecture, led by the US and the United Nations; and, after 1990 with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, what US president George HW Bush called a “new world order”.Now, as the economic balance of powershifts eastwardsand a new mercantilism takes root, what was once called the Washington consensus is no longer supported anywhere – least of all in Washington. Globalisation is now rejected by millions as a “free for all” that has not been fair to all. It is not open trade but the opposite – restrictions on trade – now being popularised as a nation’s route to prosperity.President Trump’s tactical ploy has been to exploit the profound shifts that were already reshaping the world’s geopolitics: first, the yawning gap between the benefits that globalisation promised and what it delivered inpeople’s everyday lives, and so he has become the world’s leading anti-globalist. He also saw how, turbo-charged by social media blitzes landing nonstop via people’s phones, he could resurrect the “great man” theory of history – Putin, Xi, Erdoğan and Kim Jong-un having shown him that populist but dictatorial leaders could set the agenda.But Trump’s sheer unpredictability foreshadows even greater danger ahead. “Let chaos reign and don’t rein in the chaos” seems to be the mantra, and while there may be a lingering hope that something like normal governance might resume soon, this can no longer be a rational basis for anyone’s future planning. Instead, with both the US and China taking risks in accelerating their confrontation to new levels, the question is whether we are descending towards a “one world, two systems” future, or simply the chaotic disorder that has characterised the history of most previous centuries – and whether there is now any chance of building a world order that could ever be stable and sustainable.What’s clear after recent events is that the fourth global order cannot be restored. We are not only in a more protectionist era but are moving from a unipolar world where the US was the sole hegemonic power to one that has many more centres of decision-making power. But because we are also a more interconnected world, we are more vulnerable to crises – from pandemics and climate emergencies to financial contagion. All the more so because countries can, as we saw this week, weaponise that interdependence and the choke points it creates for their own advantage. So if we are to have anything approaching a values-based order we will have at some point to agree an updated global charter for our common future, something that builds on theAtlantic Charter of 1941and theUN Charter of 1945, but is geared to a completely different century.As William Beveridgesaid at that time: “A revolutionary moment in the world’s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.” Over the past few days,calls for multilateral cooperationhave come from the leaders of Spain, Brazil and South Africa, this year’s chairs of three global conferences: the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development, the 30th UN climate change conference and the G20. “As a collective we must now unite to enforce international law,” the Malaysian prime minister and Colombian and South African presidentshave written. “The choice is stark: either we act together to enforce international law or we risk its collapse.”All countries that believe in international cooperation should pledge that through a new multilateralism this generation will deliver global solutions to what are now inescapably global problems that cannot be resolved by nation states acting on their own or in bilateral deals alone. Second, as building blocks of that future, thiscollation of the willingshould immediately engage in practical cooperation on urgent concerns for which no nation state-only answers are possible – global security, climate, health and humanitarian needs as well as the flow of trade. They should work to modernise the international institutions that deliver them.Trump is pushing the world towards recession. By learning the lessons of 2008, we can still prevent it | Gordon BrownRead moreAnd third, we should try to build a bridgehead to sceptics such as Trump by agreeing with him on the need for reciprocity and for fair burden-sharing between nations; and because this is a debt-laden world we should propose innovative and equitable ways to raise the resources needed to turn these commitments into action. By addressing the failures of the era of hyper-globalisation, we can all strive for a world that is not only open to trade but inclusive of all those who have been left behind.Two hundred years ago, in similarly momentous times, aBritish leadercalled “a new world into existence to redress the balance of the old” , and the lesson of history is that any new order that endures has to be built on the solid rock of principle and not the shifting sands of expediency and the narrowest interpretation of national self-interests.At the heart of the Atlantic Charter, the Roosevelt-inspired declaration of international cooperation, was a set of principles celebrating basic freedoms – against the use of force and protectionism, and for the self-determination of nations and national social contracts that would bridge the divide between rich and poor. Even if none of these goals are, as of now, championed by Trump, all is not lost: according to the US Global Leadership Coalition, 82% of Americans oppose isolationism, believing that the US is stronger when “engaged in the world”. And while the US can no longer lead a unipolar world by dictating to others, it can lead a multipolar world through persuasion.Sadly, despiteKeir Starmer’s valiant efforts, none of us can now guarantee that Ukraine – and its resources – will not be carved apart, emboldening autocrats everywhere. But we can set out the moral compass that will guide us and make us better prepared for the challenges ahead. We remain at risk of repeating the 1930s descent into global anarchy; but by nations acting together, we could create a 1940s moment as we start on the herculean task of constructing the fifth world order of modern times.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsBrown on tariffsGlobalisationDonald TrumpTariffsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

The game enables children to explore and reconfigure a creative digital environment, accumulating resources in a world built from blocks. The movie enables children to explore and reconfigure the codes of basic decency in a cinema environment, testing the limits of any hapless usher left to supervise.A Minecraft Moviemeans mischief. In recent days, a viral trend has encouraged audiences to wait for the onscreen moment when a zombie jumps piggyback on to a chicken – yes, actually – then toerupt into chaos, hurling popcorn around the theatre. The cue for action is marked by a character played by Jack Black, who spots the zombie-chicken combo and yells “chicken jockey!”. In a video of one such incident, a tween carrying a real-life chicken is paraded on the shoulders of a friend through cinema seats. It was the chicken jockey to end all chicken jockeys.Clearly, the phenomenon is a nightmare for cinema staff, given the debris of snack foods crunched into carpets. Equally clearly, no adult arrives atA Minecraft Moviewith an expectation of rapt silence. The exuberance of children recognising a key moment from their own gameplay should hardly inspire the disapproval some of us reserve for the oaf who disrupts an art house cinema. (I speak as someone with an acute sensitivity to noise and a long-honed repertoire of judgy looks.) A Krzysztof Kieślowski retrospective requires silence; the latest Jack Black vehicle does not.If your tween is participating in the “chicken jockey” phenomenon, it’s less likely to be an act of rebellion, heralding a lifetime of social delinquency, so much as a requisite act of conformity. DuringAMinecraftMovie’s first weekend, very little disruption was reported in Britain. Now all the kids are doing it, inflamed by widely circulated news that a cinema in New Jersey had kicked back by banning unaccompanied minors. Cue British cinemas following suit; cue large parties of tweens proudly filming themselves flouting the rules; cue adult outrage. Childhood trends come and go, but the features of the mass hysteria around them stay largely the same.The “chicken jockey” phenomenon is largely harmless – unless you’re the minimum-wage cinema staff who have to clear up. Warner Bros, desperate to create in-person experiences that require streaming audiences to return to cinema, has encouraged the trend, with director Jared Hess telling the world: “I’m just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.” It’s a messier version of the push to get women to head to cinemas wearing pink forBarbieor green forWicked.The strongest case for keeping quiet in a theatre is that it’s profoundly selfish to distract the performersYet the dispute lands just as audiences on both sides of the Atlantic are caught up in a feverish debate about post-Covid etiquette at cinemas, theatres and live music events. Producers and investors face the same dilemma. In a sector desperate for bums on seats, how far can they encourage traditional audiences to remember their visit as a participatory event? How far do the construction of “in-person” phenomena alienate existing audiences and disrupt the art itself?The crisis sparked by our shifting norms during shared experiences has been most pronounced in theatre. Last year, two sisters were convicted of assault after punching a couple who asked them to keep quiet during a Glasgow performance ofJersey Boys: the court heard that the defendants, a nurse and a care-worker, had earlier in the altercation defended their right to make a noise as part of “enjoying themselves”.It was only one of a series of incidents that have made headlines in the entertainment press. In April 2023, Alison Hammond and Vanessa Feltz were forced to apologise after advocating for the right to sing along in the audience when attending a musical. “Isn’t that what everybody does very, very loudly while eating an ice-cream?” asked Feltz on ITV’sThis Morning. Nope, replied furious musical theatre professionals on social media.As someone who spends up to four evenings a week at the theatre – a perk of my side-gig as a theatre critic – I’m a martinet about people making noise in the stalls. Live theatre depends on a shared experience and a shared commitment to concentration. The strongest case for keeping quiet in a theatre is that it’s profoundly selfish to distract the performers. While our screen age might have numbed some audiences into consuming all storytelling as if it’s projected from an LED monitor, actors and classical musicians are profoundly affected by distractions. As one singer tells me: “We hear every sweet wrapper; we see each light from a mobile phone.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In theatre, as in music, it is suggested that audiences forgot how to behave after the long Covid hiatus. I also blame the alcohol offers that venue owners, desperate for revenue streams after the pandemic, now push in “premium” packages.In response, directors have finally accepted the need to remind theatregoers of basic behaviour, often with a pre-curtain speech by an actor. For years, the idea was sneered at by theatre’s progressives as “elitist” or “gatekeeping”, but it works. (I’ve never seen so many people turn off phones as when sharply instructed to do so by snobbish Emily, in character, inThe Devil Wears Prada.) In Thomas Ostermeier’s recent version ofThe Seagull,we had a parody of such pre-curtain announcements, with one character encouraging the audience to “be present”, before reading out a list of rapid-fire prohibitions on everything from snogging to laughing. It still worked.But although disruption has less impact on film than in theatre, film-makers have long understood that our experience in any cinema is shaped by those with whom we share it.A Minecraft Moviereminded me of a very different film: Maggie Gyllenhaal’s sensitive adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novelThe Lost Daughter. Olivia Colman stars as a solo female holidaymaker, fighting for respect from a raucous mafia family in the same resort. In a scene that any lone woman who stands up for herself will recognise, their adolescent sons wilfully disrupt her experience of watching a movie by throwing popcorn. The question of who controls the soundscape at any collective experience is a question about who has power; who feels untouchable. Maybe it is time for the grownups to lay down the law.Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsFilmOpinionA Minecraft MovieTheatreMinecraftcommentShareReuse this content"

The judge, Jamee Comans, hadgiven the Trump administration a deadlineto produce the evidence required to show that Khalil should be deported. In a functional state, such evidence would rise to a standard of extreme criminality necessitating deportation.But not in this case and certainly not with the Trump administration, which has summarily deportedhundreds of Venezuelan menbased not on any verifiable criminal activity but simply on the basis of their body art. In response to the judge’s order, the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, produced a flimsy one-and-a-half-pagememothat admits that Khalil engaged in no criminal conduct. Instead, the memo, citing an arcane law, stated that Khalil’s “past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations that are otherwise lawful … compromise a compelling US foreign policy interest”. In other words, the government was saying that Khalil’s views – including even his future views – were sufficient grounds for his deportation.To my husband, Mahmoud Khalil: I can’t wait to tell our son of his father’s bravery | Noor AbdallaRead moreMake no mistake. The government is seeking to deport Khalil solely for his constitutionally protected speech, a protection that applies to everyone in the United States. If the government succeeds, you could well be next. And don’t think that your citizenship will protect you. If the government can deny the basic right of freedom of speech to lawful permanent residents, what’s to stop them from going after citizens next? (The administration already has a plan todenaturalizeUS citizens.)Do we really want to live in a country where the government can decide which ideas are allowed to be heard and which cannot? I’m surprised that I even have to write these words. In an open society, free debate is encouraged and needed, while in a closed society, lists of proscribed ideas circulate and proliferate, and it’s frighteningly clear which way we’re headed. The Trump administration has alreadybannedthe use of words and phrases such as “equity”, “women” and “Native American” from government websites and documents, showing us how the open door of American democracy is slamming shut faster and louder than we could have imagined. And Khalil’s case is the test of what this government can achieve.Rubio alleges that Khalil engaged in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States”. But he provides no evidence whatsoever. Meanwhile, here’s what Khalil toldCNNlast year: “As a Palestinian student, I believe that the liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand, and you cannot achieve one without the other. Our movement is a movement for social justice and freedom and equality for everyone.”The attempt to deport Khalil is meant primarily to discipline the people of the United States into silence and conformityIt would seem that Rubio believes the phrase “freedom and equality for everyone” undermines US foreign policy interests. He may finally be right about something. But he’s wrong about Khalil, who clearly is not antisemitic. If Rubio wanted to cleanse the country of the noxious hatred of Jewish people, he could start by examining members of his own party. Marjorie Taylor Greene oncespeculated publiclythat California wildfires were started by a beam from “space solar generators” linked to “Rothschild, Inc”, a disgusting nod to bizarre antisemitic conspiracy theories. Robert F Kennedy Jrsaidthat the coronavirus had been manipulated to make “Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people” the most immune to Covid-19. Elon Musk can barely keep his arm fromextendinginto a salute, Dr Strangelove-style.It’s not some illusory antisemitism that has brought the wrath of the Trump administration raining down on Khalil. It’s the fact that he was standing up for Palestinian rights and calling out Israel’s actions, labelled genocidal byjurists,expertsandinternational human rights organizationsalike. But the US government does not want the American people to even entertain this discussion, which includes American complicity in this human catastrophe that is also US foreign policy, and so it will use every means at its disposal to forestall the possibility, including the bluntest instrument in the political book: mass fear.The attempt to deport Khalil is meant primarily to discipline the people of the United States into silence and conformity. For that reason alone, the government’s actions must be resisted. Healthy societies are based on free thinking and dissent. Unhealthy societies mobilize fear and intimidation to regulate opinion and manufacture consent. Today, that consent is about Israel. Tomorrow, it will be about something else. Either way, it will never be your choice, and it will always be theirs.Many legal observers were anticipating today’s ruling by Comans. Immigration judges are appointed by the Department of Justice. As such, they are employees of the executive branch and not the federal judiciary. The New York Times evennotedthat, had Comans dissented from the government, she would also have “run the risk of being fired by an administration that has targeted dissenters”. The ACLU speculated that the decision to deport Khalil had been “pre-written”, as it was delivered so fast. And Comans stated that the constitutional questions raised by the case will be heard in federal court in New Jersey and not in immigration court in Louisiana.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the contrary, the decision is another dangerous illustration of how much power the executive branch in the United States always wields, how much more power theTrump administrationis willing to assume, and how deferential the institutions that could rein in this administration have become.This structural cowardice on the part of these institutions is doing great harm to the integrity of American democracy, often expressed in some sort of embarrassed whisper. Khalil, on the other hand, speaks loudly and eloquently for his position. At the end of his hearing in Louisiana, Khalil asked to address the court. “You said last time that there’s nothing that’s more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness,” hesaid. “Neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.”Mahmoud Khalil is clearly a remarkable, principled man. He doesn’t deserve this unjust detention the US government is subjecting him to.

And swiftly on its heels,the parable of the dire wolf. We’d rather resurrect a 12,500-year-old species from the dead than save our existing wild animals. Of course we would. Recycling is boring; doing the very thing 90s science fiction movies warned us not to do is fun.We are not quite on the verge of bringing back ancient species. But last week the PR campaign for doing so began in earnest.Colossal Biosciences– a company known for trying to revive the dodo, the mammoth and the thylacine – has unveiled three large adorable white puppies, claiming it has created “the world’s first successfully de-extincted animal”: the dire wolf, made famous byGame of Thrones. It invited authorGeorge RR Martinto look; he duly burst into tears.Scientists have been quick to point out that the companyhasn’t done anything of the sort: it has instead created a new animal altogether – a larger, whiter, more muscly wolf. To do so, researchers made edits to the grey wolf genome, and then implanted the resulting embryos in large dogs, extracting them by caesarean section. The puppies look like dire wolves, but what gives the project away is the fact that this is down to just 20 gene edits made on a genome of billions of bases – which makes them closer to the grey wolf than anything else.There is little point bringing back an animal if we simply drive it to extinction againStill, it’s a tremendous achievement, and was announced alongside another: the company has cloned four red wolf pups, a species with fewer than 20 in the wild. This could help to revive their thinning population. Does this herald a solution to declining biodiversity and dying ecosystems?Not quite yet. Let’s start with the obvious ethical problem: the welfare of these animals. The first generation of an extinct species will arrive without kin. Wolves are sociable creatures, but the three novel pups have no pack to join, and no parents to teach them how to survive and thrive. Nor can they be released into their natural habitat, as it no longer exists. Colossal plans to keep the three “dire wolves” in (spacious) captivity for their whole life – there is of course no other solution. They will not be allowed to breed. In fact, it is hard to imagine a future for ancient animals like the dire wolf that doesn’t involve life in a zoo, kept as exotic curiosities.At this point some employ the brutal argument zoos often do: the suffering of these animals has a greater purpose; sacrificing the welfare of a few charismatic creatures will indirectly help others. Just as keeping animals on pitiful display supposedly drives enthusiasm for conservation, so excitement over a resurrected mammoth might attract funding, advancing technology that could be repurposed for worthier efforts, such as bolstering populations of endangered animals and plants.But it’s a bargain that doesn’t add up. You do not need to recreate the dire wolf or the dodo in order to work on the red wolf. And shouldn’t the imminent extinction risk of swathes of creatures be motivation in itself? Are we such children that we need zoos andGame of Thronesto tempt us into saving the planet?Would de-extinction work, even in the most promising cases? Let’s say we dispensed with the ridiculous project of reviving long-dead creatures and focused our efforts on animals that went extinct recently, for whom some habitat remains.Two problems stand in our way. First, it is incredibly hard to release captive-bred animals, which do not know how to survive in the wild. Humans have not yet learned to train them in artificial environments – and we may never work out how.Second: there is little point bringing back an animal if we simply drive it to extinction again. Most animals die out because of climate change and the destruction of ecosystems. De-extinction is not an alternative to conservation – we would have to do both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It may be better to spend on the living than the dead. Astudy published inNaturehas calculated that maintaining a population of resurrected animals would be so expensive that two species would die out for every one revived, should the money come out of government conservation budgets. If private money were redirected from de-extinction to conservation, two to eight times more speciescould be saved. In other words, if Colossal wants to “fix extinction”, its enormous budget and technological genius would be better employed saving orangutans, blue whales and mountain gorillas.In fact, the opportunity costs may be starker: critics have warned that the idea we can bring back species will undermine conservation. They were swiftly proved right. Trump’s administration hailed Colossal’s claims to argue forslashing endangered species protections. “Going forward, we must celebrate removals from the endangered list – not additions,” US interior secretary Doug Burgum has said. “If we’re going to be in anguish about losing a species, now we have an opportunity to bring them back.

It has emerged that Jingye, the Chinese owner of Scunthorpe-based British Steel, was poised to refuse to buy further supplies of the coke and iron ore requiredto keep them running, at which point it would not have been possible to restart them; effectively, a unilateral decision to put an end to Britain’s capacity toproduce primary steel. In these circumstances, the government had no choice but to recall parliament for an emergency sitting to pass legislation to give business secretary Jonathan Reynolds the power todirect British Steel.The UK is starting from alow steel-producing base: it produced just 7.2m tonnes in 2021, compared with 13.9m tonnes in France, 24.4m tonnes in Italy and 40.1m tonnes in Germany. If British Steel were to shut its furnaces, this would leave the UK as the only G7 nation without primary steel-making capacity, with significant economic and security consequences. A range of industries rely on steel: construction, defence, transport, green energy. Without British-produced steel, global giant ArcelorMittal would attain what the defence thinktank Rusi has described as a “virtual monopoly” in the production of structural steel building framesfor the UK market. Network Rail sources about 95% of its trackfrom Scunthorpe. Parts of the defence industry are heavily reliant on British-produced steel; 90% of the steel used in Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers was produced by Tata Steel at Port Talbot, for example.There would be significant risks if UK industry were to become wholly reliant on steel imports, in a world characterised by increasing instability and the trade protectionism of Donald Trump’s White House. Europe may be considered a reliable trading partner, but the steel tariffs imposed by the US, combined with pressures for increased defence capability as the US goes cold on Nato, means the UK may not be able to count on sufficient supply from our European allies.So the government had to intervene in this way: to let the furnaces in Scunthorpe go out would have been not only to lose thousands of jobs, affecting the community, but to put Britain’s security at risk. The power to directBritish Steeldoes not amount to nationalisation, but this seems an all-but-certain outcome, given the situation with Jingye. It could end up costing the British taxpayer dear, but the risks of not maintaining domestic primary steel production would be even more costly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere has been a complete lack of strategy for nurturing competitive British companies and removing barriers to their growthIt is far from ideal that ministers have found themselves in this situation, and for that governments of both colours over decades bear responsibility. The history of British steel-making has been lurching from crisis to crisis: the Scunthorpe furnaces were sold by Tata Steel to the private equity fund Greybull Capital in 2016, which left just three years later. The only buyer on the market was Jingye, which Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, saw as a more palatable option than closure or nationalisation. No government has set out a long-term strategy for maintaining British primary steel-making capacity, including realistic plans for decarbonisation, given it is a huge polluter. While steel producers in France and Germany have been relatively protected from high wholesale energy costs through government intervention, UK producers have been paying up to 50% more for electricity, a huge input cost into steel-making, than theircompetitors from these countries; Conservative business secretaries never addressed this asymmetry. The last government could also have done more to increase the market for low-carbon steelthrough regulation. It is an all-too-common aspect of British industrial policy: a complete lack of long-term strategy for nurturing competitive British companies and removing barriers to their growth.There is a risk that, without a broader strategy for British Steel, the government nationalises the Scunthorpe furnaces in a way that will drain billions of taxpayer funds but is not part of a sustainable strategy for the future of primary steel-making in the UK. That needs to be the priority once the immediate crisis is averted. But the business secretary needs to learn the broader lessons of this sorry saga for industrial policy across the board. The UK is in a precarious position economically: long-term structural issues including low productivity growth and business investment and stagnant living standards have been compounded by the pandemic, by the energy crisis and by the global instability created by Trump’s tariffs policy. Britain’s long-term growth potential has been harmed irrevocably through Brexit and the erection of significant trading barriers with our largest and closest trading bloc.We are living in a world in which Britain has declining economic and diplomatic agency. It is more important than ever to limit our dependence on other countries, including China, for the production of materials of strategic importance. The government deserves praise for taking swift action to prevent its primary steel-making capacity from being shut down. But that’s the easy bit: the much more difficult question is whether it’s possible to improve the competitiveness of British Steel in the medium term, while decarbonising, in a way that ensures the future of steel-making in the UK without it being forever reliant on huge subsidies from the taxpayer.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But experts worry that these rogue efforts could do more harm than goodGary HartleySat 12 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 12.24 EDTShareVisions of habitats teeming with nature are powerful, particularly so in an age of extinction.Rewilding, which offers the promise of such transformations, was once something most would have imagined happening far away, carried out by people unlike them, but times are changing. The wilderness is getting closer to home and more personal.In the past few months, there have been twosuspected lynx releasesand one offeral pigsin a small area of the Cairngorms, along with reports of arise in “beaver bombing” on England’s rivers, andwild boarroaming Dartmoor.These acts may have Robin Hood appeal, but the rearing and release of large mammals goes some way beyond the well-established phenomenon of “guerrilla gardening”, where people sow native plants on land without express permission, or even the letting loose of rare butterflies in nature reserves (also atrending phenomenon).On the latter point, butterfly specialist Matthew Oates notes that ad hoc butterfly releases have been going on for more than two centuries, with Winston Churchill a notable practitioner.The latest wave of rogue activity, Oates says, is “fuelled by butterfly enthusiasts seeing a plethora of seemingly suitable but unoccupied habitat, which isn’t going to get colonised naturally, and a degree of disillusionment with nature conservation bodies”.I think some people who have taken matters into their own hands have a romantic view of what it’s like to be a wild animalRoisin Campbell-Palmer, Beaver TrustAs with mammals, trying to establish what has been unofficially introduced, as opposed to arisen from natural colonisation, involves “a lot of mythology and assumption,” he says. But there are many “highly reputable” breeders of butterflies with long-established reputations – something that rings less true when it comes to large animals.“I think some people who have taken matters into their own hands potentially have a quite romantic view of what it’s like to be a wild animal out there. It’s not just about opening the crate and letting them go,” says Roisin Campbell-Palmer, head of restoration for the Beaver Trust.“We should always put the animals first. We can celebrate the enthusiasm and the attitude of some people to shove two fingers to the system, but if those animals aren’t accepted and if they face prolonged or ongoing persecution, then I struggle ethically when asking: ‘Is this right, have we all done a good job here, and can we truly call this species restoration?’”View image in fullscreenA woman has a friendly encounter with a wild boar in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. There are several well established populations of the animals in the UK, largely because of escapes from farms.Photograph: David Slater/AlamyShe acknowledges that without rogue releases, beavers would not be back in Britain on amore formal basis– but fears that some bridges have been permanently burned because of the experiment. “Fingers can always be pointed. In retrospect, it’s very hard to encourage people to then accept the animals and coexist with them when they feel it wasn’t their choice and they weren’t involved.”A group of scientists working to restore predator communities havecome out stronglyagainst the Scottish lynx releases. It’s a view Campbell-Palmer shares. “What was the long-term outlook likely to be for those animals? They weren’t behaviourally ready for the wild. And to me, that’s just thrown up a big potential case of straight-out cruelty,” she says.“I hope that’s been a bit of a wake-up call for people who think you can just put large mammals back and it’ll all be fine. I’m very empathetic with people who get frustrated with the speed of change, but this rationale of ‘just get them out there and they’ll be accepted in the end’, I do struggle with that.”While charismatic species wandering free grab many of the headlines, a less bombastic phenomenon is growing: community groups are buying smaller patches of the landscape to interpret rewilding as they see fit.The Covid-19 pandemic prompted many to dream of wide-open spaces and nature in bloom, but one group in Harrogate, NorthYorkshire, decided to get on with making it happen.The council talked about rewilding and making it butterfly-friendly, but all that meant is they didn’t cut the grassCaroline Williams, Calderstones Park groupThe collective, from a variety of professional backgrounds, began by getting 3,000 shareholders to buy a £50 stake through a crowdfunding platform to acquire the 12-hectare (30-acre) Long Lands Common on the outskirts of the town. They have recently completed another fundraising drive to add another 24 hectares of land, known asKnaresborough Forest Park, which has been out of public hands since 1770.“Everyone’s come together around this singular ambition, to protect, to restore, and to just provide more space for nature in the community. We’ve found there are very few people who don’t seem to agree with that,” says George Eglese, a designer and the youngest member of the team behind the project.View image in fullscreenButterfly expert Matthew Oates.Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian“I think before Long Lands existed, there wasn’t really anyone in the area who was doing this kind of work, and there was a lot of apathy in the town: people wanted change, but felt they couldn’t effect it. Long Lands created a platform, and there’s a sense that ‘we’ve got all this resource now – let’s do as much as we can to ensure the safety of our natural environment’.”As well as offering nature right next to accessible transport, and forging links with schools and charities, the project is also hoping to supply local food banks with fresh produce through a community food field, and offer a sustainable source of wood via the reintroduction of coppicing. They even hope that, in time, the site may attract some of those charismatic big beasts.“What we’re talking about is reversing nature depletion, and that means increasing biodiversity, whether it’s for fauna, fungi, the small and medium-sized things,” says Ian Fraser, the project’s woodland officer. “Do those things, the ecosystems are stronger, then the larger animals will come back on their own.”Despite doing things by the book, groups working to bring more wildness into communities are not against a touch of righteous anger and rebellion. There’s a trend for struggles against threats to habitats turning into reimaginations of them: the story of Long Lands Common began as a protest against a relief road that would have run through the Nidd Gorge. In Liverpool, a smaller patch of habitat began with a community halting a proposed deal between the council and Redrow Homes to build on a park.More than simply saving Calderstones Park, the Liverpoolcampaign groupwent on to develop 1.5 hectares of semi-derelict land into a nature reserve, using some novel techniques that have won the admiration of urban planting experts. They have sown a wildflower meadow over concrete using a soil made from Mersey grit and crushed stone, introduced rescued hedgehogs, seen a big uptick in bats and are working on specialist butterfly habitat.“The council talked about rewilding and making it butterfly-friendly, but all that meant is they didn’t cut the grass,” says Caroline Williams from the group. “Without greater effort, a lot of it became just a sheer mess, with Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed [invasive plant species] coming in. There was definitely a feeling that if we don’t do it, nobody else will.”View image in fullscreenRoisin Campbell-Palmer with a beaver in a crate, ready for release at a secret location in the south-west of England.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyHigh-profile support has emerged for an even more personal form of rewilding. Financier and environmentalist Ben Goldsmith recently urged anyone with savings tobuy land for rewilding, describing it as “the most rewarding, joyful and most impactful thing you can possibly do”.For those not willing to go solo and put their savings on the line, the UK has now got – at least in theory – structures in place to financially support rewilding at all manner of scales.Biodiversity Net Gain(BNG) legislation means that when new developments cannot feasibly create adequate habitat onsite to compensate for what they have damaged or depleted, plus 10% more, biodiversity projects, including relatively small community-managed patches of the landscape, can offer an offsite investment solution.Infrastructure is being added to BNG soon, which is likely to work especially well for projects such as theLondon Tree Ring, which aims to provide connective tree cover surrounding the capital, while also linking up smaller-scale community projects. Christoph Warrack, chief executive of thenature recovery consultancyCommon, has been visiting potential sites.What all these projects and ideas have in common is nature and nature recovery. And that is in everybody’s interestChristoph Warrack, chief executive, Common“This is reforestation on the edge of lots of the biggest construction and infrastructure projects in the country. It’s a really easy fit, because you can essentially connect each part to an individual development project and create the Biodiversity Net Gain credits,” says Warrack.“But we want those credits to happen anywhere. It’s important for quite complex mechanisms like that to be simplified and made available to communities, so that they’ve got a more powerful economic rationale for taking the plunge and acquiring their land.”As well as these moves to boost biodiversity on a national scale, and a boom in crowdfunding for nature, there is also philanthropic funding out there willing to support local action. Knaresborough Forest Park received a loan on generous terms from the organisationWe Have the Power, while Common is being backed by the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation to build new financial models for communities to move faster in snapping up land on the market.British people’s love for wildlife, in a notably biodiversity-depleted country, is renowned. As such, rewilding was never going to remain purely the domain of large estates beyond the horizon. The fact that flagship projects have inspired efforts to bring the idea closer to home is a testament to their success, and it’s fair to say that was always at least partly the point.While most people wanting to make a personal impact are likely to find the comfort and increased financial clout of groups – and the safety of working within existing systems – the most desirable option, for some, permits and certificates, rules and regulations will always be the antithesis of nature. Officialdom will probably win the day, but the rebels could have some influence on how fast things are done.“Biodiversity is a whole huge multiplicity of dimensions, and then you add people, and the relationships between people and biodiversity. Welcome to planet Earth; this is life and all its glorious complexity,” says Warrack.“At the heart of that are some simple principles about place and people that have been clearly mapped out. What all these projects and ideas have in common is nature and nature recovery. And that is in everybody’s interest.”Explore more on these topicsRewildingThe ObserverConservationYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Half a dozen staff members maneuvered the caged sea lion off the bed of a truck, and grabbed IV bags full of fluids and vitamins.Periodically, the animal slumped down, lethargic, and then bit at the bars of its transport cart. The high-pitched barks of other sea lions echoed through the complex.California: sea lion attack on teenager raises fears of toxic algae poisoningRead moreBut this sea lion wasn’t any average malnourished or stranded animal. It had fled its natural habitat and was acting uncharacteristically sluggish, or “down and out”, as Jeni Smith, the head of the rescue unit, put it – both potential signs of poisoning from domoic acid, a neurotoxin currently being produced by a harmful algae bloom off the coast of southern California.“We’re like the 911 operators and we also respond to the calls,” Smith said, looking on as her team tended to the new arrival. “We’re also the ambulance, or the animal ambulance, and then we’re the caretakers once they’re here, so we’re like the nurses, too.”Smith quickly checked her phone, the one used to field 911-type calls from San Diegans who spot injured or sick sea lions. She had 31 missed calls and 18 voicemails in the last two hours alone.This has not been a typical spring for Smith and her team. While toxic algae blooms have plagued the Golden state for the past four years, 2025 may be the worst year yet – at least for San Diego. SeaWorld alone has rescued 47 sea lions and 30 birds with suspecteddomoic acid poisoning this year, compared with only 11 sea lions in 2024 and 18 in 2023.Beyond San Diego,the outbreak has sickenedhundreds of sea lions, dolphins, birds and other marine animalsin Californiaover the past month, leaving animal rescue workers scrambling to keep up. Small fish that consume the toxic algae are then eaten by bigger animals, like sea lions and dolphins. For a sea lion with domoic acid poisoning, which can lead to seizures and heart failure, the chance of survival is roughly 50-50 if treated in time, Smith said.For a dolphin, it’s often fatal.View image in fullscreenTwo staff members of the SeaWorld San Diego rescue team work to capture an injured sea lion in Ocean Beach, California.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/GuardianIn response to the current outbreak, the SeaWorld San Diego rescue team has had to double its staff. The team has been receiving roughly 100 calls a day for several weeks.“We kind of went from zero to 60 in two seconds,” Smith said.While scientists are still working to determine why, exactly, this year’s bloom has been so extensive, with some posing questions aboutthe potential impact of debrisfrom the Los Angeles wildfires in January,warming oceans fueled by the climate crisishave long been shown to contribute to extreme algae blooms.Whatever the exact cause, working on the animal rescue team lately has felt something like working in a high-pressure hospital setting, Smith said.“We have those middle-of-the-night, intense rescues, and your adrenaline is so high,” she said. “And throughout the day you’re just going, going, going.”View image in fullscreenJeni Smith, the head of SeaWorld San Diego’s rescue unit.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich‘If need be, we’re here 24 hours’After the latest sea lion intake on Tuesday, the animal was added to a “quarantined” pen with four others; one of the sea lions swam around a small pool of water, pawing at a tiny silver fish but not eating it. Elsewhere on the SeaWorld property, a handful of pelicans suspected to have poisoning huddled together, eyeing newcomers warily. Veterinarians and staff on the rescue team buzzed around, feeding animals and cleaning enclosures.Smith passed the rescue team’s phone off to Tracy Spahr, SeaWorld’s director of public relations, to help respond to calls.By the time Spahr returned, she had a long list of other sea lions that were in need of help: one that appeared dead in Coronado, a pup lying by a lifeguard stand in Encinitas, another by the Pacific Beach pier that police had called in about and a fourth one stranded in Ocean Beach.“And Scripps [Pier] called and there’s one still there,” Spahr added, reading from a page of hand-written notes that she had taken about each call. “‘Alive but struggling. It moves but is acting strange.’”Two hours later, SeaWorld’s rescue team arrived at the scene. A large male sea lion sprawled across the sand by the pier, occasionally sitting up to crane his neck back towards the sky. While a crowd of beachgoers gathered to watch, two rescuers – Kevin Robinson and TG Plein – pulled their truck onto the beach and unloaded their gear: a metal crate, nets and several plastic boards.“It’s been a long month-and-a-half,” Plein told one onlooker, as he answered questions about the recent domoic acid poisonings.With the help of two lifeguards, Plein and Robinson had to take about 15 minutes to corral the barking sea lion into the crate and load it onto their truck. Though Robinson wasn’t sure whether the animal had been affected by the toxic algae bloom specifically – it could have been struggling with another type of infection or cancer – the plan was to bring him back to headquarters, take a blood sample or two and come up with a course of treatment.View image in fullscreenDomoic acid has sickened hundreds of sea lions over the past month. As the outbreak spreads, animal rescue teams have scrambled to keep up.Photograph: Amanda Ulrich/GuardianFor the rescuers, their day was far from over.They packed up and headed to Ocean Beach, a tight-knit coastal community 20 minutes south. Near the surf, a small sea lion was curled up, unmoving, in the sand. Flies buzzed around its head. A woman in a hot-pink shirt was hunched over it, taking photos. She had first spotted the animal the previous night, she said, and had been praying and singing to it since then.“You’re here!” she exclaimed to the rescuers, a tear in her eye. “I’m the one who called!”This time the capture only took a minute or two. The rescuers were again unsure what the specific ailment was, but Robinson suspected cancer.“We’ll treat her like she’s DA [domoic acid] initially, give her lots of fluids, maybe some antibiotics, that kind of thing, and run her through a full work-up,” he said. “Then we’ll have a better idea of what’s going on.”Robinson, who has worked for SeaWorld for 48 years, has become very accustomed to this routine. Over the last two weeks, as the outbreak had intensified and spread from Malibu down to San Diego, he has been on a rescue run at least once every day.“I’m a little bit tired, but, I mean, this is what rescue is about. It gives you a sense of purpose for the day,” he said. “The goal is to do some really good work and to help these animals out. There’s your motivation.”The rescue team’s ultimate hope is that rehabilitated animals can be successfully released back into the wild. So far this year, SeaWorld has returned 10 sea lions that were treated for suspected domoic acid poisoning.After Robinson and Plein’s mission in Ocean Beach, they headed back to SeaWorld. The rest of the afternoon could involve a lot more action, Robinson said, whether that meant more sea lion rescues or animal intakes. Technically, he works until 5.30pm each day – but that can easily change, especially as domoic acid poisonings continue. Although it’s uncertain how long this current toxic algae bloom will last. Previous blooms have sometimes lingered for months.“If need be,” Robinson said, starting back towards the rescue truck, “we’re here 24 hours.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSeaWorldOceansMarine lifeWest CoastWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

If only there were a supersonic jet that could cruise at 1.7 times the speed of sound, and get me there two hours quicker than the typical JFK-to-Denver route.There soon might be. Scholl is the CEO of Boom Supersonic, a company betting that ordinary civilians want to shoot across the sky at 1,100 miles (1,700 kilometres) per hour. After the pandemic brought a slump to the skies,air travel has returned to its former levels, andin-person business events are back on track. As a faster option for these travellers, Boom is developing its breakneck jets to be operational by 2029 – nearly a quarter century after Concorde landed its last plane.Aside from keeping the slender, pointed design, Boom distances itself fromConcorde, which Scholl calls “a false start” to a supersonic age. In Boom’s revived version, its 64-seater airliners could whizz across the Atlantic in three-and-a-half hours, at least twice as fast as commercial carriers, and check off hundreds of new routes such as Madrid to Miami, or Tokyo to Seattle. They would lean into software and algorithms to tweak speed and altitude based on real-time conditions. Boom is already “a darling of the bros at Silicon Valley,” says Brian Foley, a US-based aviation industry analyst and former aerospace engineer, pointing to investors including OpenAI’s Sam Altman.But sceptics will compare Boom to Concorde, and question whether it can overcome the list of issues that led to its predecessor’s decline, including price, demand, safety, regulation and the environment – all of which may remain stubborn barriers.To its credit, Boom has appeared to solve one of Concorde’s major hurdles: the sonic boom, the ear-splitting thunderclap heard on the ground when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound. When an aeroplane moves, molecules ahead have to get out of the way; as it breaks the sound barrier, the craft catches up and drags the molecules along with it. The sudden disruption causes a shock wave, felt as a deafening roar.Boom’s airliners could whizz across the Atlantic in three-and-a-half hours and check off hundreds of new routesConcorde couldn’t escape the boom as it flew at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound. “When they got it wrong, it was smashing greenhouses and scaring little old ladies,” says Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire. The sheer sound forced noise regulations in Europe, and in the US an outright ban on supersonic flight in 1973, relegating Concorde to oceanic routes such as London to New York.That isn’t enough for Boom, which wants to capture the domestic business market and fly above land at Mach 1.7. So, in quite the physics feat, Boom has eliminated the sonic boom.It has put into practice a longstanding theory of refraction known as “Mach cutoff”, which works via the same law that makes a pencil appear to bend in a glass of water in the classic school lab experiment. As the plane flies, the sound wave refracts towards colder temperatures, curling upwards. It keeps turning upwards until it reaches space.View image in fullscreenA British Airways Concorde flight shortly after takeoff, July 2000.Photograph: REUTERSDuring two supersonic test flights in January and February, with a specially built craft a third of the proposed size, Boom demonstrated the Mach cutoff six times, without an audible boom on each occasion.Boom’s planned aircraft, Overture, is still in early development and will be a different beast, especially because Boom is making its own engine. That’s rare in an industry where commercial craft invariably use engines from the established giants such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce. “I’m not convinced the current team assembled has the experience or depth or capability to develop a supersonic engine,” Foley says.If they can do it, their timing is opportune. The first American-built civilian supersonic jet is likely to be welcomed by a protectionist federal administration gung-ho on US manufacture and deregulation. In the Oval Office in February, Donald Trump posed with an Overture model, and Elon Musk pledged to overturn the supersonic ban. The $600m infusion of funding from some of his billionaire peers won’t hurt.Boom isn’t the only company developing a “quiet” supersonic aircraft. Nasa is testing its ownexperimental X-59 jet. And an aircraft from China’s state-owned manufacturerComac is reportedly under way, according to a self-released paper. A patriotic aerospace race could further spur legislation. “Let’s beat ’em,” Scholl posted on X, with a US flag emoji.But success will ultimately depend on consumer demand. The tragic crash in 2000 of an Air France Concorde catalysed its downfall, which was compounded by the downturn in air travel after 9/11. It’s unclear whether the public wants supersonic travel – or even knows of its existence. The only surveys that exist are Boom’s own (which unsurprisingly claim that 97% of passengers want it); two major aviation research firms told me there’s no real data.Demand will be driven by affordability. “Concorde was for royalty and rock stars,” Scholl says of its $20,000 tickets in today’s money. He estimates Boom could start at $5,000 for a transatlantic flight, akin to some business-class fares. But at a time of inflation, it’s not cheap. Despite Scholl’s vision for our in-person meeting, freelance journalists are not the target market, though he says he predicts economy-level fares “for the rest of us” by the late 2030s.Foley isn’t swayed. “This isn’t a ‘scale big’ aerospace segment,” he says. “It’s a very niche market.” Major carriers such as American and United have already put in orders for aircraft, but Foley says that’s a typical PR move for carriers to show their progressiveness. Eventually, they’ll cave to pure cost-per-seat-mile economics. The private jet market may be a better fit, but even with their participation, Foley estimates Boom would probably only sell about 300 aircraft over 10 years.The private jet sector is routinely under fire for its poor environmental record, burning far more fuel per passenger mile. And while aviation in general accounts for2.5% of all emissions, the industry continues to grow, leading to predictions it willdouble its carbon output by 2050.Boom founder Blake Scholl: from high school dropout to supersonic high-flyerRead moreScholl says Overture will be built to be compatible with sustainable aviation fuel, and that choosing between innovative tech and the environment is a “mistaken trade-off”. The public may have different ideas. Even in the 1960s, Concorde faced eco-pushback around emerging ozone layer concerns, and advocacy from grassroots campaigns such as the Citizens League Against the Sonic Boom helped secure the bans.Today, Gratton says it’s “irresponsible” for a supersonic jet that burns two to three times more fuel to be launched in a full-fledged climate crisis. “As an aeronautical engineer, I am absolutely thrilled with what Boom are doing,” he says. “As an environmental scientist, I’m horrified.”“They are doing very clever work,” Gratton says. “Whether it’s a good idea that they do it – that’s the tougher question.”Explore more on these topicsScienceThe ObserverAir transportConcordeShareReuse this content"

We don’t value boys and masculinity. Too many young men are isolated. Boys and young men are in crisis.The headlines, opinion pieces and speeches about the crisis facing boys and men have been relentless in recent weeks, as the Netflix drama Adolescence has sparked conversations fromthe school gates to the Houses of Parliament.But while public debate has focused on the crisis facing boys, a series of less remarked upon statistics suggest that girls are far from being the winners of a zero-sum game.The Children’s Commissioner for England told the Guardianthis week that the current debate risked pitting boys and girls against each other – to the detriment of both.“This is an optimistic generation, eager for change – but both boys and girls are facing pressures and influences that previous generations never imagined,” said Rachel de Souza. “We can’t pit boys against girls, because these are shared issues for every child.”Last month a report from the Centre for Social Justice argued that the last 100 years had “been marked by great leaps forward in outcomes and rights for women” but in this generation “it is boys who are being left behind”. TheLost Boysreport noted that in education girls were outperforming boys “from nursery to university”, while men aged 16-24 were more likely to be unemployed than young women, and if in full-time work, paid on average 9% less.Yet men are still more likely to be paid significantly more over their working lives, with their earnings “almost completely unaffected by parenthood”, according toanalysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It showed that women’s earnings fell sharply after they have children and stabilised at a much lower level with little growth – seven years after the birth of a first child, women’s earnings are on average less than half of men’s.In terms of education, girls inEnglandsay they feel less safe at school and are more disenchanted, according to research published last week. Research from the University of Manchesterpublished last monthasked teenage girls about their experiences of school and found that outperforming came with its own pitfalls. “On the narrative that girls are always outperforming boys, some of them said, ‘Well, that’s quite a lot of pressure, actually’,” said the report author, Dr Ola Demkowicz. “‘There’s this assumption that we’re fine’.”Schools fear impact of budget cuts amid girls’ mental health crisisRead moreAnd current research suggests that is far from the case. While there is a widely recognised mental health crisis among all young people – a study published in theLancetearlier this year revealed that the number of children admitted to acute hospital wards in England with serious mental health concerns hasincreased by 65% in a decade– other research suggests girls are particularly hard hit.Recent data from a Europe-widestudyby the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggested that English girls are the sickest and unhappiest in Europe. Almost two-thirds of 11-year-old English girls – more than in any other European country – reported having multiple health issues at least twice a week, while also experiencing the poorest mental health in all of the 44 countries examined. This chimed with a report last year from the Children’s Society, which found that 15-year-old girls’ average life satisfactionworsenedbetween 2018 and 2022, while boys’ satisfaction remained largely the same.It is a picture that Dr Elaine Lockhart, the chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ child and adolescent faculty, recognises. “We’re absolutely running to try and catch up and not very successfully, unfortunately, because there is so much demand,” she said. “The girls we are seeing are the tip of the iceberg … behind them will be many more who will be sub-clinically anxious or sad.”NHS numbers show a large increase in the number of girls admitted to hospital after self-harming, while annual admissions for eating disorders (which, according toNHS data, are four times more prevalent among 11- to 16-year-old girls than boys) also grew from 478 to 2,938 over the last decade.“I would also say boys aren’t doing great either,” stressed Lockhart. “I wonder if part of this is that girls and women are more likely to present with emotional disorders and boys with behavioural problems – it is the same two sides of the same coin.”Covid hasundoubtedly had an impacton children and young people, while an increasing number of countries are taking action tolimit the impact of potentially damaging online contenton children’s mental health.Children and teens were finding the normal challenges of growing up “totally distorted” by the pressures of social media, the rise of the influencer and the 24-hour nature of communication, said de Souza. “In many ways I’m worried that we’ve gone backwards as a society,” she said.But wider social norms and outdated structural systems, such as parental leave entitlements, were letting both girls and boys down, said Joeli Brearley, a maternity discrimination campaigner and host of the To Be A Boy podcast. “Something is going badly wrong,” she said. “The old systems don’t stand any more, but this generation needs help and support to create a society that doesn’t leave them feeling like they are looking into the abyss.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthGirls' mental health crisisHealthHealth policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This leads to a reduction of the chemical dopamine which plays an important part in controlling movement.This new test, which the Times reports costs £80, analyses small pieces of genetic material known as transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) in the blood, focusing on a repetitive RNA sequence that accumulates in Parkinson’s patients.It also looks at a parallel decline in mitochondrial RNA, which deteriorates as the disease progresses. Mitochondria exist inside cells and generate energy.By measuring the ratio between these biomarkers, researchers said the test “offers a highly accurate, non-invasive, rapid and affordable diagnostic tool, providing hope for early interventions and treatments that could change the course of the disease”.On a scale where a score of 1 indicates a perfect test while 0.5 shows the test is no better than flipping a coin, the test scored 0.86, the Times reported.The best clinical tests presently used on patients showing early signs of the disease scored 0.73, according to the study published in the journalNature Aging.The test uses the same PCR technology used during the pandemic to confirm Covid cases. It works by amplifying the genetic material being targeted, which allows it to be detected.“This discovery represents a major advancement in our understanding of Parkinson’s disease and offers a simple, minimally invasive blood test as a tool for early diagnosis,” said Prof Hermona Soreq of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who supervised the study. “By focusing on tRFs, we’ve opened a new window into the molecular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease.”Prof David Dexter, director of research at Parkinson’s UK, said: “This research represents a new angle to explore in the search for a biological marker for Parkinson’s. In this case the marker can be identified and measured in the blood which makes it attractive for a future patient-friendly diagnostic test for Parkinson’s.“More work is needed to continue to test and validate this possible test, especially understanding how it can distinguish between other conditions that have similar early signs to Parkinson’s.”The study was led by PhD student Nimrod Madrer under the supervision of Prof Soreq at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences and the Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, at the Hebrew University, in collaboration with Dr Iddo Paldor from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, and Dr Eyal Soreq from the University of Surrey and the Imperial College London.Explore more on these topicsParkinson's diseaseMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They said: “We take concerns about bullying seriously and strongly encourage anyone who experiences such behaviour to report it.”Just 27% of staff agreed that they were happy with attempts to address bullying and harassment – with some of the most high-profile science departments scoring especially badly – and only half of staff (52%) said their department supported their mental health and wellbeing.The results have prompted an academic at the university, astrophysicist Prof Wyn Evans, to break with tradition and seek nominations in the forthcoming election of Cambridge’s new chancellor on an anti-bullying manifesto, after Labour peer David Sainsbury announced his resignation from the post last year.View image in fullscreenProf Wyn Evans wants to seek nominations in the forthcoming election of Cambridge’s new chancellor on an anti-bullying manifesto.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverEvans said: “This survey reveals a grim culture of bullying and harassment, yet the most shocking thing of all is that the university found this out a year ago and hasn’t taken any action.“If a senior academic is valuable to the university because they hold a lot of research grants bringing in a lot of money, Cambridge won’t touch them,” he added. “If there is a grievance, it will be discarded.”The chancellorship is a largely ceremonial position that is expected to attract big name alumni, including leading politicians and peers. William Hague, the former Conservative leader and foreign secretary, waselected chancellor of Oxford Universitylast November, andPrince Philippreceded Lord Sainsbury at Cambridge.Evans said that having an outward-facing ambassadorial chancellor had worked well in the past, but the university was facing an “internal crisis” of bullying and too many academics on insecure short-term contracts. It now needed a chancellor who would push for “sweeping reforms”.A survey by the university and the three main campus unions in 2020 found thatnearly a third of staff had experienced bullyingor harassment at work in the previous 18 months. Then vice-chancellor Stephen Toope wrote a statement to accompany the survey results, pledging action and stating: “To be a leading institution, we must accept this type of behaviour has no place at Cambridge.”The university is far from alone in facing challenges of this kind. In 2020,a survey by the Wellcome Trust, one of the largest charitable funders of research in the UK, questioned more than 4,000 researchers across 20 universities, and found that nearly two-thirds of them had witnessed bullying and harassment, and 43% had experienced it themselves.More than three-quarters of them felt that intense competition to win research grants and publish in high-profile journals – with research departments also competing to perform well in league tables and respond to government initiatives – had created “unkind and aggressive” conditions.Diego Baptista, head of research and funding equity at Wellcome, said: “Research shouldn’t come at the cost of damaging people’s wellbeing, and it’s encouraging to see institutions asking students and staff about the issues they face.”He added: “The research sector can and should learn from one another. By painting a picture of people’s experiences, we are all better placed to design a positive and inclusive research culture.”Wellcome has explicit anti-bullying, exploitation and harassment rules as a pre-condition of its grants, and in 2018 revoked £3.5m in funding fromProf Nazneen Rahman, one of Britain’s leading cancer scientists, who was then based at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, after 45 colleagues made accusations of bullying and harassment.Rahman, who resigned from the institute, denied the allegations and said at the time “there were no disciplinary findings against me”.Cambridge declined to release survey results for some of its departments under FoI. However, among the detailed results seen by theObserver,there are some departments with more concerning results. In the Medical Research Council toxicology unit, 69% of staff who responded disagreed or strongly disagreed when asked if they were happy with how bullying and harassment was addressed.In the department of pathology, this figure was 61%; in the Cavendish laboratory of physics it was 58%; and at both the Cancer Research UK (CRUK) Cambridge Institute and in the department of oncology it was 50%. Other departments with close to half of staff disagreeing or strongly disagreeing that these issues were tackled well included earth sciences, history and astronomy.A cancer researcher who left the university recently and claims they were “intimidated, harassed and bullied” by a senior academic at CRUK Cambridge Institute said: “Research was my whole life. I really looked forward to coming into the department, exchanging ideas and inspiring research students. I was left despairing and had many months of demoralisation.”The researcher said: “The ordeal ruined my personal life. I stopped sleeping. I had support from friends, colleagues and former students – but from the university just bland exhortations to see the GP.”Dr Krzysztof Potempa, founder of biotech startup Braincures, supported a colleague in blowing the whistle on bullying at a UK research institute and now campaigns for universities to tackle the issue better. He said: “Sadly, complaints against revenue-generating professors often result in the victim leaving, while the perpetrator continues to build their career.”The spokesperson for Cambridge added: “The university strives to provide an inclusive and supportive working environment where all staff feel valued.”He said that the university had introduced a new code of behaviour and updated its dignity-at-work and grievance policies.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of CambridgeThe ObserverHigher educationBullyingResearch fundingUniversity fundingResearchFreedom of informationnewsShareReuse this content"

Cured meats, raw meats and milk are off limits regardless of whether they are packed, packaged or have been bought at duty-free.FMD does not directly affect humans, but it can be devastating to cattle, and while there are no cases in the UK at present, the government wants to keep it that way.FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cattle, sheep, pigs, and other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boars and deer.In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the outbreak in Europe “presents a significant risk to farm businesses and livestock”. The disease can cause “significant economic losses due to production shortfalls in the affected animals, as well as loss of access to foreign markets for animals, meat and dairy”, it added.Earlier this year, the government placedbans on imports of cattle, sheep, other ruminants, pig meat and dairy products from Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Austriain response to outbreaks of FMD in those countries.UK bans German meat and dairy products after foot-and-mouth caseRead moreThe new restrictions apply only to travellers arriving in Great Britain and will not be imposed on personal imports arriving in Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man.The minister for food security and rural affairs, Daniel Zeichner, said: “This government will do whatever it takes to protect British farmers from foot-and-mouth. That is why we are further strengthening protections by introducing restrictions on personal meat and dairy imports to prevent the spread of the disease and protect Britain’s food security.”The UK deputy chief veterinary officer for international and trade affairs, Jorge Martin-Almagro, said: “Robust contingency plans are already in place to manage the risk of this disease to protect farmers and Britain’s food security. This biosecurity measure, combined with all others we have implemented, are critical to limit the risk of FMD incursion.”Martin-Almagro urged livestock keepers to keep an eye out for signs of disease, maintain biosecurity, and immediately report any suspicion of disease to the Animal and Plant Health Agency.There are exemptions from the new rules, including a limited amount of infant milk, medical foods, and certain composite products such as chocolate, confectionery, bread, cakes, biscuits and pasta.The government said: “Those found with these items will need to either surrender them at the border or will have them seized and destroyed. In serious cases, those found with these items run the risk of incurring fines of up to £5,000 inEngland.”Explore more on these topicsFoot-and-mouth diseaseFood & drink industryEuropean UnionFoot-and-mouthEuropeEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

And the most hated? Brummie.Geordie was liked, she told an audience in Sunderland, but from one end of the country to the other it wasBirminghamthat was particularly disliked.Adie was speaking at an event marking the cataloguing of a huge archive of material documenting her life and career. From starting out at BBC Radio Durham to covering the Troubles, numerous wars and the student uprising in Tiananmen Square, Adie was for years one of Britain’s best-known and most trusted television reporters.Her archive of more than 2,300 objects includes dozens of notebooks as well as tapes, letters, photographs and video clips. It was donated to the University of Sunderland a number of years ago butfunding to properly catalogue the items only came last year.View image in fullscreenBBC News reporter Kate Adie at home near Kew in London in 1980.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesAdie was brought up in Sunderland but has never had a strong accent, she said. Nor did her parents, who adopted her as a baby, “or their parents”.She said: “It is one of this country’s complex matters. Accents vary hugely and how they are received varies hugely.“Years and years ago the BBC had an unofficial league table of the most liked and the most hated accents.“The view was that some of them drove people nuts up and down the country. Geordie did pretty well. It’s liked.”Adie asked the audience to guess what the most disliked accent was. A chorus of “Birmingham” followed. They were correct, Adie said.“From one end of the country to another, it’s Birmingham! Michael Buerk, who comes from Birmingham, was once asked why he didn’t use the accent. He said, ‘I didn’t want death threats’.”She said dissertations could be written on news programme accents, recalling her days at BBC Radio Durham when a locally accented producer would read the bulletin. “We got complaints from everywhere. The whole range of audience. They felt it wasn’t right for news. It is a curious one.”Her big break came as duty reporter in May 1980, during the Iranian embassy siege. Her coverage was groundbreaking but did not make her an instant star, she said. “I was sent off to a pools winner the next day.”The archive includes a bullet that grazed Adie when she was reporting from Tiananmen Square but said her worst moment was in Belfast where she thought she had been shot in the face, dropped down and assumed she was going to die.View image in fullscreenAdie in a BBC Radio Durham car.Photograph: HandoutThen she heard her cameraman shouting: “Get up! Get up! You’ve been hit in the face by a potato!”The archive shines a light on Adie’s happy childhood – “lots of tennis” – and her time at the National Youth Theatre, which was not quite the Shakespearean study group her teacher had imagined.It was instead a large group of “randy 17- and 18-year-olds,” she said. “We had fun.”Adie recalled the theatre having people from all backgrounds. She remembered meeting a memorably quirky girl. “I wonder what happened to Helen Mirren?”TheUniversity of Sunderlandsaid the cataloguing essentially “unlocks” the Adie collection. It includes images from her first BBC job in 1968 at Durham where her annual salary was £934 a year and its first story was a pigeon race.She went on to BBC jobs in Plymouth, Bristol and the south coast where she was tipped off about a double murder in Brighton. She and her crew captured great footage but her news editor in Southampton was unimpressed – she was meant to be covering an embroidery exhibition in Ditchling.View image in fullscreenA ‘keepsafe’ box of items collected by Kate Adie in her travels, including a piece of the Berlin Wall, and a small model of St Peter’s church in Monkwearmouth.Photograph: HandoutShe was sacked, she said, but by chance a national news editor rang her to see if she was free for a shift and she told him about the murder and she joined the London newsroom.David Bell, the university’s vice-chancellor and chief executive, said Adie was one of the most talented broadcasters of her, or any, generation and there were plans to digitise key strands of the collection.“By unlocking the Kate Adie collection this way, the university hopes to educate and inspire audiences, both young and old, with the accomplishments of a Sunderland-raised pioneer in her field.”Adie admitted she was something of a hoarder. “I’m just one of those people who goes to clear the attic and then never does.”Adie is 79 but can still be heard presentingFrom Our Own Correspondenton BBC Radio 4.Asked about the state of news reporting today, she said she would love to see a small radio station in every UK town providing local information.“I think every area of this country, except London, is badly reported. I think a lot of places are neglected, seriously. I’ve seen a thing in New Zealand where the local newspaper is on the same building floor as the local TV and the local radio. They all work together and it works. It is wonderful and it is not expensive.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamThe news on TVBBCUniversity of SunderlandTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Our final brain surgery update,” a joyful McCall, who was joined by her boyfriend, Michael Douglas, told her 2.1m Instagram followers on Saturday.“I was a bit nervous about it because I knew if any of it was left, then it would grow back, and I’d just go through the whole thing again – which I was prepared to do,” McCall said in a sunny video.“I was also very nervous about it,” said Douglas, who had cared for the 57-year-old as she recovered at home, adding: “It’s been a huge journey.”“But it was clear!” revealed McCall.The couple also shared their “heartfelt” gratitude for the medical teams as well as their friends and family who supported them throughout.“I am so, so grateful, particularly because I know a lot of people have inoperable tumours, and I know I’m lucky to be able to draw a line under this and move on with my life when so many people can’t,” she said.Colloid cysts are benign, fluid-filled sacs in the brain’s ventricles, the four cavities in the brain. Benign tumours are not cancerous, and they account for less than 2% of all primary brain tumours, but the rate of growth and symptoms can vary from person to person.These brain tumours are more common in the over-50s. Symptoms to look out for are headaches, vision problems and drowsiness, the NHS website says.McCall added she wanted to disabuse people of the assumption that benign brain tumours were not life-threatening, as they could be fatal. “And I’m just gonna say this one more time … benign does not mean fine.”Explore more on these topicsDavina McCallHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

All beer used to be served in casks, but the practice faded from the beginning of the 20th century as easier-to-maintain, highly carbonated keg lagers became popular.“We’re the only nation that meaningfully holds on to this tradition,” said Garrett, who loves cask ale for its “softer, moussier” feel in the mouth.“We’ve ended up with this incredible brewing tradition of about 4% malt-led, bittersweet beers that is, in the brewing scene, the envy of the world. Yet we tend to pass over it and fetishise American, Belgian and German brewing. We have our own world-famous heritage.”He added that drinking cask ale was like “tasting how our ancestors enjoyed beer”.The initiative has been backed by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) and several breweries, including Timothy Taylor’s, Five Points and Shepherd Neame, which together own hundreds of pubs around the UK.View image in fullscreenJonny Garrett, who runs The Craft Beer Channel on YouTube, and his business partner Brad Evans.Photograph: Heather AdlingtonGarrett, who also runs the CraftBeerChannel on YouTube, hopes to raise awareness about cask ale, which still makes up about 10% of draught sales – more in strongholds such as Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield.Garrett estimated that 3% to 4% of the market is craft keg beer, yet it “gets most of the headlines”. The campaign also seeks to protect breweries –the UK had 100 fewerin January 2025 than the year before – as well as barley and hop growers. According to the British Hop Association, only about 50 hop farms remain in the UK.Earning cultural heritage status would provide a multi-pronged boost, said Garrett. The government would be beholden to protect the culture around cask ale and it could provide an “extra tool for bargaining” against raising alcohol duty or business rates. It would also provide funding for research and education, helping to bring in younger generations.WhenBelgian beer culture was recognised in 2016, Garrett said it led to an “incredible surge in interest, both within Belgium but also in terms of tourism. That would be of real benefit, particularly now, when times are so tough for pubs and breweries”.The corporate takeover of ‘craft beer’ leaves a nasty taste in the mouth | Katie MatherRead morePete Wells, chief executive of Wells & Co in Bedfordshire, said that cask ale had been an “important part” of the brewery’s 149-year history.“The fantastic campaign is something we are pleased to support, and hope that this will honour what we have always known – that cask ale is a heritage worth protecting, while rejuvenating interest in a continuously changing market.”Camra’s chair, Ash Corbett-Collins, said that cask beers were threatened by global brewing conglomerates absorbing historic breweries – “only to ignore and eventually disregard their beers”.Garrett said there were rays of hope, with rising interest among the young craft beer crowd. He added that there were several reasons cask ale might be ripe for resurrection: it is generally lower in alcohol, more affordable and made more naturally – which should appeal to younger drinkers.“A superb pint of cask ale is at the heart of what makes a great British pub,” said Richard Bradbury, managing director of Theakston Brewery in North Yorkshire.“It would be fantastic to have that recognised and celebrated byUnesco. In this era of protectionism, it may, in time, motivate a lower rate of excise duty on cask beer.”Corbett-Collins added: “The incredibly skilled brewers producing cask beer deserve to have their artisan trade respected and protected.”Explore more on these topicsBeerThe ObserverUnescoBelgiumUnited NationsPubsAlcoholHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Much of this week’s appeal and the original hearing about his security were heard in private because of the “highly confidential” evidence. “People would be shocked by what’s being held back,” he said, adding that his “worst fears have been confirmed by the whole legal disclosure in this case and that’s really sad”.The prince was not required to give evidence at the hearing, but flew from his home in California to attend what has been described as the “last throw of the dice” to overturn a decision. He “comprehensively lost” his case against the Home Office in February 2024 when Mr Justice Lane ruled that the government’s decision to remove his security was not unfair.Harry reportedly views the removal of his and Meghan’s security as “a means of trying to force them back into Britain and establishment life, by making visits to the UK as outsiders more difficult and potentially unsafe”.The prince also believes that his father, King Charles, could have intervened to reinstate his security detail because the king’s private secretary, Sir Clive Alderton, sits on the royal and VIP executive committee, but Buckingham Palace denied it had any decision-making power.It is understood that Alderton was not on the committee when the decision over Harry’s security was made five years ago after he and Meghan had left their royal duties.A palace source said: “These are matters of security and government policy and, as usual, it would be inappropriate to comment or intervene on either.”It is alleged that Harry is still not on speaking terms with his father and brother. Harry saw the king last February after Charles was diagnosed with cancer, but they have not met since.A result of his appeal will be handed down by a panel of three judges after Easter.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryMonarchyHome OfficeMeghan, the Duchess of SussexKing Charles IIICourt of appealnewsShareReuse this content"

In a sign the talks over a joint agenda had gone well, they agreed to meet again on 19 April.A breakdown would have come if Donald Trump had demanded the complete dismantling of Iran’s civil nuclear programme, something thatIranis not prepared to contemplate. Iran insists it is pursuing only a civil nuclear programme, but Donald Trump took the US out of the previous nuclear deal claiming Tehran’s regime was seeking a nuclear weapon.It appears he is resolved to pursue an updated version of the deal.The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the talks had been “constructive”, and held in a “calm and respectful environment” with “no sharp words exchanged”.“Both sides don’t want to talk for sake of talking and wasting time, and want to reach a deal as quickly as possible. Both sides showed commitment to take these talks forward until we reach a favourable deal,” he added.Oman’s foreign minister acted as the mediator in the talks in Muscat, shuttling between Araghchi and Trump’s diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff.Witkoff has admitted he does not have technical expertise about civil nuclear disarmament programmes, but Trump implicitly trusts his judgment.Witkoff also said the discussions had been held in a positive and constructive atmosphere. It is likely the next set of talks will not be held in Muscat, but Oman will retain the role of shuttling between the two negotiating teams in separate rooms.It is understood that the two diplomats did have a brief exchange at the end of the process, but it was described as not a fully fledged negotiation.An Iranian condition for the talks wasthere would be no direct talks with the USwhile Iran is under US economic sanctions.Iran says talks with US will be indirect, contrary to Trump’s wordsRead moreBut what was more important to the Iranian side was whether Witkoff would demand Iran stop uranium enrichment altogether and end its civil nuclear programme. There was also concern Trump might table demands that Iran stop backing militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.Witkoff mapped out an agenda apparently similar to the intent behind the 2015 nuclear deal, but that will also have to address the fact that since 2018 Iran has amassed a large stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a purity greater than what is required for a civil nuclear programme.The next round of talks will have to agree how to dispense with this stockpile and how Iran will allow the reintroduction of an independent inspection regime. The UN nuclear weapon inspectorate, the IAEA, has seen its cameras switched off in Iran’s key nuclear sites on successive occasions, making it next to impossible to know what Iran is producing.Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is due in Iran next week, but it is not clear whether he is yet working in tandem with the small and relatively inexperienced US negotiating team.Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said he was proud to have hosted the talks in Muscat and to have mediated. He said the goal was “a process of dialogue and negotiations with the shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.”“I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability. We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal,” he added.View image in fullscreenA copy of the Iranian daily newspaper Etemaad on Saturday shows a composite picture of Araghchi and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPASina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said “the outcome signals progress. A likely framework is likely now on the table, centred on no weaponisation and sanctions relief.”Toosi added: “Both sides were likely to sound positive today – even with talks focused on format and agenda – because they currently need the negotiations to continue.“But without real progress, this dynamic – sustainable in past talks – is unlikely to hold as long this time.”Ryan Costello, policy director with the National Iranian American Council, said the parties had cleared a low bar today.He said: “Now, it is important for both the US and Iran to insulate the apparent positive environment of negotiations from those who want to sabotage a move toward a deal.“Each side should exercise restraint. For the US, this could mean dialling back the military threats. President Trump will also have to make sure that Israel does not go behind the administration’s back and undertake provocative steps that could derail negotiations, including sabotage, as we saw in 2021.“For Iran, signalling more openness to direct negotiations and ceasing warnings of weaponisation options can help build momentum toward and put a breakthrough in reach.”With the Iranian economy in freefall, and Iranians suffering energy blackouts, the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has always favoured talks with the US as the way to escape “the cage of sanctions”, but he has faced resistance from parliamentary hardliners and parts of the group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On 7 February, Khamenei said experience showed it was “not rational, intelligent or honourable” to hold talks with Trump, a judgment that Pezeshkian said he had no option but to accept.But the Iranian foreign ministry – supportive of talks – persuaded Khamenei that his regime, already weakened by reverses in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, might crumble unless he negotiated. Trump also threatened to give Israel the freedom to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites.To preserve Iran’s dignity, Khamenei insisted the initial talks at least be indirect, but there will be pressure from the US side to allow direct talks. The two countries broke off formal diplomatic relations after the 1979 Iranian revolution.Pezeshkian, in an effort to talk Trump’s transactional language, said this week: “His excellency [Khamenei] has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran. American investors: come and invest.”Trump, too, has relented both in his rhetoric and possibly his demands, saying on Friday: “I’m not asking for much; they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” adding: “I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be a great, wonderful, happy country.” Trump and Witkoff also badly need a diplomatic breakthrough since their peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine have so far been abject flops. A further war in the Middle East is fiercely resisted by the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia.Netanyahu said this week that a deal would only work if Iran’s nuclear facilities were blown up, “under American supervision with American execution”. He also called for a “Libya-style agreement”, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi’s voluntary dismantlement of his nuclear programme under international supervision. But Iran senses that Netanyahu is losing influence with Trump over the nuclear file.Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who is involved in parallel talks with European leaders, said: “If the American side does not raise irrelevant issues and demands and puts aside threats and intimidation, there is a good possibility of reaching an agreement. The Islamic republic of Iran believes in dialogue and interaction based on mutual respect, and any bullying and coercion is unacceptable in our view.”Araghchi, a veteran of the 2015 talks who holds a PhD in political thought from the University of Kent, is accompanied by a technical team.Iran, which has a reputation for being an exhaustive and exhausting negotiator, knows it is working against a deadline of two months, European officials say, because the UK, Germany and France must signal by the end of July whether they will reimpose punishing UN sanctions against Tehran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on 18 October.Explore more on these topicsIranIran's nuclear programmeOmanMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyTrump administrationNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

And it has a longer-term economic costSat 12 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 02.53 EDTShareMinutes after Donald Trumpunveiled a climbdown on tariffs, softening an extraordinary US attack on trade from much of the world, his press secretary scolded reporters at the White House.“Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” said Karoline Leavitt, referring to the 1987 bestseller which laid the foundations of the president’s reputation as a consummate dealmaker.Outside the administration, Wednesday’s 90-day pause of vast tariffs on dozens of countries – the latest bewildering reversal on tariffs since he took office, coming as his deputies repeatedly swore the levies were here to stay – conjured up a different fable.“Really, like the boy who cried wolf, you can only do this so many times,” said John Cochrane, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. “It really does piss people off.“These tariffs are an answer in search of a question,” said Cochrane. “It always comes down to tariffs, and then the reasons for them keep changing.”Trump and his officials have long put forward a consistent, but contradictory, case for high tariffs. They will lure an influx of manufacturers to set up plants in the US, according to the administration while at the same time enabling the US to tax the world, not its citizens and prompting a stream of countries to strike new deals with Washington and eliminate US trade deficits – the gap between what it imports and exports – with other leading economies. Economists can’t see this working.“I think the Trump administration is floundering,” said Simon Johnson, a Nobel prize-winning economist and professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. “They know they’ve got an issue that grabs attention … They don’t know the endgame they want.”Nor has the implementation of the slated tariffs been consistent. Officials who had spent days explaining how this stunning wave of tariffs would create millions of US jobs and raise trillions of dollars were sent out to explain why its part-reversal was, in fact, a shrewd masterstroke – billed by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, as part of “the greatest economic master strategy from an American president” in history.Even Trump struggled to claim this move was part of a carefully crafted plan. People “were getting yippy”, he said, when asked why he ordered the pause. He later acknowledged “transition problems”, as companies and consumers struggled to keep up with developments.Just 10 days ago, the president – on what he claimed would go down as “one of the most important days” in US history – announced a baseline tariff of 10% on most of his country’s imports, and significantly higher tariffs on specific nations. 2 April 2025 would forever be remembered as “liberation day”, according to Trump and his aides.Stock markets tanked, US government bond markets endured a sharp sell-off, and even some of Trump’s allies warned of widespread disruption. But he imposed the 10% tariff anyway, insisting that he would not be moved.On Wednesday, hours after the US introduced the higher tariff rates on about 60 markets, Trump abruptly changed tack. For 90 days, he said, these markets – including the EU (20%), Japan (24%) and the Falkland Islands (41%) – would face the blanket 10% rate, after all. Only China, which hit back hard with its own tariffs on US exports, would face a targeted US tariff of 145%.View image in fullscreenA stock ticker shows the Dow trending down in New York on Thursday.Photograph: Sarah Yenesel/EPAWhile markets briefly surged back, confusion and uncertainty loomed large. “I think the probability of an across-the-board cataclysm has receded,” said Johnson. “Until the next time Mr Trump speaks publicly.”Nothing is certain under this president. Fromlongstanding geopolitical relationshipstoconstitutional term limits, he has little time for established norms. Erratic policymaking is a feature, not a bug, of his administration.Trump has forged this uncertainty, and uses it as a short-term political tool – leaving the world to hang on his every word, be it uttered in the Oval Office, or posted on his social network. But it has a longer-term economic cost, too.“It used to be that a country could sign a trade agreement and have fair confidence that that meant that there’d be free trade,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prize-winning economist and professor at Columbia University. “With Trump, no confidence. It’s added a permanent level of uncertainty into all cross-border transactions.”Sure, this week’s pause removes the imminent danger of “complete Covid-level and more supply chain chaos”, said Cochrane. “You’re not going to have that immediate effect. But you’re certainly going to have the chilling effect that nobody knows what’s coming next.”Facing the threat of higher prices as a result of tariffs, some consumers hunker down and curb their spending. Others make bigger purchases now, earlier than planned, for fear of paying more next week, or month.Johnson, for example, went out and bought a car this week for his daughter, who did not need it for another two months. Uncertainty can be “an inducement to buy consumer durables”, he said. “But from a business investment perspective, it is probably a delaying factor.”How many global executives are prepared to commission a new factory, and fund months, if not years, of construction, in a market where the economic landscape shifts drastically from one week to the next?For now, at least, one thing firms can count on is spiraling tensions between the world’s two largest economies. After a dramatic escalation in recent days, the US is now charging a tariff of 145% on Chinese exports, and China is charging a tariff of 125% on US exports.“We are very interdependent on China – right through our whole supply chain,” Stiglitz, former chief economist of the World Bank and chair of the US Council of Economic Advisers, said of the US. “Doubling the cost of every input is going to mean the cost of our goods are going to go up.”Chinese-manufactured finished products, from consumer goods to electronics, are likely to be hit, noted Cochrane – but key parts and tools for other goods will also be affected. “Everything at Walmart is going to double as a result of Trump’s tariffs on China,” he said.View image in fullscreenA container ship port in Shenzhen, China, on Friday.Photograph: Cheng Xin/Getty ImagesSuch expectations have heightened fears of “stagflation”, an unpalatable economic cocktail of both stagnant growth and high inflation. The US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, haswarnedin recent weeks of “higher inflation and slower growth”, while the JPMorgan Chase boss, Jamie Dimon, reported that Trump’s tariffs have prompted “many” to consider “a greater probability” of recession.“We may be facing inflationary pressures and – at the same time because of the shortage of key components, with increased prices – we also may be facing unemployment,” Stiglitz said. “There’s a real risk of stagflation.”That is “particularly true” if Fed policymakers respond to inflation as they typically do, and raise interest rates, he said. “And particularly true if Americans see, as they are seeing, chaos. There’s a lack of confidence. And particularly, as the US is facing, this additional problem of mass government layoffs, chaotically done, in critical institutions.”There is a further risk, he added, that Trump – having built an economic strategy around tariffs on goods – overlooks industries at the heart of the US economy built around services,from finance and advertising to technology.“He doesn’t understand that we are a service-sector economy,” said Stiglitz. “We’re not in the 1950s. Service sector exports for the United States are particularly important. And he has just taken actions which are killing two of the important service sectors of the United States.”Tensions with allies, like Canada, and detentions of tourists have “sent a chill” through the international tourism market, while student visacancellationsare “killing our universities”, he said. “He’s hellbent on destroying two of the most important service export sectors.”As the economic impact of his trade war with China becomes clear, Trump now wants to strike agreements with an array of other countries, halting those tariffs until July.Such deadlines only work if people believe they are true. This administration, asCanada and Mexico know well, has a habit of scuffing its lines in the sand.High tariffs would put the US on “a whole new prosperous path”, Trump claimed –despite the doubts of many economists– in his “liberation day” address. He held firm for a week, before announcing a three-month detour.What happens next? Trump, who built and rebuilt his political career on a promise to make America great again, has opted to make America wait, again.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsThe ObserverDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

The poster, which was reviewed by the Guardian as well, alleged that investigators had probable cause to arrest a 51-year-old man identified as Carlos Garcia – whose last known address is in the Bronx – on a count of sexual misconduct of a dead human body.Gothamist, citing police, also reported that the man identified in the wanted poster as Garcia could be seen on surveillance footage taking items from the pockets of the dead person before violating the corpse and fleeing.View image in fullscreenSuspect whom police allege robbed the corpse on the New York subway.Photograph: New York police departmentThat attack marked the second time the dead person – who was described as a man – had been stolen from in less than an hour. At about 10.48pm on Tuesday, police said a woman approached the late man, removed unspecified property from him and then left.Police released surveillance images of a suspect in that initial robbery, which showed a woman wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt, black pants and a black baseball cap.A police spokesperson would not comment on the allegations of the wanted poster first reported on by Gothamist and later seen by the Guardian.Another official on Saturday morning said there had not been any arrests made in the case. Police said anyone with useful information can submit it to New York City’sCrimestopperswebsite.Police said it appeared the victim had died of natural causes before both crimes.Wednesday morning’s case of necrophilia on the subway not only provided a graphically documented instance of a sexual disorder psychiatrists assume to be among the rarest. It also reignited a discussion about the safety of theNew YorkCity subway system that in some quarters is ongoing.Statistics generally show violence on the subway is relatively rare, though high-profile cases have the tendency to unnerve the public.For instance, in December, a 57-year-old woman namedDebrina Kawamdied after being set on fire while sleeping on a train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn. Days later, 45-year-old Joseph Lynskey was pushed in front of an oncoming train at Manhattan’s 18th Street station but survived.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The White House only confirmed that García was under the authority of the El Salvador government.The administration’s confirmation of García’s location was confirmed to the court by Michael G Kozak, who identified himself in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the state department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.The filing comes one day after a US government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide the US district judge Paula Xinis with any information about García’s whereabouts. Xinis issued an order after Friday’s hearing requiring the administration to disclose García’s “current physical location and custodial status” and “what steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.“It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego García is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,” Kozak’s statement said. “He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.”View image in fullscreenKilmar Abrego García in April 2025, in a photo provided by Casa, an immigrant advocacy organization.Photograph: APKozak’s statement did not address the judge’s latter requirements.Xinis was exasperated Friday with the government’s lack of information.“Where is he and under whose authority?” the judge asked in the hearing. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”The US supreme court on Thursdayupheldthe judge’s order to facilitate Abrego García’s return to the US, after Abrego García and his family filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of his summary deportation on 15 March.Abrego García has had a US work permit since 2019 but was stopped and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers on 12 March and questioned about alleged gang affiliation. He was deported on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador made up chiefly of Venezuelans whom the government accuses of being gang members and whom it assumed special powers to expel without a hearing.Abrego García’s wife, US citizen Jennifer Vásquez Sura, has not been able to speak to him since he was flown to his native El Salvador last month and imprisoned. She has beenrallying outside courtand has urged their supporters to keep fighting for him “and all the Kilmars out there whose stories are still waiting to be heard”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

From this Sunday, organisers of the2025 Expositionin Osaka will be hoping that appeal will put the event’s unsettled preparations in the shade for a six-month celebration of our common humanity.The westernJapancity is preparing to host its second World Expo, 55 years after the first was held in a country eager to capitalise on fading memories of the second world war as it embarked on its postwar journey to become an industrial and technological powerhouse.Then, 64 million people descended on Osaka’s northern suburbs to view theTower of the Sun– still a popular site in the commemorative park – and a moon rock retrieved by Apollo 12.The 2025 version opens under a geopolitical cloud dark enough to cast a shadow over the 960-acre grounds on the reclaimed Yumeshima (“Dream Island”), a former dumping ground for industrial waste and, for successive Osaka governments, a plot of land in perennial need of a purpose.The expo is the most convincing attempt yet to make use of the unloved island, until now a blot on the landscape, with Osaka’s industrial skyline on one side and the busy shipping lanes of the Seto inland sea on the other. In its mission to bring people together, 150 countries and regions will showcase the best of their culture and technology, albeit with an acknowledgment that humanity is more divided than at any time most of the millions of expected visitors can recall.They should, though, marvel at a Martian meteorite discovered by Japanese scientists in Antarctica in 2000, interact with androids that could one day live in their homes, view a beating artificial heart made of stem cells and – not for the ­faint-hearted – stare back at an image of what they might look like in 25 years’ time.View image in fullscreenA woman poses for a photo in front of Myaku-Myaku, the mascot of the 2025 Osaka Expo, during a media preview day on Wednesday.Photograph: Richard A Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesViewed from the grand ring – a 2km (1.24 mile) wooden promenade that encircles the waterfront site – there is an incongruity to the 150 pavilions, from the flamboyance of Turkmenistan to the neat wooden contours of Japan. And all separated by lots of Tarmac and concrete. The earthquake-resistant wooden “skywalk”, though, is a feat of craftsmanship, built with a traditional joinery method used in the construction of ancient shrines and temples, its network of cypress, cedar and pine beams destined to become a shady oasis when Japan unleashes its brutal summer heat midway through the  event.The expo theme’s tagline – “towards a brighter future for all” – feels laughably elusive, but credit should go to the organisers for addressing the harsh realities of the world outside.The blue and yellow sign over Ukraine’s booth states that the country is “not for sale”, echoing comments from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia has chosen not to take part.In August visitors will be able to take part in a virtual reality experience corner for conflict zones in Gaza, in a space currently devoted to 80 years of the United Nations and its constituent departments and agencies, including Unrwa.Palestine’s space is to be found in the far corner of a shared pavilion, although its organisers claim the shipment of several planned exhibits has been delayed by Israeli authorities, which is denied by Israel, whose pavilion includes a stone from the Western Wall in Jerusalem.The reported delay is in keeping with Osaka’sbumpy road to Expo 2025. Construction was hit by labour shortages and the soaring cost of building materials – the project’s initial price tag of ¥125bn has soared to ¥235bn (from £666m to £1.25bn) – while interest among the Japanese public has so far been lukewarm.The 1970 Osaka Expo’s 64 million visitors was a record until Shanghai in 2010. So far, only 8.7m advance tickets have been sold for 2025, well below the pre-sales target of 14m.Last week, as TV crews swarmed around the site, workers were still flattening strips of tactile paving for visitors with visual ­impairments, while activity around incomplete pavilions gave them the feel of a supermarket entrance. The 1,500 trees comprising the Forest of Tranquillity will need time to bed in.Organisers have been given last-minute jitters by the discovery of potentially explosive concentrations ofmethane gas, as well as concern about overcrowding at the new subway station serving the site and, on social media, disbelief at the lack of cubicle walls in thechildren’s lavatories.The host nation, though, has deployed its soft power to good effect: the world’s longest conveyor belt sushi, a giantGundamrobot, 32 sculptures ofHello Kittydressed as different types of algae to symbolise the plant’s versatility, and an upgraded version of a “human washing machine” that proved a hit at the 1970 event.In a country addicted toyuru-kyara[mascot characters], the biggest attraction could turn out to be Myaku-Myaku, a red and blue figure with five googly eyes that was ridiculed when it was selected as the expo’sofficial mascot. Since then, the mysterious creature, purportedly “born from the fusion of cells and water”, has won over the Japanese public and is now the centre of a large merchandise empire … and the face ofmanhole coversacross Osaka.Sou Fujimoto, the exposition’s architectural mastermind, conceded the event was opening at a time when minds are focused on wars, real and commercial. “The whole global ­situation is very unstable,” he told CNN. But he added: “I believe this is a really precious opportunity to show so many countries can come together in one place and think about our future together.”That lofty vision will be fleeting, however. The pavilions – and Fujimoto’s “sustainable” edifice – will be dismantled later this year to make way for Japan’sfirst casino. But as gambles go, the longer odds could be on selling the idea that the expo movement’s bricks-and-­mortar appeal for global unity will strike a chord in a hyper-connected, but fractured, world.Explore more on these topicsJapanThe ObserverAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Another, which has notes of grapefruit, rose and Levantine spice, is reminiscent of a £215 bottle of Penhaligon’s Halfeti. But unlike those luxury brands, these “dupe scents” can cost as little as a fiver.As many as half of UK consumers are now thought to have succumbed to the social media craze for cheap perfumes “inspired by” well-known luxury fragrances. And lawyers now say perfume brands and beauty companies need greater legal protection from rivals who imitate their products.Intellectual property lawyers and chartered trademark attorneys told theObserverthat the law must catch up to better protect the original creators of perfumes. Some said they had been contacted by companies seeking advice on how to legally dupe a perfume, while others had received enquiries from luxury brands about how to take legal action against dupe scents.“Everybody wants to smell good and to have an affordable slice of luxury. However, it comes at the expense of proper artists, because perfume creation is an art,” Mireille Dagger, legal director at Broadfield law firm, told theObserver. “These companies are riding on the coattails of artists. It’s very unfair. It’s very hard to create a perfume brand and build it up. It requires expertise, artistic talent, time, energy and investment.”“There have been no known cases in the UK of any perfume brands being able to trademark their scent – because under UK law, it’s a requirement that a trademark be graphically representable,” Dagger said.While perfume manufacturers can trademark their brand names, distinctive labels and unique bottle shapes, none of the lawyers theObserverspoke to believed it would be possible, in practice, to trademark the scent of an original fragrance. A company needs to be able to clearly, precisely and objectively describe what they are protecting with a trademark.“When it comes to scent, you just can’t do that, because scent is subjective. Different people smell different things. It’s very hard to consistently reproduce that scent on paper,” added Dagger. “You’re not able to put it in writing.”Equally, a scent cannot usually be patented, said Eloise Harding, a partner in Mishcon de Reya’s intellectual property department, because this requires a particular perfume formulation to have an “inventive step” during its creation. “I don’t think any kind of fragrance is likely to have a sufficient level of inventive step,” she said.A brand owner might not even want to patent its perfume formulation, said Robert Lye, legal director at Gateley. “The quid pro quo for patent protection is that the patented invention is made public, meaning that anyone would be able to copy the formulation once the patent has expired.” The maximum duration of a patent is 20 years, he added.Some copycat perfume manufacturers are usinggas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GCMS) to break down the complex chemical profiles of expensive perfumes so they can emulate these scents – potentially using cheaper, “substandard” ingredients, Dagger said. The cheaper imitations are particularly popular on TikTok, where there are thousands of posts with the hashtag #perfumedupe.With the once-inaccessible trade secrets about a perfume’s formulation now able to be deduced using GCMS, “there is no way, legally, for perfumers to protect their work,” said Dagger.She would like to see “dupe brands being forced to pay royalties to the original brands”. As for the law, “something creative needs to happen – protection for the fragrance industry is lagging woefully behind beauty and fashion.”The UK fragrance market was estimated to be worth £1.74bn in 2024, and is on track to surpass £2bn by 2029, according to market researchers Mintel.In a recent survey of 1,435 fragrance buyers in the UK, 50% said they had bought a dupe perfume. A third of those surveyed said they would be prepared to buy a dupe fragrance again while 18% of those who had not yet bought one said they would be interested in doing so.“It is almost a lost cause for perfume brands to defend themselves, if all they are saying is ‘we came up with this fragrance first’, because I don’t think consumers really care about that,” said Dionne Officer, a Mintel research analyst.Admirers of designer perfume brands no longer think they should have to pay through the nose to have access to luxury scents: “Seeing dupe scents on social media, and knowing influencers are buying them, has made them more acceptable,” she added.Younger consumers in particular are accustomed to seeing fast-fashion brandsduplicating independent designers, and are unlikely to feel it is a taboo to openly wear a dupe scent or even give one as a gift.“Maybe in older generations, it would have been looked down upon, to copy something,” said Officer. “But younger consumers have grown up in a time of economic instability, where you’re praised if you get a bargain – it’s seen as quite cool, now.”Explore more on these topicsFragranceThe ObserverIntellectual propertyBeautySocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

The object’s value is believed to be about £50,000.The Kallos Gallery, which specialises in ancient art, was founded in 2014 by Baron Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza, son of the lateBaron Hans Heinrich von Thyssen Bornemisza, the Swiss billionaire who built up what was regarded as the greatest art collection in private hands in the world.Measuring 23.6cm in height, the amphora is decorated with sphinxes, a ram and a lion. It is attributed to the artist known only as the Phineus Painter, named after a cup he decorated with the myth of Phineus, the blind king plagued by harpies and saved byJason and the Argonauts.View image in fullscreenThe amphora is attributed to the Phineus Painter, named after a cup he decorated with the myth of Phineus, seen in this engraving by Bernard Picart.Photograph: Chronicle/AlamyThe collecting history given by the gallery online only dated back to 1986. This raised Tsirogiannis’s suspicions that the jar could have been part of an illicit excavation, he said: “These are immediate red flags.”He added that the provenance details included a gallery that had belonged to a dealer who was himself convicted for receiving stolen antiquities from Italy in the 1970s.Tsirogiannis, an affiliated archaeology lecturer at the University of Cambridge, heads illicit antiquities trafficking research for the Unesco chair on threats to cultural heritage at the Ionian University in Corfu. The late Paolo Giorgio Ferri, the Italian public prosecutor who pursued and prosecuted traffickers in looted antiquities, gave Tsirogiannis access to tens of thousands of images and other archival material seized in police raids from traffickers and other individuals involved in the illicit trade.Over 19 years, Tsirogiannis has identified more than 1,700 looted antiquities, alerting police and playing a role in their repatriation to 15 countries. The finds include an ancient Greek bronze horse that Sotheby’s New York intended to auction in 2018 until Tsirogiannis notified the authorities of its links to theBritish antiquities dealer Robin Symes. Greece claimed the horse as its national property, and in 2020 Sotheby’s lost its legal challenge, prompting the Greek culture minister to welcome the court’s ruling as a victory for countries seeking to reclaim their antiquities.Last year,Christie’s withdrew ancient Greek vasesfrom auction after Tsirogiannis discovered their link to another convicted antiquities trafficker. He criticised the auctioneer’s failure to reveal that the objects could be traced to Gianfranco Becchina, who was convicted in 2011 of illegally dealing in antiquities. Christie’s said at the time that it withdrew the works once it was made aware of the connection.Tsirogiannis has identified many other Medici objects, which have been repatriated to Italy over the years. “Medici was receiving objects looted from tombs in Italy,” he said, adding that he believes the amphora came from Etruscan tombs in Italy.He has repeatedly argued that auction houses and dealers do not make adequate checks with Greek and Italian authorities, and has criticised their failure to disclose objects’ full collecting history.Madeleine Perridge, director of the Kallos Gallery, said: “We make every effort to do our due diligence and publish all collection and publication history known to us … The artwork in question has been immediately removed from sale pending advice from the relevant authorities. We have absolutely no interest in handling tainted artworks and welcome an opportunity to find practical and productive solutions to these complex issues.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyThe ObserverArt theftCrimeItalyGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The 28-year-old social media manager used to buy a latte most days, but with prices having gone up by about 15-20 kronor (about £1-£1.50), she has cut down to two or three times a week.But it is not just about coffee. The economy also extends tofika– the historically hardwiredSwedish traditionof meeting for a catch-up over a coffee and a biscuit or cake. “Many I know are abstaining from meeting forfikato save money. So we do something else instead,” Tomth says. Low-cost alternatives include meeting at home or going on walks, but it is not quite the same asfika, which plays a key social role in an otherwise often introverted society.“To take afikawith somebody is such a simple and short meeting, but even so, it’s so big because you go through what has happened since you last saw them, what’s important, or just sit down with someone you like,” says Tomth.Coffee shortages area global issue, caused by a combination of poor harvests as a result of the climate crisis and extreme weather, increased demand and rising transport costs. But the problems – the price of unroasted coffee beans has risen by over 100% in the last six months – are having a very specific impact infika-loving Sweden.View image in fullscreenSitting down forfikawith colleagues is part ofSwedish office culturetoo – and people may be increasing their coffee consumption at work.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianAmid significant price rises – the cost of a packet of coffee has breached the 100 kronor mark in some shops for a 500g packet – and another increase to come, some Swedes are stockpiling coffee before it goes up again, resulting in empty supermarket shelves.Ulf Mazur, the chief executive of Matpriskollen Sverige (Food Price Survey Sweden), says on Monday there will be the “largest price increase ever in coffee prices at once”. Although some stores may wait until after Easter to put prices up, he expects prices to rise by up to 25 kronor a packet – as much as 40%.Already sales of ground coffee or coffee beans for use at home have decreased in recent years amid food inflation and changing habits. With many workplaces offering free coffee to their employees, people may be increasing their coffee intake at work, where sitting down forfikawith colleagues alsoplays a central role.“Coffee is sacred in Sweden, but coffee consumption has declined quite significantly in recent years in volume,” Mazur says. “People now brew less coffee at home, they reduce waste by being more careful with the dosage, and many probably drink more coffee at work, where it is free. This reduces home consumption.”But the ethnologist Richard Tellström, an associate professor in food and meal science at Stockholm University, is not concerned about the survival of Swedishfikaculture.“Both coffee and fika culture are a central part of how Swedes develop both personal and work relationships, so the cost of coffee is a high priority. If you visit somebody you will always be offered coffee and to decline a cup of coffee can be impolite,” he says.While individual coffee consumption at chain coffee shops could go down, he believes people will not cut down on “coffee drinking that creates social relationships”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Doing that would give troops stationed there the legal right to detain immigrants accused of trespassing on what in effect is an elongated base – and unauthorized immigrants would be held in custody until they could be turned over to immigration agents.Military activities that could be carried out on federal land include “border-barrier construction and emplacement of detection and monitoring equipment”, according to the memorandum.After 45 days, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, will assess the “initial phase” of the order. But at any time, Hegseth could extend the amount of federal land included in the memorandum.The ordered military takeover excludes Native American reservations, according to the memorandum.Friday’s order is the latest step from Trump in his administration’s ongoing focus on immigration enforcement, which has involved declaring a national emergency on thesouthern border.On Thursday, a US federal judgeruledthat the Trump administration was allowed to require people who are in the country but not citizens to register with the federal government, a requirement that advocates say hasn’t been universally implemented since it was enacted as a law in the 1940s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her debut novel,The Ministry of Time(Sceptre), was published last year to critical acclaim and a place in the bestseller charts and is out in paperback now. It’s a vivid time travel tale following Lieutenant Graham Gore, a crew member of Franklin’s lost 1845 Arctic expedition, who is brought back to life in the 21st century as part of a government experiment. He develops an unlikely relationship with his “bridge”, a contemporary character helping him assimilate to the modern world. It waslonglistedfor the 2025 women’s prize for fiction and the BBC has commissioned a TV adaptation.The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley review – time-travel romance is a sparkling delightRead moreWhat has thepast year been like for you?Lovely and discombobulating. I veer wildly between immense gratitude and intense impostor syndrome. But I’m still working 4.5 days a week, so I’m grounded by my job.How didThe Ministry of Timecome about?In 2021 I started watching a TV series calledThe Terror. I didn’t know anything about polar exploration but – because this was during lockdown, and I was just roving around the house – I started thinking a lot about the Franklin expedition. I looked up one of the characters, Graham Gore. Then I came across a very sweet community of people online, some of whom were fans of the show and others who were more generally interested in polar exploration. They shared a lot of their research with me. I started writing what would becomeThe Ministry of Timeas a kind of gift for them.What drew you to Graham Gore?I do think the photo of him that’s published in the book is great. He’s dashing, frankly. Many people disagree – I simply cannot say why the Americans took the photo out of the book. But also, when I read about him, it suggested he was a very competent, kind, calm man. And I’m not a calm person at all. That really appealed to me.What modern invention was most fun to describe to someone from a different time?Spotify. It’s mad that for most of human history, music was something you had to make together. And now you can just play music endlessly by yourself. And you don’t even have to treat it as something to respect. You can play some of the greatest symphonies in history while you’re doing the washing up. That’s just stupid.The book’s narrator, “the bridge”, is British-Cambodian, and you use time travel as a metaphor for the immigrant experience. How did that come to you?It wasn’t with me immediately. The story started off very playful: what would happen if we introduced this man to a washing machine? But a satisfying book is one where you take a silly conceit seriously, where you prove the emotional possibilities of it. The more I tried to imagine what it would be like for a person torn from history to experience London in the 21st century, the more it became obvious to me that what I was looking at was the refugee experience. It was probably at the forefront of my mind because the book I was trying to write before this was a “serious” novel about Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge, my family and the diaspora.What is your relationship to your Cambodian ethnicity?It’s a family relationship – a relationship with my mother and my mother’s family. And I feel like there are multiple versions of Cambodia that I have relationships to. One of them is a past Cambodia that no longer exists; that’s the Cambodia of my mother’s stories. But the internalised sense of my ethnicity changes on a daily, hourly basis. Though I feel very strongly that I am a British-Cambodian writer at this time in my life. It’s had a significant impact on the way I write.How?I was brought up Buddhist. There are frameworks that I continually refer to in my writing that come from Buddhism, such as the idea of attachment. We become attached to things that are impermanent. But they have to leave us, so we will always mourn their loss, and the only way to free ourselves from this pain and yearning is to accept the transience of life, even the transience of self. But I worry about how you apply that to human solidarity. That comes up inMinistry: the bridge is someone who continually fails to show solidarity, and moves towards complicity.I veer wildly between immense gratitude and impostor syndromeYou first sent out your novel to agents under a pseudonym. Why?I masochistically wanted to check that the work was good enough that it could pass without me leveraging my contacts. And there was the absolute dread that it would go to people I know and respect and they’d talk to one another and say: “God, did you get that book? It’s shit, isn’t it? What do we tell her? Should she just leave the industry?” The idea of that was mortifying.Which book made you want to work with books?Terry Pratchett’sDiscworldseries. The first one I ever picked up wasInteresting Times, which is actually not one I recommend. But reading Pratchett when I was very young – I mean, I was still losing milk teeth – made me excited about the possibilities of literature, books, series, authors. He has influenced my writing more than anyone else.Is there a book you return to often?I readKing Learevery five years or so. I think it’s the greatest play ever written. And I always come back toLe Grand Meaulnesby Alain-Fournier. I’m drawn to that idea of yearning and loss.Which new book are you most excited about?Moderationby Elaine Castillo, which is coming out in July. It’s about moderating comments on a social media platform. I think it’s going to really startle people.What can you tell us about your second novel?It’s about a lighthouse that occupies a border between the land of the living and the land of the dead. The person who runs the lighthouse takes on an apprentice every winter to look after the crossings, and she starts to experience very weird phenomena. There is something wrong with the border, so she has to investigate.The Ministry of Timeby Kaliane Bradley is published by Sceptre (£9.99).

After decades of high-octane feuding (more of which anon), Madonna recently turned up impromptu backstage when John was appearing on late-night television sketch show,Saturday Night Livein New York to “confront” him. Her ensuingInstagram post, liked 420,605 times and counting, said: “Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist”.Madonna continued: “When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was ‘Forgive me’, and the walls between us fell down.”Thespat between the musicianswas one for the ages: a dense matrix of jibes, counter-jibes, and outright insults (“She looks like a fucking fairground stripper”). Throughout, John seemed the most vocal and volatile. At the 2004Qmagazine awards, receiving the classic songwriter award, he said of Madonna’s nomination: “Madonna, best live act, fuck off! Since when was lip-synching live?” Before her 2012 US Superbowl half-time show, his publicly bequeathed advice was: “Make sure you lip-synch good.” (John later softened, if not entirely retracted, his lip-synch criticisms.)It was such a long-running contretemps, it had its own eco-system and supporting players. At the 2012 Golden Globes, after John was beaten by Madonna for best original song his husband, David Furnish, said: “Her acceptance speech was embarrassing in its narcissism.”When Madonna noted that Lady Gaga’s Born This Way sounded like her own song, Express Yourself, John professed outrage at how “ungracious” she was.Now a Madonna-John collaboration is mooted, and the world can be relieved that the artists have finally buried the hatchet, and for once not in each other’s metaphorical skulls.Alternatively, it could be that deep in our dark, damaged hearts, we enjoy such feuds. That celeb-strata hostilities are considered part of the entertainment: watching the rich and famous, the great and the good debase themselves, splash about in the bin-juice of human discord, revealing themselves to be just as imperfect, short-fused and obstinate as the rest of us. All of which proving that a feud can be many interesting things but it is also a great leveller.Still, what are such feuds really about? Why would any famous people publicly go to war, especially these days, in a social media era when every slight, snub and smear is distributed, amplified and preserved for ever in online amber? In psychological terms – on any measurable level – what do they get out of it, how is it feeding them? And what of those of us who avidly watch these A-list bloodbaths play out? Who reach for the XXL tub of popcorn when celebrities openly diss each other on social media or via carefully cryptic but deadly comments in magazine interviews. What fault-line in the human condition explains that?Dr Audrey Tang is a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, and the author ofThe Leader’s Guide To Wellbeing. She explains to me that generally with human beings, feuds can be a manifestation of something that’s been going on for much longer beneath the surface. “It doesn’t seem right to say that person also plays music, they’re in the same space, therefore they’re going to be competitive,” she says.“It’s not necessarily professional. It may be that something personally triggered something in the other one and they’re reacting to that inner trauma.”View image in fullscreenBette Davis and Joan Crawford.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAccording to Tang, in psychological terms, feuding can be a highly complex matter involving primitive natures, hierarchies, fear-based impulses, familial structures, building personal needs on self-esteem (based on comparison) rather than self-compassion, not possessing strong enough conflict resolution skills, and more.Why are relatively few feuds successfully resolved? “Then the question comes: what part of that feud is performative? What are people gaining? Is a feud performative because it gets ratings, it sells papers? Even if it’s not performative, how are you benefiting from prolonging this action and this experience?”As for the public appetite for relishing the fall-out from high-profile feuds, Tang thinks it’s not onlyschadenfreude: “In a healing sense, it can spark discussion … You can remove yourself directly from the situation but you can discuss the same feelings, behaviours and actions talking about someone else … It allows us to explore these feelings safely.”Certainly, the global stage has never been short of feuds, panning out across popular culture and far too numerous to list in full here. Sometimes the differences are resolved; other times, people double- or triple-down, taking their antipathy all the way to the grave.View image in fullscreenNoel and Liam Gallagher.Photograph: Zak Hussein/PAThe highways of rock’n’roll are littered with the firebombed wrecks of former creative closeness. The familialfroideurof the now re­united Oasis brothers, Noel andLiam Gallagher, resulted in many a snipe (Noel, 2009: “Liam is the angriest man you’ll ever meet … a man with a fork in a world full of soup”).Decades after Johnny Marr prompted the Smiths’ 1987 split, Morrissey still appears intent on feuding with him, in 2022 asking that Marr “please stop mentioning my name in interviews” (cue much hollow laughter from any hacks who, like myself, have ever tried to crowbar a Morrissey-quote out of the famously disinclined Marr).Elsewhere, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry (now reconciled) initially dispatched each other to the wilds of social Siberia over some allegedstolen tour dancers. Kanye West’s beef with Swift is bizarre and ongoing: just a few days ago, he accused her (via her relationship with Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs) of being why hehasn’t been invited to play the Superbowlhalf-time show. Kelce is reported to be “furious”.Nor have feuds been confined to musicians. In football, Brian Clough and Don Reviefought over the soul of circa-1970s Leeds United. In Hollywood, sisters Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havillandfeuded, and there was bloodcurdling enmity betweenBette Davis and Joan Crawford. On Crawford’s death, Davis was quoted as saying: “You should never say bad things about the dead, only good. Joan Crawford is dead. Good.”With royalty: did we ever solve the mystery of who made who cry (Catherine? Meghan?) overPrincess Charlotte’s wedding tights? In politics: the sibling fireworks of the 2010 Labour party leadership contest led to David and Ed Miliband beingrebrandedas the Cain and Abel of New Labour.View image in fullscreenEd and David Miliband.Photograph: Nick Ansell/PAThen there are writers. The 18th-century poets Lord Byron and John Keatsgrated on each other. Novelist Julian Barnesstarted a feudwith Martin Amis (later resolved) when he dropped his wife, Pat Kavanagh, as his literary agent. In US literary circles, Gore Vidalremarked of fellow authorTruman Capote’s death: “A wise career move.” Norman Mailer alsofuriously feudedwith Vidal, at one point punching him to the floor. Getting up, Vidal is supposed to have said: “Once again, words fail Norman Mailer.” Another literaryfeud involved novelist sisters, AS Byatt and Margaret Drabble, the latter observing: ”Discussing my sister just makes trouble.”Some might prefer to think that all these celebrity skirmishes say something: that the famous are the absolute worst for feuding, and it’s all about paper-thin skins and giant egos, with social media pouring on the rocket fuel. For new kids on the block, there may even be cynical advantage to linking your name to a more successful person via a well-timed online fracas. (There is a food chain in feuds, just as there is anything else.) But again, what about our own part?It’s somehow the famous sibling rivalries, the fraternal/sororal scuffles that bring the concept of feuding, the whole messy all-too-human shebang down to earth. Perhaps because sibling rivalry is a reminder that all of us are capable of feuding, even ifEntertainment Weeklywouldn’t be remotely interested in whether we achieve conflict resolution; even if ordinary folk don’t make up in dramatic scenes backstage atSaturday Night Live, with thousands of likes onInstagram.In the comments beneath Madonna’s post, John wrote a message, thanking her for “forgiving me and my big mouth”. John and Madonna’s well-cooked beef is done, but at 78 and 66 years old respectively, you really do have to marvel at the precious battery-life expended on verbally tearing lumps out of each other over the years. To paraphrase John’s own song, sorry wasn’t the hardest word, it was just a bit of a long time coming.Explore more on these topicsMadonnaThe ObserverElton JohnPsychologyCounselling and therapyInstagramRelationshipsNoel GallagherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

TakeDie Die DEI, from the week before last. Queasy and pointed, it tackles the issue of the Trump administration’s “war on woke”. As soon as the orange man-baby got into office, his government started shutting down inclusion programmes, and corporate US followed. Why? It’s not about saving money, or terminology-wrangling. It’s far more deeply prejudiced.View image in fullscreenWritten and presented by Stephen Armstrong, the show focuses on one particular member of the Trump administration: the deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser,Stephen Miller. Described baldly by one contributor as “a violently rightwing racist who is pushing a white nationalist agenda”, he is far from a nice guy. But Armstrong is wise enough to tell Miller’s story gradually. He was brought up in liberal, multiracial Santa Monica, California. Yet as a kid he dumps one of his friends by telling him exactly why he doesn’t like him. “Among that list of things,” recalls the friend, “was my Latino heritage. That was one of the things that disqualified me from being his friend.”We follow Miller through his college years, a controversial rape case (not his: he supported some lacrosse players who werefalsely accused of sexual assault) and into the Senate. There, he uses the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) approach against itself, telling white people that they are, in fact, victims. “Hijacked victimhood” is what it’s called: the idea that your lifestyle – your life – is put in a precarious position because other people are different from you. The way Miller plays it, it’s a zero-sum game. You must triumph and “they” – people not like you – must be vanquished.Armstrong’s script is excellent. I could quote from any part of the show, but he really hits his stride towards the end. “Don’t get distracted by absurdities. This administration is throwing out so many bouncing, multicoloured balls that it’s almost impossible to focus on what’s important. The trick is to watch Stephen Miller. When he says something, it matters… The truth is, his views haven’t changed since he dumped his best friend for being Latino.”There’s something at once modern and classic about Armstrong’s script, and I thought about this while listening toDrama on 4: The Film, a small gem of a radio play about a movie. Its subject is a true story. In 1945, Sidney Bernstein, a film-maker and producer, was given hundreds of hours of footage from the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Shot by British army crews for the Ministry of Information, the footage was basic but devastating, full of appalling, cruel, hellish murder. How to make this into a film that would both engage and expose the public to the horrors of the Holocaust? How to do justice to the suffering? Amazingly, Bernstein asked Alfred Hitchcock to help. And Hitch, initially reluctant, said yes.Written by Martin Jameson,The Filmis aRadio4 drama of ye olde school: rather stagey, with theatrical speeches and performances. But it’s also nicely paced, well acted, clear, moral. I found myself almost relieved that it exists. Not just because it’s about the Holocaust, which should never be forgotten, but because it’s an interesting real-life story that’s a play, as opposed to an episode of a clever news podcast. Old-fashioned audio.View image in fullscreen‘Slapdash and self-congratulatory’: Amy Poehler.Photograph: Corey Nickols/Getty Images for IMDbHere’s an example of new-fashioned audio, and it’s one that promises much. Amy Poehler, delightfully funny comedian and actor, has decided “about four or five years too late” to give us a podcast. The pitch forGood Hang with Amy Poehlermust have had producers drooling: Poehler simply scrolls her contacts list, calls up a famous mate and has a chat, avoiding anything controversial in favour of having a laugh.Her first episode was withTina Fey, who, being Tina Fey, took over and gave us insight (she works 12 hour days, plus “homework” in the evening) and wit (she’s worried about becoming one of those older Hollywood types who just “tells it like it is”). But, God, it only takes a couple of episodes before we find ourselves riding on fumes. All is slapdash and self-congratulatory. An episode with actor Ike Barinholtz gives us almost nothing. There’s a passing reference to him getting in an ecstasy mess in Amsterdam when he was younger, but we breeze past, and by the end of the show we know him no better. In every episode, Poehler enthuses so much about her guest – to their face! – that it feels performative. She laughs too much and for too long. Are these incredibly successful, creative, funny people so insecure that they need bolstering every other sentence? (Yes, clearly.)View image in fullscreenIn a similar vein, please welcome Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s latest podcast venture,Confessions of a Female Founder. Actually, don’t bother, unless OMG-yes-sister-and-you-look-so-good-while-doing-it is your thing. Honestly, I think it’s just how they talk over there. Their idea of a good hang, or a good podcast, is different from ours, and involves a lot less piss-taking.Meghan’s first show is withWhitney Wolfe Herd, founder of dating app Bumble, but, nope, we don’t learn anything much, except about how Megs and Whits met (it was NYE and Wolfe Herd was wearing a rhinestone cowboy costume! The embarrassment!) and how supportive they are of each other.View image in fullscreenIf you want a decent podcast from a 28-year-old entrepreneur who’s already built three companies and is generous with her business tips, then I recommend Grace Beverley’sWorking Hard, Hardly Working, now on episode 133. She also interrupts her guests too much to talk about her own life, but you get far more corporate insight and life practicality. The world, it seems, is full of these frantically perfectionist, success-obsessed, greige-swathed young women trying to get their life to work. I’d say relax, but they can’t.Explore more on these topicsRadioMiranda Sawyer on podcasts and radioPodcastsUS politicsDonald TrumpTortoise MediaBBCMeghan, the Duchess of SussexreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her experiences have influenced her work on the new show, which is due to take place over 9,000 sq metres in an empty building in Deptford.View image in fullscreenActor Meera Syal.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Observer“I still remember those days clearly,” she told theObserver. “Before the 2007 crackdown inGeorgia, independent media faced significant challenges and mounting pressure.”The debut show, calledStorehouse, is due to run from 4 June until 20 September. The story will take place in a fictional storage facility, where humanity’s history has been archived since 1983, the dawn of the internet.In this arena, a “battle between truth and order” will be waged, “as the powerful manipulate the truth to their own ends and critical thinking is the only effective weapon”. Syal, who will voice Dolly K Guha, one of the imagined radical founders of the movement, said: “I’m thrilled to be part ofStorehouse. It is an ambitious immersive production that tackles a critical issue.”The three other founders are played by Jones, whose performances as postmaster Alan Bates in the ITV drama about the Post Office scandal won widespread acclaim, the renowned actor Kathryn Hunter, recently seen in Netflix’sBlack Dovesand in the filmPoor Things, and by rising star Billy Howle from the filmOn Chesil Beach. They will guide visitors through the warehouse and through a cast of live actors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In today’s attention economy, news has been commodified, becoming a product that needs to be ‘sold’. It becomes paramount to be able to discern ‘sellable information’ and false narratives from facts and being properly factually informed.”The show will run in tandem with a series of public debates, or critical conversations, that are being held through the summer on the other side of London atthe Pleasance theatre. The sessions, staged in collaboration withIntelligence Squared, will be compered by the journalist Sophia Smith Galer.The discussions are intended to help inform or “inoculate” the audience against misinformation by showing them how it can work. “We want to empower individuals by better understanding the powers at play. A key point for us is to give people a sense of agency, as this topic can make us feel apathetic and disempowered, which ultimately feeds the problem,” said Patarkatsishvili, whoselate father,known as Badri, founded the Imedi radio station and television station in Georgia.Debate, she argues, might be a more conventional way to develop critical thinking skills, but theatre can be more effective. “In its own way, this is whatStorehouseaims to do; immerse audiences in a world where they decide what’s true,” she said. “The art of storytelling creates empathy and understanding in ways that facts alone cannot. When audiences step inside, they’re not just watching a story – they’re living it. They’re forced to grapple with difficult questions about truth, power, and their own complicity in shaping narratives. Entertainment has always been a powerful tool because it humanises abstract issues and makes them personal.”Patarkatsishvili’s hope is that Storehouse will be “more than a show – it’s a call to action”.“It asks audiences to reflect on their role in today’s information ecosystem, and challenges them to take responsibility for the stories they believe and share.”Explore more on these topicsImmersive theatreThe ObserverToby JonesMeera SyalGeorgiaActingPleasance (Stage)InternetnewsShareReuse this content"

It feels like history is repeating itself, he saysSat 12 Apr 2025 06.55 EDTShareRamy Youssef has this theory: “The more fucked up the climate, the stupider television must be.” Granted, he came up with it barely 10 seconds ago, but the 34-year-old is committing. “You need something dumb,” he’s newly certain, “to cut through the tension for relief.” Now he’s frantically tapping away on his phone, searching for facts to prove it. Bingo. “You see, [MTV celebrity prank show] Punk’d premiered on 17 March 2003. Know what happened three days later? The US invaded Iraq. Maybe my stupid new show is perfect for howfuckedeverything is right now.”In particular, Youssef is pointing to Palestine: his2024 heartfelt SNL monologuecalling for an end to the violence one of a litany of interventions he’s made in recent years. “I’ve sat down with too many people who’ve just lost entire sections of their families.” Does he feel speaking out could come at a cost to his career? “If I was constantly waiting to be cast,” he says, “I might not be so busy. We make TV like immigrants: not waiting around for someone else. We’re trying to speak to something human, even if we do it while people are trying to dehumanise us, our culture, where we come from and who we are.”We’re meeting in a downtown Manhattan hotel, late on an icy, mid-February Friday; Youssef lives with his wife and dog in Brooklyn. He is all smiles as he bops into the lobby sporting a baseball cap embroidered with “Sufi Centre of North Jersey”, a nod to the fictional community centre in Golden Globe-winning Ramy – a three season-deep comedy drama about a directionless, idiosyncratic millennial Muslim American. Youssef is its co-creator and star.View image in fullscreenWeird science … Ramy Youssef and Willem Dafoe in Poor Things.Photograph: Yorgos Lanthimos/Searchlight PicturesHis new, “stupid” show is an animation called #1 Happy Family USA. Its protagonist is 12-year-old Rumi (it’s onlysemi-autobiographical), and it opens at the Hussein family’s suburban east coast home, halal food truck parked out front, on 10 September 2001 – all inside naive to the global upheaval tomorrow brings. “It’s hard to avoid the obviously dramatic things in it,” says Youssef: an act of mass terror, a seismic shift in geopolitics, an explosion of Islamophobic prejudice. “It being a cartoon undercuts all that heaviness, and allows us to laugh at what happened, and reflect. South Park did that for me growing up. Often, it was more nuanced than anything on CNN, then suddenly it went back to crudeness.”As a kid you don’t know what’s happening. I had a recurring dream that Bin Laden was in my kitchenLike South Park, Youssef’s show uses a pre-adolescent outlook to its advantage. “Global things feel personal at that age,” Youssef says, “and personal things feel global. It’s like, ‘Oh my God, this tragedy happened’, alongside, ‘Oh my God, I love this girl’. At that age, it’s all at the same volume.” One minute, Rumi is pained, fantasising unrequitedly about his teacher to the sound of K-Ci & JoJo, the next, his uncle is arrested – soon to be #1 Prisoner in Guantánamo – simply for having “terrorist vibes”.Astute observations and sharp satire sit alongside farcical sequences: at the mosque, Rumi’s mother meets an undercover FBI agent who introduces herself as “Carol, from Mecca”; his father, invited on to Fox News, is billed as “Halal Harry”. Pigeons are eaten at the dining table, there’s a kitchen leaderboard ranking cousins, prepubescent Rumi smokes. “I didn’t smoke then,” Youssef clarifies, “but I had the tension of a smoker as a middle schooler.”View image in fullscreenGetting animated … #1 Happy Family USA.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeFast-paced and funny, yes, but his depiction of that time teems with trauma. In the writers’ room, all sorts of distressing details were shared. “Look,” he’s quick to qualify, “I’m fortunate, I grew up in a town with good people, gracious neighbours and kind classmates. I’m also able to realise we wereveryafraid after 9/11, unsure and uncertain. What I’ve explored in this show, and am not sure I understood until a few years ago, is the amount of not self-hatred, but self-fear or self-paranoia I had.”These memories have been percolating since 2018. “We did a flashback episode to that time in Ramy,” he says, “and I realised I had so many stories from that period that I hadn’t confronted.” Youssef was born in Queens, but his parents – both Egyptian – raised the family in New Jersey. “It was a nice place to grow up,” he says. “That added to the immigrant anxiety. When something is nice, the stakes are higher: I hope we can stay here, that we can afford it, and people will accept us.”Ramy review – Mahershala Ali dials this outstanding comedy up to 11Read moreYoussef was 10 on 9/11. He remembers the day. “My dad was working in hotels, in between Newark and New Jersey,” he says. “I didn’t know where he was. There was a massive panic. My uncles and grandparents were all in New York. And it was super-surreal. Shocking with that proximity, but as a kid you don’t really know what’s happening.” He had a recurring dream “that Bin Laden was in my kitchen. There was this weird rumour at school: a bomb in our town.”There weren’t many brown or Muslim kids locally, and soon his experience diverged from that of his classmates. “Looking back,” he says, “I can see the huge impact on my family as culture and politics shifted.” Youssef felt it profoundly: “scrutiny, being watched. I thought: ‘Oh shit, my name matches one of these guys who did this thing. What if there’s some secret in my family? Is who we are bad?’ That inner dialogue played on me a lot more than I understood as a child. Sitting with that fear is more potent than anything anyone could say to you. It infiltrates your inner workings. That’s what it does to the Hussein family.” For his cartoon characters, an identity crisis follows. Until starting at college, Youssef sees now, that was his experience too.View image in fullscreen‘It feels a betrayal to not speak up’ … Ramy Youssef.Photograph: Erik CarterThere he found space to breathe. “I joined the Muslim students association,” he says, “and for the first time opted into being in a community of my own volition. Hanging out with these other Muslims I realised we all had shared experiences. I’d tried to block it during school. In the two years I went to college before dropping out I found it comforting to connect.” Then that safety was pulled from under him: “We found out the NYPD was monitoring us; surveilling the Muslim organisation, treating us with suspicion.”It’s why he started writing. “I realised it was a way I could explore all of this, and my identity, without repercussion. Writing fucked-up jokes, specifically, helped me work through it.” First, in standup. Then in shows such as Ramy and Mo – the acclaimed Netflix series about a Palestinian refugee in Texas which Youssef co-created – and now his new series. In their own ways, each also delicately depicts Islamic ritual. “It’s almost like we create a playground that has emotional resonance to it, and feels safe, so we can also talk about and share things that are otherwise hard to.”For a while, being theMuslim showrunner of the moment felt like a weighty responsibility. “There’s such little representation of our communities on TV,” he feels, “but now I’ve put that aside. I’m in an abundance mindset: I’ve spent years focusing on my specific corner of understanding, proving programmes from one specific point of view can repeatedly and returnable-y hit the target. That, I hope, creates more space for other really specific things to follow.”View image in fullscreenWingman and a prayer … Youssef with Mahershala Ali in Ramy.Photograph: Craig BlankenhornCertainly, Youssef says, he’ll keep making work that mines his personal experience, but his horizons now feel more expansive. “That’s what was so fun aboutPoor Things,” he says (Youssef starred in Yorgos Lanthimos’s 2023 Hollywood hit), “and [acting in] Seth Rogen’s new show,The Studio, and some of the standup I’m working on. It doesn’t touch on any of those themes that defined my life. Doing projects that are so close to the core of who I am has shown me how I like to craft a story, but now it’s fun to widen the palette of what I’ll do with that.”Mo season two review – one of the most hilarious, heart-rending shows on TVRead moreThe effects of Trump 2.0 are already being firmly felt by those in his crosshairs – the trickle-down effect on culture, though, will take a little longer to calcify. However, it’s easy to imagine a shift in streamers’ slates. Big tech has been cosying up to the new US administration. The future of commissioning is uncertain. #1 Happy Family USA is a Prime Video production: Amazon donated $1m to the Trump inauguration fund. Apple’s Tim Cook did the same. Does Youssef believe shows his latest would be green-lit today?“This feels like a glitch, honestly,” he replies. “If I walked in and pitched this today, they’d say no; what are you talking about?” He laughs, nervously. “They’d literally say what the hell are you thinking? We’d be told it was too polarising for now.”A few days previously, I’d seen Youssef perform a work-in-progress standup show at an intimate Brooklyn venue. His material mixed playful bits about his rescue dog and wedding, with the knotty: asking whether we should even try to laugh as a livestreamed genocide unfolds? The laughs were there, but so too was an edge; mania and tension.“I’m not going to pretend that this stuff isn’t getting to me,” he says. “I don’t think my comedy could be accused of leaving people with a warm, fuzzy feeling.” Deep breath. “I hope people laugh, but also feel gross, sweaty and confused.”‘No one knew what to do with me’: Ramy Youssef on privilege, fear and his friend Taylor SwiftRead moreHe started work on #1 Happy Family USA years ago, and couldn’t have predicted how pertinent its eventual release would feel. “It’s somehow 2001 and 2025 right now,” he says: Guantánamo repopulated; state-sponsored snatch squads on US streets; a relentless news cycle of destruction, hatred and war. “Look at the way you’re seeing mostly Muslims forced to denounce the violence of others, again, because of their faith or identity.” Youssef experienced this post-Hamas’ 7 October attacks in Israel. “People coming up to my face asking: do you like what happened? I’m like, what thefuckare you talking about? I thought you knew me … Everything that’s happening with immigration, with speech, with college students, the forced cosplaying of Americanness. It’s the same as post 9/11.”These days, he is moving in esteemed circles. After our interview, he’s off to a suit fitting to wear at the SNL 50 celebrations, then to Hollywood for pre-ski trip meetings; the likes of Taylor Swift attend his standup shows. When it comes to Gaza, much of America’s A-list has been mostly muted. It must, I suggest, be frustrating, shouting so loudly while plenty of peers hold their tongue.He pauses, then cautiously proceeds. “It’s a very difficult thing to tell anyone how to be in any relationship” he says, “let alone a work one. It’s hard to find that balance of me so clearly seeing what’s happening and meeting other people where they’re at. But yeah, it’s getting to the point …” A sigh. “Dude, I just know I’ve no reason to not speak. It feels a betrayal to not. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t deserve to be anywhere near a microphone.”#1 Happy Family USA premieres globally on Prime Video on17 April.Explore more on these topicsTV comedyRamyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After a career as a magistrate specialising in adoption and foster care, she studied creative writing at Oxford Brookes University. Her debut novel,My Name Is Leon, was published in 2016, winning the Kerry Group Irish novel of the year award. De Waal, who chairs this year’s judging panel for theWomen’s prize for fiction, is a fellow at Birkbeck, University of London, where she set up a scholarship for writers from marginalised backgrounds.

At the moment it’s displaying this unusual 17th-century painting: often you’ve got a white woman next to a black woman, but the black woman is subservient. This is one of the few paintings where both women are the same size and position. They’re wearing these little spots of paper in the shape of a sun, moon and stars. They were a vanity thing: “Oh, look at me. I look fabulous.” They look very strange, in fact – like when a man has shaved and he’s got a bit of toilet paper on his face.3.MusicScott MatthewsView image in fullscreen‘His lyrics are extraordinary’: Scott Matthews.Photograph: Shedio RecordsI recently went to see Scott Matthews, a folk singer I absolutely adore. He has won an Ivor Novello award but he’s very under the radar. I’ve probably seen him five times. He’s a sign writer by trade, so a friend of mine got him to write out the lyrics to my favourite song of his, calligraphy style. It’s calledMona, which was the inspiration for my second novel: it’s about a woman who doesn’t come home, and it’s about yearning. His music’s fantastic, but the lyrics are extraordinary. I think the only person who has lyrics as good is Joni Mitchell.4.ExhibitionParis Noir, Centre PompidouView image in fullscreenParis Noir runs at Centre Pompidou until 30 June.Photograph: Foc Kan/WireImageAt the weekend I’m going to Paris, and I can’t wait. This is an exhibition of 150 black artists in France from 1950 to 2000, tracing their influence on French life, Paris and the international scene. I saw that it was coming and I couldn’t have got tickets any faster. I think it’s great to have something dedicated to black art at such a prestigious venue. I really applaud them for doing that. The work being showcased in the publicity material looked incredible.5.ClassicalRachmaninov 2nd Piano Concerto by Candlelight,St Mary le Strand, LondonView image in fullscreenSt Mary le Strand church, recent host to Rachmaninov’s 2nd Piano Concerto.Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockI go to hear this at least once a year – it’s my favourite piece of music. I call it the theme music toBrief Encounter, which is probably a bit of an insult. It’s a wonderful pairing of music and film: it speaks about sadness and deep love. I first saw the film when I was 18, and since then I can’t bear to just hear one of the three movements. If ever I put it on, I make sure I’ve got 33 minutes to myself, so I can hear the whole thing.6.PlaceWhitby AbbeyView image in fullscreen‘Very beautiful, atmospheric’: Whitby Abbey.Photograph: Paul LindleyLast weekend, I went to Whitby and took the 199 steps up to Whitby Abbey to see where Bram Stoker got the inspiration forDracula. It’s very beautiful, atmospheric. I can absolutely see why he got the idea for a vampire from there. It’s a gothic ruin on the top of a hill, overlooking the sea. It’s black stone. While he was waiting for his wife to join him in Whitby, he found a book that talked about this count in Romania who used to kill his enemies with a stake through the heart, and he just put two and two together.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarTheatreArtClassical musicSteve CooganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To be honest, a lot of them tasted pretty similar and the spicing was almost universally far too subtle for my tastes. The differences mainly came in the quality of the dried fruit, the level of citrus and how dry some of the buns were. Even so, and while nothing beats a hot cross bun bought from a traditional bakery or one made at home, there were a couple of supermarket versions that are worth buying.The best supermarket hot cross bunsBestall-rounderWaitrose richly fruited hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 4 at Waitrose★★★★☆A good amount of fruit, but what really makes these stand apart is the flavour of the fruit, which is plumper and richer than most of the other buns.

They’re very pale and oddly wrinkly, as if something went wrong when they were made, although that might be just the batch I received. But they also have a really high percentage of dried fruit, a wider variety of spices and a pleasant combination of orange oil and zest, although the orange flavour is much more present than the spices. Overall, a nice flavour and texture, but not a looker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I don’t think the flavour is particularly special, but the texture is lighter than many of the others, so I’m sure some people would like these. I would buy again, but not my first choice.Co-op Irresistible richly fruited hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£2 for 4 at Co-op★★☆☆☆A good amount of dried fruit, but a tad dry.

We luxuriated in mutual bliss – the classic fairytale – and I just smugly assumed that I’d figured out this love stuff at last, pleased with my intuitive skill. I was right for a surprisingly long time.There were a couple of bumpy patches along the way as the fireworks of early love gave way to the steadier warmth of affectional bonding, but we navigated them, got married, had children, and embarked on a happy and secure family life. Things only went wrong when – in an embarrassingly clichéd midlife crisis – I accidentally became infatuated with a colleague at work.The delirious highs of adolescent crushes were back, but now laced with guilt about the implicit betrayal of being gaga about someone other than my wife. I had absolute intellectual clarity about the outcome I wanted – to break the infatuation and end the threat to my marriage – but I also, repeatedly, failed to master my feelings. I just couldn’t turn them off.I understood the addict’s dilemma: part of you wants to fail the moral test because it means satisfying your cravingTo manage temptation, I adopted a simple, inviolable boundary: I would never disclose my feelings. I don’t know if my limerent object ever knew. I did my best to hide it, but there may have been some “tells”, and I wouldn’t have trusted my judgment about reading her mind when I was “under the influence”.I did my best to maintain professionalism through my private psychological battle, but I wasn’t confident I would win. For the first time in my life, I understood the addict’s dilemma – a deep part of youwantsto fail the moral test, because failure means you get to satisfy your craving.It felt as if I wasliving in an altered mental state and that turned out to be my first big advantage. As an academic and neuroscientist, altered mental states fell squarely within my expertise.I started to plough through the literature on love, the neurochemical basis of euphoria, the processes that control addiction. The breakthrough came as I was reading a little-known book written in the late 1970s by the psychologistDorothy Tennov:Love and Limerence, the Experience of Being in Love.It captured my experience perfectly.Tennov invented the term “limerence” to describe an intoxicating early phase of love defined by intense euphoria, a profound sense of emotional connection, mood swings, intrusive thoughts, overarousal, obsessive infatuation and involuntary craving for the other person. She saw it as a distinct mental state that people were “in” when they had fixated romantically on another person, and in the half-century since Tennov carried out her social psychology research, we can now make sense of limerence from the perspective of contemporary neuroscience.Under the right conditions, activation of the arousal, reward and bonding systems in the brain can make one person become incredibly romantically potent. They become the primary source of reward in the limerent’s life, because they trigger an extraordinary natural high.If barriers or uncertainty prevent the open expression of those feelings and the limerence persists unresolved, those same neural systems can be driven into a state of supernormal activation that resembles an addiction. Most people are familiar with the idea of sex, love or pornography addictions. In the same sense, limerence can be understood as addiction to another person. Their company really is intoxicating.This insight led to a consequential decision, and a second big advantage – I told my wife what was happening to me and discovered that she had also experienced limerence. She understood what I was going through.That was a turning point. I was no longer fighting a secret personal battle but working in partnership with my wife to solve the problem. I tested methods for overcoming the infatuation, reversing the mental programming and freeing myself from the limerent state. This meant disrupting the habits that were reinforcing the limerence by limiting contact with my co-worker, deliberately spoiling daydreams and reframing happy memories to instead focus on the negatives. Equally important, though, I realised that I couldn’t just use mental punishment, I needed to develop a new, positive, purposeful vision for the future.Progress was slowbut steady. Home life improved, work life improved, and I learned important lessons about not being so smug about the impressiveness of my instincts and intuition. During this period I made another consequential decision that would change my life. I started a blog. I bought the domain namelivingwithlimerence.comand started writing under the pseudonym “Dr L”. It was an exorcism of sorts – pouring out what I’d learned, what I’d gone through, the methods I’d trialled for turning down the volume on limerence. Over time, people started to find the site. Comments began to appear, readers discussed their own limerent experiences, asked questions, shared their painful secrets: lawyers who had become limerent for their clients; patients who became limerent for their therapists; people whose previously loving and supportive spouse had transformed into a cruel adulterer in the mania of an obsessive, addictive love.The site grew into a community of people trying to make sense of their limerence, how it had started, what it meant about them, where the origins of this romantic vulnerability might lie in their personal history. Again and again visitors reported the same epiphany that I had been through when reading Dorothy Tennov’s book: “Yes, that’s exactly what I’m going through! I’m not going mad. And I’m not alone.”At this stage, I realised that I had two very powerful forces available for understanding limerence: the neuroscience literature and a community of thousands of limerents who had committed over six million words of personal testimony to the site. The blog entered a new phase of gathering information, and refining the definition of limerence, trying to understand the difference between the universal elements of the experience and the unique personal details of individual cases. Case studies were analysed and commented on, and I ran a survey through a market research firm to try to get an unbiased estimate of how common limerence is in the general population.I had two powerful forces available for understanding limerence: the neuroscience and thousands of personal testimoniesThat survey suggested that 50-60% of the population have experienced limerence and, of those people, half again have had it so badly that the addiction damaged their lives. There really do seem to be two “love tribes” out there, limerents and non-limerents, who experience the early phase of love in a profoundly different way. Some of us fall into wild, ecstatic infatuations that feel like a different operational mode for the brain, others are able to enjoy the “new relationship energy” of attraction without, well, flipping out. The mismatched expectations of those two tribes about what loveshouldfeel like also explains a lot of the heartache and romantic misadventures that we all suffer through.I also learned other interesting details. Limerence is equally common in men and women, whatever their sexuality, but there is one group that seems to be especially prone to the experience: those with an anxious attachment style. This is a bonding style characterised by uncertainty and insecurity. Anxious attachers seek a lot of intimacy from their romantic partners, are highly sensitive to the fear of abandonment and spend a lot of time worrying about the security of their relationship. Small disagreements with their partner can feel like a big threat. This psychological state is thought to arise from unreliable care during infancy and childhood.In our survey, 79% of people with an anxious attachment style reported having experienceding limerence. People without an anxious attachment style had a lower incidence of limerence at 55%. Clearly, an anxious attachment style is not required to experience limerence, but it certainly seems to correlate with it very strongly.After seven years of researching and blogging about limerence under a pseudonym, I finally decided to “out” myself and wrote my first book,Smitten. It encapsulates everything I’ve learned about limerence so far, how to make sense of the altered state of mind, and how to recover from it.For myself, that destructive infatuation now feels a long way in the past. I’m thankful that the experience ultimately led to a purposeful new direction for my life and the creation of a community to help other people going through the same trials.It was sobering to have to accept my personal shortcomings. Being driven into an altered state of mind, experiencing a new, heightened emotional range and being forced to confront big questions about your life and your choices is hugely disruptive, but it also forces you to re-evaluate yourself. For anyone going through the pain of unwanted limerence themselves, I hope it is an encouraging thought that what seems like a life-shaking obsession can be turned into a force for personal renewal.Smitten: Romantic Obsession, the Neuroscience of Limerence and How to Make Love Last by Dr Tom Bellamy is published by Watkins at £16.99.

A blazer adds instant interest to a jeans and a T-shirt look and keeps a mini skirt look modern when worn with a chunky flat sandal or loafer. It’s perfect for that in-between April weather.There are a multitude of updated colours aside from classic camel and taupe, look for interesting shades from cognac to olive green. Whistles’s western-style overshirt with tassels, crafted in a rich green (£399), works well with summer neutrals and all shades of denim, or go all-in with Zara’s khaki co-ord (4, below). Meanwhile, shades of brown and tan marry perfectly with florals. Consider swapping your denim jacket with a suede overshirt, or Mint Velvet’s tan classic collar patch pocket jacket (£285) that adds utility spin to a summer dress look.Have fun exploring the vintage suede jacket market. Look for retro details featuring western style, particularly fringing and shearling finishes. Beyond Retro has a great selection of motorcycle jackets and aviator bombers to 70s belted coats, all starting from £65. Lastly, a roomy suede bag is the easiest way to wear the trend: we love Massimo’s Dutti’s dark green bucket bag (£169) and Sezane’s camel Gabin maxi bag (£360) that doubles as a weekend or carry-on bag.View image in fullscreen1.

I come from a big Catholic family – six kids, millions of cousins – from a rural part of the country, and I didn’t think there was anyone like me. Although my parents and family have been unwavering in their support from the day I came out in 2001, they also understood my need to leave a country where, back then, a religion that didn’t recognise me was so dominant.Cities like Sydney are queer beacons, and when a career opportunity arose I moved to a job at St Vincent’s hospital. That’s when I met Mitch, at a Mardi Gras party.The moment I knew: as two pythons writhed above us, I realised our lives would always be intertwinedRead moreI’m a cardiologist with a specialist interest in the cardiac effects of HIV/Aids. Mitch is an HIV research scientist. In the 80s, St Vincent’s pioneered HIV/Aids treatment and care in Australia and I’m proud to work in the country’s first HIV cardiac clinic.Mitch and I were friends for years before we started dating. One day, when he picked me up in his old banger of a car to go on our third date, I noticed sheets of music among dumped takeaway cartons in the footwell. I asked: “Do you play an instrument?” He dismissively said he sometimes played piano.View image in fullscreenEoin and Mitch on holiday in Berry, NSW, in 2019I didn’t think anything of it until a year later, when Mitch’s housemates threw a party for his 30th birthday. He had an electric keyboard that he played while wearing headphones, but not even Mitch’s best friends or mother had heard him play. After a lot of drinks and cajoling, Mitch reluctantly sat down at his keyboard. We were expecting something simple like Chopsticks. Mitch casually played the entire opening prologue of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast, The Enchantress version.Everyone was gobsmacked. I remember sitting there overwhelmed, thinking, this is the person I’ve got to marry.Mitch had been quietly training himself since he was six years old. He composes too. Mitch bared his soul in that performance. I completely fell for a sensitive side I’d never seen. Later, when we got engaged, I bought Mitch his first grand piano.I think growing up gay, you become good at hiding things. Although Mitch had grown up in a relatively gay-friendly city,queer rights in Sydney were hard fought, and he had struggles too. We’ve both stood in front of a mirror at some point practising saying, “I’m gay.” We both know how it feels to be ignored by society, government, institutions and even the health industry.View image in fullscreenEoin and Mitch in Sydney with their dog Joleen.Photograph: Mark H Dickson/deepfieldphotography.comSurprisingly, same-sex marriage was legalised in Ireland in 2015 – two years before Australia. When Mitch first came back to my hometown of Cashel in Tipperary with me, he understood how special it is. He loved the sing-songs, the little house parties with all the relatives. He said he’d love to have a big Irish wedding.We chose thegardens of the Cashel Palace hotelfor the ceremony. Ironically, back in the 17th century, it was the archbishop’s residence. Its grandness is dwarfed by one of Ireland’s most famous castles – theRock of Cashel– which sits above on a limestone outcrop and was once the seat of Celtic kings.A couple of days before our wedding, I arranged a traditional music session at my local pub to welcome Mitch’s family and friends from Sydney. All the local farmers lined up to shake our hands. I thought they would tiptoe around us. I was completely wrong.The moment I knew: I was snot-crying through a Disney film when he placed his head on my shoulderRead moreThen, when we arrived at the Palace, a massive rainbow flag was flying at the gates between Irish and Australian flags. A sight I never thought I’d see. While we were getting ready, my mum said loads of people from the town gathered and were taking pictures of the flag. To top it all, as night fell, the Rock of Cashel lit up in bright pink. I still don’t know who made that happen.As a teen, gayness wasn’t visible. Maybe underneath it all, people were always accepting. Now I see pride flags flying in towns everywhere. Mitch composed an original piece about it all for our first anniversary. It’s called Sunrise.We’ve been living together in Sydney for six years now, with our dog Joleen. Mitch no longer wears headphones to play the piano. Our neighbours sometimes sit outside with a glass of wine to listen, until Joleen decides to “sing” along.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

She lives in Tynemouth with her son, Harvey.This was my firstholycommunion. I don’t remember much about the day but I do recall the click-clack of the heels. The rest of the outfit was a bad choice – very old-fashioned and womanly, especially as I was a tomboy who loved trainers and tracksuits. If I’m honest, the main benefit of having holy communion, as a girl who likes to eat and drink, was the fact that during boring old mass I’d now get some bread and wine.My expression here is so awkward, which perfectly represents how I felt at that age. I was always very nervous. I didn’t know what to do with my face; I clearly wasn’t keen on showing my teeth and I’m holding back a bit in general.School made me especially anxious. I was geeky – not one of the cool girls. As soon as I got into the building, I’d think: “Get me out of this place.” There were a lot of big personalities, and it took me a long time to find a space where I belonged. Fortunately, I had dance class to retreat to after school.Dancing became a way of releasing something inside me, something that I didn’t have the vocabulary to express. My dad died of a heart attack when I was four. It was never addressed and as a result I liked to stay busy. I was always filling my time trying not to think, and I hated the idea of going home and realising that I had nothing on. The quietness of Sundays was awful. I thrived on stress and stimulation; I danced as much as I could. Without knowing, I was learning a lesson: ballet is often painful, but if you stay with the pain it gets a lot easier. It took me decades to realise the same method applies to dealing with grief.By the time I was 13 I knew I wanted to be an actor. It wasn’t as if I was going around telling everyone. I kept it quiet. But I have to give huge props to my mum – she always supported me. Normally, parents might suggest you have a backup plan if you’re choosing a risky career path – “Just do a degree and you’ll have something to fall back on” – as if they think you’re probably not going to make it. Mum never did that. Her attitude was always: “If it makes you happy, do it.” Luckily, that worked out.Being in Byker Grove was thrilling. There’s no other word for it. You could not get me out of the door quick enough on the mornings we were filming. The only thing was, it attracted a significant amount of negative attention at school. A car would be waiting outside school to take me to set, and someone would knock on the door and say: “Jill, your car is here!” I was at an urban, working-class school. It wasn’t a place where students thought: “She’s working hard doing something she loves – and earning money. How cool is that?” The culture was to denigrate – to make me feel stupid, as if I was being a show-off. Going through puberty was already awkward and weird, and being on telly definitely made it worse.I left drama school at 21, and for the next five years I was booking episodes on all of the usual jobs: Heartbeat, The Bill, Peak Practice. I was doing a lot of theatre, a lot of touring. I was a bit of a raver at the weekends. My sisters were into pub culture; backcombing their hair and drinking lager. Meanwhile, I wanted to get a ticket for a massive party in a field and slip into a leather waistcoat and miniskirt. A lot of the time I’d think: “Oh God, I don’t know whether I can pull another nine-hour rave.” But I would often find somewhere to sleep on the floor. It would take days to recover, but I loved every second of it.In my 20s, it was as if I’d hit the ground running: I was onCoronation Streetand EastEnders, Strictly, and then Chicago on the West End. Suddenly, people knew my name, but I wasn’t quite ready to absorb all this good stuff that was happening to me. I felt empty inside. My relationships were breaking down, and I started to question if I even wanted to be an actor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I kept waiting for something to fill the hole; for everything to fall into place. When success started happening, and I still wasn’t fixed, I started to unravel. I spent my 30s working on that: I had been leaning on alcohol to stop the thoughts, and eventually I went to AA. I got sober. I thought: “Hey, look at me. I’m ready for my life now!” I met a man named Matt. We fell in love. We were so happy together. Then, in 2017, he died. I was like: “Huh? That doesn’t seem right. That’s not how that was supposed to happen.” I thought I’d done the work, I thought I’d been a good girl, I thought I’d done all the things I should do. Matt dying of a heart attack brought me to another level of surrender entirely. I realised that what you have to do when life implodes is … nothing. You can’t productivity your way out of grief.Some days, I still struggle. I am prone to existential moments where I honestly don’t know what life is about or why I am here. Then other days, I go: “That’s a real crock of shit that, Jill. It’s all overthinking, so get on with it and have a nice time.”My experiences of losing my dad and Matt have taught me such valuable lessons about how to treat others who are grieving, too. When I was in the thick of it, I could never answer the question, “How are you?” It was too big. “How was this morning? How was school drop-off?” were far better. Breaking the grief into specific bits makes it easier to talk about.While I am not as awkward as the little girl in the photo, there is still a bit of shyness about me. I can be open and confident because of the nature of my job, but I’m not like a lot of actors, who are able to walk into a room and hold court. I always think: “Why are you still performing? The camera’s not even on!” It’s just not who I am.I suppose that’s why I am often cast as the “everywoman”. The character, who, when you watch the telly, you can go, “That could be me.” I’m not Nicole Kidman. The dramas I am in are never like Emily in Paris, full of scenic backdrops and beautiful clothes. If I’m on your screen, you’re probably more likely to think: “She’s going to go through a very hard time, but, in the end, we’re going to be fine.” Which pretty much sums up the story of my life.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyEastEndersCoronation StreetSoap operaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were very attractive and we had a good connection, but nothing happened.I told my husband Patrick about it when I returned; about how we were sitting close and how that felt sexually in my body. I was surprised he wasn’t jealous – in fact, he found it really sexy. He approached my story as if he was watching a movie and became aroused.After that, we thought maybe this could bring us something new and interesting in our sex lives. We started to play around with the idea of being sexual with other people.One time he had sex with our old neighbour and I felt like that broke the rulesWe have a traditional relationship in many ways – we’re married, we have kids. But it’s also a relationship that isn’t necessarily open – rather, it’s free.This means if one of us is on a business trip and we feel a really big attraction to someone else, we are free to pursue it. We’re not out looking for anything, but we just allow it to happen and, if it does, we’ll talk about it. It doesn’t happen a lot – in 24 years together it’s happened five or so times for me. I think lots of supposedly monogamous couples probably have sex outside the relationship more than we do – but we just tell each other and are just honest about it.And we use these experiences to enhance our sex life. For example, once Patrick had really nice oral sex with someone and told me what she did, and suggested we try that.It’s about bringing in other elements. We also get a lot of inspiration from porn and stories. Our free relationship can be very sexy for me, but I do have a limit. There is no contract, but we’ve agreed it’s not supposed to be in our community.One time he had sex with our old neighbour and I felt like that broke the rules. Although we don’t live there any more, it was still too close and it hurt. But I have to remember I am always the centre of his fantasy and understand that even if he has good sex with someone else, that’s not a threat to our relationship.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s kind of an add-on, and it doesn’t happen often. Over the relationship I’ve probably had sex with someone else once every six or seven years.This is all driven by a belief that it’s important to stay curious and never think that you know everything already – even after 24 years, I still find new spots on my wife’s body that I can kiss in a new way. I have the attitude that one can always learn new things.Position-wise, I don’t think that we have much variety, but the imagination part is thereLise and I have attended some massage and Tantra workshops, not with the intention of meeting other people but to learn new ways of connecting and touching each other – something that can enrich our lives. Whenever she has had an encounter with someone, I encourage her to tell me everything, as I really want to be inspired. Once she was with a man and there was a lot of oral action, which was not really part of our dynamic before. When she told me that she really liked it, I started to introduce a lot more kissing down there, and that’s still part of our repertoire today.We’ve started doing things we couldn’t really imagine a few years ago – like taking erotic pictures – but I’m not sure how much the sex itself has changed. Position-wise, I don’t think that we have much variety, but the imagination part is there, which is very strong. She’s at the absolute centre of my fantasies. I’ve found that talking about sex to Lise in an abstract fantasy world makes it easier for both of us to discuss our wants and needs with the best of intentions.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itRelationshipsSexMarriageFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What happened next is an unlikely tale of friendship against the oddsWhen it emerged that a fertility clinic had made one woman pregnant with another’s baby, Renée Ballou and Carole LieberWilkins were advised to ‘lawyer up’. Instead they did something extraordinary – even as one raised the other’s biological childJenny KleemanSat 12 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareRenée Ballou thought she was a lucky person. In the 1980s, she was living in a beautiful home an hour’s drive from Los Angeles, with a job she loved, a happy marriage and a young son. Everything had always felt so easy for Renée – until she began trying for a second child. Two years on, she still wasn’t pregnant. “I was pretty much used to getting what I wanted,” Renée, now 67, tells me with a sad smile. “It was very stressful.”Along with her husband, Wesley, Renée went through a battery of tests, followed by years of surgeries, supplements and hormones. Her gynaecologist referred them to Dr Sergio Stone, a fertility specialist at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in Orange County, for more treatment. They tried artificial insemination – first with Wesley’s sperm, then with a donor – without success. Their son, Matthew, was four when they started trying for a sibling for him; by 1987 he was 10. It was lonely and emotionally and physically gruelling. But Renée refused to give up. “I wanted that baby more than anything.”Then, Renée seemed to get lucky again. Stone told her that two high-flying South American fertility doctors – Argentine Ricardo Asch and José Balmaceda, a Chilean – had been recently recruited from Texas to work with him at UCI. “They had this miracle programme. They’d had a huge success rate over in San Antonio,” she remembers being told. Asch had developed a groundbreaking new technique called gamete intrafallopian transfer – snappily abbreviated to Gift – where eggs were fertilised inside the fallopian tubes. It was more invasive than IVF (where sperm and egg are made to meet outside the human body) but it appeared to be up to twice as successful, according to research led by Asch,published in the Lancetin 1984. Renée felt incredibly fortunate to have this pioneer arrive on her doorstep.After thebirth of the first IVF babyin 1978, there was a gold rush in private fertility medicine in the US. In California, doctors who promised new techniques with better success rates were able to earn fortunes. Asch was flashy – he owned five racehorses and several beachside mansions, and drove a red Ferrari with the numberplate DR GIFT – and entrepreneurial. He travelled to the Vatican to secure thepope’s blessing for his programme, successfully making the case that his procedure should be more acceptable for the world’s billion Catholics than IVF, because Gift babies were conceived inside the body.Asch’s waiting room at the Garden Grove Medical Centre was bright, and packed. Renée was impressed. “It wasn’t like you were sitting next to people from Orange County – everybody was flying in from somewhere different,” she remembers. Bills of $10,000 a cycle were not unusual.Many patients paid in cash. (Renée’s costs were covered by the carpet franchise company where she worked.) She was only 30 in 1987; Asch told her she was a great candidate for Gift, that she would easily get pregnant. “I just felt sohonouredthat he was spending this time with me,” she says. She liked him. “He had a fun side. Which was good, because it’s not a fun process.”Gift demanded weeks of blood tests, transvaginal ultrasounds and carefully timed daily injections of drugs to stimulate Renée’s ovulation, followed by surgery under general anaesthetic. While Renée was unconscious, Asch harvested 22 eggs from her ovaries, selected four, and placed them into her fallopian tubes along with donor sperm. When Renée woke up after the procedure, Asch said it had all gone brilliantly. “You’re pregnant,” he told her.View image in fullscreenCarole (left) agreed to test Daniel’s DNA. The results confirmed that he was Renée’s son.Photograph: Matthew Scott/The GuardianBut she didn’t feel it. “From the minute I got home, I had an intuition: I justknewI was not pregnant.” The feeling was confirmed by a negative test a few days later. Back in Asch’s office, he was still so optimistic: Renée was such a good candidate for Gift, he said, they should try again. But a feeling of cold resignation came over her. “I just looked at him and said, ‘No. I’mdone.’” The most cutting-edge treatment available hadn’t made her pregnant. “If the best didn’t work, why continue? My marriage was deteriorating. At some point, you’ve got to stop.”Renée and Wesley resolved to move on with their lives. Renée was offered a high-flying job in Sacramento, so the family moved to northern California. Matthew started at a new school; Renée threw herself into her work. But her marriage never recovered. Renée and Wesley divorced in 1992.Three years later, Renée’s mother died, and Renée decided to move back to southern California to be closer to her friends and family. In October 1995, she was loading the last of her possessions from her Sacramento home into a removals van, when her landline rang. It was a reporter from the Orange County Register.“Are you alone?” the reporter asked.“No,” Renée said. Her brother and new partner were helping with the move.The reporter said Renée should fetch one of them, and find somewhere to sit down. Then she told Renée that the Register was about to publish a story about Asch and Balmaceda, and her name had come up in connection with it.They had got hold of Renée’s medical records and seen that, while she had been unconscious on Asch’s operating table, he had stolen some of her eggs and given them to another patient without Renée’s knowledge or consent. That woman – a stranger – had gone on to become pregnant and give birth to a son. The baby that Renée had spent six years trying to conceive. The baby she so desperately wanted.The UCI fertility scandal, as it came to be known, was relatively old news by the time Renée received that phone call. The Orange County Register had been reporting on it for five months, since whistleblowers from Asch and Balmaceda’s clinic first gave journalists photocopied records in May 1995 that revealed eggs were being harvested without patients’ consent. It took years for the full scale of the scandal to emerge, but subsequent investigations by reporters and the authorities at UCI ultimately indicated that at least137 patientshad their eggs or embryos stolen by Asch and Balmaceda, leading toat least 15 live births.It was an explosive story. Former patients, now victims, gave interviews to Oprah Winfrey, Phil Donahue and Maria Shriver. Somehired private investigatorsto try to track down the children conceived with their stolen eggs. Loretta and Basilio Jorge, who learned that a woman had given birth to twins believed to be conceived with Loretta’s eggs, madeheadlines when they sought custody of the six-year-old boy and girl, who they hadarranged to have secretly filmed and photographed. The scandal was quickly turned into aschlocky Lifetime cable TV drama.Renée had already heard about it. Her mother had spotted a People magazine story about the Jorges’ custody battle and, shortly before she died, pointed it out to Renée. “My mom said, ‘Look at this! That’s your doctor!’ I read it. I said, ‘Ido notbelieve it. My doctors would have never done anything like that tome.’ I thought of them as gods. I had them on a pedestal.” She dismissed it as an absurd tabloid story. “I thought it was ridiculous.”Her eyes are still wide in disbelief, 30 years after taking the phone call in her empty Sacramento home. We are talking in Matthew’s kitchen in Anaheim, Orange County, less than 15 minutes away from where the Garden Grove clinic used to be. Renée speaks slowly and deliberately, as if she is still trying to process it all.I didn’t seek custody rights. I could never do that to him. Or to them. They were victims, tooWhen she hung up the phone to the reporter, she told her brother and her boyfriend what she’d just learned. “They thought that was thebestnews, that I had this child. I said, ‘Are you effing kidding me? This ishorrible.’”Her mind went back to the forms she had signed in 1987 and how she had explicitly stated that she did not want to donate any of her eggs. “It’s your genetic material. It’s being a mother. Absolutely not.” The reporter faxed her the medical form from UCI the next morning. Renée was named as a “donor”; four of her eggs had been given to another woman whose name had been redacted, and the procedure had resulted in a live birth (marked male).“Then I thought, what if there’smorethat I don’t know about? If there were 22 eggs, she got four and I got four – what if I have more children?” (The subsequent investigation by UCI, whichended four years later, in 1999, concluded that the baby boy was likely to be the only live birth from Renée’s eggs – but no one can be sure.)Stealing eggs, or using them without permission, was not illegal when Asch and Balmaceda were doing it. They were ultimately charged with fraud and tax evasion, but theyfledthe US for Mexico and Chile, respectively, in 1995, before they could face justice. The law was changed in the wake of the scandal, and the use of embryos and eggs without consent has been acriminal offence in California since 1996.The news cycle moved on, but Renée could not. The baby conceived with her stolen egg was seven by the time she found out he existed in 1995. Where was he? And what was she going to do about him?Carole LieberWilkins, 71, is a marriage and family therapist who works with people using donor conception or surrogacy to create their families. She is one of the first practitioners in the world to specialise in this area – and she came to it for personal reasons.“I was licensed as a therapist in January of 1984, opened up my office as a general therapist, and seven months later I was diagnosed,” she tells me. Aged only 30, she learned she was going through menopause. “There’s no cure for menopause. If you want to be parents, you’ll have to adopt,” said the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) reproductive endocrinologist who diagnosed her, with a bluntness that still startles Carole as she recalls it 40 years later.“The diagnosis itself was devastating,” she says. Carole had been married to Don, an architect, for five years. “I had really thought about us having a baby together by that time, even though we weren’t trying.” Don had been ambivalent about becoming a father, but the news galvanised Carole. “The quest to become parents started the day I was diagnosed.”At the sun-drenched kitchen table of the airy Malibu home she shares with her second husband, Jay, Carole gives the impression of someone who makes things happen. But when it came to fertility treatment, there were no options for women like her in 1984. Two years later, the tactless endocrinologist referred her and Don to an experimental programme at UCLA called “ovum transfer”. It was an early form of egg donation: a donor would be artificially inseminated, with her egg fertilised inside her uterus, but it would be washed out before it had a chance to implant in the lining of her womb, and transferred to the intended mother.Carole met an adoption lawyer in 1986, in the hope that she and Don might have a child placed with them by early 1987. But being pregnant mattered to her. “I wanted to be a member of a club, and I felt really excluded from that club.” What club? “Women who have given birth. Mommies.” So she signed up for ovum transfer.She got as far as meeting the woman who had agreed to donate her egg to her and Don; she insisted on it, much to the bewilderment of her doctors at a time when anonymous sperm donation was standard practice. But the ovum transfer programme closed down before they got to participate in it, in large part because the procedure left many of the egg donors accidentally pregnant. Instead, Carole and Don were referred to have a different cutting-edge fertility treatment: the Gift programme at UCI.View image in fullscreenCarole with Daniel: ‘I was really scared. I absolutely thought it was possible Renée would try to get him.’Photograph: Damien Maloney/The Guardian“We had an initial consultation with Asch, who said, ‘You’re a perfect candidate, and there’s a six- to 18-month wait.’” The donors, Carole was told, were women undergoingIVFwho agreed to give away eggs they couldn’t use; it wasn’t possible to freeze or preserve them in those days, so it made sense to her that a few women might be willing to donate eggs rather than see them perish. But there were far more people seeking eggs than donating them, she was told. So they continued to pursue adoption, figuring that they would use Gift to try for their second child.Carole’s adopted son, Alex, was born in May 1987. It was an open adoption, which meant that Carole was in close contact with his biological mother, who came to their home and met their extended family. This was pretty radical at the time. “It seemed scary to everybody but us,” Carole smiles.Exactly a month after Alex’s birth, she got a call from Asch’s office: they had a donor, the woman was having her eggs retrieved at that very moment, and Carole needed to get to the clinic in two hours for her Gift procedure. Carole lived a two-hour drive away, and had a newborn baby in her arms. “I called my mother. I left Alex with her, and we got in the car and drove to Garden Grove.”She retrieves a scrap of paper from a box file: it’s the note from June 1987 where she had jotted down, in curly cursive writing, what Asch’s office told her on the phone about the donor. “29 y.o. 5’9”. 135[lbs]. Blonde. Medium [build]. Caucasian. Endometriosis. [Works in] Marketing.” Finding out these details mattered to her, even though she had no time to waste getting to the clinic. She kept asking questions when she arrived. “They said, ‘What do you need to know all that for? This is going to beyourchild. Once they put that baby in your arms, you’ll never think about it again.’”Did she ask whether the donor had consented? “It never occurred to me to ask that question,” she tells me, quietly. “I’d like to tell you that it did, but it didn’t.”Two weeks after Asch inserted four eggs into Carole’s fallopian tubes along with Don’s sperm, Carole had a positive pregnancy test. “It was unreal. I just remember walking around saying, ‘Menopausal women don’t get pregnant.’” When did she start to believe it? “When Daniel came out.”Daniel was born in March 1988. He was an easy baby, Carole says, very sweet, and very blond – in contrast to her own dark features. She has since learned that he is among the first 11 people in the world to have been conceived through egg donation (the first was in Australia, in 1983). But she never felt like a pioneer. She was too busy looking after two sons who were only 10 months apart. “I remember being blissfully happy.”From the outset, Carole was honest with both her sons about how she came to be their mother. At a time when doctors actively discouraged parents from telling their children they were donor conceived, this was groundbreaking. But it came naturally. “I had adoption books at home for very young children. I have a vivid memory of sitting with one on each side of me. I was reading this book and referencing Alex’s story, and I remember spontaneously turning to Daniel and saying, ‘And you were sort of, kind of, adopted.’ It really was like a 50% adoption to me, and so it just didn’t make any sense not to do that when I was doing it with Alex.”As Carole started to specialise in therapy for donor conception and surrogacy, she and Asch became colleagues. They went to the same conferences; they bumped into each other at lectures and meetings. She would update him on how the son he helped her give birth to was doing. She even brought Daniel along to a conference in Palm Springs, and he got to meet Asch in person.Then, at a conference in 1994, Asch took Carole to one side. “He said, ‘The UC Regents are out to get me. You’re going to hear some things about me that are completely untrue. I just want you to know.’ I said, ‘That’sterrible.I’m so sorry.’” She looks me dead in the eye. “The next year was when I got the call from the Orange County Register.”It would be years before Renée learned Carole’s last name, the name Carole shared with the boy conceived from Renée’s stolen egg. But she didn’t think much about Carole, at first. Instead, she was bothered by the idea that Wesley may have made small talk in the Garden Grove waiting room with whoever-she-was’s husband, a man who would soon be celebrating his wife’s pregnancy, while Renée and Wesley’s marriage disintegrated.Wesley was horrified by the news. “He felt like I had been wronged, and he had, too,” she says. It was his idea to contactGloria Allred, one of the most famous and notoriously hard-nosed lawyers in the US, who took them on as clients. As her stolen egg had resulted in a live birth, Renée’s claim against UCI was particularly strong, but the theft was classed as medical malpractice, which limited the amount of compensation she could claim. “Malpractice, to me, is when you cut the wrong kidney out – not when you steal eggs and give them to other people,” she says, bitterly. Renée got $250,000 from UCI – the maximum she could have been entitled to – and an apology.Allred told Renée she could go further: she could seek custody, or at least visitation rights, over her biological son. “She said, ‘You don’t have to enforce it, but have it, in case you ever need it. What if they pack him up and take him out of the country?’ If they were crazy people, I would have no recourse without it.”The Orange County Register reporter offered to connect Renée and Carole. The women spoke on the phone, along with Daniel’s father, Don, a few months after they found out what Asch had done.“They were very cautious, very defensive,” Renée says. “She had some questions. What was I wanting?”“I was really scared,” Carole says. “Being a nongenetic parent, having gone through infertility, there’s this feeling of, am I entitled to this child? I absolutely thought it was possible that she’d try to get him.”Carole had everything to lose. She had established herself as an expert therapist in the field of donor conception: what would happen to her career if it emerged that her own child had been conceived from a stolen egg? She knew other victims had hired private investigators to track down their biological children. “We thought reporters would be standing outside our house trying to take a picture of Daniel. We were worried about his safety and security. I remember Don saying something like, ‘She can’t get Daniel, but she can ruin our lives trying.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But it was never an option for her, Renée tells me. “If he had been younger – one or two or three, maybe, or even four – I probably would have sought some visitation. But he wasseven.” She shakes her head. “I could never do that to him. Or to them. You know, they were victims, too.”Slowly – tentatively – Renée and Carole began to forge a relationship. At first, they exchanged letters, with Carole’s adoption lawyer acting as their intermediary, because Carole was wary of letting Renée know her home address. Carole wanted to know about Renée’s medical history; Renée wanted to know what Daniel was like.“He was playing soccer, he was doing well at school. Normal things,” Renée says. She sent photos of herself and Matthew for Carole to show to Daniel, and Carole sent her photos of Daniel. “I’d be so excited when I saw the mail and got the pictures. But it was heartbreaking to see him. I would cry, because I’d see a lot of Matthew in him.” Renée told Carole about her struggle with alcoholism. She has been sober since 2004, but tells me that, at her worst, she was drinking three bottles of wine a night, alone.Carole agreed to test Daniel’s DNA. “My brother said, ‘She’s going to swab the dog’s mouth,’” Renée says. “And I said, ‘No, she’s not.’ I trusted her, and she trusted me. People don’t send you pictures and answer your letters and then become a liar. Everything she said she was going to do, she did, and everything I said I was going to do, I did.” The DNA results confirmed Daniel was Renée’s son.I call Renée Daniel’s genetic mother. It took me a long time to integrate the word motherWhen Daniel was eight, Renée and Carole were speaking on the phone and, out of the blue, Carole asked Renée if she’d like to talk to him. (Carole tells me she thought nothing of this – she used to pass the phone over to Alex so that he could chat to his biological mother. Why not do the same with Daniel?)“I got on the phone and I said, ‘Hi Daniel. How are you?’” Renée says. They chatted about football, school, friends – the kind of conversation any adult would make with an eight-year-old boy. “I kept him on the phone for a few minutes. When I got off, I justbawled. But I was so happy that she let me have that conversation with him. For all she knew, I could have just gone crazy and said, ‘I’m your mommy.’ She totally trusted me.” Renée shakes her head in disbelief.Against the odds, in a country where contracts and threats of litigation define every complex relationship, Renée and Carole chose to have faith in each other’s goodness. Renée never tried to track Daniel down; Carole never withheld Daniel from Renée.When Carole first learned what had happened at Asch’s clinic, she sought advice from a high-powered attorney. “He said, ‘Lawyer up, baby. Lawyer up,’ she tells me, fixing me with her eyes. “I don’t know why, but I then called a different attorney, a female attorney. And she said, ‘What does Renée want? Talk to her.’ It changed my life.” Renée wanted Daniel to know who she was, and that she would like to meet him once he was ready. Nothing more. “The amount of restraint on Renée’s part is really extraordinary.”They continued to exchange letters and occasional phone calls. Eventually, Carole ditched the intermediary and let Renée know her full name and address. Carole and Don got divorced; both she and Renée remarried, and Renée invited Daniel to her wedding. “He was 13 or 14,” Carole says, “I told him about it – it was a few years after Jay and I got married – and he said, ‘I didn’t want to go toyourwedding. Why would I want to go tohers?’ So he didn’t go.”Several years into their relationship, Carole was due to go to a conference near where Renée was living, and she suggested they meet in person for the first time, in a restaurant. “We chat, we’re both very nervous,” Carole remembers. “And then Renée says, ‘Put out your hand. I have something for you.’ So I put out my hand.” Carole reaches down for her purse and takes something from it, which she drops into my hand, just as Renée once placed it into hers. “Renée says, ‘This is my nine-year AA chip. I never would have made it without you.’” She takes it back from me, quickly. “I carry iteverywherewith me. It’s extremely meaningful to me. That was really the beginning of a different kind of relationship.”But Daniel didn’t want a relationship with Renée. He wasn’t interested, aged 18, when Carole first mentioned that his biological mother really wanted to meet him. Renée put it down to his age. “A lot of 18-year-old boys don’t want to have a relationship withonemother, let alonetwo,” she laughs. She hoped he’d change his mind by the time he was 21. “Then that passed. And I thought, well, maybe when he finds a woman, because you know how women get people together … ”Daniel’s father, Don, died in 2008. Daniel became a video-game software engineer, moved to Germany, moved back to Los Angeles, turned 30 in 2018, and married his German wife in 2019. Carole sent Renée pictures of the wedding, with Daniel’s consent. Every so often, Carole would ask him if he was interested in meeting Renée. He never was.“Honestly, I don’t know why,” Daniel Wilkins, now 36, tells me with a deep sigh. “I think it’s kind of selfishness. I hate to say it. I’m not a parent, so I don’t have that connection to what it would be like.” We’re speaking over Zoom; he’s in Bavaria visiting his in-laws, and as soon as he appears on my screen I am struck by how much he shares Renée’s slim face. But Daniel says he never had any curiosity about his genetic ancestry. “I didn’t think it was such a big deal,” he shrugs.Legal and ethical ‘nightmare’ after woman gives birth to stranger’s child due to Monash IVF mistakeRead moreCarole had always been so upfront about how she came to be his mother, and it left Daniel with no desire to know who his biological mother was. “There’s not a ton of drama around this for me because it was always out in the open.” He can’t even remember being told that he had been conceived from an egg that was stolen rather than donated. He assumes it must have been sometime in his teens. “It’s interesting that I can’t remember when we delineated between those two,” he muses. “But I do know that it was in a way that was just not very shocking.”(Carole remembers, of course. “I was really scared to tell him,” she says, her voice low. “I was afraid that he would feel tainted.” But Daniel was far too pragmatic to take the circumstances of his conception personally. “His response was completely the opposite from what I feared.”)But Daniel’s wife, Laura,wascurious. And, as she began to Google Asch and the scandal, she found an interview where Renée spoke about the pain of never knowing the son created from her stolen egg. With Laura’s encouragement, Daniel sent Renée an email. And then, last year, they had a Zoom call.Before he logged on, Daniel was nervous. “In my life, I can pick and choose – I can hire people that I like to work with, I can be around friends that I like.Family, not so much,” he tells me. “I was afraid that we weren’t going to get along. There’s all that pressure to materialise into someone she’d been thinking about for all these years. There was this connection that she missed, and I didn’t feel like there was a part of me missing.” But he needn’t have worried. “She was lovely,” he grins. They spoke for about an hour, with Laura joining at the end.“It waswonderful,” Renée beams. “He had his notebook, I had my notebook. He asked some really good questions.” Renée told him about her life, her best friends, her hobbies. “Afterwards, I was walking on air.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s not a ton of drama around this for me – it was always out in the open,’ Daniel says of his two mothers.Photograph: Damien Maloney/The Guardian“She seemed a lot more young and hip than I was expecting – jetskiing and stuff like that,” Daniel says, “and I was like, ‘Oh, that’s super badass.’ I was really intrigued, because my birth mom – my mom! – you’d never catch her dead on a jetski. So that was really cool.”Just before Christmas 2024, after waiting nearly three decades, Renée finally got to meet Daniel in person. The moment itself was anticlimactic: they bumped into each other in the parking lot of the Long Beach steak house where they had agreed to have dinner. Daniel arrived with Laura, Renée came with her boyfriend–her second marriage having ended in divorce–and with Matthew and his wife.“I went up to all of them and give them a big hug,” Daniel says.“We hugged, we hugged, we hugged,” Renée tells me, her eyes shut. “It was just wonderful hugging my son.”Daniel was struck by his half-brother’s narrow face and high cheekbones. Then he looked at Renée, and realised that it all came from her.“It was like seeing long-lost friends, or long-lost family,” she continues, her hand on her heart. “No one talked about the past. We just talked about current and future things. We talked and talked and talked.”At one point, the waiter came over to ask if they were celebrating anything. “I kind of just froze – like, are we?” Daniel says. “How does one put a label on what this is?”They never spoke about what had happened at UCI – to the extent that Renée still doesn’t know that Carole has told Daniel that the egg used to create him was stolen. But, from their first conversation on Zoom, Renée wanted him to know how she felt about him. “I said, ‘Your mom doesn’t really think of me as your mother, butI do. She’s your mother, she raised you, that will never be taken away of from her. But Ialsothink of you as my son.’”When I ask Carole how she describes Renée’s relationship to Daniel, her answer is immediate. “Genetic mother,” she replies. “It took me a while to integrate the word ‘mother’.” For a long time, she didn’t know how to frame it: Renée can’t be called an egg donor, because she never donated. “There is no language for this. There really isn’t.”“I consider Carole part of my family. And wearefamily,” Renée says, her fingers drawing branches of a family tree on the table in front of her. “It’s different, but we are a family.”Daniel doesn’t seem to know how to feel about Asch. “I feel sorry that he affected other people’s lives. Personally, I’m happy I’m here, which would not have been the case if he didn’t do what he did. I’m not grateful at all to him, but I wouldn’t say I’m angry … I’m angry on behalf of other people whose lives were uprooted.”Despite repeatedattempts to extradite him to the US to face justice, Asch is still living in Mexico and practising as a fertility specialist, even though, as success rates for IVF have continued to improve, Gift has fallen out of favour. In a2019 Tedx talk, Asch waxes lyrical on his career helping people create their families, omitting to mention all the nonconsensual families like Carole and Renée’s that he also created. Balmaceda–whose son is the Game of Thrones actor Pedro Pascal–returned to the US to receive aplea deal over tax fraud charges in 2022.“Asch had no consequences. And we’re all stuck picking up the pieces,” Renée says.“But, deep down, I really feel like the doctors were doing it to help more people have babies. I don’t think they were doing it maliciously, I really don’t. They had all the money they needed at that point.” She shrugs. “I could be totally wrong.” Perhaps it is easier for her to live with the idea they were motivated by compassion rather than malice or money.Carole has a different take. “It was ego, arrogance, God complex,” she says, simply. “Asch is still doing egg donation. That’s been making me crazy for 30 years.”The UCI fertility scandal may sound like a product of its time. But don’t be fooled, Renée says. “It seems like every week I read about incidents where people went through IVF and gotthe wrong baby, or itwasn’t the spermit was supposed to be. IVF is a good thing, but people need to know that things can go wrong.”Carole is clear about the power of assuming good faith – and the benefits of being honest with donor-conceived children, even in the most fraught circumstances. “I really believe that genetic identity matters. You’re always going to be their mommy. As I tell my clients, children don’t reject their parents because they don’t share DNA – they reject them for other reasons! The truth will set you free.”Daniel says he is looking forward to getting to know Renée better. “When we were leaving the restaurant, he said, ‘Let’s do this again.’ That warmed my heart,” she tells me, with tears in her eyes.After years of restraint and patience, of never trying to find out where Daniel lived, never Googling him, never stalking him on social media, after decades of respecting what Carole and Daniel want, Renée is finally reaping the rewards. “It’s been a very hard journey. But if I had done things differently, I might never have got to this day.”The older he gets, Daniel tells me, the more grateful he is for his two mothers, who both wanted him so much.“I’m thankful for the way things unfolded, and the way theybothhandled it,” he says. “I had some fears about meeting Renée. But how could shenotbe a decent, lovely person, having allowed me a normal childhood – even though it came at the cost of her own happiness.”Explore more on these topicsFertility problemsIVFHealthPregnancyFamilyHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These days, it’s not uncommon to hear Americans describing a single event as a “one-off” or noting that a perfect assessment is “spot on”.People on both sides of the Atlantic have complained about this exchange. Britons have long argued that Americanisms are “poisoning” or even “killing” their language, but it must be alive and well, since some Americans vent about the opposite; they feel that their compatriotsare being a bit tweewhen they “impersonate an Englishman”. Others, however, welcome the cross-pollination – not least, apparently, young Americans.Gen Z is helping to fuel the import of Britishisms into American English, according to researchers at Northern Arizona University, who collaborated with the language-learning platform Babbel to investigate the phenomenon. Using a database called theLancaster-Northern Arizona Corpus of American Spoken English– a joint project with the UK’s Lancaster University – the team analyzed 1,000 hours of spoken American English recorded between January 2023 and October 2024. In the process, they identified the most commonly used Britishisms in American English.The other British invasion: how UK lingo conquered the USRead moreThe most common was bonkers, meaning “absurd”, which was applied to topics from politics to sports to internet trends, according to the language learning platform Babbel. The word is believed to derive from “bonk”, meaning “hit on the head”, and first appeared in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1943; at the time, a soldier wrote that losing contact with his family would cause him to “go bonkers”. By 1965, it had appeared in the US, in a New York Times article describing a film character, and by the 2000s, it was common in the US. Back in the UK, it got renewed life fromDizzee Rascal’s 2009 hitof the same name, which later appeared in the US show Rick and Morty, the researchers note.The rest of the top 10:Amongst(rather than “among”), whose use has nearly quadrupled in the US over the past four decadesQueue, whose frequent use on tech platforms such as Netflix has given its British meaning – what Americans would generally call a “line” – new life in the USWonky, meaning a bit offCheeky, meaning a bit naughty or indulgent, asfrequently used by Mike Myers(a Canadian with English parents) on Saturday Night Live in the 1990sSnarky, often used to describe early internet discourse and sites such as GawkerCheers, which has long been used while clinking glasses in the US but has started to mean “thanks” in some contextsKeen,meaning enthusiasticMaths,rather than just math, which has become more familiar in the US due to international academic work and social mediaNil,meaning zero, which is turning up in online gamingIn addition to the list of words, researchers examined the demographics of the speakers. They found that the use of “bonkers” is most common among gen Z, whose members accounted for 77% of uses in the database. People aged 66 and older didn’t use it at all. Meanwhile, 90% of “bonkers” speakers were women, and 97% lived in urban areas.Esteban Touma, a linguistic expert with Babbel, said gen Z’s use of Britishisms was a result of “cultural globalization”, pointing to the impact of social media as well as streaming services that give Americans greater access to UK television and films. Love Island, for instance, has taught Americans about “getting the ick” and “grafting”; meanwhile, British musicians including Charli xcx and Harry Styles continue to make their mark in the US. British media outlets, including theGuardian and the Mail, have a growing influence on the US political conversation.And for the most part, Americans seem to welcome the linguistic imports. We have occasionally complained about British incursions into American English – a US literary critic named Richard Grant White, who coined the term “Briticism” in 1868, wasenraged by the use of “awfully” to mean “very”, as Ben Yagoda notes on his blog,Not One-Off Britishisms. But generally speaking, the vitriol is reserved for Americanisms infiltrating Britain: Yagoda, perhaps the US’s premier tracker of Britishisms, didn’t hear any complaints from Americans over his book Gobsmacked! The British Invasion of American English (adapted last year for aGuardian story).So why do Americans embrace Britishisms? Sometimes, Yagoda says, it’s just “Darwinian”: “it’s better, it’s more useful, it’s more vivid”. “Gobsmacked” is far more colorful than “surprised”; the phrase “go missing” to describe a missing person is so useful, and thus so embedded in American English, that most Americans saying it (including me) probably didn’t realize it’s borrowed. In other cases, Yagoda says, users of Britishisms – especially writers – are just looking for a new way to say something. In either direction, the exchange of phrases is a healthy thing, Yagoda says: “It aerates the language a little bit.”Think you know the differences between UK and US spelling? Take our quizRead moreBut of course, there is a charm in different dialects – who hasn’t chatted with friends about regional quirks, whether between Dallas and Los Angeles or New York and London? Treasuring the differences between British and American English, and fretting about the increasing UK use of “cookies” for biscuits or TV “seasons” instead of series, is understandable.But Yagoda isn’t worried. The difference between dialects is “still very distinct, and there’s no reason to think it won’t be in the future”. While certain phrases are traded between the countries, countless other subtle differences hold – going “round” someone’s house (UK) rather than “over to” their house (US); saying things are “different to” rather than “different from” each other; having “an ice cream” versus “having ice cream”.There’s no reason for these usages to cross the ocean, Yagoda says: unlike “gobsmacked” and “surprised”, “different to” is no better than “different from”, so why would anyone make the switch? It would be bonkers. In the meantime, new Britishisms and Americanisms are enriching their home countries all the time, Yagoda says: “Some of them will come over one way or the other, if they’re cool and flashy and funny, but the majority, I think, will stay put.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsLinguisticsLanguagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Experts warn fourth amendment rights have been weakened at the borderJohana BhuiyanSat 12 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 08.31 EDTShareAmir Makled thought he was being racially profiled. A Lebanese American who was born and raised inDetroit, the attorney was returning home from a family vacation in the Dominican Republic when he said an immigration official at the Detroit Metro airport asked for a “TTRT” agent after scanning his passport on Sunday. Makled said the expression on the agent’s face changed. He felt something “odd” was happening.“So I Googled what TTRT meant. I didn’t know,” Makled said. “And what I found out was it meant Tactical Terrorism Response Team. So immediately I knew they’re gonna take me in for questioning. And that’s when I felt like I was being racially profiled or targeted because I am Arab.”But it quickly became apparent, Makled said, that the stop was different from the type of so-called randomstop Muslims and Arab-Americans have become accustomed toat US airports. The plainclothes immigration officer said he knew who Makled was and what he did for a living, according to the lawyer; agents wanted to search his phone.“They made it clear right off the top: ‘We know that you’re an attorney and we know that you’re taking on some higher-profile cases.’ I was like, ‘OK, well, what do you want from me?’” Makled recalled.How to protect your phone and data privacy at the US borderRead moreAmong the high-profile cases Makled has taken on recently:a pro-Palestinian student protesterwho was arrested at a demonstration at the University of Michigan.“To me, there’s a clear correlation when you think about what’s been happening with all the student protesters across the country and the very explicit direction from thecurrent administrationabout looking into attorneys who are taking on cases for people seeking asylum or these major law firms in Washington that he issued executive orders on,” he said. In the past few months, theTrump administrationhas set its sights on people protesting againstIsrael’s ongoing attacks on Gaza. The administration has detained and attempted to deport student protesters who are in the US on visas andrevoked the visas of more than 600 students, some in explicit retaliation for activism. Donald Trump has simultaneouslysigned executive ordersthat take aim at major law firms that have previously represented clients who opposed some of the president’s interests by stripping them of their access to federal buildings.On top of that, device searches at US ports of entry are legally permissible under existing case law in most places. Fourth amendment protections provided by the US constitution, which guard against “unreasonable search and seizure”,are weaker at the US border.The officers never explained to him what they were looking for or why he was being stopped, according to Makled. They told the lawyer that he could either unlock his phone voluntarily or that they would confiscate it and look through it themselves, he said.Makled, who has been an attorney since 2012, uses his phone to speak to his clients. He told the officer much of the information on his device was privileged and that he would not hand it over. Agents asked him to write down what was privileged so they could look at other information on his device, he said, and he refused. After consulting with a supervisor, the official returned and said that he planned to take away Makled’s device unless the lawyer gave up the list of contacts on it. Makled felt he had no choice but to acquiesce.“Because they kept telling me they were just going to take the device,” he said. “And I didn’t want that to happen. I needed my device.”After downloading and then browsing his contacts, the immigration official asked Makled about five or six specific names. He refused to divulge any more information. He was eventually allowed to go home.Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told the Guardian that Makled’s account was “blatantly false and sensationalized”. According to the agency, the attorney underwent a routine, 90-minute secondary inspection that any traveler might face. Makled provided written consent for “a limited search” of his phone, which was “conducted in accordance with established protocols”, CBP assistant commissioner Hilton Beckham said.“He was then promptly released. Claims that this was an attack on his profession or were politically motivated are baseless. Our officers are following the law, not agendas,” Beckham said.‘The fourth amendment goes away’Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, called the search of Makled’s phone “outrageous”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But because this guy is at the border, and they want it for potentially just domestic monitoring and enforcement, somehow now the fourth amendment goes away.”Both citizens and non-citizensentering the US are potentially subjectto having their phones searched at the border. Fourth amendment protections, which guard against “unreasonable search and seizure”, have been weakened at US points of entry. CBP’s role is to stop people or goods that could pose a threat to the US from entering the country. In the case of US citizens, CBP may pull a traveler whom agents have security concerns about – anything from drug or sex trafficking to espionage concerns – but must ultimately admit them into the country, Cope said.However, there have been many recent cases of CBP pulling a US citizen about whom they have no border security concerns into a secondary screening at the behest of other federal agencies, Cope said. The FBI, for example, has in the past asked CBP to put flags on people’s travel profiles so that when they cross the border they are pulled into secondary inspection, she said.“That may be because the person is under domestic investigation themselves or because the traveler is associated with somebody who’s under investigation and the government’s just trying to get around the warrant requirement,” Cope said.Cope said that, based on the existing information, it doesn’t appear Makled’s stop was routine. “If they tell him: ‘We know you’re a lawyer,’ and then this terrorism flag popped up, that’s not routine, that’s pre-planned,” Cope said.Here’s what you need to know about your rights when entering the USRead moreCBP has access to a vast array of databases through which agents can gain access to personal information about individuals who are traveling into or out of the US. One of these repositories may have contained a “lookout” designation for Makled, a flag on his file that can lead to a secondary screening. Those “lookouts” can remain on a person’s file as long as CBP deems them “pertinent”, according todocuments revealed in a 2019 case in Massachusetts federal court.When Makled was finally released around two hours after he was first detained, he asked the official if he should expect to be stopped every time he traveled abroad.“He’s like, ‘You might be stopped next time,’” Makled said. “You might not. It depends on the agent that’s working.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationPrivacySurveillanceSmartphonesDetroitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His new book,The Determined Spy, is about Wisner, a man who lived an extraordinary life but came to be buried at Arlington national cemetery, under asimple headstone, identified merely as a commander in the US naval reserve.“I’ve always gravitated toward controversial characters,” Waller said. “People who had loyal followings and charisma, and just as many people who hated them, who even considered them evil.”‘Have you no sense of decency, sir?’ Joe McCarthy and the road to TrumpRead more“The first was ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan, who headed up Franklin Roosevelt’s spy service, the Office of Strategic Services. He was charismatic, his agents revered him, but there were people in the Pentagon and even the state department who thought he was as evil as Hitler. I recall during that time running across Wisner among hundreds of OSS officers and thinking: ‘Gee, this is kind of an interesting guy.’ What little I had on him, I put in my stories file, and thought: ‘Well, I’ll get back to him.’“The next book I wrote was Disciples, an ensemble biography of [CIA leaders] Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, Bill Colby andBill Casey. And again, I ran across Wisner, particularly when he was working for Dulles in Germany after the war, in charge of 200 operatives. And I talked at that point to Wisner’s oldest son, Frank Wisner II.”Wisner II, whodied in February, aged 86, did not just look like his father. He also carved out a high-level government career, as ambassador to Zambia, the Philippines, Egypt and India, and US envoy to Kosovo.“This is the first time the family opened up,” Waller said. “They made all the material available. Wisner’s personal papers are at the University of Virginia. His middle son, Ellis Wisner, provided a lot, particularly medical material, stuff that hadn’t been released.“Frank Wisner II had gotten declassified material from the CIA that he turned over to me, which was a big help. With the three sons –Graham Wisneris unfortunately deceased too – I spent probably 50 hours on interviews about their father. There were some very painful sessions. His death was quite a blow.”Wisner was 56 when, in October 1965, he killed himself. It was the awful culmination of a long struggle that saw Wisner committed to a psychiatric hospital in 1958. He experienced bipolar disorder, little understood in his time.Psychiatrists gave Waller “a whole stack of reading to do, to get a sense of how bipolar disorder can evolve, and a lot of the myths behind it”. Waller “tried to accurately portray the shock Wisner’s suicide was for everybody.“Ellis Wisner told me he thought that maybe his father, at the very end, was debating whether or not to kill himself, by the fact that he went to the family farm [in Maryland], he got his work clothes on.“But when you read the scientific literature, you find that this is a normal way that suicide can play out, that the disease can be so unrelenting, so oppressive, that suicide seems the only option, and the person about to commit it becomes almost at peace with himself, with how his life is going to end. That’s what you saw with Wisner … the symptoms for this disease, if untreated, can be so relentless.”So could Wisner, in work, family life and intense socializing with the Georgetown set, a hard-drinking group of government officials and journalists, among them Phil Graham, a publisher of the Washington Post“People confused that side of Wisner with the manic depression,” Waller said. “A world war two buddy wondered whether Wisner’s deep hatred of the Russians was part of his disease. But the Russians gave him a lot to hate in their takeover of eastern Europe. He was ahead of the US government when he was posted in Romania [during the second world war], in terms of warning that the next enemy was going to be the Soviet Union, which at that time was an ally.“There’s parts in the book where you see even Donovan worried about Wisner having to dial it back. He wasn’t a religious man but he took his own role in history very, very seriously. And eventually, I think you see the country coming up to where his view is, and viewing the Russians as an existential threat. You have to see yourself in that period, in 1950 or so, when Americans firmly believe the Russians are bent on world domination. The Pentagon even picked out a day they thought the Soviets might invade western Europe: 1 July 1952. Nothing happened, but the paranoia which Wisner felt, at the tip of the spear? It existed.”View image in fullscreenFrank Wisner, second from right, with other US officials and officers at the time of the Berlin airlift, circa 1948. Photograph: Wisner family collectionPhotograph: Wisner Family CollectionTurned inward, that paranoia fueled the red scare, anti-communist witch-huntsled by Joe McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican senator now on many minds as Donald Trump purges the federal government.“Wisner had a view on the red scare,” Waller said. “He saw a huge threat of communism, but it was outside communism, Russian communism, not the Communist party in the US. He didn’t think much of that. He thought guys like McCarthy were really barking up the wrong tree.”Wisner was surveilled himself, by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI. Suspicions largely arose from a wartime affair with a Romanian princess, one of many parts of Wisner’s story that seem stranger than fiction, or at least evoke novels by Graham Greene or Ian Fleming, who was Wisner’s friend in London.Waller notes the immense human cost of Wisner’s efforts to topple elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala, in 1953 and 1954. He also describes CIA failures, many in eastern Europe and notably in Hungary in 1956, when Russia crushed an uprising.Few think Wisner broke down due to guilt over Iran and Guatemala. Some think Hungary broke him. Waller does not. Wisner’s illness was powerful enough on its own.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Waller said Wisner’s work before his breakdown should all be seen in context:“The popular view is that the CIA are rogue actors, hatching these coups in the dark without anybody in the US government really knowing about it – which is a bunch of baloney. [Harry] Truman knew full well about what [under Wisner] was blandly called the office of policy coordination, which eventually became 6,000 men and women involved in clandestine operations worldwide. [Dwight] Eisenhower … was more than eager to point the CIA and Wisner’s forces toward third-world targets. The Eisenhower view was you’re either for the US or against it. What was happening was exactly what the White House wanted.”Sometimes, the White House wanted even shadier work. Nazis and Nazi sympathizers wererecruitedto the anti-communist cause.Waller said: “The whole issue of working with Nazis wasn’t as bad as has been portrayed, and it wasn’t as good as has been portrayed. There were a handful of Nazis they brought in to the US. They worked with a lot more overseas. But Wisner was always a diehard anti-Nazi.”Waller keeps an eye on current events. As the war in Ukraine drags on, Trump not having delivered peace as promised, the US president’s attitudes toward Russia and Vladimir Putin are in perpetual question.“We are now in the middle of the second cold war against the Russians,” Waller said. “Wisner was there at the beginning of the first, 70 years ago. And I think there’s lessons to be learned from that. You’re seeing history repeat itself, in some respects. Not sure we’re winning at this point, but we’re in, definitely in a second cold war.“Another question I get asked is: ‘How do you compare the quality of Wisner’s CIA with the CIA now? And the answer is, it’s vastly superior today.”In 2022, US intelligencepredictedRussia’s invasion of Ukraine with striking accuracy. Failures, particularly overwhetherIraq had weapons of mass destruction, also dot the record.The Determined Spy is a serious book, a study of American covert power and its lasting effects on those who attempted to wield it, as well as on the world at large. But though Frank Wisner was a powerful man, Waller focuses on his human side, his weaknesses as well as his strengths. Some episodes from Wisner’s career, particularly from the early stages, as the CIA was born, produce a kind of comedy of trial and error.View image in fullscreenThe Determined Spy.Photograph: DuttonIn Turkey during the second world war, Waller said, a “former savings and loan business executive from Illinois, Lanning ‘Packy’ MacFarland, just made a complete mess of the Istanbul station.“Frank Wisner II said his dad told him about his first meeting with MacFarland in Istanbul. Wisner went to a nightclub, hoping to see him there, kind of incognito. And the lights to the stage turn on, and there’s Packy MacFarland with a line of chorus girls, dressed in drag, singing, ‘Boo Boo, baby, I’m a spy.’ That was a favorite song among a lot of other spies there. Packy wasn’t the only one with poor operational security.”The Determined Spy ispublished in the USby DuttonIn the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Now, only five trading days later, the autopsy is still under way but the victim may instead be economic populism, strangled by Wall Street, the citadel of globalisation. Donald Trump’s so-called liberation day may in fact have been theanti-globalist’s entombment day.In an effort to deny even a tactical retreat, Trump’s aides insist the White House goal all along was not to weaken globalism, or even to protect theUS economywith tariffs, but instead to get into a negotiation to lower tariffs around the world and to punish China. As cover stories go, it is hardly credible, partly because the tariffs were repeatedly lauded by Trump as a macroeconomic revenue-raising measure, or a means to bolster US manufacturing.The reality is that when faced by an attempt to remake the world trading system overnight, or what the former UK Treasury minister Jim O’Neill describes as “a full-on Kamikaze mission”, the markets revolted. But the retreat caused by the sell-off of US Treasury bonds has been only partial, with tariffs set at 10% universally, except for parts of trade with Mexico and Canada.0:52Donald Trump explains decision to pause US tariffs for 90 days - videoWashington’s all-out trade spat with China, meanwhile, still leaves the average effective tariff rate at 27%, the highest since 1903, according to theYale Budget Lab.Amid the chaos, significant long-term damage has been done not only to Trump’s political credibility but also to the resilience of globalisation as a system.Trust, agreed rules and a degree of political stability are the underpinnings of globalisation. They are the prerequisite for specialised and highly extended trade supply lines across political borders to function.Globalisation, after all, is not just about the trade in goods or free markets, it is a set of interconnected ideas and institutions underpinning wealth creation that has dominated political thinking since the end of the second world war.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was not alone in arguing that Trump’s liberation day and its aftermath marked the end of an era. In a warning that holds true even after Trump’s retreat, Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and a former governor of the Bank of England, said: “The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of second world war, a system that while not perfect helped deliver prosperity for Canada for decades, is over.“The 80-year period when the US embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect and championed the free exchange of goods and services, is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality.”In short, this is not a phase, however the trade war withChinais resolved. The legacy of liberation day will linger for generations.Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, largely agreed that the US was committing an act of abdication. “The rules governing tariffs and the negotiating process that brought those tariffs down over time grew out of theReciprocal Trade Agreements Act, devised by Roosevelt in 1934 … It was, in fact, one of America’s greatest policy achievements. Donald Trump burned it all down,” hewrote.When the man elected to lead the country that invented globalisation places the rejection of globalism at his ideological core, even if it means alienating the US’s closest allies, a fundamental reordering is under way.A key difficulty is that Trump, 78, has shown no sign of wanting to learn from this debacle. As far back as September 1987 he spent $95,000 to publish an “open letter to the American people” in three newspapers. “For years, Japan and other wealthy nations have been taking advantage of the US,” he wrote. “It is time to end our vast deficits by making Japan, and others who can afford it, pay.”While his target may have shifted from Japan to China, Trump’s sense of resentment and betrayal, coupled with an aversion to trade deficits, has never left him. His election in 2016, alongside Brexit, merely confirmed to him how his message resonated.In fairness to Trump, analysis showed that US voting districts with industries vulnerable to Chinese imports tended to elect representatives with more polarised stances.The vote gave him a mandate to end what he described as the US carnage of “rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation”. Many in theDavos establishmentacknowledged that he had seen something they had not – globalism had left too many behind, not just in poor countries but among a previously middle-class group in western economies.Trump’s first term would probably have seen a version of this week’s debacle if he had chosen different advisers, and if he had not later been knocked off course by Covid.View image in fullscreenTrump and Gary Cohn in 2018. The White House senior economic adviser was among a series of high-profile departures during the president’s first term in office.Photograph: Getty ImagesFor the first two years of his first term, in 2017-18, his instincts were largely kept in check by his economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, who dampened Trump’s determination to use tariffs to end trade deficits.Cohn engaged in a two-year running argument, compiling a mass of statistics designed to convince a sceptical Trump that the decline of US manufacturing and its replacement by a service economy was largely benign.He set out how blanket tariffs rebound on American consumers. He explained the link between consumer uncertainty and the stock market. He challenged Trump to explain why he thought tariffs would not be counterproductive. Trump replied that he did not know, but he just did and it was what he had thought for 30 years. At one point, exasperated, Cohn accused Trump of a dangerous nostalgia, saying: “You have a Norman Rockwell view of America” – the artist remembered for hisidealised portrait of American workers.In the end, Cohn found Trump – who once scrawled “trade is bad” as the summation of his thinking for a keynote speech – so immune to evidence, and so determined to impose steel and aluminium tariffs,that he quit, leaving Peter Navarro, a man Cohn regarded as a tariffflat earther, to take the reins.Vestiges of opposition to Trump’s tactics remained inside the Republican party. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska senator, tweeted a now familiar criticism in 2018: “About those new tariffs: Europe, Canada & Mexico aren’t China. You don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. Blanket protectionism is a big part of why we had a Great Depression. ‘Make America Great Again’ shouldn’t mean ‘Make America 1929 Again’.”But Trump largely ignored the critics inside his own party. Re-elected in 2024, with Navarro and other tariff supporters reappointed to lead his trade team, Trump was convinced that his key mistake in the first term had been taking any notice of those advising him that globalisation had brought the US unparalleled wealth.The path was clear for Trump’s headlong assault on tariffs, in part because in the four years out of office the anti-globalist tide had appeared to be heading in his direction. Many on the centre left bought the argument that hyperglobalisation did not suit an era of geopolitical conflict.View image in fullscreenJoe Biden with Xi Jinping last year. The Biden administration retained many of Trump’s tariffs.Photograph: Leah Millis/ReutersThe Biden administration, for instance, in the name of reindustrialisation and national security, retained many Trump-era tariffs, especially on China, a decision seen as a mistake by a study published this week by Harvard Kennedy School. In the study, Joe Biden’s economic advisers Adam Posen and Jonas Nahm argued that the protectionism was excessive.Since the 2007-08 financial crisis, there has been a steady increase in trade-restricting measures – such as tariffs, non-tariff measures, export controls and investment restrictions – contributing to growing trade fragmentation. In 2024 alone, more than 3,000 trade restrictions were implemented globally.Some arose from legitimate concern about unfair competition, but much was being driven by deepening geopolitical competition. Countries of all politics have resorted to ever-expanding definitions of national security to screen foreign investment and trade. New language has entered the vocabulary such as “friend or near-shoring”, a term to encourage companies to align their supply chains with the geopolitical interests of their countries.The call for resilient supply chains was given a spur by the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid, including the west’s dependence on asmall number of vaccine suppliers.After the invasion of Ukraine, Russia further exposed the west’s supply chain vulnerability byexploiting Europe’s dependence on its gas pipelines. Interconnectors designed to bring countries closer, such as undersea data cables,have become targets– from the Baltic Sea to the Taiwan Strait. The war also blew apart the myth that trade brought peace.As a result, investment screening measures were introduced by governments all over the west empowering them to block takeovers and investments by foreign firms, mainly Chinese in strategic industries.Rachel Reeves endorsed the trend in a speech in Washington as the UK’s shadow chancellor in May 2023. “Globalisation as we know it is dead. Supply chains that prioritise only what is cheapest and fastest struggle when a crisis strikes, be that PPE during Covid or energy following the war in Ukraine.”In a diagnosis similar to Trump’s, Reeves claimed that a globalised system “can be gamed by countries like China who have undercut and ignored the international trading rules and made it impossible for our own to compete”.Rajan Raghuram, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and ex-governor of India’s central bank, has argued that friend-shoring is “resurgent protectionism, cloaked and augmented by new geopolitical rivalries”. He also criticised the initiative as “concentrating production within the gated community of advanced communities”.Even so, trade as a proportion of GDP – the best measure of economic openness – has not as yet collapsed. In its 2023 report titled Re-globalisation, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said there had been a slowdown in world trade after the financial crash and Covid, but the change may as much be to do with the growth of services, as opposed to goods, in the world economy. Countervailing trends such as digital trade have kept globalisation alive.The issue now is what can be preserved from the wreckage of the past week, and whether a new coalition of the willing – this time of free traders – can be assembled, if necessary. There is talk of a G6 – the G7 minus the US – going to China to see if an agreement can be found to reduce its trade imbalances, and distorting subsidies, a subject of complaint to the WTO not just by the west but by emerging markets.But this will require the UK’s Labour party to stop briefing that globalisation has failed. In the current context there is no room for nuance, and it risks sounding as if Labour shares Trump’s utterly chaotic prescription. This is the time to declare economic populism, and not free trade, dead.Explore more on these topicsGlobalisationGlobal economyTrump tariffsTariffsUS economyEconomicsChinese economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Despite being banned by the BBC, the song became a UK Top 10 single and spent 25 weeks in the charts, cementing his legacy as one of the world’s most recognisable reggae voices.View image in fullscreenMax Romeo performing at Park West in Chicago in 1981.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images“To hear of his passing is quite shocking,” said Max Romeo’s lawyer, Errol Michael Henry. “He was a perfect gentleman, and a gentle soul. He had great love for his family, and he was a legend in his own right. You couldn’t meet a nicer person – which makes the loss more difficult.”Romeo began his career in 1965 as the lead vocalist for the Emotions, before his music became synonymous with the Jamaican social democracy movement of the 1970s. His song Let the Power Fall on I became a ballad for Jamaica’s People’s National party during its successful 1972 election campaign.His 1976 album War Ina Babylon, released on Island Records and backed by Jamaican band the Upsetters, is widely regarded as a classic of the roots reggae era. It featured Chase the Devil, a song that has since been sampled by artists across genres, including the Prodigy and Kanye West.Romeo later moved to New York in 1978, where he co-wrote and starred in the musicalReggae, while he went on to perform backing vocals on the Rolling Stones’ track Dance on their Emotional Rescue album.Explore more on these topicsReggaeJamaicaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

His daughter Kate Kotchefftold the Canadian Pressthat he had died of heart failure on Thursday in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, where he lived.His son Thomas said: “He died of old age, peacefully, and surrounded by loved ones.”In an amazingly varied career, Kotcheff’s work ranged from hardhitting TV plays and low-budget features in the UK, to hit Hollywood comedies and prestige-laden award-winners and cult films. Kate Kotcheff said: “He was an amazing storyteller. He was an incredible, larger than life character [and] he was a director who could turn his hand to anything.”View image in fullscreenRichard Dreyfuss in The Apprenticeship of Duddy KravitzPhotograph: SNAP/Rex FeaturesThe son of Bulgarian/Macedonian immigrants to Canada, Kotcheff was born in 1931 in Toronto, and raised in the city’sCabbagetowndistrict. After earning a degree in English literature from Toronto University, Kotcheff joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in the early 1950s, part of a remarkable generation that includedNorman Jewison,Arthur Hiller, Sidney J Furie andAlvin Rakoff. Like them, he felt he had to move away to further his career, and Kotcheff came to London in 1957 and began making TV plays for strands including Hour of Mystery, Armchair Theatre and ITV Playhouse. These included an adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s Emperor Jones in 1958, written by Terry Southern and starring Kenneth Spencer and Harry H Corbett, No Trams to Lime Street in 1959, written by Alun Owen, and – infamously – Underground in 1958, in which actor Gareth Jones collapsed and died during a live transmission.Kotcheff moved into features in the early 60s, making his debut with the 1962 comedy TiaraTahiti, starring James Mason and John Mills, following it up with Life at the Top, the sequel to hit kitchen sink drama Room at the Top, in 1965, and the race-issue drama Two Gentlemen Sharing in 1969. In the same period Kotcheff also directed the original production of Lionel Bart’s celebrated musical Maggie May,which premiered in 1964. Kotcheff continued to work in TV, directing Ingrid Bergman in an adaptation ofJean Cocteau’s La Voix Humainein 1967, and achieving perhaps his high point with a contribution to Play for Today in 1971: Edna the Inebriate Woman, starring Patricia Hayes as a homeless alcoholic.View image in fullscreenSylvester Stallone in First Blood.Photograph: ScreenProd/Photononstop/AlamyHowever his career had taken an unexpected detour in the same year with the cult Australian film Wake in Fright, for whichhe was offered the job to directdespite never having visited the country. Despite being poorly received in its home country due to its uncompromising depiction of a brutally cruel Australian outback, including notorious scenes of a kangaroo hunt, Wake in Fright was selected for the Cannes film festival and went on to becomecelebrated as a landmark film, both as part of theAustralian new wave of the 1970sand as a pioneering entry inthe “Ozploitation” subgenre.In 1974 Kotcheff finally realised his ambition of makinga successful Canadian feature film with The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz; starring Richard Dreyfuss, it was adapted from a novel by his friend (and former housemate in London) Mordecai Richler, with whom he had worked on a string of British productions – including an Armchair Theatre adaptation of Duddy Kravitz in 1961. The film won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival and was a major commercial success in Canada.View image in fullscreenDonald Pleasence and Gary Bond in Wake in Fright.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyAs a result, Hollywood took notice and Kotcheff was hired to make satirical comedy Fun with Dick and Jane, starring George Segal and Jane Fonda as a successful married couple who turn to crime after Segal is fired. It was a hit on its release in 1977, and Kotcheff followed it up with another Segal comedy Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? and Nick Nolte American football film North Dallas Forty.Kotcheff then released arguably his most influential film: theSylvester Stalloneaction film First Blood, which had numerous directors and lead actors attached to it before Kotcheff offered the role to Stallone and production got underway in 1981. A depiction of an emotionally embattled Vietnam veteran, First Blood was a sizeable hit and spawned two sequels, including Rambo: First Blood Part II which became a career-defining success for Stallone in 1985. Kotcheff had another big success at the end of the decade: the dead-body comedy Weekend at Bernie’s, starring Andrew McCarthy.View image in fullscreenJane Fonda in Fun with Dick and Jane.Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/AllstarAfter the failure of the Tom Selleck comedy Folks! in 1992, Kotcheff returned to TV, and in 2000 joined the long running crime show Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as executive producer and occasional director, where he remained for 12 seasons.Kotcheff was married twice, to Sylvia Kay between 1962 and 1972, and to Laifun Chung, who survives him.Explore more on these topicsFilmWake In FrightComedy filmsThrillersCanadaFilm adaptationsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the canal’sneutrality treaty, no foreign power can “maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations within its national territory”, and the US comments have prompted outrage in Panama.Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesRead more“This is a camouflaged invasion,” said Ricardo Lombana, the leader of the opposition Other Way Movement.“An invasion without firing a shot, but with a cudgel and threats.”At a Wednesday press conference to announce the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the US, Panama’s minister of public security, Frank Abrego, said the agreement would not impinge on his nation’s sovereignty and that the country would not accept military bases.However, a full text of the MOUincluded aerial photosof Fort Sherman, Rodman naval base and Howard air force base, with areas outlined for “training”, “humanitarian activities” and the “installation of US property”.The Panamanian government says they are not “military bases” and that the deal is temporary, but opposition parties have rejected such claims.“If you have an installation which is for use of foreign soldiers and they have control over what happens inside – and Panama has to ask in advance to enter – that’s a military base,” said Lombana.For many Panamanians, the return of US armed forces – even for supposed “joint operations” – will bring back uncomfortable memories of 1989’s Operation Just Cause, whenAmerican troops killed thousands of civilians.A second agreement allows US navy ships to be reimbursed for the fees they pay to the canal. That preferential treatment would appear to violate the neutrality treatment and could open the door to further attempts to negotiate down the fees charged by the canal.On Thursday a local lawyer filed a legal case against the Panamanian president, José Raúl Mulino, accusing him of “crimes against the international personality of the state”.Frustration is growing over the government’s handling of the diplomatic crisis. Since Trump declared his plan to “take back” the Panama canal on his 20 January inauguration speech, all communication on the topic has been through Mulino and the details of negotiations kept largely secret.This has led to serious differences in the US and Panamanian accounts of those negotiations. When the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, visited in early February, Mulino told press that the meeting had been “very cordial” and that the canal was not under threat. Later, however, Rubio said the situation around the canal was “unacceptable” and Trump continued to call for the return of the canal.The latest example came on Tuesday when two different statements concerning Hegseth’s meeting with Mulino were published. In the Panamanian version, Hegseth was said to have recognized Panama’s “inalienable sovereignty” over the canal, but those words were absent from the secretary of defense’s statement and Hegseth refused to acknowledge Panamanian ownership of the canal at Wednesday’s press conference. Panama says thatthe US omitted the phrasefrom the agreed joint statement.Mulino has also opted to avoid engaging with other countries – such as Canada and Mexico – to gain international support for his country’s cause.US-Panama relationship was ‘very strong’. Then Trump upended the diplomatic playing boardRead moreOn Thursday the local chapter of Transparency Internationalrequested on Xthat Mulino “inform the country of all the details of what is happening, the agreements in process and the pressures he is receiving if that is the case. The country requires transparency in order to achieve unity against this threat to our sovereignty.”Even before Hegseth’s visit, Mulino had faced heavy local criticism for offering concessions to the US without gaining firm assurances over the future of the canal.Two-thirds of Panamanians disapproveof the way he is running the country. In addition to the diplomatic crisis he has passed an unpopular social security reform and angered environmentalists by opening talks with a copper mine closed down in 2023 due to popular protest. He lacks the backing of many of his party’s deputies in congress who are loyal to his political patron, Ricardo Martinelli, who has been residing in the Nicaraguan embassy to escape corruption charges and recently saw his attempt to gain exile in that country rejected.Popular demonstrations against US policy and the handling of the government are expected on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsPanamaTrump administrationUS foreign policyPete HegsethAmericasDonald TrumpUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

From this Sunday, organisers of the2025 Expositionin Osaka will be hoping that appeal will put the event’s unsettled preparations in the shade for a six-month celebration of our common humanity.The westernJapancity is preparing to host its second World Expo, 55 years after the first was held in a country eager to capitalise on fading memories of the second world war as it embarked on its postwar journey to become an industrial and technological powerhouse.Then, 64 million people descended on Osaka’s northern suburbs to view theTower of the Sun– still a popular site in the commemorative park – and a moon rock retrieved by Apollo 12.The 2025 version opens under a geopolitical cloud dark enough to cast a shadow over the 960-acre grounds on the reclaimed Yumeshima (“Dream Island”), a former dumping ground for industrial waste and, for successive Osaka governments, a plot of land in perennial need of a purpose.The expo is the most convincing attempt yet to make use of the unloved island, until now a blot on the landscape, with Osaka’s industrial skyline on one side and the busy shipping lanes of the Seto inland sea on the other. In its mission to bring people together, 150 countries and regions will showcase the best of their culture and technology, albeit with an acknowledgment that humanity is more divided than at any time most of the millions of expected visitors can recall.They should, though, marvel at a Martian meteorite discovered by Japanese scientists in Antarctica in 2000, interact with androids that could one day live in their homes, view a beating artificial heart made of stem cells and – not for the ­faint-hearted – stare back at an image of what they might look like in 25 years’ time.View image in fullscreenA woman poses for a photo in front of Myaku-Myaku, the mascot of the 2025 Osaka Expo, during a media preview day on Wednesday.Photograph: Richard A Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesViewed from the grand ring – a 2km (1.24 mile) wooden promenade that encircles the waterfront site – there is an incongruity to the 150 pavilions, from the flamboyance of Turkmenistan to the neat wooden contours of Japan. And all separated by lots of Tarmac and concrete. The earthquake-resistant wooden “skywalk”, though, is a feat of craftsmanship, built with a traditional joinery method used in the construction of ancient shrines and temples, its network of cypress, cedar and pine beams destined to become a shady oasis when Japan unleashes its brutal summer heat midway through the  event.The expo theme’s tagline – “towards a brighter future for all” – feels laughably elusive, but credit should go to the organisers for addressing the harsh realities of the world outside.The blue and yellow sign over Ukraine’s booth states that the country is “not for sale”, echoing comments from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia has chosen not to take part.In August visitors will be able to take part in a virtual reality experience corner for conflict zones in Gaza, in a space currently devoted to 80 years of the United Nations and its constituent departments and agencies, including Unrwa.Palestine’s space is to be found in the far corner of a shared pavilion, although its organisers claim the shipment of several planned exhibits has been delayed by Israeli authorities, which is denied by Israel, whose pavilion includes a stone from the Western Wall in Jerusalem.The reported delay is in keeping with Osaka’sbumpy road to Expo 2025. Construction was hit by labour shortages and the soaring cost of building materials – the project’s initial price tag of ¥125bn has soared to ¥235bn (from £666m to £1.25bn) – while interest among the Japanese public has so far been lukewarm.The 1970 Osaka Expo’s 64 million visitors was a record until Shanghai in 2010. So far, only 8.7m advance tickets have been sold for 2025, well below the pre-sales target of 14m.Last week, as TV crews swarmed around the site, workers were still flattening strips of tactile paving for visitors with visual ­impairments, while activity around incomplete pavilions gave them the feel of a supermarket entrance. The 1,500 trees comprising the Forest of Tranquillity will need time to bed in.Organisers have been given last-minute jitters by the discovery of potentially explosive concentrations ofmethane gas, as well as concern about overcrowding at the new subway station serving the site and, on social media, disbelief at the lack of cubicle walls in thechildren’s lavatories.The host nation, though, has deployed its soft power to good effect: the world’s longest conveyor belt sushi, a giantGundamrobot, 32 sculptures ofHello Kittydressed as different types of algae to symbolise the plant’s versatility, and an upgraded version of a “human washing machine” that proved a hit at the 1970 event.In a country addicted toyuru-kyara[mascot characters], the biggest attraction could turn out to be Myaku-Myaku, a red and blue figure with five googly eyes that was ridiculed when it was selected as the expo’sofficial mascot. Since then, the mysterious creature, purportedly “born from the fusion of cells and water”, has won over the Japanese public and is now the centre of a large merchandise empire … and the face ofmanhole coversacross Osaka.Sou Fujimoto, the exposition’s architectural mastermind, conceded the event was opening at a time when minds are focused on wars, real and commercial. “The whole global ­situation is very unstable,” he told CNN. But he added: “I believe this is a really precious opportunity to show so many countries can come together in one place and think about our future together.”That lofty vision will be fleeting, however. The pavilions – and Fujimoto’s “sustainable” edifice – will be dismantled later this year to make way for Japan’sfirst casino. But as gambles go, the longer odds could be on selling the idea that the expo movement’s bricks-and-­mortar appeal for global unity will strike a chord in a hyper-connected, but fractured, world.Explore more on these topicsJapanThe ObserverAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, only five trading days later, the autopsy is still under way but the victim may instead be economic populism, strangled by Wall Street, the citadel of globalisation. Donald Trump’s so-called liberation day may in fact have been theanti-globalist’s entombment day.In an effort to deny even a tactical retreat, Trump’s aides insist the White House goal all along was not to weaken globalism, or even to protect theUS economywith tariffs, but instead to get into a negotiation to lower tariffs around the world and to punish China. As cover stories go, it is hardly credible, partly because the tariffs were repeatedly lauded by Trump as a macroeconomic revenue-raising measure, or a means to bolster US manufacturing.The reality is that when faced by an attempt to remake the world trading system overnight, or what the former UK Treasury minister Jim O’Neill describes as “a full-on Kamikaze mission”, the markets revolted. But the retreat caused by the sell-off of US Treasury bonds has been only partial, with tariffs set at 10% universally, except for parts of trade with Mexico and Canada.0:52Donald Trump explains decision to pause US tariffs for 90 days - videoWashington’s all-out trade spat with China, meanwhile, still leaves the average effective tariff rate at 27%, the highest since 1903, according to theYale Budget Lab.Amid the chaos, significant long-term damage has been done not only to Trump’s political credibility but also to the resilience of globalisation as a system.Trust, agreed rules and a degree of political stability are the underpinnings of globalisation. They are the prerequisite for specialised and highly extended trade supply lines across political borders to function.Globalisation, after all, is not just about the trade in goods or free markets, it is a set of interconnected ideas and institutions underpinning wealth creation that has dominated political thinking since the end of the second world war.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was not alone in arguing that Trump’s liberation day and its aftermath marked the end of an era. In a warning that holds true even after Trump’s retreat, Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and a former governor of the Bank of England, said: “The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of second world war, a system that while not perfect helped deliver prosperity for Canada for decades, is over.“The 80-year period when the US embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect and championed the free exchange of goods and services, is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality.”In short, this is not a phase, however the trade war withChinais resolved. The legacy of liberation day will linger for generations.Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, largely agreed that the US was committing an act of abdication. “The rules governing tariffs and the negotiating process that brought those tariffs down over time grew out of theReciprocal Trade Agreements Act, devised by Roosevelt in 1934 … It was, in fact, one of America’s greatest policy achievements. Donald Trump burned it all down,” hewrote.When the man elected to lead the country that invented globalisation places the rejection of globalism at his ideological core, even if it means alienating the US’s closest allies, a fundamental reordering is under way.A key difficulty is that Trump, 78, has shown no sign of wanting to learn from this debacle. As far back as September 1987 he spent $95,000 to publish an “open letter to the American people” in three newspapers. “For years, Japan and other wealthy nations have been taking advantage of the US,” he wrote. “It is time to end our vast deficits by making Japan, and others who can afford it, pay.”While his target may have shifted from Japan to China, Trump’s sense of resentment and betrayal, coupled with an aversion to trade deficits, has never left him. His election in 2016, alongside Brexit, merely confirmed to him how his message resonated.In fairness to Trump, analysis showed that US voting districts with industries vulnerable to Chinese imports tended to elect representatives with more polarised stances.The vote gave him a mandate to end what he described as the US carnage of “rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation”. Many in theDavos establishmentacknowledged that he had seen something they had not – globalism had left too many behind, not just in poor countries but among a previously middle-class group in western economies.Trump’s first term would probably have seen a version of this week’s debacle if he had chosen different advisers, and if he had not later been knocked off course by Covid.View image in fullscreenTrump and Gary Cohn in 2018. The White House senior economic adviser was among a series of high-profile departures during the president’s first term in office.Photograph: Getty ImagesFor the first two years of his first term, in 2017-18, his instincts were largely kept in check by his economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, who dampened Trump’s determination to use tariffs to end trade deficits.Cohn engaged in a two-year running argument, compiling a mass of statistics designed to convince a sceptical Trump that the decline of US manufacturing and its replacement by a service economy was largely benign.He set out how blanket tariffs rebound on American consumers. He explained the link between consumer uncertainty and the stock market. He challenged Trump to explain why he thought tariffs would not be counterproductive. Trump replied that he did not know, but he just did and it was what he had thought for 30 years. At one point, exasperated, Cohn accused Trump of a dangerous nostalgia, saying: “You have a Norman Rockwell view of America” – the artist remembered for hisidealised portrait of American workers.In the end, Cohn found Trump – who once scrawled “trade is bad” as the summation of his thinking for a keynote speech – so immune to evidence, and so determined to impose steel and aluminium tariffs,that he quit, leaving Peter Navarro, a man Cohn regarded as a tariffflat earther, to take the reins.Vestiges of opposition to Trump’s tactics remained inside the Republican party. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska senator, tweeted a now familiar criticism in 2018: “About those new tariffs: Europe, Canada & Mexico aren’t China. You don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. Blanket protectionism is a big part of why we had a Great Depression. ‘Make America Great Again’ shouldn’t mean ‘Make America 1929 Again’.”But Trump largely ignored the critics inside his own party. Re-elected in 2024, with Navarro and other tariff supporters reappointed to lead his trade team, Trump was convinced that his key mistake in the first term had been taking any notice of those advising him that globalisation had brought the US unparalleled wealth.The path was clear for Trump’s headlong assault on tariffs, in part because in the four years out of office the anti-globalist tide had appeared to be heading in his direction. Many on the centre left bought the argument that hyperglobalisation did not suit an era of geopolitical conflict.View image in fullscreenJoe Biden with Xi Jinping last year. The Biden administration retained many of Trump’s tariffs.Photograph: Leah Millis/ReutersThe Biden administration, for instance, in the name of reindustrialisation and national security, retained many Trump-era tariffs, especially on China, a decision seen as a mistake by a study published this week by Harvard Kennedy School. In the study, Joe Biden’s economic advisers Adam Posen and Jonas Nahm argued that the protectionism was excessive.Since the 2007-08 financial crisis, there has been a steady increase in trade-restricting measures – such as tariffs, non-tariff measures, export controls and investment restrictions – contributing to growing trade fragmentation. In 2024 alone, more than 3,000 trade restrictions were implemented globally.Some arose from legitimate concern about unfair competition, but much was being driven by deepening geopolitical competition. Countries of all politics have resorted to ever-expanding definitions of national security to screen foreign investment and trade. New language has entered the vocabulary such as “friend or near-shoring”, a term to encourage companies to align their supply chains with the geopolitical interests of their countries.The call for resilient supply chains was given a spur by the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid, including the west’s dependence on asmall number of vaccine suppliers.After the invasion of Ukraine, Russia further exposed the west’s supply chain vulnerability byexploiting Europe’s dependence on its gas pipelines. Interconnectors designed to bring countries closer, such as undersea data cables,have become targets– from the Baltic Sea to the Taiwan Strait. The war also blew apart the myth that trade brought peace.As a result, investment screening measures were introduced by governments all over the west empowering them to block takeovers and investments by foreign firms, mainly Chinese in strategic industries.Rachel Reeves endorsed the trend in a speech in Washington as the UK’s shadow chancellor in May 2023. “Globalisation as we know it is dead. Supply chains that prioritise only what is cheapest and fastest struggle when a crisis strikes, be that PPE during Covid or energy following the war in Ukraine.”In a diagnosis similar to Trump’s, Reeves claimed that a globalised system “can be gamed by countries like China who have undercut and ignored the international trading rules and made it impossible for our own to compete”.Rajan Raghuram, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and ex-governor of India’s central bank, has argued that friend-shoring is “resurgent protectionism, cloaked and augmented by new geopolitical rivalries”. He also criticised the initiative as “concentrating production within the gated community of advanced communities”.Even so, trade as a proportion of GDP – the best measure of economic openness – has not as yet collapsed. In its 2023 report titled Re-globalisation, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said there had been a slowdown in world trade after the financial crash and Covid, but the change may as much be to do with the growth of services, as opposed to goods, in the world economy. Countervailing trends such as digital trade have kept globalisation alive.The issue now is what can be preserved from the wreckage of the past week, and whether a new coalition of the willing – this time of free traders – can be assembled, if necessary. There is talk of a G6 – the G7 minus the US – going to China to see if an agreement can be found to reduce its trade imbalances, and distorting subsidies, a subject of complaint to the WTO not just by the west but by emerging markets.But this will require the UK’s Labour party to stop briefing that globalisation has failed. In the current context there is no room for nuance, and it risks sounding as if Labour shares Trump’s utterly chaotic prescription. This is the time to declare economic populism, and not free trade, dead.Explore more on these topicsGlobalisationGlobal economyTrump tariffsTariffsUS economyEconomicsChinese economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Advance’s executive director, Matthew Sheahan, claimed in a February email to supporters it had already raised $7.6m to “smash the Greens” and about $2m to target Labor. The group has spent more than $200,000 in the past week to promote posts from Facebook pages with names such as “Greens Truth”.But it has not previously talked publicly about the extent of its support for other groups hostile to the Greens, including those that take exception to the party’s position on the Israel-Gaza war or on renewable energy.The type of assistance Advance has on offer was revealed by two Jewish advocacy groups at a forum hosted by the Australian Jewish Association (AJA).Simonne Whine of J-United, which campaigned against the Greens in the recent Prahran byelection in Victoria, said her group had reached out to Advance to get its campaign started.“They were fantastic, efficient, strategic, well resourced,” she said. “They supplied the flyers, the T-shirts and the corflutes, and shipped everything to Melbourne, helping us hit the ground running.” Advance even paid for a picnic to thank volunteers, Whine said.View image in fullscreenJ-United, which campaigned against the Greens in the Prahran byelection in Victoria, reached out to Advance to get its campaign started.Photograph: Diego Fedele/AAPDuring last year’s Queensland state election, the Queensland Jewish Collective (QJC) also focused on the Greens vote in Brisbane seats such as Maiwar and Moggill. One of the group’s directors, Roz Mendelle, told the AJA forum QJC had spoken with Advance after seeing its work during the campaign against the Indigenous voice to parliament.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“When time came … to do something against the Greens here in Brisbane, I knew who to turn to,” Mendelle said, claiming that Advance kept “a healthy distance” while the campaign was under way. According to an event invitation seen by Guardian Australia, QJC held a volunteer event with Advance in February.Mendelle is a co-director of a new group, Minority Impact Coalition (MIC), which hasstarted a billboard campaignagainst Labor and the Greens in multiple states.During the AJA briefing, Mendelle showed an image of a billboard paid for by QJC that read: “The Greens: They’ve changed for the worse.”“This is also inspired by the Advance messaging,” she said. “But from there, we gained our footing, and we decided to just speak our truth.” MIC is using the same mobile billboard provider as Advance in Queensland, NSW and Victoria – STT Advertising.In return, Advance has also used content from groups such as J-United on social media, sharing pictures of its“local grassroots community members”on its Greens Truth Facebook page.The likely electoral impact of the anti-Greens strategy remains somewhat elusive. The Greens hold only four seats in the lower house, of whichthe three they won in Brisbane at the last election appear vulnerable. They have six senators up for re-election. By contrast, six new teal independent MPs were elected in 2022 – if they hold those seats or even increase their numbers, they might be expected to have a greater say in the event of a hung parliament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three seats will tell the tale in 2025Read more“They’ve clearly worked out how to get conservative people fired up enough to throw money at them, and the way to do that is by attacking the Greens,” said Peter Lewis, the executive director of Essential, which is conducting qualitative research for the ALP. “But it’s not going to do anything to help the Liberals win back teal seats.”The Advance spokesperson said: “Our campaign against the Greens won’t defeat teals because it was never meant to. We have been crystal clear for the past 18 months that our focus is on the Greens this election.”Sheahan told an Australian Jewish Association forum in 2024: “Our goal is to just expose the Greens policies so that people don’t vote for them … A partial benefit will be that we think that will also reduce the teal vote.” His logic for that claim was unclear.Anti-renewablesAdvance has also focused on the anti-renewables movement, appearing at “energy forums” across the country and events held by groups set up to oppose the roll-out of offshore wind and solar energy.As Guardian Australiahas previously documented, the Facebook account for Advance spokesperson Sandra Bourke is active in dozens of local Facebook groups and pages opposing renewable projects in places such as Lake Borumba and Mount Fox in Queensland, regularly sharing Advance content.Bourke is a regular speaker at these rallies and events – unusually for the outfit, which generally avoids a public-facing presence.View image in fullscreenA Reckless Renewables rally in Canberra in February last year.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPGrant Piper is the former chair of the National Rational Energy Network (NRen), which brought together community groups opposed to renewable energy projects and hosted events includingthe Reckless Renewables rallyin Canberra last year.That’s where Piper first met Advance. “We didn’t tie any formal knots, but we could tell we were pushing after the same thing when it comes to renewables,” Piper said.NRen, which has rebranded as Let’s Rethink Renewables, has had discussions with Advance “all the way through”, he said, although it has remained independent. Bourke, one of NRen’s original members, is now Advance’s spokesperson and the face of its campaign against the Greens.According to Piper – who appeared in Advance’s anti-renewablesDollars & Destructionvideo series – the organisation is a natural ally for groups that feel they are mostly excluded from the conversation taking place in parliament and the media.“Advance is helping get publicity for the grassroots people who have been shut out of everything,” he said.Others who have teamed up for the Greens Truth campaign include groups that emerged from the anti-lockdown movement, the Freedom party and Reignite Democracy Australia – whichmakes clear to prospective volunteersthat their details will be shared with Advance.Another NRen member and former One Nation candidate,Katy McCallum, was the MC at a “Goodbye Greens Rally” in Brisbane in late March, where QJC also appeared. Along with other event backers such as the Libertarian candidate Jim Willmott, she thanked Bourke and Advance for their help at the event.“If our other good mate Sandra Bourke … from Advance hadn’t have jumped on, this would not be happening today,” she said.Do you know more?

Its owners have become grandmothers, and want to spend more time with their families. To “close this chapter” they are holding a “big sale”.But there is no bricks-and-mortar Maison Canberra store. A domain search shows the website was only registered on 21 March. Two Maison Canberra Facebook pages were created on 23 March. Another, called Maison Canberra Boutique, was set up on 1 April. There is no ABN or registered company name on the website.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterExperts say Maison Canberra is an example of an online-only “ghost” store, claiming to be Australian despite having no local shopfront, telling a false story to entice customers into shopping their closing down sales.View image in fullscreenAn image of ‘Cooper and Ellis’, standing outside a store which is supposedly in Byron Bay but which does not exist.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says the products are typically shipped from overseas warehouses.A spokesperson for the ACCC says it is investigating the issue after an increase in complaints about online retailers operating ghost stores.Guardian Australia has identified several other e-commerce sites which appear to be advertising as ghost stores: Cooper&Ellis, Molly-Smith, Julie Melbourne, and Syd Collective.They are running social media ads that tug on the heartstrings about “closing down” sales after many years in business – despite only being registered recently.The chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, Erin Turner, says that if these sites are making false claims then they could risk breaching Australian consumer law.“Companies cannot lie to their customers,” she says. “This includes lying about the location of their operations, fake closing-down sales or using images of fake owners to create a sense that the business is legitimate”.Turner says search engines and social media platforms should be doing more to confirm if the businesses advertising on their sites are legitimate.Crypto investment scammers exploit fake images of Penny Wong in social media adsRead moreAs for where the clothes come from? Maison Canberra is selling what it calls the “Andrine™ Casual Sweatshirt and Dress Set” for $79.95. It claims the original price was $269.95. A reverse image search shows you can buy what appears to be an identical item on the Chinese marketplace AliExpress for just $14.99.Prof Jeannie Paterson, the co-director of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for AI and Digital Ethics, says the fact that you can buy similar or identical clothing for cheaper elsewhere doesn’t mean the sites are engaging in misleading conduct.“The issue is that they’re saying they’re discounting it from a storefront, and there is no storefront, which means there is no real discount,” she says. “This is close to a scam.”Paterson says the sites should be subject to Australian consumer law because they are advertising on social media here, but it will be difficult to enforce any breaches if they are run from overseas.View image in fullscreenA sponsored ad on Facebook from online business Cooper&Ellis promoting a purported closing down sale.Photograph: Facebook“The ACCC can, in theory, seek to find the company,” he says. “It’s just difficult because it’s unclear that you can even identify the real seller.”Paterson says social media platforms should take more responsibility for advertising on their platforms.The online retailer Molly-Smith claims to be a “family-run business” based in Sydney and owned by “Molly and Peter Smith” which has been a “well-known name in the local fashion scene since 2012”. The domain name was registered last year.“Over the years, we’ve faced unsold stock, financial difficulties, the impact of Covid, and even competitors copying our designs and leaving unfair reviews,” the website says. “Saying goodbye is never easy, but we hope you’ll understand and support our decision.” The exact same copy appears on the Facebook page of an apparently UK-based label called Taylor London, although that post is signed off from “Edward & Margaret Taylor”.The Cooper&Ellis website features an image of a couple standing smiling outside a Cooper&Ellis shopfront. The file name begins with “a-realistic-photo-of-an-australian-coupl_Ai”.The company claims to be a clothing label founded by two people called Cooper and Ellis “in the heart of Byron Bay”, a well-known tourist destination in the New South Wales northern rivers. But the store does not exist.After “16 wonderful years”, “Cooper and Ellis” are “retiring” and are offering an “exclusive 80% discount”, according to the site. But a domain search shows the website was only registered on 13 February. The Cooper&Ellis Facebook page wasn’t created until 20 February.The Byron Bay Chamber of Commerce president, Matt Williamson, believes Cooper&Ellis is the latest example of an e-commerce site capitalising on the beach town’s popularity by pretending to be a local brand.‘Blessings’ scam: con artists allegedly swindle elderly Melbourne victims by claiming to rid them of evil spiritsRead more“We’re pretty pissed off, to be frank,” he says. “What it does is it undermines all of those local businesses who legitimately are here and employ local people and go to the expense of having a shopfront and do everything by the rules.”Williamson says the chamber had researched adifferent online store after fielding complaints from locals, which turned out to be a “Chinese-based company with absolutely no local representation”.“The articles of clothing looked really nice but when they arrived they weren’t even remotely close to what was online,” he says. “I imagine it’s very easy to replicate versions of the same thing.”Meta, which owns the Facebook and Instagram platforms where the sponsored ads appeared, said it was investigating the pages.The photographs purporting to be of real people outside physical shops on the online store “closing down sale” ads appear to be AI generated or manipulated with AI tools. If they are images of actual persons, the Guardian does not suggest they are aware their likeness is being used in this way.Maison Canberra, Cooper&Ellis, Molly-Smith, Julie Melbourne, Syd Collective and Taylor London have not responded to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsScamsSocial mediaBusiness (Australia news)Retail industryByron BayAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

And he says in his many years in nuclear-free campaigns he has never seen so many sectors – including unions, state leaders, energy producers, businesses and protest groups – aligned against nuclear.The Coalition has pinpointed Tarong and Callide in Queensland, Liddell and Mount Piper in New South Wales, Loy Yang in Victoria, and small modular reactors (SMRs) in Port Augusta in South Australia and Muja, near Collie in Western Australia.Coalition nuclear plan will plough $58bn wrecking ball through renewable energy projects, analysis warnsRead moreIt says the $331bn nuclear plan will make electricity cheaper, while critics have called its costings a “fantasy”.TheLiberal partydid not respond to questions about the lack of consultation and lack of veto power.The alliance said there “has been no consultation or free prior and informed consent from traditional custodians”.“You never asked locals if they want nuclear reactors in their back yards, instead you threaten compulsory acquisition and federal overrides with no right to veto,” it saidin a petition to the Coalition.3:05Where in Australia would Peter Dutton's nuclear reactors go? – videoIt said the plan was a “distraction” designed to “create false debate” when communities are already transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.Jayla Parkin, a Collie resident and community organiser for Climate Justice Union, said pro-nuclear information sessions had not provided any answers and had tried to stop First Nations people from entering.Nuclear for Australia has held two information sessions with “expert speakers” in the town.One elder was “devastated” after initially being refused entrance to a meeting last year, Parkin said. “She wanted to get the information,” Parkin said. “Not everyone is simply for nuclear or against. We are for being informed on what’s going to happen.”At a January meeting, elders were told they couldn’t go in because of something wrong with their registrations, which Parkin then sorted out. Once inside, she said questions had to be submitted via an app.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“Not a single question could be answered … like ‘Where is the water coming from?’, ‘How will this benefit Collie?’, and ‘Where are you going to store the radioactive waste?’” she said.Since then, the community had heard nothing, she said.Nuclear for Australia, founded by Will Shackel and boasting the entrepreneur Dick Smith as a patron, describes itself as a grassroots organisation with no political affiliation.Information sessions have featured Grace Stanke, a nuclear fuels engineer and former Miss America who says being called “Barbenheimer” is one of her favourite compliments.Shackel told SBS that Nuclear for AustraliaGoogle peoplewhen they try to register for the sessions.“If we believe that someone is a known protester … someone who could cause a physical threat to people in there, we will not allow them in,” he said.Farmer, also the president of Voices of the Valley, said Nuclear for Australia was “silencing people” by only allowing questions through an app and filtering them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said there were concerns about the safety of any power plant and the impact on the local environment. “Port Augusta … is probably the most stupid place to put a nuclear power station in the world,” he said, pointing to the unique nature of Spencer Gulf and its flat“dodge” tides.“Any leakage … the water would end up in the top end of the gulf, with only one place to go, through Port Lincoln, the fish nurseries, the mangroves … only 50km further south is Point Lowly near Whyalla, where the annual migration of thesouthern giant cuttlefishoccurs, which is a unique event in the world,” he said.The other point, Bannon said, was that the region had already transitioned away from baseload power to renewables.Nuclear curious? Here’s what you need to know about the Coalition’s energy claimsRead moreGuardian Australia has approached the Coalition and Nuclear for Australia for a response.Tom Venning was preselected to replace retiring MP Rowan Ramsey in Grey, the federal electorate that Port Augusta sits within. He said he supported the policy as part of a “credible path to net zero” and that if the Coalition formed government there would be a two-and-a-half-year community consultation and an independent feasibility study.“I’m committed to keeping my community fully informed and involved,” he said, adding that he would take any concerns seriously and would work with local leaders and the energy minister to address them.Sweeney said the Coalition already appeared to be backing away from its commitment to nuclear and appeared reluctant to bring it up.On Friday Dutton said people would flock to nuclear if they subsidised it but that they could “subsidise all sorts of energies”.“I don’t carry a candle for nuclear or any other technology,” he said.Farmer said: “There is a growing backlash.“We are keeping it as a hot topic – because the Coalition doesn’t want to talk about nuclear, we will.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Nuclear powerCoalitionAustralian politicsLiberal partyPeter DuttonRural AustralianewsShareReuse this content"

In turn, 68% believed better relations with the EU would boost UK/EU trade in a clearly positive way.Asked what they believed Keir Starmer’s priorities should be for a UK-EU summit in May, at which the prime minister and EU leaders will discuss moves to increase post-Brexit cooperation, the most popular answer was “trade between the UK and the EU”, which came out narrowly ahead of “illegal immigration across the channel” and, in third place, “improving the UK’s and EU’s defence and security”. Even among people who said they would consider voting for Reform UK at the next election, half (48%) said closer EU ties would have a positive impact on trade, with the same number saying it would make travel for Britons easier acrossEurope. This compares with one in 10 (11%) potential Reform voters who said it would have a negative impact on either.View image in fullscreenKim Darroch, former UK ambassador to the US, says ‘the US has shown little interest in doing favours for anyone, friend or foe’.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhen voters were given 20 options and asked to choose four that the government should focus on improving, “the UK’s ability to sign new trade deals with the USA” came 17th. The cost of living came top, followed by immigration and asylum, the UK economy and economic growth, energy costs, UK defence, and trade between the UK and was EU in sixth place.The study also found that a majority (62%) understand that the government is seeking a closer relationship with the EU. Far more people also thought the government was not going far enough to rebuild ties (35%) than those who thought the current approach was correct (15%). Among Labour’s winning coalition at the last election, a clear majority believed the government was not going far enough (54%).A sample of 4,703 people responded to YouGov between 31 March and 2 April, just as Trump was beginning to unveil his tariff plans, which have panicked the global final financial markets and opened the prospect of a bitter and prolonged trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the US and China.Last week, Trump was forced by the meltdown on the financial markets to announce a 90-day pause in the introduction of his higher “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on dozens of countries – with the notable exception of China. Keir Starmer’s public line is that he still hopes to gain an exemption from the 10% base tariffs imposed on the UK by signing a wider UK/US economic deal in the coming weeks.Recentindependent economic analysisby Frontier Economics found that even in the face of Trump’s trade war, acommonsense dealwith the EU that included deeper alignment on goods and services would secure economic growth of up to 1.5% to UK GDP, offsetting the impact of US tariffs completely for the UK and by a third for the EU.View image in fullscreenNaomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, says voters want Keir Starmer ‘to prioritise removing trade barriers in the interests of bringing costs down and getting growth’.Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, said: “Voters expect the prime minister to come away with more than just a defence pact when he hosts EU leaders in May and want him to prioritise removing trade barriers in the interests of bringing costs down and getting growth. They want trade before defence, trade before Channel crossings, and definitely trade with the EU before trade with Donald Trump.”Much of the analysis was based on the “Max-Diff” method, which is regarded as suitable when a range of options need to be put to respondents in order to gain a full and meaningful set of responses. Under this methodology, priorities are scored by asking people to choose their top three preferred options and their bottom three to provide a representative result.Peter Norris, chair of Virgin Group said: “As the last week has so painfully demonstrated, Trump is bad for business, consumers and savers. He has wreaked havoc in international markets and left us all on the precipice of a global recession that would mean real pain for people in the UK.Gordon Brown calls for ‘economic coalition of the willing’ to tackle Trump tariffsRead more“It is of the utmost urgency that our UK government work with our reliable partners in the EU to remove the artificial trade barriers between us so that both British and European businesses are in the best position to succeed in these extremely challenging conditions and so shield consumers from the worst effects.”Former British ambassador to the US Kim (now Lord) Darroch said: “Under the current administration at least, the US has shown little interest in doing favours for anyone, friend or foe.“The global order which has been in place for almost 80 years is changing by the hour and it makes sense for the UK to find stability through deeper cooperation with our allies in Europe while maintaining good relations with Washington.”Explore more on these topicsOpinion pollsThe ObserverEuropean UnionEuropeUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump wants Kyiv to hand over its natural resources as “payback” in return for weapons delivered by the previous Biden administration.Talks have become increasingly acrimonious, Reuters said. The latest US draft is more “maximalist” than the original version from February,which proposed giving Washington $500bn worthof rare metals, as well as oil and gas.Citing a source close to the talks, the news agency said the most recent document includes a demand that the US government’s International Development Finance Corporation take control of the natural gas pipeline.It runs from the town of Sudzha in westernRussiato the Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod, about 750 miles (1,200km) away, on the border with the EU and Slovakia. Built in Soviet times, the pipeline is a key piece of national infrastructure and a major energy route.On 1 January, Ukrainecut off the supply of gaswhen its five-year contract with the Russian state energy company Gazprom expired. Both countries had previously earned hundreds of millions of euros in transit fees, including during the first three years of full-scale war.Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy, a Kyiv thinktank, said the Americans were out for “all they can get”. Theirbullying “colonial-type” demandshad little chance of being accepted by Kyiv, he predicted.Last autumn, Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed giving the US access to Ukraine’s underdeveloped mineral sector. He envisaged a deal that would see the incoming Trump administration supply Ukraine with weapons, in return for future profits from joint investments.Instead, Trump has refused to give security commitments or military support but wants the minerals anyway. Last week he complained Zelenskyy was trying to “back out of an agreement” and said Ukraine’s president would have “big problems” if he failed to sign.Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Zelenskyy said he was ready to do a deal to modernise his country but that Ukraine could only agree if there was “parity” between the two sides, with revenues split “50-50”.“I am just defending what belongs to Ukraine. It should be beneficial for both the United States and Ukraine. This is the right thing to do,” Zelenskyy said. The US Treasury confirmed “technical” talks were ongoing.Meanwhile, the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said hisremarks over a possible partition of Ukrainehad been misinterpreted. In an interview with the Times, Kellogg said the country could be divided “almost like the Berlin after world war two” as part of a peace deal.Writing on X, Kellogg said he was referring to “a post-cease fire resiliency force in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty”. Under this plan, Russian troops would remain in territory already seized by Moscow, with British and French forces stationed in Kyiv and in other parts of the country.On Friday, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Witkoff’s reported solution to the conflict was to give Russia the four Ukrainian provinces it is demanding – including territory that Ukraine controls, and which is home to 1 million people.Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group on Friday, Kyiv’s alliesannounced a record €21bn (£18.2bn) in additional militaryhelp. They accused Putin of dragging his feet over a 30-day ceasefire deal which Ukraine has accepted.Early on Saturday, Russia carried out further air attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets.Three warehouses were destroyed in Kyiv, with two people injured. The Kremlin has fired 70 missiles and 2,200 drones at Ukraine since the 11 March US ceasefire proposal, Ukrainian officials said.Zelenskyypaid tributeon Saturday to a 26-year-old pilot, captain Pavlo Ivanov, who was killed during an F-16 combat mission. Ukraine’s small air force “heroically” defends the country from Russian missiles and drones, and supported ground operations, he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaEuropeGasEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Cured meats, raw meats and milk are off limits regardless of whether they are packed, packaged or have been bought at duty-free.FMD does not directly affect humans, but it can be devastating to cattle, and while there are no cases in the UK at present, the government wants to keep it that way.FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cattle, sheep, pigs, and other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boars and deer.In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the outbreak in Europe “presents a significant risk to farm businesses and livestock”. The disease can cause “significant economic losses due to production shortfalls in the affected animals, as well as loss of access to foreign markets for animals, meat and dairy”, it added.Earlier this year, the government placedbans on imports of cattle, sheep, other ruminants, pig meat and dairy products from Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Austriain response to outbreaks of FMD in those countries.UK bans German meat and dairy products after foot-and-mouth caseRead moreThe new restrictions apply only to travellers arriving in Great Britain and will not be imposed on personal imports arriving in Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man.The minister for food security and rural affairs, Daniel Zeichner, said: “This government will do whatever it takes to protect British farmers from foot-and-mouth. That is why we are further strengthening protections by introducing restrictions on personal meat and dairy imports to prevent the spread of the disease and protect Britain’s food security.”The UK deputy chief veterinary officer for international and trade affairs, Jorge Martin-Almagro, said: “Robust contingency plans are already in place to manage the risk of this disease to protect farmers and Britain’s food security. This biosecurity measure, combined with all others we have implemented, are critical to limit the risk of FMD incursion.”Martin-Almagro urged livestock keepers to keep an eye out for signs of disease, maintain biosecurity, and immediately report any suspicion of disease to the Animal and Plant Health Agency.There are exemptions from the new rules, including a limited amount of infant milk, medical foods, and certain composite products such as chocolate, confectionery, bread, cakes, biscuits and pasta.The government said: “Those found with these items will need to either surrender them at the border or will have them seized and destroyed. In serious cases, those found with these items run the risk of incurring fines of up to £5,000 inEngland.”Explore more on these topicsFoot-and-mouth diseaseFood & drink industryEuropean UnionFoot-and-mouthEuropeEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

That photograph was part of an archive seized from him by police and was on the website of the Italian Carabinieri.The Dutch police have been notified. The object’s value is believed to be about £50,000.The Kallos Gallery, which specialises in ancient art, was founded in 2014 by Baron Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza, son of the lateBaron Hans Heinrich von Thyssen Bornemisza, the Swiss billionaire who built up what was regarded as the greatest art collection in private hands in the world.Measuring 23.6cm in height, the amphora is decorated with sphinxes, a ram and a lion. It is attributed to the artist known only as the Phineus Painter, named after a cup he decorated with the myth of Phineus, the blind king plagued by harpies and saved byJason and the Argonauts.View image in fullscreenThe amphora is attributed to the Phineus Painter, named after a cup he decorated with the myth of Phineus, seen in this engraving by Bernard Picart.Photograph: Chronicle/AlamyThe collecting history given by the gallery online only dated back to 1986. This raised Tsirogiannis’s suspicions that the jar could have been part of an illicit excavation, he said: “These are immediate red flags.”He added that the provenance details included a gallery that had belonged to a dealer who was himself convicted for receiving stolen antiquities from Italy in the 1970s.Tsirogiannis, an affiliated archaeology lecturer at the University of Cambridge, heads illicit antiquities trafficking research for the Unesco chair on threats to cultural heritage at the Ionian University in Corfu. The late Paolo Giorgio Ferri, the Italian public prosecutor who pursued and prosecuted traffickers in looted antiquities, gave Tsirogiannis access to tens of thousands of images and other archival material seized in police raids from traffickers and other individuals involved in the illicit trade.Over 19 years, Tsirogiannis has identified more than 1,700 looted antiquities, alerting police and playing a role in their repatriation to 15 countries. The finds include an ancient Greek bronze horse that Sotheby’s New York intended to auction in 2018 until Tsirogiannis notified the authorities of its links to theBritish antiquities dealer Robin Symes. Greece claimed the horse as its national property, and in 2020 Sotheby’s lost its legal challenge, prompting the Greek culture minister to welcome the court’s ruling as a victory for countries seeking to reclaim their antiquities.Last year,Christie’s withdrew ancient Greek vasesfrom auction after Tsirogiannis discovered their link to another convicted antiquities trafficker. He criticised the auctioneer’s failure to reveal that the objects could be traced to Gianfranco Becchina, who was convicted in 2011 of illegally dealing in antiquities. Christie’s said at the time that it withdrew the works once it was made aware of the connection.Tsirogiannis has identified many other Medici objects, which have been repatriated to Italy over the years. “Medici was receiving objects looted from tombs in Italy,” he said, adding that he believes the amphora came from Etruscan tombs in Italy.He has repeatedly argued that auction houses and dealers do not make adequate checks with Greek and Italian authorities, and has criticised their failure to disclose objects’ full collecting history.Madeleine Perridge, director of the Kallos Gallery, said: “We make every effort to do our due diligence and publish all collection and publication history known to us … The artwork in question has been immediately removed from sale pending advice from the relevant authorities. We have absolutely no interest in handling tainted artworks and welcome an opportunity to find practical and productive solutions to these complex issues.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyThe ObserverArt theftCrimeItalyGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The 28-year-old social media manager used to buy a latte most days, but with prices having gone up by about 15-20 kronor (about £1-£1.50), she has cut down to two or three times a week.But it is not just about coffee. The economy also extends tofika– the historically hardwiredSwedish traditionof meeting for a catch-up over a coffee and a biscuit or cake. “Many I know are abstaining from meeting forfikato save money. So we do something else instead,” Tomth says. Low-cost alternatives include meeting at home or going on walks, but it is not quite the same asfika, which plays a key social role in an otherwise often introverted society.“To take afikawith somebody is such a simple and short meeting, but even so, it’s so big because you go through what has happened since you last saw them, what’s important, or just sit down with someone you like,” says Tomth.Coffee shortages area global issue, caused by a combination of poor harvests as a result of the climate crisis and extreme weather, increased demand and rising transport costs. But the problems – the price of unroasted coffee beans has risen by over 100% in the last six months – are having a very specific impact infika-loving Sweden.View image in fullscreenSitting down forfikawith colleagues is part ofSwedish office culturetoo – and people may be increasing their coffee consumption at work.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianAmid significant price rises – the cost of a packet of coffee has breached the 100 kronor mark in some shops for a 500g packet – and another increase to come, some Swedes are stockpiling coffee before it goes up again, resulting in empty supermarket shelves.Ulf Mazur, the chief executive of Matpriskollen Sverige (Food Price Survey Sweden), says on Monday there will be the “largest price increase ever in coffee prices at once”. Although some stores may wait until after Easter to put prices up, he expects prices to rise by up to 25 kronor a packet – as much as 40%.Already sales of ground coffee or coffee beans for use at home have decreased in recent years amid food inflation and changing habits. With many workplaces offering free coffee to their employees, people may be increasing their coffee intake at work, where sitting down forfikawith colleagues alsoplays a central role.“Coffee is sacred in Sweden, but coffee consumption has declined quite significantly in recent years in volume,” Mazur says. “People now brew less coffee at home, they reduce waste by being more careful with the dosage, and many probably drink more coffee at work, where it is free. This reduces home consumption.”But the ethnologist Richard Tellström, an associate professor in food and meal science at Stockholm University, is not concerned about the survival of Swedishfikaculture.“Both coffee and fika culture are a central part of how Swedes develop both personal and work relationships, so the cost of coffee is a high priority. If you visit somebody you will always be offered coffee and to decline a cup of coffee can be impolite,” he says.While individual coffee consumption at chain coffee shops could go down, he believes people will not cut down on “coffee drinking that creates social relationships”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reuters reported that Turkish military teams had scoped out the main airport in Hama province as well as the T4 and Palmyra air bases in Homs, assessing the runways, hangars and infrastructure to see if forces and military hardware could be deployed there as part of a planned joint defence pact between Ankara and Damascus.The defence minister Israel Katz called airstrikes “a clear message and warning for the future”.Israel has struck military sites in Syria hundreds of timessince Assad fled to Moscow four months ago, destroying military assets including missile systems and air defences that the transitional government in Damascus had hoped to inherit.Assad’s overthrow marked the end of over 50 years of dictatorial rule by his family, as well as a halt to a decade-long civil war that became a frozen proxy conflict. The former autocrat’s backers Russia and Iran faced off against forces supported by Ankara in northern Syria, and an American military presence in the east and south.View image in fullscreenPresident Erdogan with Syria’s president Ahmed al-Sharaa at the Antalya diplomacy forum.Photograph: Murat Cetinmuhurdar/PPO/ReutersAfter an insurgency spearheaded by Sharaa’s forces took power in Damascus, Ankara emerged as the most significant regional backer of Syria’s nascent transitional government.Turkish officials have established fast ties with Damascus, while negotiating a reported defence pact that could see Turkish forces using Syrian airspace and establishing bases on the ground. Israel meanwhile moved to expand its decades-old occupation of the Golan Heights into a designated buffer zone following Assad’s departure.“Assad had Russia as his protector in the second half of the Syrian civil war. If Turkey comes in and begins installing air defence systems or introducing jets into Syrian airspace, that limits Israel’s freedom of action significantly,” said Aron Lund, an analyst with the New York thinktank Century International.“For Turkey, the problem now is not just Israel objecting to their military presence but doing things that by design or default are weakening or preventing the emergence of a functioning government in Syria, such as saying the new Sharaa government can’t have forces south of Damascus,” he said.Israeli military forces infiltrated a remote town in the Daraa countryside south of Damascus earlier this month, with Syrian state media saying nine civilians were killed in shelling during the deepest Israeli incursion into Syria.Amid few signs that Israeli forces intend to leave the area around Mount Hermon, an Israeli tour company hasreportedlybegun offering twice-daily hiking tours of the area in cooperation with troops stationed there.Less than a week after Israel struck three airbases in Syria, the two sides held talks in Azerbaijan aimed at finding ways to defuse growing tensions in Syria. The office of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a delegation composed of top security and diplomatic officials met their Turkish counterparts, with the two sides agreeing “to continue on the path of dialogue in order to maintain regional stability.”The Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told local broadcaster CNN Türk that “while we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia.”Fidan added that technical teams from both sides are in contact “when needed”, in order “to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other”.Lund labelled the talks “a very positive thing”, given the risk of a clash between the two powers in Syria, amid regional conflict including Israel’s 18-month assault on Gaza.“They will be both be military involved in Syria, and this could spiral in a number of different ways. So some form of red lines or communication channels are essential to managing that tension, and this seems to be a step in that direction,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaTurkeyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsShareReuse this content"

In a sign the talks over a joint agenda had gone well, they agreed to meet again on 19 April.A breakdown would have come if Donald Trump had demanded the complete dismantling of Iran’s civil nuclear programme, something thatIranis not prepared to contemplate. Iran insists it is pursuing only a civil nuclear programme, but Donald Trump took the US out of the previous nuclear deal claiming Tehran’s regime was seeking a nuclear weapon.It appears he is resolved to pursue an updated version of the deal.The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the talks had been “constructive”, and held in a “calm and respectful environment” with “no sharp words exchanged”.“Both sides don’t want to talk for sake of talking and wasting time, and want to reach a deal as quickly as possible. Both sides showed commitment to take these talks forward until we reach a favourable deal,” he added.Oman’s foreign minister acted as the mediator in the talks in Muscat, shuttling between Araghchi and Trump’s diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff.Witkoff has admitted he does not have technical expertise about civil nuclear disarmament programmes, but Trump implicitly trusts his judgment.Witkoff also said the discussions had been held in a positive and constructive atmosphere. It is likely the next set of talks will not be held in Muscat, but Oman will retain the role of shuttling between the two negotiating teams in separate rooms.It is understood that the two diplomats did have a brief exchange at the end of the process, but it was described as not a fully fledged negotiation.An Iranian condition for the talks wasthere would be no direct talks with the USwhile Iran is under US economic sanctions.Iran says talks with US will be indirect, contrary to Trump’s wordsRead moreBut what was more important to the Iranian side was whether Witkoff would demand Iran stop uranium enrichment altogether and end its civil nuclear programme. There was also concern Trump might table demands that Iran stop backing militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.Witkoff mapped out an agenda apparently similar to the intent behind the 2015 nuclear deal, but that will also have to address the fact that since 2018 Iran has amassed a large stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a purity greater than what is required for a civil nuclear programme.The next round of talks will have to agree how to dispense with this stockpile and how Iran will allow the reintroduction of an independent inspection regime. The UN nuclear weapon inspectorate, the IAEA, has seen its cameras switched off in Iran’s key nuclear sites on successive occasions, making it next to impossible to know what Iran is producing.Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is due in Iran next week, but it is not clear whether he is yet working in tandem with the small and relatively inexperienced US negotiating team.Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said he was proud to have hosted the talks in Muscat and to have mediated. He said the goal was “a process of dialogue and negotiations with the shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.”“I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability. We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal,” he added.View image in fullscreenA copy of the Iranian daily newspaper Etemaad on Saturday shows a composite picture of Araghchi and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPASina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said “the outcome signals progress. A likely framework is likely now on the table, centred on no weaponisation and sanctions relief.”Toosi added: “Both sides were likely to sound positive today – even with talks focused on format and agenda – because they currently need the negotiations to continue.“But without real progress, this dynamic – sustainable in past talks – is unlikely to hold as long this time.”Ryan Costello, policy director with the National Iranian American Council, said the parties had cleared a low bar today.He said: “Now, it is important for both the US and Iran to insulate the apparent positive environment of negotiations from those who want to sabotage a move toward a deal.“Each side should exercise restraint. For the US, this could mean dialling back the military threats. President Trump will also have to make sure that Israel does not go behind the administration’s back and undertake provocative steps that could derail negotiations, including sabotage, as we saw in 2021.“For Iran, signalling more openness to direct negotiations and ceasing warnings of weaponisation options can help build momentum toward and put a breakthrough in reach.”With the Iranian economy in freefall, and Iranians suffering energy blackouts, the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has always favoured talks with the US as the way to escape “the cage of sanctions”, but he has faced resistance from parliamentary hardliners and parts of the group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On 7 February, Khamenei said experience showed it was “not rational, intelligent or honourable” to hold talks with Trump, a judgment that Pezeshkian said he had no option but to accept.But the Iranian foreign ministry – supportive of talks – persuaded Khamenei that his regime, already weakened by reverses in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, might crumble unless he negotiated. Trump also threatened to give Israel the freedom to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites.To preserve Iran’s dignity, Khamenei insisted the initial talks at least be indirect, but there will be pressure from the US side to allow direct talks. The two countries broke off formal diplomatic relations after the 1979 Iranian revolution.Pezeshkian, in an effort to talk Trump’s transactional language, said this week: “His excellency [Khamenei] has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran. American investors: come and invest.”Trump, too, has relented both in his rhetoric and possibly his demands, saying on Friday: “I’m not asking for much; they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” adding: “I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be a great, wonderful, happy country.” Trump and Witkoff also badly need a diplomatic breakthrough since their peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine have so far been abject flops. A further war in the Middle East is fiercely resisted by the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia.Netanyahu said this week that a deal would only work if Iran’s nuclear facilities were blown up, “under American supervision with American execution”. He also called for a “Libya-style agreement”, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi’s voluntary dismantlement of his nuclear programme under international supervision. But Iran senses that Netanyahu is losing influence with Trump over the nuclear file.Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who is involved in parallel talks with European leaders, said: “If the American side does not raise irrelevant issues and demands and puts aside threats and intimidation, there is a good possibility of reaching an agreement. The Islamic republic of Iran believes in dialogue and interaction based on mutual respect, and any bullying and coercion is unacceptable in our view.”Araghchi, a veteran of the 2015 talks who holds a PhD in political thought from the University of Kent, is accompanied by a technical team.Iran, which has a reputation for being an exhaustive and exhausting negotiator, knows it is working against a deadline of two months, European officials say, because the UK, Germany and France must signal by the end of July whether they will reimpose punishing UN sanctions against Tehran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on 18 October.Explore more on these topicsIranIran's nuclear programmeOmanMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyTrump administrationNuclear weaponsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has disputed allegations from two witnesses who exhumed the bodies and newly releasedpostmortem resultsthat found several of those killed had close-range gunshot wounds to the head and chest and were discovered with their hands or legs tied.Field operatives from Unit 504, a military intelligence unit with a reputation forcruelty and reckless behaviour, including torture, were also present during the attack, a senior military intelligence source with knowledge of recent IDF deployments in southern Gaza told the Guardian. The Israeli military declined to comment on whether 504 was involved.During the Rafah attack, the Golani troops were under the command of the reservist Armoured 14th Brigade. The 14th Brigade is part of a division led by Brig Gen Yehuda Vach, who former officers say designated an unofficial “kill zone” elsewhere in the strip which resulted in the arbitrary killings of Palestinian civilians. Soldiers also alleged Vach’s “lack of operational discipline” endangered soldiers’ lives.Vach has also told troops “there are no innocents in Gaza”, according to an investigation by the Israeli daily Haaretz.In a video of Golani troops being briefed before their redeployment toGazaearlier this month, aired by Israel’s Channel 14, a battalion commander appeared to endorse an open-fire policy, telling the soldiers: “Anyone you encounter there is an enemy. You identify anyone, you eliminate him.”Golani soldiers have previously been accused of war crimes in the conflict, including killing civilians, degrading treatment of bodies, needless destruction of civilian infrastructure, and incitement to genocide.A song written by a member of the brigade’s 51st Battalion in the aftermath of the Hamas 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the war has become an unofficial anthem for many soldiers. The chorus’s lyrics include: “For what you did to the nation of Israel, Golani is coming with gasoline … Gaza will burn.”The accompanying music video features footage from Golani operations in Gaza in which the brigade’s yellow and green standard can clearly be seen.Many of the allegations against Golani troops were compiled from social media photo and video footage posted online by the soldiers themselves and cited in legal filings by theHind Rajab Foundation, a non-profit that aims to hold Israeli military personnel accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israeli officials say the two founders of the Belgium-based organisation have ahistory of extremist views.The presence of Unit 504 was also backed up by the account of the sole survivor of the massacre, the Red Crescent volunteer Munther Abed, and official photos and video of recent IDF operations in Rafah.The unit has conducted thousands of interrogations of captives from Gaza during the war, and differs from other Israeli military intelligence outfits in that the soldiers are combat troops, operating at a battalion level, who speak fluent Arabic.According to Abed, a 27-year-old ambulance service volunteer, troops he described as looking like “special forces … armed with rifles, green lasers, and night-vision goggles” dragged him out of the emergency vehicle after it was shot at continuously for five minutes, killing the driver and paramedic he was travelling with.The uniform description could match either Golani commandos or that of Unit 504 field operatives.Abed said he was then stripped to his underwear, with his hands bound behind his back, and threatened, suffocated and beaten during several hours of interrogation.1:16Footage shows moment Israeli soldiers killed Palestinian paramedics – videoLast week, the Israeli military backtracked on its account of the killings of the paramedics afterfootage emergedwhich contradicted its claims that the Red Crescent vehicles were not marked as emergency vehicles and were not using headlights or flashing lights when troops opened fire.The IDF has said that between six and nine of the medics had links to Hamas, without providing evidence. None of those killed – eight Red Crescent staff, six members of the Gaza civil defence agency and one employee of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees – were armed. One Red Crescent employee is still missing.The Israeli army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, has since ordered a second, more in-depth investigation into the attack.Over 18 months of war Israeli forces have killed hundreds of medical workers and the staff of aid agencies and UN organisations in Gaza.In April last year, seven members of the charity World Central Kitchen died in a sustained Israeli attack on their clearly marked vehicles.Human rights organisations have long accused the Israeli military of a culture of impunity, with few soldiers ever facing justice. In 2023, fewer than 1% of complaints made against Israeli troops’ actions in the occupiedPalestinian territoriesended in a conviction, according to the latest US state department annual human rights report.Earlier this week, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society called for an international investigation into the incident, which was the deadliest for members of the International Committee of the Red Cross since six workers were shot and killed in 2017 in an Islamic State ambush in Afghanistan.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warWar crimesHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The undated memo, the main piece of evidence submitted by the government, contained no allegations of criminal conduct.During a tense hearing on Friday afternoon, Khalil’s attorneys made an array of unsuccessful arguments attempting to both delay a ruling on his eligibility for removal and to terminate proceedings entirely. They argued the broad allegations contained in Rubio’s memo gave them a right to directly cross-examine him.Khalil held prayer beads as three attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security presented arguments for his removal.Judge Jamee Comans ruled that Rubio’s determination was “presumptive and sufficient evidence” and that she had no power to rule on concerns over free speech.“There is no indication that Congress contemplated an immigration judge or even the attorney general overruling the secretary of state on matters of foreign policy,” Comans said.1:25Mahmoud Khalil's support team makes statement as judge rules he can be deported from US – videoA supporter who was in tears sat on the crowded public benches as the ruling was delivered.Following the ruling, Khalil, who had remained silent throughout proceedings, requested permission to speak before the court.Addressing the judge directly, he said: “I would like to quote what you said last time, that ‘there’s nothing that’s more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness’.”He continued: “Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process.“This is exactly why theTrump administrationhas sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me is afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.”Khalil, 30, helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last year. Hewas arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers in New York on 8 March and transferred to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he has been detained for over a month. His case was the first in a string of Ice arrests instigated by the Trump administration targeting pro-Palestinian students and scholars present in the US on visas or green cards.The ruling means that Khalil’s removal proceedings will continue to move forward in Jena, while a separate case being heard in federal court in New Jersey examines the legality of his detention and questions surrounding the constitutionality of the government’s claims it can deport people for first amendment-protected speech if they are deemed adverse to US foreign policy.Khalil’s legal team is asking the New Jersey judge to release him on bail so that he can reunite with his wife, who is due to give birth to their first child this month.His lawyers slammed the decision, which they said appeared to be prewritten. “Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues,” said Marc van der Hout, Khalil’s immigration lawyer.White House may seek legally binding control over Columbia through consent decree – reportRead more“If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes. We will continue working tirelessly until Mahmoud is free and rightfully returned home to his family and community.”Van der Hout told a federal judge that Khalil will file the appeal after the immigration judge who ruled him “removable” issues the final written ruling. Van der Hout added that Khalil’s legal team may also pursue an asylum case.“So nothing is going to happen quickly in the immigration proceeding even though she’s found him removable on the foreign policy grounds,” he said.The judge gave lawyers for Khalil until 23 April to seek a waiver.During a short prayer vigil held outside the detention centre on Friday afternoon, a group of interfaith clergy read messages of support. A short statement from Khalil’s wife,Noor Abdalla, who is due to give birth this month, was also delivered in front of reporters.“Today’s decision feels like a devastating blow to our family. No person should be deemed ‘removable’ from their home for speaking out against the killing of Palestinian families, doctors, and journalists,” the statement read.It continued: “In less than a month, Mahmoud and I will welcome our first child. Until we are reunited, I will not stop advocating for my husband’s safe return home.”The New Jersey judge has ordered the government not to remove Khalil as his case plays out in federal court. A hearing in that case is set for later on Friday.Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilUS campus protestsColumbia UniversityUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

All three officers were treated in hospital, with one female officer discharged by 4pm on Saturday.Abedi was jailed for life in August 2020 for assisting his brother, Salman Abedi, in carrying out the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena in 2017. The attack killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.Responding to the assault, the secretary of state for justice,Shabana Mahmood, wrote on X: “I am appalled by the attack of three brave officers at HMP Frankland today. My thoughts are with them and their families.“The police are now investigating. I will be pushing for the strongest possible punishment. Violence against our staff will never be tolerated.”HMP Frankland is a category A prison, the highest level of security. It is understood the incident took place inside a separation centre – a special facility that aims to isolate prisoners with extreme views.Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the POA, said: “Separation centres hold the most dangerous terrorist offenders who simply do not wish to alter their ideology, and, as this event confirms, are determined to inflict violence on those who hold them securely.”He called for an urgent review of the privileges available to terrorist offenders in custody: “We must now review the freedoms we allow separation centre prisoners to have.”“I am of the opinion that allowing access to cooking facilities and items that can threaten the lives of staff should be removed immediately.“These prisoners need only receive their basic entitlements and we should concentrate on control and containment instead of attempting to appease them. Things have to change.”A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Three prison officers have been treated in hospital after an attack by a prisoner at HMP Frankland. Police are now investigating so it would be inappropriate to comment further.“Violence in prison will not be tolerated, and we will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hard-working staff.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationManchesterManchester Arena attackUK criminal justiceCounty DurhamShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the peer had been contacting a friend about a prostate cancer test during an event to support the Railway Family charity.A spokesperson for Hendy said: “Last month Peter Hendy used his phone while driving. He has apologised in full for this error of judgment and has contacted the police.”The Metropolitan police confirmed the case had initially been closed due to lack of evidence but was later reopened after Lord Hendy admitted to using his phone behind the wheel. He is expected to receive six points on his driving licence and a fine.The organisers of the Railway Family fundraiser said they had not received any formal complaint at the time of the incident.They said: “Since then, the organisers have only had one conversation from the complainant in the form of a text message, which he sent on 2 April, where he informed us that he’d reported Lord Hendy to the Metropolitan police.“The Railway Family fundraiser is run by railway professionals, all of whom work with safe systems of work and rules and regulations about safe practice. None of us would advocate or condone unsafe practices. However, we reiterate that we are not aware of the whole situation, and affirm our hope that any investigation is able to be conducted fairly.“The organisers regret that a positive and enjoyable event ended in this way and would once again like to express our thanks to Lord Hendy for his support for our event and fundraising.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shoppers bought an extra 45.4m packs of chocolate, cakes and crisps from the top-selling brands.The spending bonanza came as campaigners said food corporations were switching tactics to circumvent the impact of the upcoming regulations, which will bring in a 9pm watershed for TV commercials showing unhealthy food products, and ban them online from October, after five years of delays.Outdoor posters, audio advertising on podcasts and streaming services such as Spotify, and partnerships with social media influencers are not covered by the regulations.The increase in spending and the suggestion it may have led to an increase in sales may fuel calls for further restrictions. James McDonald, the director of data, intelligence and forecasting at WARC Media, which monitors ad spend and recorded the 26% increase, said it was “not surprising that we saw sales lift in line with spend”. He added: “I think the timing is interesting, given the introduction of HFSS [foods high in fat, salt or sugar] regulation this year.”New unpublished data analysed by academics at University College London and the Pan American Health Organization, including Chris van Tulleken, the NHS doctor and broadcaster, and shared with theObserver, found that the junk food ad regulations would only cover less than two-thirds of foods that could be considered unhealthy according to government nutrition guidelines.Health campaigners say food companies are adopting tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in the battle over cigarette advertising, by focusing on brands and logos rather than products. The advertising industry has argued that uncertainty over regulations threatens the sector and said ministers should legislate to exempt brand-only ads from the regulations.A battleground has opened up over whether the rules should cover adverts that only feature a brand name such as McDonald’s or Cadbury without showing an “identifiable” product.Allowing brand ads would mean that Cadbury could run its memorable drumming gorilla ad, for example, before the watershed so long as there were no images of chocolate bars.TheAdvertisingStandards Authority (ASA) is about to issue guidelines for advertisers clarifying issues like this, after suggesting that it would examine adverts on a case-by-case basis. Ahead of this crucial decision, both sides have ramped up their messaging.Archie Norman, the Marks and Spencer chair,told theFinancial Timesearlier this month that the regulations would “stop people talking about mince pies” and threaten future Christmas ads.Bite Back 2030, a youth activist group fighting the influence of junk food, surveyed 859 poster sites in Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle and Southwark in London and found nearly half were for food and drink. They also found that 44% of all HFSS food ads were in the most deprived areas, while only 4% were in the least deprived.View image in fullscreenDr Chris van Tulleken says he is not convinced the new regulations will work.Photograph: TT News Agency/AlamyThe government appeared to come down on the side of advertisers last week. Ashley Dalton, a junior health minister, issued astatementsaying “pure brand advertising” should not be restricted, and that the government did “not expect the perception or association of a corporate brand with less healthy products to automatically bring an advert into scope of the restrictions”.Last week an investigation by theBMJfound that local authorities were shelving restrictions on junk-food poster adverts in their areas after warnings from ad companies that they would lose revenue.“The only foods that are marketed in this country, almost without exception, are high in fat, salt or sugar,” Van Tulleken told theObserver. He said there were “no really functional marketing restrictions” for children on harmful food brands. “And I’m not enormously optimistic that anything that’s going to happen in October will significantly change that, because companies advertise on bus tickets … they have billboards advertising the brand, if not the product, up and down the street,” he added.Van Tulleken said there was “saturation” of unhealthy food brands across the country. “They’re in every shop, at every convenience store, in every supermarket, at every petrol station. They have complete 360 degree coverage, and the alternatives are inaccessible and unavailable and unaffordable for many, many, many people.”Curbing advertising on less healthy food products has long been considered a key part of tackling the UK’s obesity crisis.In 1980, only 6% of men and 9% of women were obese, according to theNational Heights and Weights Survey, while processed food made up 26% of kitchen groceries and families spent 57% of their food budgets on ingredients, according toresearchby the Institute for Fiscal Studies.By 2022, 28% of adults in England were classed as obese by the NHS, with two-thirds of all calories in UK diets coming from processed or ultra-processed food.The first government restrictions on ads for less healthy foods arrived in 2007, with some commercials banned during children’s TV shows. In 2018, after mounting evidence that children were still seeing junk food commercials, Theresa May bowed to pressure from campaigners such as Jamie Oliver to introduce a 9pm watershed for ads.Legislation was eventually passed in 2023 and the Advertising (Less Healthy Food Definitions and Exemptions) Regulations 2024 will come into effect on 1 October, with the aim, like thesoft drinks levy, of encouraging food brands to ­reformulate their products or introduce new ones.Rob Newman, the director of public affairs at ISBA, which represents brands advertising in the UK, said they were “extremely concerned” about the implications of the new restrictions and said the ASA was “caught on the horns of dilemma”.“The impact of brand ads being caught … could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds of lost revenue, redirection of spend outside the UK, or the inability to use ad campaigns which have already been prepared on the basis of what was understood to be the legislative position,” Newman said.Nicki Whiteman, Bite Back 2030’s chief brand officer, said: “The echoes of tobacco are everywhere. Instead of acknowledging and taking accountability for the extraordinary power these companies have over children’s health, what they do instead, just like Big Tobacco did, is look for ways around it.“Children across the world, all you [need] to do is show them a yellow M and they’ll know exactly what that stands for.”McDonald’s and Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment.Katharine Jenner, director of theObesityHealth Alliance, said food companies use “sophisticated techniques to keep unhealthy products in the spotlight” and exposure to unhealthy food marketing influences children’s preferences.“We now appear to be witnessing a final surge in less healthy food advertising before the rules come in, underlining why voluntary approaches have repeatedly failed and will continue to do so,” she said. “These long-delayed restrictions are sensible, proportionate, and evidence-based. Most importantly, they are a crucial step towards protecting children’s health.”Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthThe ObserverObesityFoodFood & drink industryAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

We understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world.”View image in fullscreenFormer British prime minister Gordon Brown said key trading nations needed to step up their collective response to the chaos unleashed by Donald Trump.Photograph: Victoria Jones/PALast week, the former prime ministerGordon Brown wrote in theGuardianthat leaders of other key trading nations needed to step up their collective response to the chaos unleashed by Trump, warning: “We are seeing a simultaneous breakdown in economic and geopolitical orders.”Brown said: “We need an economic coalition of the willing: like-minded global leaders who believe that, in an interdependent world, we have to coordinate economic policies across continents if we are to safeguard jobs and living standards.”Referring to the US under Trump, Brown said the “world is being brought to its knees by one economy, outside which live 96% of the population, who produce 84% of the world’s manufactured goods”.On Saturday, Trump announced thatsmartphones and computers would be exemptedfrom the 125% tariffs he has imposed on imports from China, as would electronics components such as memory cards and semiconductors.Experts had warned the tariffs could cause prices of electronic goods such as iPhones and laptops to dramatically spike for US customers.Support is growing among economists for a new layer of trade agreements between leading economic powers, under the auspices of theWorld Trade Organization, but excluding the US for as long as it follows the protectionist route.With both houses of parliament on SaturdayOn Sunday, in a further response to the uncertainties, ministers will announce that British businesses across the country will have access to new support through a multibillion-pound increase in government-backed financing.The new package will give UK Export Finance the power to expand financing support for British businesses by £20bn, with small businesses also able to access loans of up to £2m through the British Business Bank’s growth guarantee scheme.Thousands of companies are expected to benefit from the move, including those directly affected by tariffs. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Within a changing world, we need to adapt, and as part of our plan for change, this government is responding.”View image in fullscreenA new poll has revealed that more than half of adults believe US president Donald Trump is not ‘a friend of Britain’s’.Photograph: Andrew Leyden/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockAnOpinium poll for theObserverfinds that 34% of adults now believe the US is more of a threat than an ally, up from 16% in November last year, while those who have confidence in the US as an ally are just 35%.Views of Trump are also becoming more negative. Although the president has said he has an affinity with the UK, the poll shows that more than half of adults believe he is not “a friend of Britain’s” – a 12% leap since January. And fewer people believe he has the best interests of the US at heart than do not. Only 16% of those polled believed he was trustworthy, against 64% who did not.Since becoming president, Trump has said the UK is “out of line” on trade, imposed a 10% tariff on all UK imports and a further 25% tariff on cars without warning Keir Starmer, and ordered Nato members to spend at least 5% of GDP on defence.Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world but to face forwardRead moreHis vice-president, JD Vance, also claimed at a conference in Munich in February that “in Britain and across Europe, free speech is in retreat”, and met leaders of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party.Separately,research by a leading thinktankhas found that a majority of UK voters want the government to concentrate on rebuilding trade ties with the EU over forging a new economic deal with the US.Commissioned by the internationalist thinktank Best for Britain, the research found that 53% of voters now believe a closer relationship with the EU will have a positive effect on the UK economy, against just 13% who said the effect would be negative. In turn, 68% believed better relations with the EU would boost UK-EU trade in a clearly positive way.The analysis shows how far the UK public has turned back in favour of the EU since the Brexit referendum nine years ago.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesThe ObserverTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

You and your colleagues for years have been the backbone of British Steel, and it’s really important that we recognise that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need to ensure British Steel is used in British infrastructure projects to boost local economies up and down the country.“That’s how you protect steelworkers’ jobs through the transition, and put UK steel-making on a firm footing for the future.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryHouse of CommonsHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House only confirmed that García was under the authority of the El Salvador government.The administration’s confirmation of García’s location was confirmed to the court by Michael G Kozak, who identified himself in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the state department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.The filing comes one day after a US government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide the US district judge Paula Xinis with any information about García’s whereabouts. Xinis issued an order after Friday’s hearing requiring the administration to disclose García’s “current physical location and custodial status” and “what steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.“It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego García is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,” Kozak’s statement said. “He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.”View image in fullscreenKilmar Abrego García in April 2025, in a photo provided by Casa, an immigrant advocacy organization.Photograph: APKozak’s statement did not address the judge’s latter requirements.Xinis was exasperated Friday with the government’s lack of information.“Where is he and under whose authority?” the judge asked in the hearing. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”The US supreme court on Thursdayupheldthe judge’s order to facilitate Abrego García’s return to the US, after Abrego García and his family filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of his summary deportation on 15 March.Abrego García has had a US work permit since 2019 but was stopped and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers on 12 March and questioned about alleged gang affiliation. He was deported on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador made up chiefly of Venezuelans whom the government accuses of being gang members and whom it assumed special powers to expel without a hearing.Abrego García’s wife, US citizen Jennifer Vásquez Sura, has not been able to speak to him since he was flown to his native El Salvador last month and imprisoned. She has beenrallying outside courtand has urged their supporters to keep fighting for him “and all the Kilmars out there whose stories are still waiting to be heard”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The notice also contained exemptions for additional electronics and components, such as memory cards, solar cells and semiconductors.The exclusions were applied retroactively to the products under the reciprocal tariffs beginning at 12.01am ET on 5 April,according tothe notice.“Importers may request a refund by filing a post summary correction for unliquidated entries, or by filing a protest for entries that have liquidated but where the liquidation is not final because the protest period has not expired,” the CBP said.On Saturday, Trump released astatementof “clarification of exceptions” pertaining to the previous evening’s announcement.Speaking toCNBC, Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at the Los Angeles-based financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said on Saturday: “This is the dream scenario for tech investors … Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game-changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.”Ives added: “I think ultimately big tech CEOs spoke loudly, and the White House had to understand and listen to the situation that this would have been Armageddon for big tech if it were implemented.”Similarly, Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics’ chief north America economist, said that the tariff exceptions “represent a partial de-escalation of president Trump’s trade war with China”.“There were even bigger winners in Asia, however, since the exemptions apply to all countries – not only China. At a stroke, 64% of US imports from Taiwan are now exempt from the 10% reciprocal tariff, 44% from Malaysia, and almost 30% from both Vietnam and Thailand. Ten to 12% of imports from India, Korea and Mexico will also now be exempt,” Ashworth added.“These exemptions will presumably not be the last either, with the success of Apple’s Tim Cook in getting its smartphones exempted likely to boost the lobbying by firms in other sectors.”Since Trump announced his tariffs, Apple was among the hardest-hit tech companies, as 90% of its iPhones arereportedly assembledin China.Invoking imagery associated with the strongest classification for hurricanes, Ives had previously described the Chinese tariffs as a “category 5 price storm for the US consumer”. He added in a note to investors: “The reality is it would take three years and $30bn in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process … For US consumers, the reality of a $1,000iPhonebeing one of the best-made consumer products on the planet would disappear.”According to analysts at the investment bank UBS, costs of iPhones would rise exponentially under Trump’s Chinese tariffs. The price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max (with 256GB of storage) could rise by 79% from $1,199 (£915) to about $2,150 (£1,600), the Guardianreportedearlier.In attempts to mitigate the blow of Trump’s tariffs, Apple reportedlycharteredcargo flights to transport iPhones from its Indian factories, with Reuters reporting the company having flown 600 tons of iPhones – or approximately 1.5m devices – to the US since March.Meanwhile, China’s Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) announced that the country’s “retaliatory” tariffs on US imports were limited to chips made in the US. Chips manufactured in Taiwan and South Korea remain unaffected.According to the CSIA, the “country of origin” for integrated circuits would be determined by the location of the manufacturing facility, not the final packaging or design location, CGTNreported. In other words, US chipmakers that outsource manufacturing to other parts of the world are exempt from China’s “retaliatory” tariffs.The latest announcement from the CSIA came as China slapped 125% tariffs on US productson Fridayas part of the latest trade-war escalation between the two trade giants.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsChinaTrump administrationTariffsUS politicsiPhoneApplenewsShareReuse this content"

The poster, which was reviewed by the Guardian as well, alleged that investigators had probable cause to arrest a 51-year-old man identified as Carlos Garcia – whose last known address is in the Bronx – on a count of sexual misconduct of a dead human body.Gothamist, citing police, also reported that the man identified in the wanted poster as Garcia could be seen on surveillance footage taking items from the pockets of the dead person before violating the corpse and fleeing.View image in fullscreenSuspect whom police allege robbed the corpse on the New York subway.Photograph: New York police departmentThat attack marked the second time the dead person – who was described as a man – had been stolen from in less than an hour. At about 10.48pm on Tuesday, police said a woman approached the late man, removed unspecified property from him and then left.Police released surveillance images of a suspect in that initial robbery, which showed a woman wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt, black pants and a black baseball cap.A police spokesperson would not comment on the allegations of the wanted poster first reported on by Gothamist and later seen by the Guardian.Another official on Saturday morning said there had not been any arrests made in the case. Police said anyone with useful information can submit it to New York City’sCrimestopperswebsite.Police said it appeared the victim had died of natural causes before both crimes.Wednesday morning’s case of necrophilia on the subway not only provided a graphically documented instance of a sexual disorder psychiatrists assume to be among the rarest. It also reignited a discussion about the safety of theNew YorkCity subway system that in some quarters is ongoing.Statistics generally show violence on the subway is relatively rare, though high-profile cases have the tendency to unnerve the public.For instance, in December, a 57-year-old woman namedDebrina Kawamdied after being set on fire while sleeping on a train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn. Days later, 45-year-old Joseph Lynskey was pushed in front of an oncoming train at Manhattan’s 18th Street station but survived.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

But the March dip may be simply an early warning of a bigger fall in the summer, because tourists typically book holidays months in advance.“Once we get into July, August, September, most of those trips will have been booked,” said David Edwards, founder of the Scattered Clouds travel consultancy.“But if there is less global trade, there will be less international business travel. Business travel is booked with a much shorter lead time so if there is uncertainty, business travel could take a swifter hit.”Spring is difficult for travel companies to analyse because Easter moves in the calendar. So could the comparative drop simply be the effect of the Easter school holidays falling in March 2024? It seems unlikely, Edwards said, because the figures from the USNational Travel and Tourism Officeshow an even bigger drop, of 16%, compared with March 2019 when Easter was on 21 April and Trump was nearing the end of his first term.Travellers from other countries also seemed to avoid the US in March – visitors from western Europe who stayed at least one night in the US were down 17% in March, year-on-year. German visitors were down 28.2% and Spanish ones down 24.6% compared with 2024. Overall, global travel to the US was down 11.6%. UK residents make up the largest number of overseas visitors to the US, with 3.9 million a year.View image in fullscreenThere are concerns that Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric is making tourists feel less welcome in the US.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesTTG, the travel industry magazine, published a poll last week showing that two-thirds of travel agents it contacted believed there had been a downturn in bookings, while only 12% of operators said their business had not been affected. Demand for hotel rooms in the US may also be falling. Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality ­analytics at CoStar, which tracks hotel room occupancy, said that the strong dollar had led to an 8% fall in visitors in 2024.“So now with the rhetoric that’s going on, I’m super worried that we’re going to continue to see travel numbers below 2019, maybe even decelerating from 2024,” he said. “Saying ‘you’re cheating us, you have a ­surplus, so we’re going to put a ­tariff on you’ – that rhetoric is not very welcoming.”Research by VisitBritain in 2022 showed that international ­travellers ranked“destination is a ­welcoming place to visit”as the second most important factor in choosing a holiday.View image in fullscreenBritish backpacker Rebecca Burke was locked up for nearly three weeks by US immigration officials.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The ObserverAfter publicity around deportations of tourists, including Germans and Australians, the UK and German governments have updated their travel advice to warn citizens of the risk. The incidents may also harm the appeal of the 2026 World Cup – currently due to take place in the US, Canada and Mexico, with the later knockout stages entirely in the US – and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, Freitag said.“Next year will be very big … If I’m a German father with two boys and I want to show them the World Cup, am I really going to spend $1,000 a pop on an airfare, plus hotel, plus the ticket, if there’s even a remote chance that I will not be able to make it into the country? I’m not going to take that risk. Not everyone will think that, but probably some people will.”Clare Collins, co-founder and chief operations officer for CT Business Travel, said that she expected there would be a decline in leisure travel to the US in the summer, but had not yet seen an impact on business travel.“We’re not seeing any dramatic effects yet for business travel, but that could change in two weeks,” she said. “I think [in] the long-term leisure market, people will choose to spend their money elsewhere.”If the March dip turns into a major fall in travellers from the UK, some airlines may start cutting routes, Edwards said, and that could have an impact on the British economy.The UK travel industry recovered from the Covid pandemic mostly because American tourists flocked to Europe, buoyed by a strong dollar that made hotels more affordable in London and Paris.“Europeans may be thinking ‘I’m not so sure that the US is a welcoming place to visit’,” Edwards said. “Equally, it might be that Americans are thinking ‘how welcome would I be if I go to Europe this year?’”Explore more on these topicsTravelThe ObserverUS politicsDonald TrumpImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

The story was sometimes played down, sometimes cheered but rarely seriously questioned – even amid warnings of price rises, recession and cratering investments, especially precious 401(k) retirement accounts.The most popular conservative news source in the United States is Fox News, which has amuch larger audiencethan CNN and the leftwing MSNBC network. Its hosts, such as Sean Hannity and Jesse Watters, consistently praise Trumpand bolsterhisinaccurate claims.But Fox News has faced new competition from Newsmax and One American News Network (OANN), networks that positioned themselves as even more reliable Trump supporters. The Wall Street Journal, which has the same owner as Fox News, features a right-leaning opinion section, but also has done lengthy investigations intoTrumpandJoe Bidenand is a favorite among people in the financial sector.Rightwing commentators such as Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro also command a large audience through podcasts and social media.After Trump declared 2 April “liberation day” and announced that the country would on 5 April institute a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods and on 9 April start “reciprocal tariffs” on some of its largest trading partners, including a 34% tariff on imports from China and a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union,Hannity describedit as “a day that will be remembered as a turning point and the start, I hope for every American, of a new golden age”.China retaliated with a 34% tariff. Global stock markets fell sharply; the Dow Jones industrial average declined more than 2,000 points over the next two days.Economists and leaders of financial institutions said that the tariffsincreased the likelihoodof a recession and inflation. Most Republican lawmakers stood behind the president; a minority, like SenatorsTed CruzandRand Paul, expressed opposition and said the tariffs amounted to atax increasefor Americans.While Fox Business, a sibling network,had guestswhocriticized the tariffs, Fox News personalities told viewers nervous about their investments that everything would work out well. A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for an interview.“I don’t really care about my 401(k) today,”Jeanine Pirrosaid on 3 April on the show The Five. “We’ve got to have manufacturing in this country … and Donald Trump is the only one who could do it because he’s got the biggest consumer base in the world. He’s not afraid of anybody.”Despite the market upheaval, theFox Newscommentators were “in too deep” to break with Trump, said Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a leftwing advocacy group.“They have, for nearly a decade now, sold their audience on the sense thatDonald Trumpwould be a good president,” Gertz said 7 April. “Now he is single-handedly causing a worldwide market collapse,” but “they can’t abandon him”.Other conservative news organizations opted to focus on other issues. At one point on 8 April, the only story on tariffs on theOANN frontpageconcerned the former speaker of the US House of RepresentativesNancy Pelosiand her comments on tariffs in 1996.The network did interview Arthur Laffer, a conservative economist who Trump awarded thePresidential Medal of Freedom. Laffer said that if Trump kept the tariffs, he didn’t see how the country could avoid a recession, but he still “could not think of one person on Earth that I would prefer more to be president”.On 9 April at Newsmax, the headline of their main story read, “Trump: Tariffs Bring in $2 Billion a Day.”The actual number this month was about $200m,Reuters reported.“A lot of times it feels more like propaganda,” Polskin said of the cable networks’ coverage. “I find it all extremely alarming, the stock market and that consumers of rightwing media could be misled so egregiously.”Newsmax did not respond to the Guardian’s request for an interview.There are exceptions in the conservative media sphere.

He can try to blame the Fed, but the tariff blunder is his alone,” was the headline of arecent editorial.Their editorial pages have been “characterized through the years as sort of the bastion of conservatism”, said Rick Edmonds, media business analyst for the Poynter Institute. “They are not at all sympathetic to the tariff actions.”Shapiro, the rightwing pundit and a founder of the Daily Wire, devoted much of his podcasts after “liberation day” to scrutinizing thetariffs and questionedwhether they could actually bring manufacturers back to the United States.But Shapiro reassured listeners that he supported the president.“What exactly is this designed to do?” Shapiro said of the tariffs during a 3 April episode of his podcast. “It is predicated on a bad idea of how international trade works. I’ve said this a thousand times: this is not coming from a place of I want Trump to fail.”Shapiro called for Trump tofire Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser who reportedlyshaped the tariffs strategy. But, of course, it was Trump who instituted them.“In general, the rightwing media, they are like Republican politicians. They don’t want to cross Trump,” Edmonds said.Still,Aaron Rupar, a journalist who tracks speeches and interviews Trump and his officials give to conservative media, thought their coverage of the tariffs was “a little more honest” than their coverage of events like the January 6 attack on the Capitol or the trials Trump faced when he was out of office.“With financial data, it’s a little harder to gaslight people,” he said.Ultimately, hours after the reciprocal tariffs took effect, Trumpannounced a 90-day pauseon them, except for China, whose tariff he increased to 125%.“Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” the White House press secretary,Karoline Leavitt, saidafterwards, referring to Trump’s book. “You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here.”A day later, with stocks still down significantly from before “liberation day”, Ainsley Earhardt, a Fox News host,reiterated Leavitt’s point.“This is the art of the deal,” she said. “This shows how strong our president is.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsFox NewsDonald TrumpFar right (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump’s trade retreat sows doubtsCallum Jonesin New YorkNothing is certain under this president – as seen in the inconsistent implementation of tariffs. And it has a longer-term economic costSat 12 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 02.53 EDTShareMinutes after Donald Trumpunveiled a climbdown on tariffs, softening an extraordinary US attack on trade from much of the world, his press secretary scolded reporters at the White House.“Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” said Karoline Leavitt, referring to the 1987 bestseller which laid the foundations of the president’s reputation as a consummate dealmaker.Outside the administration, Wednesday’s 90-day pause of vast tariffs on dozens of countries – the latest bewildering reversal on tariffs since he took office, coming as his deputies repeatedly swore the levies were here to stay – conjured up a different fable.“Really, like the boy who cried wolf, you can only do this so many times,” said John Cochrane, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. “It really does piss people off.“These tariffs are an answer in search of a question,” said Cochrane. “It always comes down to tariffs, and then the reasons for them keep changing.”Trump and his officials have long put forward a consistent, but contradictory, case for high tariffs. They will lure an influx of manufacturers to set up plants in the US, according to the administration while at the same time enabling the US to tax the world, not its citizens and prompting a stream of countries to strike new deals with Washington and eliminate US trade deficits – the gap between what it imports and exports – with other leading economies. Economists can’t see this working.“I think the Trump administration is floundering,” said Simon Johnson, a Nobel prize-winning economist and professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. “They know they’ve got an issue that grabs attention … They don’t know the endgame they want.”Nor has the implementation of the slated tariffs been consistent. Officials who had spent days explaining how this stunning wave of tariffs would create millions of US jobs and raise trillions of dollars were sent out to explain why its part-reversal was, in fact, a shrewd masterstroke – billed by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, as part of “the greatest economic master strategy from an American president” in history.Even Trump struggled to claim this move was part of a carefully crafted plan. People “were getting yippy”, he said, when asked why he ordered the pause. He later acknowledged “transition problems”, as companies and consumers struggled to keep up with developments.Just 10 days ago, the president – on what he claimed would go down as “one of the most important days” in US history – announced a baseline tariff of 10% on most of his country’s imports, and significantly higher tariffs on specific nations. 2 April 2025 would forever be remembered as “liberation day”, according to Trump and his aides.Stock markets tanked, US government bond markets endured a sharp sell-off, and even some of Trump’s allies warned of widespread disruption. But he imposed the 10% tariff anyway, insisting that he would not be moved.On Wednesday, hours after the US introduced the higher tariff rates on about 60 markets, Trump abruptly changed tack. For 90 days, he said, these markets – including the EU (20%), Japan (24%) and the Falkland Islands (41%) – would face the blanket 10% rate, after all. Only China, which hit back hard with its own tariffs on US exports, would face a targeted US tariff of 145%.View image in fullscreenA stock ticker shows the Dow trending down in New York on Thursday.Photograph: Sarah Yenesel/EPAWhile markets briefly surged back, confusion and uncertainty loomed large. “I think the probability of an across-the-board cataclysm has receded,” said Johnson. “Until the next time Mr Trump speaks publicly.”Nothing is certain under this president. Fromlongstanding geopolitical relationshipstoconstitutional term limits, he has little time for established norms. Erratic policymaking is a feature, not a bug, of his administration.Trump has forged this uncertainty, and uses it as a short-term political tool – leaving the world to hang on his every word, be it uttered in the Oval Office, or posted on his social network. But it has a longer-term economic cost, too.“It used to be that a country could sign a trade agreement and have fair confidence that that meant that there’d be free trade,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel prize-winning economist and professor at Columbia University. “With Trump, no confidence. It’s added a permanent level of uncertainty into all cross-border transactions.”Sure, this week’s pause removes the imminent danger of “complete Covid-level and more supply chain chaos”, said Cochrane. “You’re not going to have that immediate effect. But you’re certainly going to have the chilling effect that nobody knows what’s coming next.”Facing the threat of higher prices as a result of tariffs, some consumers hunker down and curb their spending. Others make bigger purchases now, earlier than planned, for fear of paying more next week, or month.Johnson, for example, went out and bought a car this week for his daughter, who did not need it for another two months. Uncertainty can be “an inducement to buy consumer durables”, he said. “But from a business investment perspective, it is probably a delaying factor.”How many global executives are prepared to commission a new factory, and fund months, if not years, of construction, in a market where the economic landscape shifts drastically from one week to the next?For now, at least, one thing firms can count on is spiraling tensions between the world’s two largest economies. After a dramatic escalation in recent days, the US is now charging a tariff of 145% on Chinese exports, and China is charging a tariff of 125% on US exports.“We are very interdependent on China – right through our whole supply chain,” Stiglitz, former chief economist of the World Bank and chair of the US Council of Economic Advisers, said of the US. “Doubling the cost of every input is going to mean the cost of our goods are going to go up.”Chinese-manufactured finished products, from consumer goods to electronics, are likely to be hit, noted Cochrane – but key parts and tools for other goods will also be affected. “Everything at Walmart is going to double as a result of Trump’s tariffs on China,” he said.View image in fullscreenA container ship port in Shenzhen, China, on Friday.Photograph: Cheng Xin/Getty ImagesSuch expectations have heightened fears of “stagflation”, an unpalatable economic cocktail of both stagnant growth and high inflation. The US Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, haswarnedin recent weeks of “higher inflation and slower growth”, while the JPMorgan Chase boss, Jamie Dimon, reported that Trump’s tariffs have prompted “many” to consider “a greater probability” of recession.“We may be facing inflationary pressures and – at the same time because of the shortage of key components, with increased prices – we also may be facing unemployment,” Stiglitz said. “There’s a real risk of stagflation.”That is “particularly true” if Fed policymakers respond to inflation as they typically do, and raise interest rates, he said. “And particularly true if Americans see, as they are seeing, chaos. There’s a lack of confidence. And particularly, as the US is facing, this additional problem of mass government layoffs, chaotically done, in critical institutions.”There is a further risk, he added, that Trump – having built an economic strategy around tariffs on goods – overlooks industries at the heart of the US economy built around services,from finance and advertising to technology.“He doesn’t understand that we are a service-sector economy,” said Stiglitz. “We’re not in the 1950s. Service sector exports for the United States are particularly important. And he has just taken actions which are killing two of the important service sectors of the United States.”Tensions with allies, like Canada, and detentions of tourists have “sent a chill” through the international tourism market, while student visacancellationsare “killing our universities”, he said. “He’s hellbent on destroying two of the most important service export sectors.”As the economic impact of his trade war with China becomes clear, Trump now wants to strike agreements with an array of other countries, halting those tariffs until July.Such deadlines only work if people believe they are true. This administration, asCanada and Mexico know well, has a habit of scuffing its lines in the sand.High tariffs would put the US on “a whole new prosperous path”, Trump claimed –despite the doubts of many economists– in his “liberation day” address. He held firm for a week, before announcing a three-month detour.What happens next? Trump, who built and rebuilt his political career on a promise to make America great again, has opted to make America wait, again.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsThe ObserverDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Surely it is now or never.Rory McIlroy will take a lead into the closing round of the Masters for the first time since 2011. That sentence barely does justice to a Saturday of high drama at Augusta National where McIlroy created history then threatened to feature in his own Shakespearean tragedy once more before re-establishing daylight between himself and the field. That sentence barely does justice, either, to what McIlroy is on the verge of. We are now in the position of fearing what on earth the impact will be on him should he not prevail.The stresses, strains, pressure and pains associated with McIlroy’s quest to win a career grand slam were perfectly obvious on day three in Georgia. Yet by the end of it, McIlroy stood tall. Whisper it, but he looks to have comprehensively conquered what demons this major has tended to throw in his way. Abundantly clear, too, was the scale of support McIlroy has at Augusta. There must be people in the galleries who do not want him to don a Green Jacket, it is just that you cannot hear any of them.The Masters 2025: day three updates from Augusta – liveRead moreMcIlroy’s second successive 66 means that at 12 under par, he has two shots to spare overBryson DeChambeau. Corey Conners is two further back. An added layer of poetry here is provided by DeChambeau’s presence. It was DeChambeau who broke McIlroy’s heart at the US Open last year. McIlroy will take nothing for granted – and his focus has been so striking this week – but the potential to level that score with DeChambeau cannot be ignored. This has scope to be a Masters conclusion for the ages. In the third day’s final act, DeChambeau holed out from 16 yards and off the 18th green to complete his 69.Those who insist the Masters only gets under way on the back nine on Sunday have it badly wrong. The scale of sporting drama on Saturday was from the finest of scriptwriters. McIlroy opened with five threes in a row, the first time that had ever been done in a Masters round. He added a sixth for good measure. McIlroy was dominant; at 2.53pm, having chipped in for an eagle from behind the 2nd green, he snatched the tournament lead for the first time in this edition. In a stretch of 13 holes, McIlroy was to go from seven adrift of the lead to the owner of that by two.McIlroy’s advantage was four as he strode from the 8th tee – 11 played seven under – as DeChambeau bogeyed the 7th. This felt straightforward. Too straightforward.View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau will play alongside Rory McIlroy in the final round.Photograph: David Cannon/Getty ImagesMcIlroy’s dropped shot at the 8th was a ragged one. Conners, his playing partner, produced stunning birdies at the 9th and 10th. McIlroy three putted the latter. His leeway was now just one. The McIlroy of old may have wobbled. The McIlroy of cliche would be influenced by scar tissue. Instead, this version of the 35-year-old birdied the 13th and played a glorious second to the par five 15th. With a 6ft eagle putt converted, McIlroy was a quartet of strokes ahead once again.DeChambeau ramped up the crowd either side of a tap-in birdie at the 16th. The Californian looked ready to chase McIlroy down the penultimate hole. McIlroy had 10ft for birdie there, his chance missing to the left. The Northern Irishman was fortunate at the last, his drive cracked right before rebounding onto safe ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Swede is six under after a 69. Åberg had the opportunity to put further pressure on those above him at the last but pushed his birdie putt. Should he fall one shot short here, that moment will be a point of reference. Åberg, a Ryder Cup team-mate of McIlroy, knows all about the leader’s strength. “I think when he plays his best golf, it’s hard to catch him,” Åberg said. “I don’t think there’s a lot of guys in this world that can catch him when he plays at his best. You can just tell that he trusts his game so much, that knowing that at any time he can make six birdies in a row.He can hit it as high as anyone and he can stop it on a dime. He knows that and he definitely uses that to his advantage.”Scottie Scheffler failed to make expected headway, a 72 leaving him at five under. Patrick Reed did, his 69 also moving him to a shot ahead of the world No 1. Discount Reed, a former Masters champion, at your peril. Another past winner, Zach Johnson, lurks at four under after a 66. The Open and US PGA champion Xander Schauffele sits on the same aggregate as Johnson. Jason Day’s 71 nudged him to minus five. Shane Lowry bogeyed the last for an identical position. Tyrrell Hatton’s love-hate relationship with Augusta National is again heading for the divorce courts.Amid the chaos, Min Woo Lee was handed a one-shot penalty after it was decided he caused his ball to move – and not when hitting a golf shot – on the 13th fairway. Jordan Spieth complained about mud balls, a theme the Masters organisers would probably rather all of us ignore. Augusta National announced a record prize fund for this year’s tournament, meaning $4.2m will be bestowed on the winner. McIlroy stopped caring about the money long ago.He admitted he barely slept before a Sawgrass playoff in March, JJ Spaun eventually seen off as the Players Championship was claimed. More tossing and turning awaits. But it could be worth it. My goodness, it could be worth it.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersThe ObserverRory McIlroyBryson DeChambeauPGA TourEuropean TourUS sportsGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a harsh punishment for an error made by the team rather than drivers.In the end the gap at the Sakhir Circuit over the single lap was not quite as cavernous as practice had suggested, with Russell only a tenth and a half back. However, the only driver who has still managed to stay in touch with McLaren in championship terms, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who won at thelast round in Japanwhere conditions favoured him, was left floundering in the desert heat in seventh.Red Bull made a setup change going into qualifying but Verstappen was far from happy with the result and he was fighting it to try and wrestle out a decent lap, struggling with the understeer he dislikes. “There’s something really wrong with the car,” he told the team. Later he added that his brakes were “terrible”.TheMcLarenalso remains tricky in qualifying, a little unstable in the rear which can be testing over a single lap on low fuel but is at its best in race pace, where the ease with which it works the tyres lends it even more of an advantage.Having been on top in every practice session and now qualifying, the prospects for how well it might run on Sunday are daunting indeed. The team having claimed their first pole in Bahrain are now in every position to convert it to their debut win at the circuit.“I felt confident out there pretty much all weekend,” said Piastri. “The others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted but I still delivered the laps when it mattered, which is the most important thing.”Norris, however, was unsurprisingly disappointed with his final run, dropping crucial time in the first sector that has left him with a huge challenge on Sunday while his teammate and title rival can make hay with pole. “No idea what happened, just not quick enough,” a clearly unhappy Norris said.The British driver has conceded recently that there are certain phases the car goes through with which he is not entirely comfortable, where he feels it is not responding as predictably as he would hope, which he and the team had been looking to address this weekend. It is clearly not quite there yet as Piastri very much had the edge at the Sakhir Circuit.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri saw off the challenge of George Russell, who was later given a one-place grid penalty, to take pole position at the Bahrain GP.Photograph: Darko Bandić/APMcLaren had expected to run well in Bahrain, where they had shown such promise in testing and in the heat and high degradation surface that suits the MCL39 so well, with the circuit offering very little grip to sit uncomfortably alongside its brutal tyre wear. This will induce variables on Sunday that will be a world away from the single-stop procession in Japan last weekend.Qualifying will not decide all then but whether anyone can come close enough to Piastri to involve him in a fight is a different question altogether. Norris, in contrast, must hope at best to move through the field and claim a podium place.Thus far Verstappen has clung on to McLaren with great determination and grit, currently trailing Norris by only one point in the championship, with Piastri 13 points down in third. But while the world champion pulled off a coup to win in Suzuka, the limitations of the Red Bull were once more exposed in Bahrain, indicating quite how far they have yet to go.Equally, just as the McLaren might expect even more in the race, the Red Bull fell away in similar hot, high-degradation conditions at the opening two rounds in Australia and Japan and may well be similarly under the cosh on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 3-0 win over Real Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final will live forever; the return is eagerly awaited on Wednesday.It was always likely to be lower-key here, Mikel Arteta making five changes to his team and watching them labour. The blood and thunder of the Madrid tie was missing; the do-or-die imperatives. It was a slog for Arsenal and as the hour mark approached, Arteta knew he had to do something. He readied three stellar substitutes – Myles Lewis-Skelly, Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka.Arsenal v Brentford: Premier League – liveRead morePerhaps, it was their presence on the touchline that provided the inspiration. Or maybe it was just that Declan Rice is having the week of his life. His two free-kick goals against Madrid had even got the royal seal of approval, Prince William backing him to take over as England’s set-piece taker. Either way, Arsenal were in front before Arteta could make the triple change.David Raya claimed aBrentfordcorner and when he threw out to Rice, the midfielder was just outside his own area. What followed was a devastating run to the edge of the Brentford box, Rice getting into that lengthy stride before drawing the chasing defender, Yoane Wissa, and playing in the overlapping Thomas Partey, who did the rest.Arsenal could not see it through. On the balance of the chances, they deserved to win but not by dint of the entertainment they provided or the intensity they brought. Brentford have been impressive on their travels in recent weeks, winning five of their previous six matches, even if the one before this had been the defeat at Newcastle. It would go down as their latest fine result away from the Gtech Stadium.Brentford do not have anything to distract them. Thomas Frank was entitled to say his team were “excellent defensively” and Wissa was the hero, punishing Arsenal when they failed to defend properly after clearing a corner. They were exposed when Bryan Mbeumo released the substitute, Michael Kayode, up the right and his cross picked out Nathan Collins, who headed back from the far post. Wissa was alive to the bounce, spinning to lash home his 15th goal of thePremier Leagueseason.Arsenal would finish with 10 men, Jorginho departing in the 85th minute after a heavy fall that looked to wind him; Arteta had already made his five changes. One of them was to remove Partey, who the manager said had “felt something so we didn’t want to take any risks”. Arteta was asked whether Partey would be OK for the second leg against Madrid. “We don’t know,” he replied. “The doctors will check him.”The Arsenal manager was desperate to avoid any injuries and it was why he reacted so explosively to Christian Nørgaard’s scissors-style foul on Gabriel Martinelli in the 28th minute, for which the Brentford captain was booked. Arteta ranted at the fourth official and Martinelli would later describe it as a potential leg-breaker. Nørgaard attempted to apologise in the tunnel at half-time only for Martinelli to wave him away. “I thought it was a strong yellow but it was yellow,” Frank said.View image in fullscreenThomas Partey’s shot beats Mark Flekken to give Arsenal the lead.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAArteta was always going to rotate; Jurrien Timber and Mikel Merino were also used only as substitutes. And if there were huge cheers for Rice at the outset, the Arsenal support were otherwise subdued. “The atmosphere was different to Tuesday, that’s for sure,” Arteta said. “I don’t know if it [the Madrid tie] was playing in the back of the [minds of the] crowd.”Arteta started with Partey at right-back, Kieran Tierney at left-back and Oleksandr Zinchenko as a No 8/No 10. There was a surge of excitement on 26 minutes when Tierney flicked home a fine header from an Ethan Nwaneri cross but he was clearly in an offside position, which was confirmed by the VAR.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was the sum total of their attacking threat before the interval. William Saliba released Martinelli with a fizzed ball over the top towards the end of the first half, which the Arsenal winger killed with a good first touch and Brentford were grateful to Ajer for a saving tackle.The visitors were comfortable and so the nature of the concession had to gall Frank. It was not a part of his defensive plan to be caught out on an end-to-end counter. Rice just had to be the driver of it, leaving Mikkel Damsgaard in his wake but credit, as well, to Partey for his support run.Saka had Arsenal’s best chance after Wissa’s equaliser, robbing Mark Flekken after the goalkeeper had taken a poor touch. Kayode, though, raced back to thwart him.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverArsenalBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Both then served lengthy bans, ruling them out for most of last season, after agreeing plea bargains that also included therapy for a gambling addiction.Juventus midfielder Fagioli – currently on loan at Fiorentina – was banned for seven months after admitting to betting on matches, while Newcastle’s Tonali received a longer suspension of 10 months as his bets also included his team’s games — at the time AC Milan.The duo are also named in the new investigation, along with Fagioli’s then-Juventus teammate McKennie and nine other current or formerSerie Aplayers, as well as Leeds defender Junior Firpo.There is no evidence that the other players ever gambled on soccer matches but their names emerged from depositions given by Tonali and Fagioli and analysis of their devices.The players are being investigated for using illegal platforms for online poker and betting on other sports. As such they do not risk a ban, but instead a maximum fine of €250 ($284) from Italian authorities.Tonali and Fagioli have also been accused of promoting those sites among their teammates and other soccer players.Fagioli said in a deposition: “I pointed out to [former Aston Villa forward Nicolò] Zaniolo illegal sites where he could make online bets, on roulette or poker … the organisers of the sites had told me that they would give me some advantages if I brought other bettors.”A message about Zaniolo found on Fagioli’s phone also said: “Bravo, capture him, work for me.”Explore more on these topicsFootballJuventusSerie AUSAGamblingUS sportsEuropean club footballShareReuse this content"

That assist was his 700th of the season – so, even if he doesn’t get another before Sunday’s end of the regular season, which would be his 70th game, he is assured of averaging no worse than 10.0 assists.The other players to average a triple-double for a full season: Russell Westbrook, Jokić’s current Denver teammate, andBasketballHall of Famer Oscar Robertson.Does Tom Thibodeau really run his players into the ground? The data says ... not exactlyRead moreWestbrook did it four times – 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 for Oklahoma City, as well as in 2020-21 for Washington – and Robertson did it in the 1961-62 season for Cincinnati.The assist that clinched it for Jokić came on a score by Christian Braun with about 52 seconds left in the first half. It was not originally credited; the boxscore was updated at halftime. Jokić wound up getting a triple-double for the game as well, his 34th of the season.Jokić – the Serbian star who has won three of the last fourNBAMVP awards and is a top candidate for that honor again this season along with Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander – has more triple-doubles this season than any other three players in the league combined. No other NBA player else entered Friday with more than 10 this season.This will be the first time Jokić averages double digits in assists. His previous career best was 2022-23, when he finished with 9.8 assists along with 24.5 points and 11.8 rebounds.“When you have a guy like Jokić, who creates so much offense for his teammates, everyone’s going to have really good looks if you don’t do the right things,” Minnesota coach Chris Finch said earlier this month.Jokić has also assured of finishing this season averaging a career-best in scoring and will likely end up with the second-best rebound average of his career as well. He’ll also set career-bests this season in three-pointers made and three-point percentage.Jokić needed 73 points in the season’s final two games – against the Grizzlies on Friday and the finale at Houston on Sunday – to push his scoring average to 30.0 for the season. If that happens, it would be the third 30-point triple-double average in NBA history; Westbrook and Robertson both did that once.Jokić has 164 regular-season triple-doubles for his career, second-most in NBA history behind Westbrook’s 203. Jokić is the second player in NBA history to have at least 30 triple-doubles in a season; the other is Westbrook, who has pulled that feat off three times.Explore more on these topicsNikola JokićDenver NuggetsMemphis GrizzliesNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The truism that the best have a crucial extra moment to work with runs through his decade in aManchester Cityshirt and was displayed in the strike crafted for Mateo Kovacic.Guardiola: Manchester City must be near perfect to make Champions LeagueRead moreEighty seconds into the second half, the 33-year-old received a Nico O’Reilly pass from the left, with threeCrystal Palacemen converging on him. All seemed to slow, as he swivelled and left them in a different postcode and laid off to Kovacic, who put City 3-2 ahead.Pep Guardiola said: “The performance of Kevin is what he has done for many, many years in many games. Unfortunately, he could not with injuries and surgery for 18 months, but he played fantastic. He helped us to break the momentum that wasn’t good. The goal and assist – he helped us a lot to win the game.”The lead came after falling two behind. Soon, the champions were two ahead. This was route one the Guardiola way. Ederson, in familiar mode, dropped a punt on to James McAtee’s toes, he rounded the charging-out Dean Henderson and finished. The relentless De Bruyne should have had a second assist. Popping up on the right, he skimmed across a ball Omar Marmoush should have buried, but Henderson saved.From 2-0 down to 5-2 takes City to fourth place, two points ahead of Newcastle, who have played two fewer games. ForDe Bruyne, who departs this summer, the focus is on Europe. “I want to go away with a Champions League for this team because they deserve it,” he said.Pre-kick-off, Guardiola’s selection seemed a curate’s egg. The positive was McAtee being handed a fullPremier Leaguedebut, but with no Savinho, Jack Grealish, Jérémy Doku (all substitutes) and Phil Foden (injured). The negative seemed a lack of width – and pace, Marmoush apart.The shape proved a narrow 4-2‑2-2 and you saw Guardiola’s thinking when Kovacic bounced the ball into a right channel for McAtee, but a left-foot effort plopped into Henderson’s hands.Weak was an apt characterisation, too, of City for Palace’s first-half goals, each being due to powderpuff defending. First, Daniel Muñoz found an acre of turf along the right – he tapped to Ismaïla Sarr, the cross removed Ederson, and Eberechi Eze turned home. Guardiola wanted offside but the semi-automated system – in play for a first time this weekend – ruled all fine.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze puts Crystal Palace in front.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesPalace’s second derived from a corner, again on the right. Adam Wharton swung this in with his left to curve at goal, and a host of defenders missed it – primarily Rúben Dias, who did nothing to prevent Chris Richards heading in.City were being schooled as if kids. Before scoring, Richards had tugged at Marmoush as the Egyptian pulled the trigger. Guardiola screamed for a penalty, Jarred Gillett ruled not, and VAR Peter Bankes decided against sending the referee to the monitor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a curled effort pinged the right post, a free-kick offered him a chance from a similar, central zone. The Belgian again aimed to Henderson’s right, and this time scored superbly.

Before Palace’s goal, he nodded the ball to Ilkay Gündogan who miskicked and Marmoush rammed past Henderson. Before this Eze again beat Ederson but this time the semi-automated offside ruled that Eze was offside by his left boot.A duff note for City was Ederson going off injured. But this was De Bruyne’s day and the surprise when O’Reilly struck the fifth – his first league goal – was that the man with the strawberry-blond hair was not involved.Oliver Glasner said he was right to remove Jean-Philippe Mateta at the break but had erred in how he replaced him. “The mistake was to change the system, not to make the sub,” said Palace’s manager.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverManchester CityCrystal PalaceKevin De Bruynematch reportsShareReuse this content"

He was understood to still have been undergoing tests on Saturday afternoon.‘Tainted victory’: Newcastle’s Saudi influence still divisive after successRead moreHowe had felt unwell for most of last week following Monday night’swin at Leicester. The previous Thursday he had undergone prolonged dental treatment and warned journalists attending the next day’s weekly press conference that they might struggle to understand him following a “day at the dentist”.In a statement released on Saturday afternoon afternoon Newcastle said the manager who led his players to last month’s Carabao Cup win over Liverpool at Wembley – the club’s first major piece of domestic silverware since 1955 – was “conscious, talking with his family and continuing to receive expert medical care”. The statement added that “everyone atNewcastle Unitedextends their best wishes to Eddie for a speedy recovery and further updates will follow in due course.”It leaves Jason Tindall, Howe’s long-serving assistant, in control against Ruben Amorim’s 13th-placed side at St James’ Park as Newcastle continue their push for Champions League qualification. Tindall took charge of the first match of Howe’s tenure – a 3-3 draw with Brentford in November 2021 – from the St James’ Park technical area after the manager tested positive for Covid and was forced to watch the game on television from his Tyneside hotel room.Tindall deputised for Howe at Friday’s press conference and expressed surprise at the absence of his workaholic friend. “It’s really unusual for Eddie not to be well enough to come to work,” he said before adding that, despite being bedridden and “really poorly”, Howe had phoned him “three or four times a day” to discuss preparations for Manchester United’s visit.Although they have a game in hand on their rivals for a top‑five finish, Newcastle dropped to seventh on Saturday. They are one point behind fifth-placed Aston Villa and behind sixth-placed Chelsea – who face Ipswich at Stamford Bridge on Sunday – on goal difference. After the Manchester United game, Newcastle host Crystal Palace on Wednesday night before travelling to Aston Villa next Saturday.Explore more on these topicsEddie HoweThe ObserverNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

It was only a year ago that Gary O’Neil seemed one of the brightest young managers in the Premier League, butby December it was over. This is how football is: when a blip becomes a slump becomes a spiral, the only solution is the sacrifice of the manager. It often works: Wolves have improved dramatically under Vítor Pereira and, while they may not yet be mathematically safe from relegation, they surely soon will be.The life of man,the folk carol reminds us, is but a span; the life of a manager is even shorter (but a spanager?). O’Neil had replaced Scott Parker at Bournemouth four games into 2022-23, after their9-0 defeat by Liverpool, and had kept them up comfortably, only to be jettisoned for Andoni Iraola. He took over Wolves less than a week before last season began and had them in the top half in March.Potter’s lack of impact at West Ham is all down to disastrous succession plan | Jacob SteinbergRead moreBut form collapsed last season after anFA Cup quarter-final defeat by Coventryand they finished 14th. When O’Neil wasdismissed in December,Wolves lay second-bottom, five points from the last safe spot, having won three of his final 26 league games.He had begun almost visibly to unravel, the intense gaze developing an unnerving wildness as he discussed another video assistant referee outrage. There was a period when it felt the main justification for keeping VAR was as a morally dubious psychological experiment in just how far one man could be pushed, O’Neil as a modern-day Job but with poverty and boils replaced by Howard Webb and inconsistent interpretations of what it is to be interfering.How could he pick up 1.24 points per game in the first 62 Premier League games of his managerial career and then crash to 0.54 points per game in their next 26? It’s not just O’Neil; plenty of other managers have followed a similar trajectory. Is it just regression to the mean, as those who deny the phenomenon of the new-manager bounce would claim?Can it really just be confidence, that once opposing sides start to work a manager out and results begin to falter, players lose faith and need a new messiah? This is such a familiar phenomenon, it’s perhaps overlooked how strange it is, the way it’s almost accepted in the lower reaches of the Premier League that after 18 months or so a manager’s usefulness is somehow spent and he must be replaced. Perhaps it is even true. Perhaps there is a limit to how many defeats, how much pressure, any one manager can take. Perhaps players need the change to break the routine.View image in fullscreenGary O’Neil shows his frustration on the Molineux touchline against Manchester City in October.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesFor Wolves, replacing O’Neil was the only realistic step afterlosing at home to Ipswichin a game when their players lost all discipline, with Rayan Aït-Nouri sent off during a post-match confrontation when Matheus Cunha stole a pair of glasses from a member of the opposing staff.As Southampton and Leicester have shown, while it may be straightforward enough to work out when a manager has to be jettisoned, finding the right replacement is far harder. While the huge gulf that exists between the Premier League and the Championship is clearly a major factor, none of what has happened in the past four months has been inevitable.In fairness, Ivan Juric, appointed four days after Pereira, had an almost impossible task, one he took on with an admirably sanguine attitude. As he gave detailed instructions to his substitutesat Tottenham last Sundaywith his side 2-0 down and about to be relegated, it was possible to believe he had somehow managed to miss Southampton’s results for the previous months. But fair play for the seriousness with which he took the task of trying to avert the earliest relegation in Premier League history.Leicester’s decision to turn to Ruud van Nistelrooyat the end of November, though, looks deeply flawed. However unpopular Steve Cooper was, with his Nottingham Forest connections and the perception he played negative football, under him Leicester were not losing eight successive home games without scoring; the last time they scored a home goal O’Neil was still manager of Wolves and Russell Martin was still at Southampton.Wolves, though, do seem to have found the right man in Pereira. They go into Sunday’s game at home to Tottenham having taken 23 points from 15 games under him. They began the weekend 12 points clear of the drop zone, having gained 20 on Leicester, 18 on Southampton and 15 on Ipswich in just over three months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPereira’s first task, after that volcanic ending against Ipswich, was to restore calm. It helps that there is a worldliness to him, having coached in eight countries, and that he has historically been the volatile one. This was not the earnest O’Neil with his neat haircut appealing for order, it was somebody familiar with chaos, somebody who has at times been its agent. When you have returned to Fenerbahce after taking them to court, or used your mother‑in‑law’s health as an excuse to quit Corinthians only to take over at Flamengo a month later, some post‑match argy-bargy and spectacle theft probably does not feel that significant.View image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen (left) has eased the goalscoring burden on Matheus Cunha.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockHe has been very astute in getting fans on board, not just in what he has said, his talk of the great Wolves family, but in visiting pubs, drinking pints and eating pies. At the same time, Wolves look better organised and are conceding fewer. Cunha has scored some vital goals and in his absence Jørgen Strand Larsen, a very different type of forward, has stepped up with four goals in three games.But those are details. The most important aspect is the mood Pereira has created, partly through his personality, partly through well-chosen gimmicks and partly through his organisational capacity. That will change at some point, perhaps in a few months, perhaps in a few years. He will be ousted, and the next messiah will come in.That is how football is. The life of managers is as grass, they flourish like a flower of the field; the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.Explore more on these topicsWolverhampton WanderersThe ObservercommentShareReuse this content"

Roberto Piccoli had the chance to pull Cagliari level when he found himself one-on-one with the Inter keeper Yann Sommer. However, the Swiss reacted swiftly, parrying the effort away.Seconds later, Martínez doubled Inter’s lead in the 26th minute, timing a perfectly weighted pass to break through the Cagliari defence before delicately chipping Elia Caprile, who seemed to hesitate too long before rushing out.Martínez could have made it a third goal before the break but his acrobatic bicycle attempt went just wide of the post.Cagliari pulled one back three minutes into the second half when Piccoli was left unmarked and sent a header into the ground that bounced into the top left corner.The visitors’ momentum was punctured in the 55th minute, however, when Inter’s Bisseck rose highest at a corner to head their third and effectively seal the match. Piccoli came agonisingly close to cutting the deficit for the visitors late in the match, his close-range shot heading goalwards, only for the Inter defender Stefan de Vrij to stretch and deftly nod the ball over the bar.First-half goals by Teun Koopmeiners and Kenan Yildiz helpedJuventusto a 2-1 win at home against relegation-threatenedLecceas Igor Tudor remains unbeaten as the victors’ coach.Koopmeiners gave Juventus the lead after two minutes, scoring with a low strike inside the far post, and Yildiz doubled the advantage after the half-hour mark as he capitalised on a brilliant team play.Lecce pulled a goal back in the 87th minute through Federico Baschirotto, who scored with a powerful header following a free-kick.Juventus moved provisionally up to third on 59 points from 32 games.

A Murillo mistake gave Everton victory in stoppage time as the pressure started to show on Forest.The Brazil centre-back lost the ball just inside theEvertonhalf, allowing Dwight McNeil to breakaway and slip in Abdoulaye Doucouré to finish the job in the 94th minute. The visitors deserved the win against a side who did not live up to their lofty position of third place.Watkins fires Aston Villa into top five despite penalty pain at SouthamptonRead moreIn many ways, it was surprising it took Everton, who have lost twice in 13Premier Leaguegames under David Moyes, so long to find a goal. They had dominated from the early stages and offered little to Forest in return. Neither Forest nor Everton are used to enjoying the majority of possession, making an intriguing spectacle when such sides meet. The hosts stuck to their usual plan of foregoing use of the ball, waiting to play on the counter, but rarely threatened.“Disappointed with the performance,” Nuno Espírito Santo said. “We were not comfortable, we didn’t play good. The game didn’t flow, everything created a lot of problems to us. They win the duels, second balls, they keep putting us under pressure. In terms of offensive game, we didn’t create too much.”There is an expectation inside and outside Nottingham that Champions League football will come here next season. Such grandiose ambitions have brought tension to the run-in as nerves jangle at the prospect of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich rocking up.The former Arsenal sporting director Edu was in the directors’ box as he is set to take up a role in Evangelos Marinakis’s multi-club group. That shows the growing ambition, but there is little experience on the pitch of battles for Europe.Everton created a few half-chances that Iliman Ndiaye failed to threaten Matz Sels with as the opening half-hour passed without major incident, bar the odd foul or two. After the break, the Senegal forward got the wrong side of Neco Williams, allowing a one-on-one chance with Sels but the goalkeeper held firm.Forest were boosted by the return of Chris Wood from injury, giving them a focal point in attack they lacked in last Saturdaysdefeat by Aston Villa, although he did not look fully fit and did not have a chance to add to his 18 goals. As a team chasing Champions League football against one whose season is effectively over, it felt like Forest should be offering greater impetus, but failed to do so.View image in fullscreenChris Wood struggled to make an impression on his return from injury.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesNuno’s potential solution was to send Anthony Elanga on for Jota Silva close to the hour mark. It lifted the mood of the crowd whose only vague excitement before that were two Callum Hudson-Odoi shots easily saved by Jordan Pickford.If one team was to get an opener, it seemed it would be Everton who looked dangerous from set pieces, but Forest had previously kept four clean sheets in four home games. Doucouré had a chance at the back post, but that was blocked by a diving Williams.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel was kept busy and he twice stopped Harry Kane and also blocked Michael Olise’s point-blank effort in the 40th minute.Dortmund, who did not have an effort on target in the first half, silenced the home crowd three minutes after the restart when Maximilian Beier was left unmarked at the far post to head in the opener.“Until the first goal ... we created chances and the game was more or less positive for us,” Bayern’s coach, Vincent Kompany, said. “After the first goal it became a cup game. I would buy a ticket to watch a game like this but as a coach you want a little bit more control.

They are paying the price for the errors made in the transfer market by their former technical director Tim Steidten. They have an ageing, unbalanced squad and it is not going to be easy for Kyle Macaulay, who has been in charge of recruitment sinceSteidten’s departure two months ago, to fix everything this summer.Patience is required. Money has been wasted on players with no resale value, leaving the club in an awkward spot. Finances are tight and a spending spree is unlikely. West Ham, who deserve a kicking for their failure to build on three consecutive seasons in Europe under David Moyes, could be waiting a while before they are able to push for a top-six finish again.West Ham’s Paquetá in limbo as spot-fixing hearing adjourned until summerRead moreThe success of the Moyes era has faded. West Ham were right to part company with the Scot last summer but the succession plan was a disaster.Julen Lopetegui was the wrong choice as managerand the positive PR around Steidten was never matched by the German’s output. Dysfunction, though, is nothing new to the majority shareholder, David Sullivan. A familiar criticism is that his desire to succeed is often compromised by his taking advice from the wrong people.This is what Graham Potter walked into when hereplaced Lopetegui in January. Relegation has never seemed a realistic possibility, which is mainly down to the three promoted sides being out of their depth, but the season has still been a write-off. Memorable performances have been few and far between, the mood in the stands has drifted into apathy and it has been difficult for Potter to do much more than paper over the cracks.The former Chelsea manager’s functional football is born of necessity. Potter has had to start from the back, devoting attention to tightening a defence that leaked goals for fun under Lopetegui, while accepting that greater pragmatism has come at the cost of attacking flair. West Ham, who have scored 12 goals and conceded 14 in Potter’s 12 games, have had to be dull. They are not designed to be dynamic. They are a slow team, particularly in central midfield, and are incapable of multitasking. They are vulnerable to pace if they open up and lack the speed to play on the counterattack when they opt for more solidity.Such poor planning explains why it is unfair to say that Potter has made little impact despite winning only three games. If doubts exist over whether his steady approach is suited to a club as excitable as West Ham then analysis of his work must be placed in context. It is worth paying attention when Potter says he is using the final weeks of the campaign to work out which players will be part of his long-term plans (short answer: not many).View image in fullscreenJulen Lopetegui was sacked by West Ham after six months in charge.Photograph: Alan Walter/ShutterstockPlanning is under way for next season. Yet the caution from inside West Ham, who are 16th before visiting Liverpool on Sunday, is that the summer budget will not be huge. Complying with the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations is a big consideration. West Ham do not have many ways of raising funds through sales – Mohammed Kudus, whose form has nosedived, is the only player they could be sure of getting a big fee for this summer – and they are looking for affordable, creative and long-term solutions. Evan Ferguson, the on-loan Brighton striker, will not be joining on a permanent deal.Potter needs a striker, better centre-backs and at least two midfielders. West Ham cannot dominate games with flowing football. There is no combination in midfield that works as an all-round package. West Ham started Saturday’s draw with Bournemouth with a stodgy trio of Edson Álvarez, Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse. The improvement came when Álvarez and Soucek were replaced by attacking players; the drawback was that West Ham then had to defend a 2-1 lead with a midfield of Carlos Soler, Lucas Paquetá and Ward-Prowse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The FA is understood to be pushing for a lifetime ban for the Brazilian if he is found guilty, but the latest reports suggest the saga could drag on until beyond the end of the season.Paquetá, who denies the allegations, has been able to play throughout the hearing and Potter is set to start him again when West Ham head to leaders Liverpool on Sunday. 'His mindset has been really good. He comes to training and it takes his mind off stuff that is clearly important and serious,' said the West Ham manager.'I haven't noticed any difference in him in training. The distraction is a welcome one for him. We check on him, make sure he's OK and we listen to him. There haven't been any problems.' Potter also gave an update on striker Michail Antonio, who is still recovering from a car accident in December which left him with a broken leg.'He's just step by step, steady, making progress,' said Potter. \"But there's no real time on anything. 'He's in the gym mostly but he can get out on the pitch and do some more stuff with the physios. It's slowly but surely.'PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It is why Potter has often sought stability by using a back three. This is a transition. West Ham conceded 20 goals in Lopetegui’s final eight games. Potter had to stop the humiliations and Opta’s numbers show a defensive improvement. West Ham have gone from allowing opponents 16.6 shots a game under Lopetegui to 14.1 under Potter. Those opportunities also seem to be taking place from less dangerous positions, given that expected goals against have dipped from 1.8 a game to 1.3.Admittedly there has been a decline at the other end. West Ham have had 9.4 shots a game under Potter, as opposed to 14.6 under Lopetegui, and their xG has fallen. Then again, Potter has not had a settled attack. Niclas Füllkrug is back from a hamstring injury but Crysencio Summerville and Michail Antonio are long-term absentees.It is a nuanced situation. Lopetegui was most mistaken in his muddled attempt to be expansive with a squad geared towards Moyes’s counterpunching approach. The Spaniard tried to change too much too soon. Potter is moving more cautiously.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedThe ObserverFootball tacticsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Two more wins for Wolves will confirm Leicester’s return to the Championship after a season to forget. But having twice fallen behind to penalties from João Pedro, it was the visiting supporters who came away smiling for a change as Caleb Okoli’s thumping header denied Brighton the victory they craved. Bilal El Khannouss –who scored Leicester’s last goalagainst Tottenham back in the depths of January – almost won it late on for Leicester when he struck the post late on.Nottm Forest 0-1 Everton, Brighton 2-2 Leicester and more: clockwatch – liveRead more“Two negative cycles have been broken, thank God,” admitted Van Nistelrooy. “We haven’t seen enough performances like that in recent weeks.”On an afternoon when Brighton’s captain, Lewis Dunk, showed the years are finally catching up with him, this was yet another disappointing display from Fabian Hürzeler’s side. They now find themselves five points behind seventh-placed Newcastle having played two more games and there were widespread boos from the home supporters at the final whistle.“We were too naive, not mature enough and didn’t stick together,” reflected Hürzeler, whose side have now failed to beat all three promoted clubs at home this season. “I wouldn’t say that’s it but we shouldn’t talk about Europe if we play like this.”Brighton could not have asked for better opponents as they attempted to get their season back on track after four games without a win. A dismal run of 15 defeats from Leicester’s previous 16 games has meant that any hopes of repeating their great escape of 2015 when they took 22 points from a possible 27 under Nigel Pearson after being bottom at Christmas have long since dissipated. Mavididi’s early effort that was blocked by Carlos Baleba was greeted with ironic chants of “we’ve had a shot” from their long-suffering fans.View image in fullscreenLuke Thomas gets to grips with Brighton’s Matt O’Riley.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesThey had a grandstand view behind Mads Hermansen’s goal as the hosts created a number of early chances but couldn’t find a breakthrough. Mavididi should have made more of another early sight of goal after a mistake from Dunk and there was something comical about the way Leicester fell behind minutes later. After an incisive move started by Baleba – who was filling in at centre-back in place of the suspended Jan Paul van Hecke – Pervis Estupiñán cut the ball back for Simon Adingra just inside the area. His shot was heading in before Conor Coady instinctively stuck out a hand and his sheepish reaction said it all. Incredibly, the referee, Darren Bond, waved play on and it still needed a lengthy VAR check to award the penalty. João Pedro stroked home with ease but Brighton’s joy was short-lived.Once again Dunk, who has struggled with injuries in his 15th season with Brighton, was at fault as he failed to control a pass and El Khannouss picked out Mavididi, who finished under Bart Verbruggen. Cue wild celebrations in the away end. João Pedro should have restored Brighton’s lead just before half-time but the Brazilian dragged his shot wide with the goal gaping before Matt O’Riley saw his strike come back off the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

O’Riley had just forced a good save from Hermansen when he tried to connect with Adingra’s cross and was hauled back by Luke Thomas. Bond allowed play to continue but was forced to reverse his decision for the second time of the afternoon as João Pedro repeated the trick from the spot.O’Riley set up Yankuba Minteh for a golden opportunity to extend Brighton’s lead that once more went begging. It almost proved costly when Mavididi played in the substitute Patson Daka around a statuesque Dunk but Verbruggen produced a strong save. Brighton survived when Kasey McAteer headed just wide yet there was to be no reprieve when Okoli arrived at the back post to head home a free kick from El Khannouss and bring an end to Leicester’s miserable run.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverBrighton & Hove AlbionLeicester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Leeds are now five points clear of their promotion rivals with four games to go.In the swirling eddies of a three-into-two automatic promotion race, this could end up being a potentially decisive 24 hours. Leeds made hard work of delivering their part of the bargain, wasting a stream of chances to make for an unnecessarily stressful conclusion.“If you want to win promotion, you have to have a special mentality,” Daniel Farke said. “You don’t crack under pressure. You must play with fire in your heart, but on the other hand you don’t lose your head and stay calm and composed. This is what the lads did really, really well.“We could have made our life a lot easier by using a few of the chances. It must have been one of the highest expected goals games for us all season. Normally, we should have scored six or seven. Nevertheless, it was a priceless three points.“I was aware it could be an important step for us today. This stadium can develop an energy like nowhere else and we had a little taste of how it would feel if we could celebrate with our supporters the really special achievement of going back to the Premier League. It would be an unbelievable feeling, but we’re not there yet. ”Leeds need eight points from their last four games to make sure of a return to the Premier League, although their goal difference is such that seven points will surely do it. They have scored 82 goals, making this their most potent campaign since the glory days of 1969-70 when 84 helped them to runners-up spot in the old First Division.Leeds should have had more, though, against a Preston side whose season is tailing off badly. The main culprit was their leading-scorer Joel Piroe, now without a goal in eight games. He had a series of opportunities to end his drought, the prime one coming in the 55th minute when he struck the bar from three yards – but he is in one of those phases as a striker when the goal shrinks to the size of a shoebox.Willy Gnonto, Brenden Aaronson and Joe Rodon also squandered good chances, the latter somehow contriving to miss an open goal from a yard out in the second half.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Manor Solomon gave Leeds a fourth-minute lead, curling a glorious angled strike beyond the Preston goalkeeper, David Cornell, and into the far corner. It was a lovely piece of vision and execution from the Israel international.Within two minutes, Preston were level through Kaine Kesler-Hayden. The Aston Villa loanee drove at Junior Firpo, cut inside the Leeds full-back and drilled a thumping left-foot strike past Darlow.Bogle quickly restored the home side’s lead, arriving inside the Preston six-yard box in between Jayden Meghoma and Andrew Hughes with perfect timing to put away Solomon’s cross from the left.Leeds’s profligacy built the tension towards the end, but the visitors could not rustle up enough as an attacking entity to discomfort Leeds unduly.

Villa need to overturn a 3-1 deficit in Tuesday’s second leg.Southampton, by contrast, have the slightly more modest ambition of trying not to become the worst team inPremier Leaguehistory. Having become the first club to be relegated with as many as seven games of the season remaining, they now have six left to secure the two points required to overhaul Derby’s record-low of 11.View image in fullscreenAaron Ramsdale saved two penalties, but it was not enough to prevent Southampton losing again.Photograph: Robin Jones/Getty ImagesSimon Rusk, appointed interim boss after Ivan Juric’s painful 14-match reign was ended on Monday, went with a back five in a bid to plug their leaky defence.But Villa opened it up inside 40 seconds when Youri Tielemans played Rashford through on goal, although Jan Bednarek recovered well to block his shot.Southampton are the lowest scorers in all four divisions with a paltry 23 goals, but they should have taken the lead after 15 minutes when Kyle Walker-Peters’s threaded pass put Cameron Archer in behind. The former Villa striker shrugged off the attentions of Tyrone Mings, only for his shot across goal to be beaten away by Emiliano Martínez.Early in the second half Bednarek came the closest to breaking the deadlock when he met a Villa corner and headed it inches over his own crossbar. Rashford curled a free-kick too high and was then substituted for Watkins.Three minutes later, Watkins was put through by Morgan Rogers and felled in the area by Bednarek, but Aaron Ramsdale guessed correctly to keep out Asensio’s spot-kick.However, Watkins soon conjured up a superb goal after latching on to Tielemans’s pass and expertly lifting it over the onrushing Ramsdale, the ball grazing the underside of the crossbar as it looped in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In stoppage time, Asensio had the chance to make amends for his penalty miss after McGinn was tripped by Jack Stephens.Although Ramsdale went the same way with the same outcome, this time McGinn was on hand to snaffle the rebound and give Villa a spring in their step ahead of PSG’s visit.Unai Emery said he needs to make a decision on his penalty taker for the second leg against the French champions after Asensio’s double failure. “We have our penalty shooters,” he said. “The first one is Marcus Rashford, the second is Marco Asensio, the third is Youri Tielemans, John McGinn or Ollie Watkins.“Marco decided to take the second because the first one he failed, it was revenge for him. He missed it. We have to accept it and now we are going to decide for the next match.“We are trying to set clear our demands and our way to achieve it. They did a fantastic job from minute one to minute 90,”Rusk said: “We showed a lot of grit for 60 or 70 minutes against a top team. We can be pleased with a lot of that.

Instead of the doubles specialist, Olivia Nicholls, present in The Hague precisely for these matches and with Harriet Dart positioned as the first-choice doubles team, the British captain chose to rely on the pure firepower provided by her singles players.It turned out to be a stroke of genius.Katie Boulterand Jodie Burrage, both ranked outside the top 250 in doubles and with minimal experience together, produced an inspired performance to lead their team to victory with a dominant 6-2, 6-2 win over Suzan Lamens and Demi Schuurs.After defeating Germany 2-1 on Friday, Great Britain’s 2-1 win over the Netherlands qualified them for the Billie Jean King Cup Finals, an eight-team knockout tournament that takes place in Shenzhen, China after the US Open in September.“Today, they executed the game plan as well as they could have done and just overpowered the opposition,” said Keothavong. “In terms of the decision-making process, it was always an option for us which I had up my sleeve and they went out there and did the job.”In the absence of Emma Raducanu, Sonay Kartal opened the tie with another assured performance by defeating Eva Vedder 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. This week has marked another step forward in her evolution after a career-best year in which the 23-year-old has established herself inside the top 100 at No 60.View image in fullscreenSonay Kartal won singles rubbers in each of Great Britain’s victories against Germany and the Netherlands.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images for LTAKartal’s victory set the stage for a battle of the No 1 singles players. Lamens, ranked No 70, has quickly established herself as a tough opponent for all. While Boulter has made improvements on clay, an in-form, top-100 opponent is still a significant challenge for her on a surface that blunts her power and often exposes her lack of adaptability. On this occasion, Lamens was a step too far as she fell 6-4, 6-3.Great Britain boast a solid pool of singles players, but their doubles lineups had become a notable weakness. Last year, Nicholls and Heather Watson were flattened in the decisive doubles rubber of the BJK Cup semi-finals against Slovakia. On Friday, Nicholls, the doubles No 31, and Dart were similarly dominated by a German team that had been defeated ˆby Lamens and Schuurs one night earlier.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Instead of relying on the same duo, Keothavong opted to take a risk. Although Boulter and Burrage are close friends, this decisive rubber marked just the second time that they had ever played together, their only other match a first-round loss at Nottingham in 2021. Sometimes, two quality tennis players in one team is enough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I completely trust her game.”By far the two biggest ball-strikers on the court, they both served brilliantly while completely dominating the baseline exchanges with their destructive shot-making and they relentlessly closed down the net. Across their 78 minutes on court, Boulter and Burrage completely overpowered their Dutch opponents to close out an unforgettable win.“It’s not like I’ve got players who play doubles week in, week out, other than Olivia Nicholls, but just finding the game styles that work together on a match court,” said Keothavong. “You can practise all you want, but you’re still kind of dipping into the unknown. You’ve got to take your chances and, for me as captain, I had confidence in these two. I’ve seen them deliver. And I think the way they delivered today just kind of seals that.”Explore more on these topicsTennisThe ObserverKatie BoulternewsShareReuse this content"

England were held scoreless until the 34th minute and only held a slender 7-5 lead at half-time.

They remained really calm and as much as Ireland tackled really well in the first half, we probably put ourselves into the washing machine hence the reason it required a little bit of adjustment at half-time.“In the second half we got more momentum. When we get momentum you see our intuitive skills come out. We are ruthless when we get momentum. We crushed their lineout, their lineout went nowhere. Their attack went nowhere in the second half. I think they only got out of their half through kick-off [in the second 40] so we were pretty ruthless, There were a couple of team tries – [Meg] Jones’ and one of [Sarah] Bern’s – they were beautiful tries.”The Red Roses have outlined clear plans in team selection in their opening three Six Nations games and Mitchell says their next one is no different. They will play Scotland in Leicester next Saturday and he confirmed the team has already been named for that encounter.He said: “We want to keep getting better so we have to keep asking questions of ourselves, where can we get better? The girls are good at that, we have a very good leadership group. We have a squad that is definitely focused.“You get three jobs within a team [starter, finisher and non-playing] and the girls at the moment are definitely focused on that. Not everyone plays but everyone wins if they do their job well and raise the training level.”From an Irish perspective, Scott Bemand said it was tough to let a game get away. “As we pick through the bones of it, there were questions asked of an English team that have not been asked of them recently,” the head coach said. “We got them under pressure, they’ve had to go back into the dressing room and rediscover how they play the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she was unharmed and quickly rejoined the peloton.Although she was supposed to be tactically riding for her Visma-Lease a Bike teammate, Marianne Vos, Ferrand-Prévôt sensed an opportunity and launched her attack with about 18km left on the road to Roubaix, close to the Belgian border. “I had a gap and I tried to go until the end,” she said afterwards.None of Ferrand-Prévôt’s rivals could catch her and she entered the velodrome on her own with the crowd cheering.

On Saturday, it covered every single one of the 52 other men in the field at the Masters, so that even the world’s No 1 golfer,Scottie Scheffler, found himself playing in the shade. Scheffler is a popular golfer, and a particular favourite with the fans around here after winning the tournament twice in the past three years, but as McIlroy’s round went on, Scheffler’s gallery started to thin quicker than Jordan Spieth’s hair. By the time he made the turn, you could pretty much take your pick of the positions around whichever green he was on. The centre of gravity was with McIlroy, back on the previous green.Scheffler was a frontrunner during both of those victories, he led the field from the second round right through to the finish both times. Which means that this year he’s in the unfamiliar position of trying to scrap his way up past McIlroy, and everyone else in his way, into first place. He’s the tortoise chasing the hare. He scored an even-par 72, which left him five under par, andwell off McIlroy’s lead.Rory McIlroy makes most of moving day to open two-shot Masters leadRead moreChasing doesn’t much suit Scheffler. Especially this year, when his finely tuned game seems just a little out of sync, like a clock that’s slipped a few seconds off. He started the day as one of a group of four players tied on five under, three shots behind Justin Rose’s lead, but found himself having to work hard just to hang on to what he had. Scheffler played a good round of bad golf, in which he made a lot of mistakes and managed to scramble back from them over and again. He ended up in a bunker at the 2nd, the 4th, the 5th and the 7th, and somehow he still managed to come through the first nine in level par.Some other day, it would have been good enough, but not when McIlroy was playing the way he was just a couple of groups back down the course. Scheffler knew it too. You can always hear the roars at Augusta National, but one of the big differences this year is that the hurricane which blew through last September has removed so many trees you can see a lot of what’s going on around you too. So as Scheffler sweated his way around the opening holes, par, birdie, par, par, par, he was pursued by the sight, and sound, of McIlroy over his shoulder, tearing his way through that very same stretch in birdie, eagle, birdie, par, birdie.And, up on the big white scoreboards around the course, the big red numbers kept running up alongside McIlroy’s name, seven under par, then nine, then 10, then 11.Scheffler’s steady-as-she-goes golf is all well and good when his nearest competitors are making mistakes, but less effective when they are running up the sort of low scores that they managed on Saturday. And it started to show.View image in fullscreenTyrrell Hatton also failed to challenge the leaders playing alongside Scottie Scheffler.Photograph: David J Phillip/APAt the 5th, Scheffler snapped. He hit his drive in the one place he wanted to avoid, towards the pair of big bunkers down the left side of the fairway. “Dang it Scotty!” Scheffler shouted as he tossed his tee down on the ground. “What the heck was that?” Which is a blue streak by his standards. He got lucky that time, his ball somehow fetched up on the isthmus between the two sand traps, but he didn’t at the 7th, where he chopped his second out of the rough into the big back bunker, a shot that left him doubled over in frustration. He dropped one shot there and another at the 12th, where he took two putts after chipping on to the green.But he picked up a second birdie at 15, after chipping to six feet, but he missed the chance to score a third on 18. Which left him right back where he began, on five under, only a lot further back from the lead than he had been at the beginning of the day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were an odd pair, the two of them, little and large, kitted out in nearly identical outfits. Hatton, squat, barrel-chested and with a furious temper, Scheffler straight-laced and square-shouldered as a tailor’s dummy.Hatton did manage to hit his tee shot flush into the cup on the par-three 6th. Unfortunately for him, it was a beer cup that had been tucked under someone’s seat in the front row of the gallery. Hatton saw the funny side of that, but not the bogeys he made at the 1st, 12th, 16th and 18th. At the 12th Hatton tossed his ball straight into the water after tapping it in. Hatton always has the air of a time-bomb that’s got three seconds left on the clock. He finished three over for the day, and so right out of it, which is a reminder of just how wrong things can go at Augusta, and how well Scheffler had done to stop his own round getting away from him.Knowing Hatton, he will probably have had a couple of choice words to say about it all. “Dang” and “Heck”, maybe.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersThe ObserverScottie SchefflerRory McIlroyEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

This marked Spieth’s best round of this Masters by four but the Texan cut a frustrated figure. When mud attaches itself to a ball, a regular Masters feature and primarily from drives, approach shots can be impacted.“My iron play killed me the last two days and to be brutally honest with you, it was primarily mud balls,” Spieth explained. “It’s just so frustrating because you can’t talk about them here. You’re not supposed to talk about them. Mud balls can affect this tournament significantly, especially when you get them a lot on 11 and 13. They’re just daggers on those two holes.Bernhard Langer keeps the faith right to the end of a classy Masters farewellRead more“There’s like less than normal but I still had them today on those holes. I had them yesterday on those holes. It’s something to pay attention to for sure for leader groups, because you just have to play so far away from trouble or lay up when you’d normally go for it, just random stuff, because it will affect it significantly. And if you’re on the wrong side of the hole you’re either in the water or you almost can’t make par depending on what hole it is.“Look, it’s mowed into the grain. The ball is digging in on every shot. A lot of times you have it on 75% of your drives.”Spieth duly repeated his belief that this topic is taboo as far as the Green Jackets are concerned. The members of Augusta National are fiercely protected of their hallowed turf. “Obviously the lower you hit it, the less chance,” Spieth added. “But, every person is having to deal with it. The fact that you’re not supposed to talk about it is a bit frustrating because it is a difference maker. It can be a difference maker in scores on some holes.”Spieth is not the first high-profile golfer to raise the mud ball issue. Sergio García issued an apology to the Masters in 2009 after his own criticism. “Even when it’s dry you still get mud balls in the middle of the fairway,” said the Spaniard. “It’s too much of a guessing game.”Explore more on these topicsThe MastersJordan SpiethEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But, as Bernhard Langer explained after finishing his 136th and final competitive round at the Masters on Friday evening, apparently that’s what happened to him when he won the tournament for the first time in 1985, back when it was Brent Musburger asking the questions on CBS. In one of the more extraordinary revelations, Langer told the press that he saw the light right by the side of the 18th green here at Augusta National.“I never mentioned it to the public but this tournament actually was very instrumental in me becoming a Christian,” Langer said, in a somewhat incongruous reply to a question about the fact that he was the last man to win a major using a persimmon driver. Apparently the club went by the name “the Last Supper”, which must have been what got him thinking about it. “I grew up Catholic, and I thought I was a Christian. But I basically used Jesus Christ in a very bad way in my first interview in Butler Cabin.”Rory McIlroy’s electric finish ignites Masters bid as Justin Rose leads packRead moreYou can go back and watch the clip. “Did you notice the pressure?” the club chairman, Hord Hardin, asked him. “I was just trying to stay cool and play my own game,” Langer said back, “and once in a while I looked up on the leaderboard and I saw these numbers going up with Curtis Strange, six and seven under, and I thought: ‘Jesus Christ! You’re not playing that bad yourself and you’re four or five behind!’ you know?”Hardin seemed to think it was funny enough, but someone else must have decided that if he was going to use that kind of language on live TV Langer needed to brush up on his catechisms, and dragged him along to a Bible study group at Hilton Head three days later. “And that was when I learned that, you know, you should be born again spiritually. So I bought my own Bible and started going to Bible studies, and shortly after that, a couple months later, I became a Christian and gave my life to Jesus.”Well, as Bob Dylan said, you’ll find God in the church of your choice. You scoff if you want to, but turns out the Almighty was a pretty good swing coach. “Eight years later, I was a Christian, and I won on Easter Sunday, which was very emotional and very meaningful for me because that’s the one day we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. And that’s what Christianity is all about. So this tournament was more meaningful to me than most people know, even in a spiritual sense.”View image in fullscreenBernhard Langer missed the Masters cut by just a shot after rounds of 74 and 73.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAThey do say he moves in mysterious ways. Langer got a reminder of this himself on the 15th on Friday. “I actually hit a beautiful wedge in, right to the middle of the green, and it spun all the way back in the water, and I made seven. I hit a perfect golf shot, literally, and I made seven, which is very annoying,” Langer said, as he reflected on his final round.“That’s how golf is. It can be the greatest game, and sometimes it can be very brutal. It’s a very fine line of, you know, hitting a great shot or ending up in a terrible place.” At 67, and after a lifetime of play, he’s still as baffled as the rest of us by the vagaries of game.Langer was a great golfer who only got better as life went on; he has dominated the Champions Tour, where he has won at least one event for 18 consecutive years. He could probably get away with playing another few years in the field here – even after what happened on 15 he would have made the cut if he had only holed a six-foot putt on 18.But he just feels the course is too long for him to enjoy playing these days. “I’m a competitor. I want to be in the heat. I want to be on the leaderboard. I want to have a chance to win. On this golf course, I don’t feel I can win anymore. I can maybe make the cut if I play really good.“I’m hitting such long clubs into these greens, I can’t stop the ball where I need to stop it, and it’s a golf course designed to be hit with medium to short irons.” That said, he still scored a 74 and a 73, which was a sight better than plenty of younger, stronger, longer golfers.He was treated to all the roars and applause Augusta always offers its favourites as he made his way off the 18th green for the final time. “How will they remember me?” Langer said. “Hopefully, you know, as a good golfer. But hopefully also a man of faith and a man of family and somebody that treated people well.” So he goes, the man who was born again in Butler Cabin.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersThe ObserverEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Experts warn fourth amendment rights have been weakened at the borderJohana BhuiyanSat 12 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 08.31 EDTShareAmir Makled thought he was being racially profiled. A Lebanese American who was born and raised inDetroit, the attorney was returning home from a family vacation in the Dominican Republic when he said an immigration official at the Detroit Metro airport asked for a “TTRT” agent after scanning his passport on Sunday. Makled said the expression on the agent’s face changed. He felt something “odd” was happening.“So I Googled what TTRT meant. I didn’t know,” Makled said. “And what I found out was it meant Tactical Terrorism Response Team. So immediately I knew they’re gonna take me in for questioning. And that’s when I felt like I was being racially profiled or targeted because I am Arab.”But it quickly became apparent, Makled said, that the stop was different from the type of so-called randomstop Muslims and Arab-Americans have become accustomed toat US airports. The plainclothes immigration officer said he knew who Makled was and what he did for a living, according to the lawyer; agents wanted to search his phone.“They made it clear right off the top: ‘We know that you’re an attorney and we know that you’re taking on some higher-profile cases.’ I was like, ‘OK, well, what do you want from me?’” Makled recalled.How to protect your phone and data privacy at the US borderRead moreAmong the high-profile cases Makled has taken on recently:a pro-Palestinian student protesterwho was arrested at a demonstration at the University of Michigan.“To me, there’s a clear correlation when you think about what’s been happening with all the student protesters across the country and the very explicit direction from thecurrent administrationabout looking into attorneys who are taking on cases for people seeking asylum or these major law firms in Washington that he issued executive orders on,” he said. In the past few months, theTrump administrationhas set its sights on people protesting againstIsrael’s ongoing attacks on Gaza. The administration has detained and attempted to deport student protesters who are in the US on visas andrevoked the visas of more than 600 students, some in explicit retaliation for activism. Donald Trump has simultaneouslysigned executive ordersthat take aim at major law firms that have previously represented clients who opposed some of the president’s interests by stripping them of their access to federal buildings.On top of that, device searches at US ports of entry are legally permissible under existing case law in most places. Fourth amendment protections provided by the US constitution, which guard against “unreasonable search and seizure”,are weaker at the US border.The officers never explained to him what they were looking for or why he was being stopped, according to Makled. They told the lawyer that he could either unlock his phone voluntarily or that they would confiscate it and look through it themselves, he said.Makled, who has been an attorney since 2012, uses his phone to speak to his clients. He told the officer much of the information on his device was privileged and that he would not hand it over. Agents asked him to write down what was privileged so they could look at other information on his device, he said, and he refused. After consulting with a supervisor, the official returned and said that he planned to take away Makled’s device unless the lawyer gave up the list of contacts on it. Makled felt he had no choice but to acquiesce.“Because they kept telling me they were just going to take the device,” he said. “And I didn’t want that to happen. I needed my device.”After downloading and then browsing his contacts, the immigration official asked Makled about five or six specific names. He refused to divulge any more information. He was eventually allowed to go home.Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told the Guardian that Makled’s account was “blatantly false and sensationalized”. According to the agency, the attorney underwent a routine, 90-minute secondary inspection that any traveler might face. Makled provided written consent for “a limited search” of his phone, which was “conducted in accordance with established protocols”, CBP assistant commissioner Hilton Beckham said.“He was then promptly released. Claims that this was an attack on his profession or were politically motivated are baseless. Our officers are following the law, not agendas,” Beckham said.‘The fourth amendment goes away’Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, called the search of Makled’s phone “outrageous”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“CBP or [the Department of Homeland Security] could not show up at this attorney’s office and say: ‘give me your contact list’ without a warrant,” Cope said. “That would be completely illegal. But because this guy is at the border, and they want it for potentially just domestic monitoring and enforcement, somehow now the fourth amendment goes away.”Both citizens and non-citizensentering the US are potentially subjectto having their phones searched at the border. Fourth amendment protections, which guard against “unreasonable search and seizure”, have been weakened at US points of entry. CBP’s role is to stop people or goods that could pose a threat to the US from entering the country. In the case of US citizens, CBP may pull a traveler whom agents have security concerns about – anything from drug or sex trafficking to espionage concerns – but must ultimately admit them into the country, Cope said.However, there have been many recent cases of CBP pulling a US citizen about whom they have no border security concerns into a secondary screening at the behest of other federal agencies, Cope said. The FBI, for example, has in the past asked CBP to put flags on people’s travel profiles so that when they cross the border they are pulled into secondary inspection, she said.“That may be because the person is under domestic investigation themselves or because the traveler is associated with somebody who’s under investigation and the government’s just trying to get around the warrant requirement,” Cope said.Cope said that, based on the existing information, it doesn’t appear Makled’s stop was routine. “If they tell him: ‘We know you’re a lawyer,’ and then this terrorism flag popped up, that’s not routine, that’s pre-planned,” Cope said.Here’s what you need to know about your rights when entering the USRead moreCBP has access to a vast array of databases through which agents can gain access to personal information about individuals who are traveling into or out of the US. One of these repositories may have contained a “lookout” designation for Makled, a flag on his file that can lead to a secondary screening. Those “lookouts” can remain on a person’s file as long as CBP deems them “pertinent”, according todocuments revealed in a 2019 case in Massachusetts federal court.When Makled was finally released around two hours after he was first detained, he asked the official if he should expect to be stopped every time he traveled abroad.“He’s like, ‘You might be stopped next time,’” Makled said. “You might not. It depends on the agent that’s working.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationPrivacySurveillanceSmartphonesDetroitfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it was not until hisso-called “liberation day”on 2 April – where the president announced sweeping duties on incoming goods, punishing competitors, allies and small and developing countries alike – that hespooked global financial marketsand provoked fears of spiralling inflation and stagnant growth.Amid a US government bond sell-off, the presidentpaused his most eye-watering tariffsfor 90 days, apart from China, whose goods are set to behit with a 145% levy.Hundreds of Americans got in touch with the Guardian to share how the uncertainty is affecting their consumption habits.Dane, who is retired, worked as an entrepreneur with his wife most of his career before later becoming an English teacher. He said he was a Republican in the 1980s but is fearful about how the US is “not going the right way” under Trump, and is unhappy with his “dystopian” policies towards global allies, the economy, education, scientific research and more.View image in fullscreenDane, 73, ran a printing shop before becoming an English teacher.Photograph: Dane/Guardian CommunityCurrently, Dane is on a trip to Paris and plans to bring home consumer goods potentially hit by 10% tariffs on European Union imports.“We’ll probably be getting tea, bringing back some cheese, some butter,” he said. “I would love tobring back eggsbut that would be a disaster. I’d have scrambled eggs in my suitcase.”Amid tariff uncertainty, Heather, a 61-year-old college professor in Texas, said she and her husband can mostly weather food cost fluctuations, but brought forward the purchase of anew car “inanticipation of price hikes”.She said they owned a 14-year-old Mini Cooper, which ran on gas, that they planned to replace with a hybrid vehicle at some point. They decided to replace their car now to avoid potential inflation – and reduce expenditure on gas.“The economic instability of theTrump administrationcertainly gives one pause,” she said. “It’s just so much instability, chaos and [the] unknown.”It’s a similar story for Stefanie, a 56-year-old educator and former tech worker in Nevada, who bought a Toyota Tacoma to replace her old Jeep as well as converting some investments into cash.Stefanie began strategizing about being more resilient to tariffs as soon as Trump was elected.“The one thing I learned in the first administration is to believe him: he says bizarre things, and then hedoesbizarre things,” she said.I really resent being drafted into this mad trade war, but if there is a silver lining ... people like me will question their unsustainable capitalistic practicesChristine, 41She’s cutting back on subscriptions and future travel plans, while stockpiling kitchen staples such as rice, cooking oils, vinegar and flour and replacing worn-out clothes including shoes and jeans, “before inflation hits”.“The supply chain is so globalized that tariffs really hit everything,” Stefanie said.But for Ishaan*, a 51-year-old engineer in Texas, the economic picture means he is abstaining from major purchases.“Everyone I know has started tightening their belts,” he said. “I am cutting out unnecessary expenses, cancelled my gym membership, focusing on savings.”The focus for Ishaan, who fears higher prices and an economic slowdown, is to build up his savings in cash. He feels “scared to invest in any stocks or bonds right now” amid market volatility.Likewise for Jonathan*, a 70-year-old in New Jersey, the financial fallout from Trump’s trade wars means he has been forced to rule out planned purchases and strip consumption back to the essentials.Jonathan said his individual retirement account (IRA) was initially “decimated” – although it ticked up slightly after Trump paused his tariffs on Wednesday. He said it was currently down about 15%.That means cancelling plans to redo the carpet in his house and replace two old televisions, Jonathan said. “In short, we’ll buy only necessities and pay bills until this stupidity ends.”‘The damage is done’: Trump’s tariffs put the dollar’s safe haven status in jeopardyRead moreRuss a 35-year-old physicist in New Mexico, said the Trump administration’s policies were “causing me to think about what kinds of spending behavior I could have done without this whole time”.He has an eight-year-old phone and nine-year-old MacBook computer that still work fine, which he will not be replacing. The prospect of runaway price rises for consumer electronics, often from China, have led him to reconsider: “Do I really need this, or do I just want this?“I see these things as being as much toys as necessities,” he said. “Maybe I’ll just go back to adumbphoneor something like that – I fantasize sometimes about not getting all these notifications all the time, like thephones we had back in 2005. But maybe that’s a Luddite fantasy.”Russ said that he was already boycotting Amazon and Target – companies that many feel have aligned themselves with Trump’s agenda such asrolling back their own DEI schemes. He’s trying to shop more at local, independent shops rather than “everything stores”, which he notes is more expensive and time consuming but ultimately worth it.“As an American citizen and registered voter, nobody really cares what you think until November of every other year, you feel kind of voiceless,” he said. “You think, well, if dollars are the only tools we have any more, then damn it, I’m going to cast those votes and allocate my spending accordingly.”View image in fullscreenChristine, 41, said she had already seen an impact on her acupuncture business from the economic uncertainty.Photograph: Christine/Guardian CommunityLikewise,small business ownerChristine* said the disruption could cause a wider re-evaluation of US consumer habits.Amid the uncertainty, Christine, 41, stocked up on supplies for her Miami acupuncture business for two years, and bought her son’s fifth birthday present – a bike – early for July. But she said she had already noticed less demand for her work.More broadly, the prospect of inflationary tariffs is accelerating Christine’s reconsideration of how much “stuff” she needs. She’s recently attended “these lovely parties” where friends bring unwanted clothes and they “switch it all around” rather than buying fast fashion.“I really resent being drafted into this mad trade war,” Christine said, “but if there is a silver lining, maybe it’s that at least some people like me will question their unsustainable capitalistic practices.”*Some names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationConsumer spendingUS economyDonald TrumpUS politicsTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world.”View image in fullscreenFormer British prime minister Gordon Brown said key trading nations needed to step up their collective response to the chaos unleashed by Donald Trump.Photograph: Victoria Jones/PALast week, the former prime ministerGordon Brown wrote in theGuardianthat leaders of other key trading nations needed to step up their collective response to the chaos unleashed by Trump, warning: “We are seeing a simultaneous breakdown in economic and geopolitical orders.”Brown said: “We need an economic coalition of the willing: like-minded global leaders who believe that, in an interdependent world, we have to coordinate economic policies across continents if we are to safeguard jobs and living standards.”Referring to the US under Trump, Brown said the “world is being brought to its knees by one economy, outside which live 96% of the population, who produce 84% of the world’s manufactured goods”.On Saturday, Trump announced thatsmartphones and computers would be exemptedfrom the 125% tariffs he has imposed on imports from China, as would electronics components such as memory cards and semiconductors.Experts had warned the tariffs could cause prices of electronic goods such as iPhones and laptops to dramatically spike for US customers.Support is growing among economists for a new layer of trade agreements between leading economic powers, under the auspices of theWorld Trade Organization, but excluding the US for as long as it follows the protectionist route.With both houses of parliament on SaturdayOn Sunday, in a further response to the uncertainties, ministers will announce that British businesses across the country will have access to new support through a multibillion-pound increase in government-backed financing.The new package will give UK Export Finance the power to expand financing support for British businesses by £20bn, with small businesses also able to access loans of up to £2m through the British Business Bank’s growth guarantee scheme.Thousands of companies are expected to benefit from the move, including those directly affected by tariffs. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Within a changing world, we need to adapt, and as part of our plan for change, this government is responding.”View image in fullscreenA new poll has revealed that more than half of adults believe US president Donald Trump is not ‘a friend of Britain’s’.Photograph: Andrew Leyden/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockAnOpinium poll for theObserverfinds that 34% of adults now believe the US is more of a threat than an ally, up from 16% in November last year, while those who have confidence in the US as an ally are just 35%.Views of Trump are also becoming more negative. Although the president has said he has an affinity with the UK, the poll shows that more than half of adults believe he is not “a friend of Britain’s” – a 12% leap since January. And fewer people believe he has the best interests of the US at heart than do not. Only 16% of those polled believed he was trustworthy, against 64% who did not.Since becoming president, Trump has said the UK is “out of line” on trade, imposed a 10% tariff on all UK imports and a further 25% tariff on cars without warning Keir Starmer, and ordered Nato members to spend at least 5% of GDP on defence.Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world but to face forwardRead moreHis vice-president, JD Vance, also claimed at a conference in Munich in February that “in Britain and across Europe, free speech is in retreat”, and met leaders of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party.Separately,research by a leading thinktankhas found that a majority of UK voters want the government to concentrate on rebuilding trade ties with the EU over forging a new economic deal with the US.Commissioned by the internationalist thinktank Best for Britain, the research found that 53% of voters now believe a closer relationship with the EU will have a positive effect on the UK economy, against just 13% who said the effect would be negative. In turn, 68% believed better relations with the EU would boost UK-EU trade in a clearly positive way.The analysis shows how far the UK public has turned back in favour of the EU since the Brexit referendum nine years ago.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesThe ObserverTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Europe and the UK can seize an advantageWill HuttonIt’s time to fashion a new global trade order without the USSat 12 Apr 2025 14.35 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 15.31 EDTShareThe game-changing geopolitical event last week was thenear collapse of the immense $29tn ­market in US government debt,threatening the stability of the American and global financial system and the safe-haven status of dollar assets.The US president boasted as the collapse unfolded that world leaders were queueing to “kiss his arse”.Twelve hours later, he was in the same humiliatingly weak position as the then British prime minister Liz Truss found herself after her tax-slashing “mini-budget” in 2022. The markets had forced him to pause for 90 days the swingeing range of “reciprocal” tariffs that he announced on what he proclaimed “liberation day”; instead he lowered all of them, bar that on China, to 10%.The markets sighed relief, but “liberation’” had boomeranged. It was Trump who was imprisoned. He and his sycophants insisted it was all part of a grand plan. Nonsense – he is economically and politically gored.He dare not risk reimposing the same tariffs when the “pause” ends without risking an even worse US debt crisis. Worse, he has killed the prospect of the rest of the world buying the avalanche of new US government debt that will follow from the huge tax cuts he plans in the autumn. The US Federal Reserve has been forced to reassure the markets, still weak, that it will do anything necessary to ensure their stability – another sign of how power is draining from Trump.The EU, Britain and other rule-of-law capitalist democracies now have the balance of advantage. But they need to recognise it and work together to capitalise on the opportunity, rather than each sue for the most advantageous deal possible in their limited “national interest”.This is a moment when the national interest is best pursued by hanging together. The situation remains dangerous. The US’s average tariff, including the 145% on Chinese imports, is the highest for a century. China, with its technological and financial power plus leverage over key raw materials, is on manoeuvres, trying to put itself at the centre of a new order.The EU, Britain and other rule-of-law democracies need to work together rather than pursue their ‘national interest’The democracies must find a common front over the next 90 days as an exercise in damage limitation, and then go beyond that tofashion a new trade order from the ruins of the old– but necessarily without the US. Equally, they must have their eyes wide open about China. While it must be engaged with, it is not a benevolent power. Rather, it is the lynchpin of what author Anne Applebaum has called “Autocracy Inc”, a network of countries including Russia whose aim is to undermine rule-of-law democratic societies, human rights and political pluralism.Britain’s Brexiters – as wilfully ignorant about the damage they have caused and today’s realities asDonald Trump– will vociferously complain, but the EU has to be Europe’s vehicle for the task ahead. Its current stance is an excellent starting point. Its goal is to remove all tariffs and, while it is prepared to negotiate on genuine US trade complaints and buy more US gas, it will use its heft to resist extra-territorial American claims on sovereignty, tax policies or regulation, calmly reserving the right for targeted retaliation if need be. It will certainly defend EU product standards across the board – from digital services to food. And it is open to a closer trade relationship with Canada.But the EU needs to use the 90-day “pause” to get beyond that and ambitiously form a coalition of the willing to create a global pact not to pursue beggar-my-neighbour trade policies, and launch the basis for a global customs union. It would recruit from the G20, extending the invitation to Asia’s Trans Pacific Partnership, the Gulf Co-operation Council, South America’s Mercosur and the Southern African Customs Union. It could be done in parallel with the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a new Global Customs Union Council, aiming ultimately to extend any agreement into common technical and safety standards, and perhaps use the WTO to police its rules and arbitrate disputes. China could join if it accepted the rules.Being outside the EU, Britain cannot be the lead playmaker in this effort, but it must indicate it will play ball – and initiate what it can. Rachel Reeves, writing in theObserverthis week, signals a first step in this direction.Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world but to face forwardRead moreTo be effective, Britain should ally itself with the EU in its negotiations with Trump and go for a much more expansive trade deal with the EU – to include agreement on technical standards – than the timorous one to be unveiled at the joint UK-EU summit in May, even suggesting Gordon Brown, internationally respected for his role in the debt crisis, as the lead sherpa, to show its good faith and commitment to the cause.Any doubts should be dispelled by the numbers. The draft head of terms for the UK-US trade deal ispathetic: minimal concessions from the US while the UK is being forced to shrink its red lines on food standards, product regulation and digital services. The independent forecaster Frontier Economics reckons that the impact of US tariffs will shrink UK GDP by 0.7%, while a deeper deal with the EU could instead lift GDP by 1.5%, despite US tariffs.So what is it to be? Bail out a stricken Trump with a third-rate trade deal on which he will boast Britain has kissed his arse? Or make common cause with the EU to boost our growth and fashion a new global free-trade architecture?Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe ObserverTariffsForeign policyEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

The judge, Jamee Comans, hadgiven the Trump administration a deadlineto produce the evidence required to show that Khalil should be deported. In a functional state, such evidence would rise to a standard of extreme criminality necessitating deportation.But not in this case and certainly not with the Trump administration, which has summarily deportedhundreds of Venezuelan menbased not on any verifiable criminal activity but simply on the basis of their body art. In response to the judge’s order, the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, produced a flimsy one-and-a-half-pagememothat admits that Khalil engaged in no criminal conduct. Instead, the memo, citing an arcane law, stated that Khalil’s “past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations that are otherwise lawful … compromise a compelling US foreign policy interest”. In other words, the government was saying that Khalil’s views – including even his future views – were sufficient grounds for his deportation.To my husband, Mahmoud Khalil: I can’t wait to tell our son of his father’s bravery | Noor AbdallaRead moreMake no mistake. The government is seeking to deport Khalil solely for his constitutionally protected speech, a protection that applies to everyone in the United States. If the government succeeds, you could well be next. And don’t think that your citizenship will protect you. If the government can deny the basic right of freedom of speech to lawful permanent residents, what’s to stop them from going after citizens next? (The administration already has a plan todenaturalizeUS citizens.)Do we really want to live in a country where the government can decide which ideas are allowed to be heard and which cannot? I’m surprised that I even have to write these words. In an open society, free debate is encouraged and needed, while in a closed society, lists of proscribed ideas circulate and proliferate, and it’s frighteningly clear which way we’re headed. The Trump administration has alreadybannedthe use of words and phrases such as “equity”, “women” and “Native American” from government websites and documents, showing us how the open door of American democracy is slamming shut faster and louder than we could have imagined. And Khalil’s case is the test of what this government can achieve.Rubio alleges that Khalil engaged in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States”. But he provides no evidence whatsoever. Meanwhile, here’s what Khalil toldCNNlast year: “As a Palestinian student, I believe that the liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand, and you cannot achieve one without the other. Our movement is a movement for social justice and freedom and equality for everyone.”The attempt to deport Khalil is meant primarily to discipline the people of the United States into silence and conformityIt would seem that Rubio believes the phrase “freedom and equality for everyone” undermines US foreign policy interests. He may finally be right about something. But he’s wrong about Khalil, who clearly is not antisemitic. If Rubio wanted to cleanse the country of the noxious hatred of Jewish people, he could start by examining members of his own party. Marjorie Taylor Greene oncespeculated publiclythat California wildfires were started by a beam from “space solar generators” linked to “Rothschild, Inc”, a disgusting nod to bizarre antisemitic conspiracy theories. Robert F Kennedy Jrsaidthat the coronavirus had been manipulated to make “Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people” the most immune to Covid-19. Elon Musk can barely keep his arm fromextendinginto a salute, Dr Strangelove-style.It’s not some illusory antisemitism that has brought the wrath of the Trump administration raining down on Khalil. It’s the fact that he was standing up for Palestinian rights and calling out Israel’s actions, labelled genocidal byjurists,expertsandinternational human rights organizationsalike. But the US government does not want the American people to even entertain this discussion, which includes American complicity in this human catastrophe that is also US foreign policy, and so it will use every means at its disposal to forestall the possibility, including the bluntest instrument in the political book: mass fear.The attempt to deport Khalil is meant primarily to discipline the people of the United States into silence and conformity. For that reason alone, the government’s actions must be resisted. Healthy societies are based on free thinking and dissent. Unhealthy societies mobilize fear and intimidation to regulate opinion and manufacture consent. Today, that consent is about Israel. Tomorrow, it will be about something else. Either way, it will never be your choice, and it will always be theirs.Many legal observers were anticipating today’s ruling by Comans. Immigration judges are appointed by the Department of Justice. As such, they are employees of the executive branch and not the federal judiciary. The New York Times evennotedthat, had Comans dissented from the government, she would also have “run the risk of being fired by an administration that has targeted dissenters”. The ACLU speculated that the decision to deport Khalil had been “pre-written”, as it was delivered so fast. And Comans stated that the constitutional questions raised by the case will be heard in federal court in New Jersey and not in immigration court in Louisiana.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the contrary, the decision is another dangerous illustration of how much power the executive branch in the United States always wields, how much more power theTrump administrationis willing to assume, and how deferential the institutions that could rein in this administration have become.This structural cowardice on the part of these institutions is doing great harm to the integrity of American democracy, often expressed in some sort of embarrassed whisper. Khalil, on the other hand, speaks loudly and eloquently for his position. At the end of his hearing in Louisiana, Khalil asked to address the court. “You said last time that there’s nothing that’s more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness,” hesaid. “Neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.”Mahmoud Khalil is clearly a remarkable, principled man. He doesn’t deserve this unjust detention the US government is subjecting him to.

Rival attempts to extract a rationale from the chaos include the idea that he is trying to devalue the dollar, or that he is seeking to “reshore” the manufacturing capacity that the US lost through decades of globalisation. My own hunch is that he just wants to show who’s the big boss around here – or as British science fiction authorCharles Stross puts it, that he “expects individual nations to come to him, hat in hand, like terrified shopkeepers pleading for mercy from a mafia don”.Cue the UK’s very own Trump whisperer, Keir Starmer, who,according to Politico, plans “to put a review of online safety rules on the table in trade talks” with the US. Which, translated, means that things such as theOnline Safety Actand copyright rules that hinder US AI companies from looting the intellectual property of the British creative sector may soon become history. The only remaining question is whether Starmer possesses a suitably distressed hat for his penitent journey to Washington.But it turns out that Trump’s obsession with tariffs goes back a long way. In hisbookFear, about the first Trump administration, the journalist Bob Woodward told of how Gary Cohn,the president’s then chief economic adviser, repeatedly tried to explain to Trump that his “antiquated vision of roaring industrial chimneys and clanking steelworks busy with grateful blue-collar workers was no longer applicable, or indeed desirable, to an America reinventing itself in service industries and hi-tech products”. And when, exasperated, he asked the president why he held these views,Trump replied: “I just do. I’ve had these views for 30 years.”So here we are. But instead of steel mills, Trump and his crew have now begun thinking that the Apple iPhone not only should, but could, bemanufactured in the US. The other day, when the White House press secretary was asked whether Trump thought that iPhone manufacturing is the kind of technology that could move to the US, she replied: “Absolutely. He believes we have the labour, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.”The skills needed to put together an iPhone are not widely distributed in a country whose manufacturing has been hollowed out by globalisationThis is, to put it politely, baloney. The skills needed to put together a product ascomplex as an iPhoneare not widely distributed in a country whose manufacturing capacity has been hollowed out by globalisation. The phone’s intricate supply chain is one of the wonders of the manufacturing world – as significant today as Toyota’s“lean” production system , or TPS,was in the mid-20th century. Apple seamlessly integrates components from 43 different countries, a task that has suddenly become even more challenging (and expensive) with the introduction of the Trump tariff regime. Which is why, with admirable foresight, Apple reportedly scheduledfive huge cargo planesfilled with assembled iPhones from China and India to arrive in the US before the tariffs were announced, leaving the company with enough inventory to see it through to the pre-Christmas launch of the iPhone 17. Neat, eh?Bringing manufacturing back home, as Trump claims he wants to do, is much harder than he thinks. A good case study is provided by the lessons that TSMC –the world’s most advanced silicon chip manufacturer– has learned when setting up a new high-end fabrication plant in Arizona. The motivation was that TSMC’s home base is Taiwan and there were western concerns about the risk of a Chinese takeover, plus the fact that the Biden administration was providing lavish subsidies.It’s a huge project, and – as you might expect – has faced difficulties, costs and delays thatwere not anticipated. For example, TSMC couldn’t find enough qualified American talent to do the jobs that the plant needs to function. So 600 new US engineers had to be sent to Taiwan for extensive training. Worse still, because of the shortage of local US talent, it had to recruit additional engineers inTaiwan, who had to be trained and deployed to the US to make TSMC Arizona function (with doubled salaries and extra benefits to boot).And this training wasn’t just the usual two- to four-week corporate offsite stuff, but up to 18 months long. So before the plant produced a single silicon wafer, more than 1,000 engineers had to be trained from scratch. And the company reckons that even when it is working as planned, its output will be 50% more expensive than in Taiwan.And the moral of the story? Bringing manufacturing back home can be done, but not within one electoral cycle.

After birth? Not so muchArwa MahdawiA bill in the US state would allow public schools to deny undocumented children the chance to enrollSat 12 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 09.31 EDTShareThink of the children? NahYou’ve probably seenthis quotefrom an Alabama pastor called Dave Barnhart. It goes viral all the time. But I’m resurfacing the quote because it is another day that ends with “y” in America, which means it is relevant once again.“The unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for,” Barnhart said back in 2018, remarking wryly on the movement’s priorities. “They never make demands of you … They don’t need money, education or childcare … They allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn.”Over inTennessee, there are a lot of lawmakers who are very proud of how much they advocate for unborn children. In 2022, as soon as Roe was overturned, the state passed one of the nation’sstrictest abortion bans– one without explicit exceptions to save the life of a pregnant person. The ban also made performing or attempting to perform anabortionaclass C felony– akin to aggravated assault – which means aiding in an abortion can land you prison time and a hefty fine. That ban has been continuouslychallenged in courtbut the bottom line is that getting an abortion in Tennessee is almost impossible.Those Tennessee lawmakers who love unborn children? Surprise, surprise, they’re not so keen on the born ones. Particularly if those kids are immigrants.On Thursday, the GOP-dominated state senate approved a bill that lets public schools check the citizenship or legal immigration status of every student. Undocumented children can be denied enrollment at these public schools or forced to pay tuition. In other words: Tennessee wants to make it legal to deny undocumented kids an education. By requiring school systems to check legal immigrant status, they’re also turning what should be safe spaces into immigration enforcement centers.All of which, to be clear, is blatantly unconstitutional. In 1982, the supreme court decision in Plyler v Doe found statescannot deny studentsa free public education over their immigration status. The Tennessee bill is not law yet, and if the Tennessee governor does sign it, it will almost certainly face legal challenges. But even if it eventually gets struck down, there is a chance it will stay on the books as a “zombie law”– ready to rise again when circumstances allow.Perhaps you are wondering why all these fierce advocates for the rights of unborn children are so keen on denying kids an education? According to lawmakers who voted for the measure, it’s not because they’re hateful racists who want to punish kids, it’s because they are being fiscally responsible. Their argument is that the state simply doesn’t haveenough money for educationfor undocumented kids, particularly since some will require English language learner classes.Melania Trump’s secret to getting through hard times? Love (actually)Read moreThere’s a small possibility – just throwing it out there – that one of the reasons Tennessee is finding it hard to find money for education is because its regressive tax policies are heavily weighted towards extracting money from the poor rather than making the rich pay their fair share. Tennessee is one of thenine statesin the US that doesn’t have an income tax. It also doesn’t have inheritance tax and has very low business tax. Residents (including undocumented immigrants) pay sales tax, property tax and agrocery tax. Undocumented immigrants are putting money into the system and getting very little out of it. Pretending that this attack on undocumented children is about money is disingenuous. Deep down, I’m sure even the people voting for the bill know that investing in children pays dividends to society.Still, while it is disheartening that a bill like this got as far as it did, it’s also important to note that it faced a lot of opposition. Nearly half of the senate’s members spoke on the bill – many of them, including some Republicans, in passionate disagreement. There were tears and a lot of Bible verses quoted aboutcompassion for children. As the US becomes increasingly dystopian, it’s important that we don’t lose sight of just how much opposition there is to the extremist policies and legislation a hate-filled minority are pushing through.Donald Trumplikes to say that winning the popular vote gave him and his cronies a mandate to do whatever they like; that all the policies getting passed have the support of the people. This simply isn’t true. Onlyaround 32% of eligible votersactually voted for Trump.While we must not minimize the amount of misogyny and racism there is in the US (and there is a lot!), we should also take heart from the fact that a sizable number of Americans do not want to live in an authoritarian dystopia where women have no rights and undocumented kids get no education.Sixty-three percent of Americanssay abortion should be legal in all or most cases according to Pew research from 2024. Most Americans sayundocumented immigrantsshould have a way to stay in the country legally if certain requirements are met. Increasingly, the actions of the American government don’t reflect the views of the American people.Which, of course, is why the Trump administration is so obsessed with undermining education as a whole. From trying to stop undocumented immigrants fromgoing to school, to tightlycontrollinghow Ivy League universities operate, toattempting to eliminatethe US Department of Education, Republicans are waging a war on critical thinking.The US just made it harder for married women to voteOn Thursday the US Houseapprovedthe Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which requires people to prove they are citizens when they vote. If you changed your birth name – as around80% of womenin opposite-sex marriages in the US have – you will have to show a lot more paperwork to vote.Mickey Rourke tells JoJo Siwa he will tie her up and make her straightI had to look up who Rourke is because he hasn’t been relevant for a while. Now, however, he is making headlines for being misogynistic and homophobic on Celebrity Big Brother UK. Rourke, 72, recently told JoJo Siwa (a gay singer and social media personality) that he’d turn her straight. “If I stay [in the Big Brother house] longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more,” Rourke said to Siwa in a clip from Wednesday. “I’ll tie you up,”he added. Rourke got a warning from producers for his language but his comments were not censored. This is in stark contrast to a Big Brother “controversy” last year, when ITV, the broadcaster, edited an episode of the show to remove shots of a T-shirt worn by one of the contestantsfeaturing a watermelon, which is a symbol of Palestinian solidarity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it doesn’t look strategic,”a headline blaredon Wednesday afternoon.At the end of trading, equities had recovered a portion of their losses. But plenty of damage had been done. Markets were thrown into turmoil, interest rates jumped and business activity took a hit. Beyond that, the possibility of a recession grew – and the possibility of a default by the US inched up to 6%, according toprediction markets.Meanwhile, Larry Summers, a treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, announced that arecession appeared imminent. “We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market,” heposted on X. Also on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projected first-quarter growth to benegative 2.4%. By extension, tax receipts will probably have shrunk.Less money coming into the treasury’s coffers means that government could breach the debt ceiling sooner than already projected if Congress eventually fails to act. That is bad news forDonald Trump, the Republicans and the country.Trump was playing chicken with tariffs. Then he chickened out | Steven GreenhouseRead moreBefore Trump transformed the economy into his personal yo-yo, the government stood poised to default on the nation’s $36tn debt sometime in between mid-July and early October,absent legislation. During the president’s walk on the economic wild side,the odds of a recession grew. Ditto the possibility of a default, a reality of which Trump is acutely aware.With Biden in the White House, Trump urged congressional Republicans to stymie efforts to lift the ceiling. “I say to the Republicans out there – congressmen, senators – if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default,” he announced. A default would also mean no social security checks for the US’s seniors.“And I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave, will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen. But it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors.”In May 2023, the Biden administration brokered a compromise with the then House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, to increase the debt ceiling but limit spending. The deal came to cost McCarthy his gig as speaker.As president-elect, however, Trump began singing a very different tune. Suddenly debt didn’t matter. In a mid-December telephone interview, Trump urged Congress to scrap the ceiling permanently. “I would support that entirely,”he told NBC News. Apparently, what was sauce for the Democratic goose was not sauce for the Republican gander.“The Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge.” Christmas came and went. Republican control of the Senate loomed with the new year.In late December, Trump went on the warpath, albeit to no avail. “The Democrats must be forced to take a vote on this treacherous issue NOW, during the Biden Administration, and not in June,”he thundered. “They should be blamed for this potential disaster, not the Republicans!”Nothing happened.Trump’s hopes for the debt ceiling now rest with the Republican-controlled Congress. Republican budget blueprints envision the ceiling being lifted through reconciliation, a process that bypasses the filibuster in the Senate and instead requires a simple majority vote in each chamber.Whether that happens anytime soon is an open question. Punters peg the chance of a pre-June increase of the debt ceiling at one-in-five. Congress loves procrastinating. Nothing focuses their attention like a crisis.Regardless, Trump’s tariff gambit leaves a pile of economic debris, including the market for US bonds. After his flip-flop on tariffs, Trump suggested that the sell-off in the bond market had forced his hand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.”“Queasy” – more like panicked. Or terrified.Practically speaking, the bond rout means the US government will be forced to pay more to borrow – not an ideal situation while Trump and the GOP push for another round of tax cuts.Regardless, the president’s capitulation reinforced the observation of James Carville, Bill Clinton’s storied political adviser. “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter,” he began.“But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody,” including Trump.For the moment, the US appears locked in a battle with China, one of the two largest holders of its debt. Don’t believe there is method to Trump’s madness.“We didn’t have access to lawyers … We wrote it up from our hearts, right?”Trump saidof his Truth Social post announcing the pause. “It was written from the heart, and I think it was well written too.”Let that sink in.

And, over the next few days, I wouldn’t be surprised if he tries to snatch a short Easter break in the warmth and sunshine of that same continent.Football and family holidays offer him some much needed relief from the grim reality of a faltering economy, towering public debt and terrifying global insecurity, which are all being made worse on a daily – sometimes hourly – basis by Britain’s closest ally of the previous 80 years.But that mayhem being caused by Donald Trump’s extended stag party in the White House means that Europe is much more than an occasional distraction for the prime minister. Slowly, if not always surely, it is once again becoming the direction towards which Britain must turn.This is not exactly where Starmer thought he would to be. For all his talk of anEU “reset”, the plan had been to “make Brexit work” within self-imposed “red lines” ruling out joining the single market or a customs union, blocking freedom of movement and appearing to allow only some minor mitigation of the damage done by Boris Johnson’s deal.In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s inauguration, new horizons on the other side of the Atlantic briefly seemed rather more exciting. There was genuine interest in, if not admiration for, this insurgent disruptor of the US’s stuffy political establishment. There was also a prospect that Britain might gain advantage over the EU from a repurposed special relationship being gilded by inviting Trump to hang out with the royals.And, even now, securing some sort of US trade deal that might save thousands of British jobs, or the promise of the minimal military cooperation needed to maintain European security, are still prizes worth having. It’s silly to blame Starmer for trying to win them, or to expect him to strike poses against Trump for the sake of cheap headlines and not much else.What’s changed, however, is a recognition around the cabinet table that the US president is much more of a problem than part of any solution. Gone are the days when a government sourcewould briefit had more in common with Maga Republicans than US Democrats, or Rachel Reeves couldtell Britainto learn from Trump’s optimism and “positivity”. Nowadays ministers say it has become almost futile to anticipate his next move because “he’s only ever reliable in his unpredictability”. Whatever happens next, this is a US administration that can’t be regarded as a stable ally either on the economy or security.Those who think Starmer, in his repeated calls for“cool and calm heads”, is still being excessively polite have perhaps been too busy complaining to have noticed a subtle shift in his language. For instance, when the Times last week ran the headline:“Why Keir Starmer hopes Trump’s tariffs could be good news for the UK”, the rebuttal came from the prime minister himself, withan articlein the same newspaper the next day, which began by stating: “Nobody is pretending that tariffs are good news.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Keir Starmer meeting in the White House on 27 February 2025.Photograph: Daniel Torok/The White HouseOne well-placed Downing Street adviser now describes how Trump “wants to destroy the multilateral institutions” that Starmer believes are essential “to span divides and bring the world together”. Another mentions polling evidence that apparently shows even if a big US trade deal can be done, British voters would still prefer closer links to the EU because they don’t trust Trump to deliver.Certainly, efforts to reset those relations have been pursued with more vigour over recent weeks. These began with Starmer’s “coalition of the willing” to replace the military support for Ukraine that Trump appears so intent on taking away, and will continue ahead of theEU-UK summit on 19 May. More focus on shared interests and values and less on “red lines” should mean asecurity and defence pactis agreed. Also within reach is a so-called veterinary deal to make agricultural trade easier, whilelegislation is already going through parliamentthat would enable UK ministers to align with EU regulations in other areas to the benefit of small exporters.There may yet be a workableyouth mobility schemefor those aged 18-30, which some EU members, notably Germany, regard as a test of whether this government is really different to the last one. Although the proposal was hastily ruled out during last year’s general election, the Treasury is increasingly sympathetic to it because, bysome estimates, it could do more for growth than planning reform and housebuilding combined. At the same time, new cooperation on North Sea windfarms and negotiations to align the UK and EU carbon trading scheme could increase investment, improve energy security and generatebillions of poundsin additional revenue.But there are still limits to this revived EU-UK relationship and it will never go far enough or fast enough to satisfy the many Labour supporters convinced that Brexit was a catastrophic mistake. Those close to Starmer emphasise he’s less interested in “relitigating old arguments from the previous decade” than in finding new ways to pursue the national interest now that “the era of globalisation is over”. Downing Street believes that part of the appeal of both Trump and our homegrown strain of rightwing populism lies in how institutions like the EU became too detached from the people they were meant to serve. In short, they’re determined not to be seen defending the status quo.The Guardian view on Starmer’s choices: time to be bold | EditorialRead moreThe UK wants any security pact to include data-sharing on illegal immigration, which the EU, for its own arcane reasons, may be unwilling to accept. The government will insist that any defence deal must also allow British industry to bid for contracts from a massive new European rearmament fund. That agreement, in turn, could yet be held up by rows with a French government demanding concessions over fish quotas. The hope is that our political leaders prove big enough to hurdle such obstacles. But economic nationalism is not confined to the White House and making meaningful progress in Europe has never been easy.Though Arsenal’s Champions League victory will have been the high point of Starmer’s week, he may reflect that his team haven’t yet reached the semi-final stage of the competition. In politics, as in football, there is much to play for in Europe, and a long way to go.Tom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer: The BiographyExplore more on these topicsTrade policyOpinionKeir StarmerTrump administrationEuropean UnionInternational tradeGlobal economyDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

By learning the lessons of 2008, we can still prevent itSat 12 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 11.58 EDTShareAfter a week that started with the worst financial volatility in recent history and ended with the most serious escalation so far of the China-US conflict, it is time to distinguish the tectonic shifts from the tremors. If nothing changes, the 2020s risks being remembered as this century’s devil’s decade – the term historians once used for the 1930s. It will be defined not just byseven million peoplewho have died of Covid-19 and rising global poverty and inequality – but also by a dismembered Ukraine, a burnt-out Gaza and little-reported atrocities inAfricaand Asia, each testimony to the violent displacement of a rules-based global order by a power-based one.Indeed, before our eyes, every single pillar of the old order is under assault – not just free trade but therule of lawand the primacy we have long attached to human rights and democracy, the self-determination of peoples, and multilateral cooperation between nations, including the humanitarian and environmental responsibilities we once accepted as citizens of the world.Power shifts are, of course, the stuff of history. Within the space of two centuries, four world orders have risen and fallen. The first two – the balance of power that emerged after the defeat of Napoleon in the early 19th century, and the post-1918 Treaty of Versailles system born after four dynastic empires collapsed – ultimately ended in the carnage of world wars. Then came the post-1945 architecture, led by the US and the United Nations; and, after 1990 with the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, what US president George HW Bush called a “new world order”.Now, as the economic balance of powershifts eastwardsand a new mercantilism takes root, what was once called the Washington consensus is no longer supported anywhere – least of all in Washington. Globalisation is now rejected by millions as a “free for all” that has not been fair to all. It is not open trade but the opposite – restrictions on trade – now being popularised as a nation’s route to prosperity.President Trump’s tactical ploy has been to exploit the profound shifts that were already reshaping the world’s geopolitics: first, the yawning gap between the benefits that globalisation promised and what it delivered inpeople’s everyday lives, and so he has become the world’s leading anti-globalist. He also saw how, turbo-charged by social media blitzes landing nonstop via people’s phones, he could resurrect the “great man” theory of history – Putin, Xi, Erdoğan and Kim Jong-un having shown him that populist but dictatorial leaders could set the agenda.But Trump’s sheer unpredictability foreshadows even greater danger ahead. “Let chaos reign and don’t rein in the chaos” seems to be the mantra, and while there may be a lingering hope that something like normal governance might resume soon, this can no longer be a rational basis for anyone’s future planning. Instead, with both the US and China taking risks in accelerating their confrontation to new levels, the question is whether we are descending towards a “one world, two systems” future, or simply the chaotic disorder that has characterised the history of most previous centuries – and whether there is now any chance of building a world order that could ever be stable and sustainable.What’s clear after recent events is that the fourth global order cannot be restored. We are not only in a more protectionist era but are moving from a unipolar world where the US was the sole hegemonic power to one that has many more centres of decision-making power. But because we are also a more interconnected world, we are more vulnerable to crises – from pandemics and climate emergencies to financial contagion. All the more so because countries can, as we saw this week, weaponise that interdependence and the choke points it creates for their own advantage. So if we are to have anything approaching a values-based order we will have at some point to agree an updated global charter for our common future, something that builds on theAtlantic Charter of 1941and theUN Charter of 1945, but is geared to a completely different century.As William Beveridgesaid at that time: “A revolutionary moment in the world’s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.” Over the past few days,calls for multilateral cooperationhave come from the leaders of Spain, Brazil and South Africa, this year’s chairs of three global conferences: the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development, the 30th UN climate change conference and the G20. “As a collective we must now unite to enforce international law,” the Malaysian prime minister and Colombian and South African presidentshave written. “The choice is stark: either we act together to enforce international law or we risk its collapse.”All countries that believe in international cooperation should pledge that through a new multilateralism this generation will deliver global solutions to what are now inescapably global problems that cannot be resolved by nation states acting on their own or in bilateral deals alone. Second, as building blocks of that future, thiscollation of the willingshould immediately engage in practical cooperation on urgent concerns for which no nation state-only answers are possible – global security, climate, health and humanitarian needs as well as the flow of trade. They should work to modernise the international institutions that deliver them.Trump is pushing the world towards recession. By learning the lessons of 2008, we can still prevent it | Gordon BrownRead moreAnd third, we should try to build a bridgehead to sceptics such as Trump by agreeing with him on the need for reciprocity and for fair burden-sharing between nations; and because this is a debt-laden world we should propose innovative and equitable ways to raise the resources needed to turn these commitments into action. By addressing the failures of the era of hyper-globalisation, we can all strive for a world that is not only open to trade but inclusive of all those who have been left behind.Two hundred years ago, in similarly momentous times, aBritish leadercalled “a new world into existence to redress the balance of the old” , and the lesson of history is that any new order that endures has to be built on the solid rock of principle and not the shifting sands of expediency and the narrowest interpretation of national self-interests.At the heart of the Atlantic Charter, the Roosevelt-inspired declaration of international cooperation, was a set of principles celebrating basic freedoms – against the use of force and protectionism, and for the self-determination of nations and national social contracts that would bridge the divide between rich and poor. Even if none of these goals are, as of now, championed by Trump, all is not lost: according to the US Global Leadership Coalition, 82% of Americans oppose isolationism, believing that the US is stronger when “engaged in the world”. And while the US can no longer lead a unipolar world by dictating to others, it can lead a multipolar world through persuasion.Sadly, despiteKeir Starmer’s valiant efforts, none of us can now guarantee that Ukraine – and its resources – will not be carved apart, emboldening autocrats everywhere. But we can set out the moral compass that will guide us and make us better prepared for the challenges ahead. We remain at risk of repeating the 1930s descent into global anarchy; but by nations acting together, we could create a 1940s moment as we start on the herculean task of constructing the fifth world order of modern times.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsBrown on tariffsGlobalisationDonald TrumpTariffsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But the deportation decision is abhorrentJo-Ann MortExpelling the Columbia activist for his views would leave our nation weaker and endanger all of our rightsFri 11 Apr 2025 20.37 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 17.15 EDTShareWhen the federal immigration judge Jamee Comansruled in favorof allowing the government to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and lawful permanent resident, her decision was based on “foreign policy concerns” presented by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. It was so shocking that I had to reread the news report several times before I could believe it.Rubio’s claim is based on Khalil’s leadership role in the anti-Israel protests at Columbia University. I didn’t agree with Khalil’s politics when he led the protests and I don’t agree today with his politics, nor even his actions during the protests. But I’m unwavering in supporting his right to his views, and his right to shout them in what, until Trump took the reins, was our free American nation.As an immigration judge, Comans couldn’t make a constitutional determination. Immigration judges are not actually part of the judicial branch of government; they are part of the executive branch and, as such, don’t rule on constitutional questions but only on issues of immigration law. Therefore, it’s likely – and hopeful – that on further appeal, Khalil’s constitutional right to free speech could be upheld, though less likely than it would have been before the weakening of our constitutional fiber under Trump.Donald Trump has transformed the American story | Osita NwanevuRead moreSince Rubio recently argued that noncitizens, even if here legally, can be deported if they undermine US foreign policy aims, the administration has taken further intimidating action. Today, visa holders and US visitors are finding their social media being examined and their phones taken at the border for searches.From the day he entered office, Rubio has shown himself to be a weak link in preserving the national interest, justifying a range of abuses under the guise of US foreign policy. He has completely crouched under the heavy arm of Trump, forgoing many of his previously long-held beliefs in everything from support for Ukraine to the use of soft aid via USAID, and generally in promoting American values. A child of parents who came to the United States as emigres from Fidel Castro’s Cuba, he once embraced democracy with as much bravado as he is now displaying in helping sink it.To claim that one of the reasons for a deportation like this is to stop antisemitism, as the state department says, is really a ruse to garner support for the widening attack on campus free speech and universities. It is certainly not making Jewish students safer. On the contrary, dividing and conquering to strip higher education and free speech of their very essences endangers every group that has relied on the first amendment’s guarantee.It also strikes me as laughable that the secretary is claiming that Khalil’s presence in the US is harming American foreign policy aims. After all,as I wrote here just last week, what in the world is US foreign policy, especially regarding the Middle East? There is no diplomacy and there are no stated foreign policy goals, unless you consider Trump’s dream of building hotel-casinos on Gaza’s beaches to be formal American policy.If Khalil’s right to remain in the US is not upheld, our nation will be weaker for it, and all our rights will be further endangeredAs Benjamin Netanyahu himself discovered when he traveled to the White House this week, Trump had nothing to offer him. The Israeli prime minister came begging for tariff relief and a green light for continuing his war against Hamas, as well as an even brighter green light to bomb Iran. He was shocked when Trump announced during their joint press availability that he would send his adviser Steve Witkoff to discuss a peace agreement between the US and Iran. Netanyahu went home empty-handed on tariff relief, and stunned at Trump’s sudden dive into talks with Iran.But of course, neither the Gaza beach hotels nor, especially, the deportations of visa holders are about foreign policy. Everything is about domestic policy; the actual purpose is to pit various groups of Americans one against the other. Thememo circulated by Rubioargues that “while Khalil’s activities were otherwise lawful”, his presence in the US would harm efforts by those who were implementing “US policy to combat antisemitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States”.Rubio went on to claim that “condoning antisemitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective”.What does this even mean? On the same day that Khalil’s freedom was being constricted, Witkoff, the White House adviser, had a four-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin, one of the leading purveyors of antisemitism in the world today. What is this administration’s plan for fighting antisemitism on a global scale? There is none, of course.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Worse still, it is to simultaneously try to make us, American Jews, complicit in his evil dealings.The ripple effect of this ruling and the detention of other students, such as Rümeysa Öztürk from Tufts University, is propelling many of us in the American Jewish community to act against the Trump administration. A newamicus brief filedby a coalition of 27 Jewish organizations, supported with pro bono work by the law firm of Davis Wright Tremaine (a firm that deserves a gold star for upholding our constitution, rather than making side deals with the president to crush it), says this: “Without presuming to speak for all of Jewish America – a diverse community that holds a multitude of viewpoints –amiciare compelled to file this brief because the arrest, detention, and potential deportation of Rümeysa Öztürk for her protected speech violate the most basic constitutional rights.”Freedom of expression, particularly on matters of public concern, the brief makes clear, is a cornerstone of American democracy and extends to academic settings and campus discourse. I’m proud to say that my synagogue, Congregation Beth Elohim, in Brooklyn, is a signatory of the brief, along with an organization, New Jewish Narratives, where I serve on the board.Tonight begins the Jewish festival of Passover, a festival of liberation and freedom. It marks a journey that the ancient Jews who were slaves in Egypt took from servitude to freedom. It is a time when Jews around the world proclaim: “Let my people go,” as we see our own fight for freedom in the eyes of those who remain unfree. For me, the freeing of the Israeli hostages is central to the Passover message, as is the freedom of both the Palestinian people and the Israelis to live in a state where they are free from fear and have a vibrant democracy.It’s a vibrant democracy that I wish, too, for the United States. And, at my Passover table, I will pledge to fight to maintain and strengthen the bonds of all peoples here in the US toward collective action that defends and maintains our democracy. If Khalil’s right to remain in the US is not upheld, our nation will be weaker for it, and all our rights will be further endangered.Jo-Ann Mort, who writes and reports frequently about Israel/Palestine, is also the author of the forthcoming book of poetry, A Precise Chaos.

For the Wirrpanda family who live in the remote North-East Arnhem Land outstation of Dhuruputjpi, it is now 90 years and counting. This is the story of a police death, a famous miscarriage of justice and a likely murder.The long-running saga resurfaced recently when theNorthern Territorycoroner released findings into the 1934 disappearance of Dhäkiyarr Wirrpanda who was last seen in Darwin a day after the high court ruled to overturn his conviction for the murder of Northern Territory police constable Albert McColl on Guwaŋarripa (Woodah Island) in Blue Mud Bay, North-East Arnhem Land in 1933.When the NT police force’s cold case taskforce began its investigation last year, the disappearance of Dhäkiyarr Wirrpanda remained one of Australia’s oldest missing person cases. Dhäkiyarr was last seen alive on 10 November 1934.View image in fullscreenDhukal Wirrpanda at Dhuruputjpi in 2023.Photograph: Tom MurrayDhukal Wirrpanda, the grandson of Dhäkiyarr Wirrpanda, says “that’s a long time ago – 1934. We’ve been waiting since then and we still don’t know what happened to him. If somebody knows then they are keeping it secret, but we lost our leader and we lost all of his knowledge and power.” It is a sentiment consistently and emotionally expressed by the family, with Dhäkiyarr’s nephew, legendary leader and artist Gawirrin Gumana AO, calling for an enquiry and informationover two decades ago.In1933-34 it had been a case that rocked the nation. It began when a group of Japanese fishermen were killed in Arnhem Land and a police party sent to investigate the circumstances of these deaths the following year.One of those policemen, Constable McColl, chained a group of women as part of the investigation, and when Dhäkiyarr Wirrpanda returned from a hunting trip he discovered this scene. On his own Country and believing he was subject to his own law, Dhäkiyarr speared the policeman to release his wife, Djaparri, and the other women. There are many versions of this story, but this is the one that was recounted by Mulkun Wirrpanda, Djaparri’s daughter, in the filmDhäkiyarr vs the King.The killing of a policeman by Indigenous people ignited a national culture war in 1933. The NT administrator Robert Weddell said the federal government needed to use a “strong demonstrative force” where “casualties amongst these Aboriginals [are considered] inevitable”. Infront-page news in the Melbourne Heraldhe argued that a punitive expedition was required to “teach the natives a lesson”.This was just four years after the devastatingmassacre of Warlpiri, Anmatyerre and Kaytetye First Nations people at Coniston in 1928, and public sentiment was being mobilised by various groups to“stop the war on Aborigines”. Large-scale demonstrations against the intended military solution were successful and government policy was changed, with prime minister Joseph Lyons instead supportive of a “peace mission” of church missionaries to visit the Yolngu communities.In 1933 the missionaries convinced a group of Yolngu men, including Dhäkiyarr and men from the Djapu and other clans, to travel to Darwin to face justice. As a result, in a four-day trial held from 3 to 6 August in the NT supreme court before Judge Thomas Wells, Dhäkiyarr was found guilty of the murder of McColl and sentenced to death by hanging. After a national outcry and protest action against the injustice of this decision, it was appealed to the high court. The case, known as Tuckiar v the King, was overturned in the high court of Australia on 8 November 1934, when the court found the trial had“seriously miscarried” due to prejudice.View image in fullscreenDhäkiyarr Wirrpanda (left) handcuffed to his nephew Mirera Ŋurruwuttun in Darwin in 1934.Photograph: Eric WilsonThe recentNT coroners reportdetails how the high court then ordered Dhäkiyarr ’s immediate release, with Justice Hayden Starke adding that he assumed “steps would be taken by the commonwealth to arrange for ‘Tokia’ to be sent to his own country”.“But he never came home. He never came back home to us,” says Dhukal Wirrpanda. “This is the thing we have been asking. He disappeared in police custody at Kahlin Compound and we have never heard what happened to him since then”.The killing times: a massacre map of Australia’s frontier warsRead moreThe 2025 NT police cold case unit report noted “two prominent scenarios about what may have happened to Dhäkiyarr are that: (a) he left the Kahlin Compound on his own accord to travel home and perished sometime thereafter; or (b) he was murdered by members of the Northern Territory Police Force in retribution for the killing of McColl.”Family members, none of who were interviewed by the coroner, do not think it likely he would have tried to travel home alone on the day of his release. Dhukal Wirrpanda said: “Darwin is a long way from here, he would have been expecting help to get home to us family.”View image in fullscreenFilming a remembrance ceremony for Dhäkiyarr Wirrpanda in Dhuruputjpi in 2003.Photograph: Tom Murray“Twenty years ago we went to Darwin seeking information and justice, and we had a Wukidi ceremony in the supreme court to try to find out what happened to him. We thought this coroners report might add something, but we are disappointed.”The 2025 NT coroners report does document a theory offered by “two old Darwinites” to Ted Egan in 1994: “That a policeman called Vic Hall shot Tuckier.” This was a reference to Mounted Constable Victor Charles Hall who was the leader of the police expedition sent to investigate the Japanese deaths, of which Constable McColl was a member when he died. But the report concluded that while there was a motive for a then serving member of the police force to harm Dhäkiyarr, “in the absence of any living witnesses, forensic evidence, or a body” this theory couldn’t be confirmed or categorically ruled out.Disappointingly, the coroner found that: “The deceased was not, immediately before death, a person held in care or custody.”Dhukal Wirrpanda is adamant this cannot be the case. “If this is true then who was in charge of his care? Who had responsibility and was looking out for him? No one brought him home. It is a clear picture from my mind. The Northern Territory didn’t do their job. They killed him. The police, their people, they did that. Where is the justice? I ask you to consider our pain and loss. The coroner is wrong in this. It is simple. We need honesty. It is over 90 years now and we still don’t have justice for our family.”Tom Murray is a film-maker who has maderadioandscreendocumentaries about Dhäkiyarr Wirrpanda.

The game enables children to explore and reconfigure a creative digital environment, accumulating resources in a world built from blocks. The movie enables children to explore and reconfigure the codes of basic decency in a cinema environment, testing the limits of any hapless usher left to supervise.A Minecraft Moviemeans mischief. In recent days, a viral trend has encouraged audiences to wait for the onscreen moment when a zombie jumps piggyback on to a chicken – yes, actually – then toerupt into chaos, hurling popcorn around the theatre. The cue for action is marked by a character played by Jack Black, who spots the zombie-chicken combo and yells “chicken jockey!”. In a video of one such incident, a tween carrying a real-life chicken is paraded on the shoulders of a friend through cinema seats. It was the chicken jockey to end all chicken jockeys.Clearly, the phenomenon is a nightmare for cinema staff, given the debris of snack foods crunched into carpets. Equally clearly, no adult arrives atA Minecraft Moviewith an expectation of rapt silence. The exuberance of children recognising a key moment from their own gameplay should hardly inspire the disapproval some of us reserve for the oaf who disrupts an art house cinema. (I speak as someone with an acute sensitivity to noise and a long-honed repertoire of judgy looks.) A Krzysztof Kieślowski retrospective requires silence; the latest Jack Black vehicle does not.If your tween is participating in the “chicken jockey” phenomenon, it’s less likely to be an act of rebellion, heralding a lifetime of social delinquency, so much as a requisite act of conformity. DuringAMinecraftMovie’s first weekend, very little disruption was reported in Britain. Now all the kids are doing it, inflamed by widely circulated news that a cinema in New Jersey had kicked back by banning unaccompanied minors. Cue British cinemas following suit; cue large parties of tweens proudly filming themselves flouting the rules; cue adult outrage. Childhood trends come and go, but the features of the mass hysteria around them stay largely the same.The “chicken jockey” phenomenon is largely harmless – unless you’re the minimum-wage cinema staff who have to clear up. Warner Bros, desperate to create in-person experiences that require streaming audiences to return to cinema, has encouraged the trend, with director Jared Hess telling the world: “I’m just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.” It’s a messier version of the push to get women to head to cinemas wearing pink forBarbieor green forWicked.The strongest case for keeping quiet in a theatre is that it’s profoundly selfish to distract the performersYet the dispute lands just as audiences on both sides of the Atlantic are caught up in a feverish debate about post-Covid etiquette at cinemas, theatres and live music events. Producers and investors face the same dilemma. In a sector desperate for bums on seats, how far can they encourage traditional audiences to remember their visit as a participatory event? How far do the construction of “in-person” phenomena alienate existing audiences and disrupt the art itself?The crisis sparked by our shifting norms during shared experiences has been most pronounced in theatre. Last year, two sisters were convicted of assault after punching a couple who asked them to keep quiet during a Glasgow performance ofJersey Boys: the court heard that the defendants, a nurse and a care-worker, had earlier in the altercation defended their right to make a noise as part of “enjoying themselves”.It was only one of a series of incidents that have made headlines in the entertainment press. In April 2023, Alison Hammond and Vanessa Feltz were forced to apologise after advocating for the right to sing along in the audience when attending a musical. “Isn’t that what everybody does very, very loudly while eating an ice-cream?” asked Feltz on ITV’sThis Morning. Nope, replied furious musical theatre professionals on social media.As someone who spends up to four evenings a week at the theatre – a perk of my side-gig as a theatre critic – I’m a martinet about people making noise in the stalls. Live theatre depends on a shared experience and a shared commitment to concentration. The strongest case for keeping quiet in a theatre is that it’s profoundly selfish to distract the performers. While our screen age might have numbed some audiences into consuming all storytelling as if it’s projected from an LED monitor, actors and classical musicians are profoundly affected by distractions. As one singer tells me: “We hear every sweet wrapper; we see each light from a mobile phone.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In theatre, as in music, it is suggested that audiences forgot how to behave after the long Covid hiatus. I also blame the alcohol offers that venue owners, desperate for revenue streams after the pandemic, now push in “premium” packages.In response, directors have finally accepted the need to remind theatregoers of basic behaviour, often with a pre-curtain speech by an actor. For years, the idea was sneered at by theatre’s progressives as “elitist” or “gatekeeping”, but it works. (I’ve never seen so many people turn off phones as when sharply instructed to do so by snobbish Emily, in character, inThe Devil Wears Prada.) In Thomas Ostermeier’s recent version ofThe Seagull,we had a parody of such pre-curtain announcements, with one character encouraging the audience to “be present”, before reading out a list of rapid-fire prohibitions on everything from snogging to laughing. It still worked.But although disruption has less impact on film than in theatre, film-makers have long understood that our experience in any cinema is shaped by those with whom we share it.A Minecraft Moviereminded me of a very different film: Maggie Gyllenhaal’s sensitive adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novelThe Lost Daughter. Olivia Colman stars as a solo female holidaymaker, fighting for respect from a raucous mafia family in the same resort. In a scene that any lone woman who stands up for herself will recognise, their adolescent sons wilfully disrupt her experience of watching a movie by throwing popcorn. The question of who controls the soundscape at any collective experience is a question about who has power; who feels untouchable. Maybe it is time for the grownups to lay down the law.Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsFilmOpinionA Minecraft MovieTheatreMinecraftcommentShareReuse this content"

And swiftly on its heels,the parable of the dire wolf. We’d rather resurrect a 12,500-year-old species from the dead than save our existing wild animals. Of course we would. Recycling is boring; doing the very thing 90s science fiction movies warned us not to do is fun.We are not quite on the verge of bringing back ancient species. But last week the PR campaign for doing so began in earnest.Colossal Biosciences– a company known for trying to revive the dodo, the mammoth and the thylacine – has unveiled three large adorable white puppies, claiming it has created “the world’s first successfully de-extincted animal”: the dire wolf, made famous byGame of Thrones. It invited authorGeorge RR Martinto look; he duly burst into tears.Scientists have been quick to point out that the companyhasn’t done anything of the sort: it has instead created a new animal altogether – a larger, whiter, more muscly wolf. To do so, researchers made edits to the grey wolf genome, and then implanted the resulting embryos in large dogs, extracting them by caesarean section. The puppies look like dire wolves, but what gives the project away is the fact that this is down to just 20 gene edits made on a genome of billions of bases – which makes them closer to the grey wolf than anything else.There is little point bringing back an animal if we simply drive it to extinction againStill, it’s a tremendous achievement, and was announced alongside another: the company has cloned four red wolf pups, a species with fewer than 20 in the wild. This could help to revive their thinning population. Does this herald a solution to declining biodiversity and dying ecosystems?Not quite yet. Let’s start with the obvious ethical problem: the welfare of these animals. The first generation of an extinct species will arrive without kin. Wolves are sociable creatures, but the three novel pups have no pack to join, and no parents to teach them how to survive and thrive. Nor can they be released into their natural habitat, as it no longer exists. Colossal plans to keep the three “dire wolves” in (spacious) captivity for their whole life – there is of course no other solution. They will not be allowed to breed. In fact, it is hard to imagine a future for ancient animals like the dire wolf that doesn’t involve life in a zoo, kept as exotic curiosities.At this point some employ the brutal argument zoos often do: the suffering of these animals has a greater purpose; sacrificing the welfare of a few charismatic creatures will indirectly help others. Just as keeping animals on pitiful display supposedly drives enthusiasm for conservation, so excitement over a resurrected mammoth might attract funding, advancing technology that could be repurposed for worthier efforts, such as bolstering populations of endangered animals and plants.But it’s a bargain that doesn’t add up. You do not need to recreate the dire wolf or the dodo in order to work on the red wolf. And shouldn’t the imminent extinction risk of swathes of creatures be motivation in itself? Are we such children that we need zoos andGame of Thronesto tempt us into saving the planet?Would de-extinction work, even in the most promising cases? Let’s say we dispensed with the ridiculous project of reviving long-dead creatures and focused our efforts on animals that went extinct recently, for whom some habitat remains.Two problems stand in our way. First, it is incredibly hard to release captive-bred animals, which do not know how to survive in the wild. Humans have not yet learned to train them in artificial environments – and we may never work out how.Second: there is little point bringing back an animal if we simply drive it to extinction again. Most animals die out because of climate change and the destruction of ecosystems. De-extinction is not an alternative to conservation – we would have to do both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhich brings us to the most important argument against de-extinction: the “opportunity costs”, or the benefits that could be lost by supporting it. It may be better to spend on the living than the dead. Astudy published inNaturehas calculated that maintaining a population of resurrected animals would be so expensive that two species would die out for every one revived, should the money come out of government conservation budgets. If private money were redirected from de-extinction to conservation, two to eight times more speciescould be saved. In other words, if Colossal wants to “fix extinction”, its enormous budget and technological genius would be better employed saving orangutans, blue whales and mountain gorillas.In fact, the opportunity costs may be starker: critics have warned that the idea we can bring back species will undermine conservation. They were swiftly proved right. Trump’s administration hailed Colossal’s claims to argue forslashing endangered species protections. “Going forward, we must celebrate removals from the endangered list – not additions,” US interior secretary Doug Burgum has said. “If we’re going to be in anguish about losing a species, now we have an opportunity to bring them back.

He wants to come in and occasionally lunges at the window to make his point. I’m not even sure what he is grumpy about – it’s a great week for Brian. Because blue tit sightings (sorry, did I mention Brian is a blue tit, orCyanistes caeruleusas he’d put it on his LinkedIn?) in gardens were up almost 10% on the previous year in theRSPB 2024 Big Garden Birdwatch. Meanwhile,Cosmopolitanmagazineinsists sky blueis the “must-have hue” for spring.Maybe Brian is crotchety because, despite his beauty and soprano trill, he remains in the No 2 slot of most-spotted birds, another year trailing to the frankly rather drab house sparrow. Or maybe he’s in a flap because all media attention has focused on the collapse in starling numbers – the lowest since counting began in 1979.I’ve tried explaining to Brian that we journalists are trained to focus on bad news – and that starlings being on a red list of endangered bird species is just that. But I sense he has a certain scorn for the groupthink mindset of starlings and their murmurating. Like a Channel swimmer’s disdain for a synchronised swim squad.Overall, there is little good news in the annual bird survey. In the five years to 2023, bird populations have declined by 2% across the UK, and by 7% in England due to climate crisis, loss of natural habitats and bird flu.The RSPB suggests we make small changes in our gardens, such as leaving grass uncut and avoiding pesticides to help survival rates. But maybe there is an even easier first step – to make friends with our feathered visitors.Brian and I met on the avian equivalent of Tinder, an online app called ChirpOMatic, which identifies birdsong and markings and has alerted me to so many birds stopping for a breather in my patch of garden. If only we could find time to truly appreciate the beauty and friendship of birds, even we naturally destructive humans might instinctively become their protectors…Pastry pilferingView image in fullscreenThe UK’s most popular ‘dining brand’, Greggs, is reporting a record number of shoplifters.Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/ShutterstockTheSunnewspaper undertook an excellent investigation last week – monitoring dozens of people going into branches of Greggs andwandering out without payingfor bakes, biscuits and doughnuts.We’ve been reading about the shoplifting epidemic for years. What we are dealing with is very occasionally incidents of people in real need acting out of desperation, and more often people who no longer wish to play by the rules, such as paying for their steak bake.There is a host of reasons why people may feel so disengaged from society that they no longer want to shell out for a sausage roll, all the way from rampant inequality, lack of trust in politics and big business, to atomisation and polarisation due to social media algorithms. But the moral argument – which the right is so much more effective at making – is that it’s simply bang out of order.The Greggs investigation is so impactful because the bakery chain lies at the heart of British life. A survey last year showed it was the UK’s most popular “dining brand”. And for every shoplifter, there are a dozen lowish-paid Greggs workers and customers forced to witness this sneering at the rules. Those are the people who need to see police officers in town centres, asannounced by the home secretary last week. If they don’t, they’ll be voting for whoever convinces them they will. It’s time to get tough on pastry pilfering – and the causes of pastry pilfering.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What’s emerged about it since points to a much darker truthLaura HallStedsans seemed to embody Scandinavia’s love of nature – until its owners moved to Guatemala, apparently leaving behind 158 barrels of human wasteSat 12 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 08.25 EDTShareFor me, visiting thenow infamousStedsans eco-retreat in Halland, southern Sweden was the apotheosis of the Scandinavian dream: apple-cheeked children running barefoot on the forest floor, a lake for swimming, a sauna to warm up in, simple cabins for sleeping and dinner served in the evening on a long table surrounded by trees. When I booked to stay back in 2022 to celebrate my wedding anniversary, it felt like I was going to be walking straight into my Instagram feed, flower-strewn dishes and all.Only now, it seems like that was as fantastical as it first appeared. This week, a jointinvestigationby the daily newspapers Dagens Nyheter in Sweden and Politiken in Denmark found the owners of the eco-conscious retreat, chef Flemming Hansen and food writer Mette Helbæk, were now living in Guatemala after apparently going on the run from tax authorities, leaving behind multiple animals and 158 barrels of human waste. The investigation also claimed that waste water was left to run into the forest, with local authorities describing their purported actions as “environmental crime”.It’s a case that has shocked Scandinavia: Stedsans had attracted international acclaim as the poster child for eco-friendly living – a real example ofThe Good Life, Scandinavian edition, showing it was possible to live in harmony with nature, run a successful business and bring up a family while doing it. No wonder it all felt too good to be true. The couplereportedlyowe the Swedish tax authorities in excess of 6m Swedish krona (£470,000), and have since started a new hotel business in Guatemala.View image in fullscreenMette Helbæk and Flemming Hansen.Photograph: Stedsans in the WoodsI find this reality hard to square with the way Helbæk presented the retreat to me in a Zoom interview some months before my visit. She told me about the couple’s desire to build a happy place to bring up their children in an ancient forest, and how lucky they had been to find this one that she felt she had a special connection to: “It’s growing on me that I can hear what trees say to me … and I can sit down and talk to a plant and it will answer me back.” Apparently the forest was giving her messages of love and light, and spirit guides had told her to create peace between all life forms. I wonder what the forest and her spirit guides are whispering about her now – and the authorities who failed to show up and shut them down earlier.What happened at Stedsans goes beyond the story of a couple claiming to run a Swedish eco-resort while apparently secretly pumping effluent into the forest floor. It calls into question the whole premise of sustainable tourism in the country. In a message posted on their website, Helbæk and Hansen wrote: “We came very far with Stedsans, but we also had to realise on the way that being soul-driven entrepreneurs on a mission in a country where taxes are some of the highest in the world and bureaucracy is relentless, it is an impossible task.” Tourism in this part of the world centres on its extraordinary nature and finding ways to get in touch with it, hike in it, and explore it. If you can’t make a back to nature, simple eco-resort work inSweden, where can you?As a travel writer working in Scandinavia, I’ve stayed at other resorts in this region that have been inspired by Stedsans and met young, idealistic hospitality workers who talked about Helbæk and Hansen as though they were heroes. If what happened at Stedsans makes others believe that running an eco-friendly project is “impossible”, Hansen and Helbæk will have damaged more than a small patch of a Swedish forest. Because it’s not true: I’ve met hotel owners all over the region with far lower profiles who can anddomake it work within environmental guidelines – so why couldn’t they?Couple who ran Swedish eco-retreat fled leaving behind barrels of human wasteRead moreMany people around the world tend to idolise Scandinavia: it’s the region ofhyggeandlagomand all these difficult to translate concepts that seem like they hold the secret to living a good life. But we should also remember it’s the home of Scandi noir: crime stories where dark things can happen in the vast expanses of countryside, where there are no neighbours to see what you’re doing and it’s easy to find somewhere quiet to bury a body.As a Brit living in Copenhagen, I’ve often found it hard to marry up those two opposing presentations of Scandinavia but this story does it well: it starts out in a woodland paradise where foraged herbs are steeped for herbal tea, then takes a dark turn as the owners escape to a country where their tax debts can’t follow them. It’s a reminder that nowhere is perfect, not even Scandinavia, and that we should all be wary of taking national stereotypes to heart. After all, Sweden is just like everywhere else: where there’s money to be made, even in nature, there will be bad actors too. It’s also a reminder, as if another were needed, not to take what you see on Instagram at face value.Laura Hall is a freelance journalist based in Scandinavia, and writes the monthly newsletterModern ScandinavianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The man was Dr Dean Nicolle and the tree was actually 10,000 eucalypt trees and mallees, of over 800 species, which Dean has been planting on a block of land south of Adelaide since 1993.Dean’s passion for eucalypts is incredible. It makes me realise that so much conservation happens purely because someone is just absolutely captivated by something. And thank goodness Dean is, because his love for the eucalypt made the Currency Creek Arboretum, which is designed to bring together all of Australia’s eucalypt species in one place for research.During my visit, I’m taken aback by the beige-brown landscape, and how the grass crunches like cornflakes underfoot. South Australia is in the grip of its worst drought in 40 years. Dean is conducting drought studies on his trees, about a third of which are dying, or have curled up and died in the last few months. He says he’s noticed the drought has particularly affected the stringybarks in the Adelaide Hills.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jess Harwood/The GuardianAs a communications professional working in climate media for years, I am used to reading terrible climate news but this hits different. There is something about seeing trees dry out and turn brown, with bark splitting and leaves desiccating, that makes my insides knot.I feel like there’s a warning implanted deep in my subconscious from way, way back that says: if the trees can’t survive, neither can you.‘Every year matters’: Queensland’s critically endangered ‘bum-breathing’ turtle battles the oddsRead moreOf course, eucalypts are historically a great survival story. Known generally ashardy and drought-resistant, Australia’s iconic eucalypts have weathered ice ages and count their lineage from52m years ago, when Australia was still part of Gondwanaland.There’s also evidence that they’ve survived bushfiresfor millions of years.Can they survive us? As burning Australia’s coal and gas fuels more severe and frequent bushfires, heatwaves and droughts (on top of land clearing, deforestation and disease), our trees are finding their limits.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has warned that25% of eucalypts are at risk of extinction, with more added to their Red List of threatened species in 2019.With about 840 species, eucalypts are highly diverse but many species only have a small distribution and are highly adapted to that particular area. This can make them particularly susceptible to localised climate impacts. If only trees could uproot themselves and walk to a more favourable location and climate.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jess Harwood/The GuardianTake Tasmania’s stunning tall forests, for example, home toEucalyptus regnans, the tallest flowering tree in the world. They grow to their impressive height because they have adapted to cool summers and high rainfall. This means they have little wriggle room and a changing climate, with moredroughtsandheatwaves, is causing dieback. The increased frequency and intensity of bushfires has also seen60% of Tasmania’s largest known eucalypts killed by fires since 2004.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jess Harwood/The GuardianOver lunch after the Currency Creek Arboretum visit, Dean, his partner Annett and I chat about how we cope with “solastalgia” (or eco-anxiety) and watching extinctions in real time.Dean says he is trying to view the death of trees he’s nurtured for decades through a research lens. Annett, also a scientist, enjoys kickboxing to cope with these big feelings. I say I find swearing helpful.More useful than swearing, however, is the work being done to protect vulnerable populations, and invest in adaptation and research such as theNardoo climate-ready revegetationproject.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jess Harwood/The GuardianMeanwhile, I will try to do my little bit to foster a love of eucalypts through art and comics. During the long drive back from Adelaide to Sydney, as the landscape turns from brown to green again, I keep looking at the bag of gumnuts Dean gave me to draw. They are like wondrous jewels. I want everyone to know and love them so they can have a safe future.Jess is a cartoonist, environmental storyteller and current Dahl fellow with Eucalypt AustraliaExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsLast chanceConservationClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

But with a bit of planning, there are ways topack a lunch that gets eatenand reduce waste in the process. Here, readers share their tips for better packed lunches and ways to cut waste.Get kids involvedGet kids to choose and prepare their own food. If you hand them something and they don’t know where it came from, they’ll turn up their nose; let them wash, cut, prepare any food and they’ll proudly eat it while telling their friends they made it themselves!–AnonymousWe have been talking about food and nutrients for a while, and we developed a list of things, so now they pack their lunch: one or two pieces of fruit; one or two pieces of vegetables; carbs (cake, biscuits, corn crackers, etc); nuts or pickled vegetables; and a sandwich (now Vegemite and cheese is a favourite), or leftovers if there’s any (they love pasta). We cook on weekends and they have kids’ cooking books from which they can choose what they want to do. They mostly eat their lunches!– MJDirty laundry: what really happens to your clothes when you donate them to charity?Read moreAbsolutely get the kids involved, eg writing the weekly meal plan and shopping list. Would they prefer chicken or cheese in a sandwich or wrap? Then getting them to prep the night before where appropriate, rather than Mum at 7am. And always include “What salady bits?” as an expected question. Sugar snap peas are a great fave of our two. Also, if the school publishes lunch menus in advance, then make the most of choosing School Lunch instead of Packed on the days when there’s a healthy and happy option to preselect. – AnonymousRethink how you reuseI try and reuse waste where possible – steam carrot sticks and serve at dinner, cook cut fruit and puree and freeze for use in porridge or baked goods as a sweetener. Or serve lunch leftovers that are still OK as afternoon tea! – ClaireMost leftovers go to the chickens or worm farm, but if fruit is still looking reasonably OK in the afternoon I add it to a post-school smoothie or smoothie icy poles. – PippaMenu ideasI cook my kids’ school meals for the week every Sunday. I come from the Nordics and having a sandwich every day at lunch is anathema. A sample menu: two days of celeriac and potato mash with breaded chicken fillets (thermos cup), side of fruit (kiwi, mango, berries), a home-baked loaf slice and yoghurt or cheese. Then two days of pasta with homemade sauce (I roast lots of veg with tinned tomatoes and herbs and blend it all) and parmesan and a third day of fish and mash or stew. I alternate the days for pasta/meat dish. The next week might be meatballs and sweet potato and regular potato mash alternating with cottage pie. This ensures a notionally healthy weekly base that has enough protein, fibre and calcium without the empty carbs.Foodis the easiest and most foundational way of looking after our health. – KarenMy son actually gets the same every day: ham and cheese salad sandwich, an apple, a nut bar, pack of crisps. Same base every day but I change up the crisps or bars. Simple but nourishing and he eats everything. – BoletteBe realisticGet the kids involved in drawing up the shopping list and planning that week’s lunches and in making the lunches the evening before. Be realistic: have a ratio of two healthy things and one treat. – AnonymousWindow shopping: is double glazing the answer to improving your home’s energy efficiency? Here’s our guideRead moreBoys, especially, want to run off and secure sports equipment as soon as the bell rings. They’re the main food dumpers. Too much lunch is the biggest bugbear and certainly contributes to huge wastage. Cut-up apples go brown, browning bananas are really unpopular. Don’t pack anything that needs peeling. Little snacks (things like crackers and raisins, grapes, cheese) are best. – Ex-year 2 teacher ToniPack wellI sent reusable containers, ice packs and cooler bags to keep the food fresh and my kid mostly ate fruit, veg and a sandwich each day. Apples, cucumbers, carrots, crackers and cheese in a reusable container were common staples. My kid hated the canteen and was happy to eat the same food every day, which also made the process easier. – AnonymousI’ve found that bento-style boxes are actually great at keeping food fresher for longer, and I’ve invested in a couple of cute Japanese boiled egg moulds which I can prep ahead of time, which makes an otherwise boring food look a bit more appealing. I also have the opportunity to check the lunchbox when my child arrives home, so I can (kindly) discuss what didn’t get eaten and work out if something else might be better, and I try to use any leftovers as part of an afternoon snack. – AnonymousSharing is caringOur children are asked to bring one fruit and one veggie to share with the class and one parent a week brings hummus and a cheese block for the class to share. This is alongside their lunchbox for morning tea and lunch, which I can then pack less in, knowing the class have shared “buffet brunch” for morning snack and afternoon tea. It’s lovely communal eating, which encourages them to try new things and I can tick that they’ve had a couple of different fruit and vegetables each day. Makes packing a lunchbox less stressful. – CharlotteExplore more on these topicsFoodChange by degreesEthical and green livingShareReuse this content"

It feels like history is repeating itself, he saysSat 12 Apr 2025 06.55 EDTShareRamy Youssef has this theory: “The more fucked up the climate, the stupider television must be.” Granted, he came up with it barely 10 seconds ago, but the 34-year-old is committing. “You need something dumb,” he’s newly certain, “to cut through the tension for relief.” Now he’s frantically tapping away on his phone, searching for facts to prove it. Bingo. “You see, [MTV celebrity prank show] Punk’d premiered on 17 March 2003. Know what happened three days later? The US invaded Iraq. Maybe my stupid new show is perfect for howfuckedeverything is right now.”In particular, Youssef is pointing to Palestine: his2024 heartfelt SNL monologuecalling for an end to the violence one of a litany of interventions he’s made in recent years. “I’ve sat down with too many people who’ve just lost entire sections of their families.” Does he feel speaking out could come at a cost to his career? “If I was constantly waiting to be cast,” he says, “I might not be so busy. We make TV like immigrants: not waiting around for someone else. We’re trying to speak to something human, even if we do it while people are trying to dehumanise us, our culture, where we come from and who we are.”We’re meeting in a downtown Manhattan hotel, late on an icy, mid-February Friday; Youssef lives with his wife and dog in Brooklyn. He is all smiles as he bops into the lobby sporting a baseball cap embroidered with “Sufi Centre of North Jersey”, a nod to the fictional community centre in Golden Globe-winning Ramy – a three season-deep comedy drama about a directionless, idiosyncratic millennial Muslim American. Youssef is its co-creator and star.View image in fullscreenWeird science … Ramy Youssef and Willem Dafoe in Poor Things.Photograph: Yorgos Lanthimos/Searchlight PicturesHis new, “stupid” show is an animation called #1 Happy Family USA. Its protagonist is 12-year-old Rumi (it’s onlysemi-autobiographical), and it opens at the Hussein family’s suburban east coast home, halal food truck parked out front, on 10 September 2001 – all inside naive to the global upheaval tomorrow brings. “It’s hard to avoid the obviously dramatic things in it,” says Youssef: an act of mass terror, a seismic shift in geopolitics, an explosion of Islamophobic prejudice. “It being a cartoon undercuts all that heaviness, and allows us to laugh at what happened, and reflect. South Park did that for me growing up. Often, it was more nuanced than anything on CNN, then suddenly it went back to crudeness.”As a kid you don’t know what’s happening. I had a recurring dream that Bin Laden was in my kitchenLike South Park, Youssef’s show uses a pre-adolescent outlook to its advantage. “Global things feel personal at that age,” Youssef says, “and personal things feel global. It’s like, ‘Oh my God, this tragedy happened’, alongside, ‘Oh my God, I love this girl’. At that age, it’s all at the same volume.” One minute, Rumi is pained, fantasising unrequitedly about his teacher to the sound of K-Ci & JoJo, the next, his uncle is arrested – soon to be #1 Prisoner in Guantánamo – simply for having “terrorist vibes”.Astute observations and sharp satire sit alongside farcical sequences: at the mosque, Rumi’s mother meets an undercover FBI agent who introduces herself as “Carol, from Mecca”; his father, invited on to Fox News, is billed as “Halal Harry”. Pigeons are eaten at the dining table, there’s a kitchen leaderboard ranking cousins, prepubescent Rumi smokes. “I didn’t smoke then,” Youssef clarifies, “but I had the tension of a smoker as a middle schooler.”View image in fullscreenGetting animated … #1 Happy Family USA.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeFast-paced and funny, yes, but his depiction of that time teems with trauma. In the writers’ room, all sorts of distressing details were shared. “Look,” he’s quick to qualify, “I’m fortunate, I grew up in a town with good people, gracious neighbours and kind classmates. I’m also able to realise we wereveryafraid after 9/11, unsure and uncertain. What I’ve explored in this show, and am not sure I understood until a few years ago, is the amount of not self-hatred, but self-fear or self-paranoia I had.”These memories have been percolating since 2018. “We did a flashback episode to that time in Ramy,” he says, “and I realised I had so many stories from that period that I hadn’t confronted.” Youssef was born in Queens, but his parents – both Egyptian – raised the family in New Jersey. “It was a nice place to grow up,” he says. “That added to the immigrant anxiety. When something is nice, the stakes are higher: I hope we can stay here, that we can afford it, and people will accept us.”Ramy review – Mahershala Ali dials this outstanding comedy up to 11Read moreYoussef was 10 on 9/11. He remembers the day. “My dad was working in hotels, in between Newark and New Jersey,” he says. “I didn’t know where he was. There was a massive panic. My uncles and grandparents were all in New York. And it was super-surreal. Shocking with that proximity, but as a kid you don’t really know what’s happening.” He had a recurring dream “that Bin Laden was in my kitchen. There was this weird rumour at school: a bomb in our town.”There weren’t many brown or Muslim kids locally, and soon his experience diverged from that of his classmates. “Looking back,” he says, “I can see the huge impact on my family as culture and politics shifted.” Youssef felt it profoundly: “scrutiny, being watched. I thought: ‘Oh shit, my name matches one of these guys who did this thing. What if there’s some secret in my family? Is who we are bad?’ That inner dialogue played on me a lot more than I understood as a child. Sitting with that fear is more potent than anything anyone could say to you. It infiltrates your inner workings. That’s what it does to the Hussein family.” For his cartoon characters, an identity crisis follows. Until starting at college, Youssef sees now, that was his experience too.View image in fullscreen‘It feels a betrayal to not speak up’ … Ramy Youssef.Photograph: Erik CarterThere he found space to breathe. “I joined the Muslim students association,” he says, “and for the first time opted into being in a community of my own volition. Hanging out with these other Muslims I realised we all had shared experiences. I’d tried to block it during school. In the two years I went to college before dropping out I found it comforting to connect.” Then that safety was pulled from under him: “We found out the NYPD was monitoring us; surveilling the Muslim organisation, treating us with suspicion.”It’s why he started writing. “I realised it was a way I could explore all of this, and my identity, without repercussion. Writing fucked-up jokes, specifically, helped me work through it.” First, in standup. Then in shows such as Ramy and Mo – the acclaimed Netflix series about a Palestinian refugee in Texas which Youssef co-created – and now his new series. In their own ways, each also delicately depicts Islamic ritual. “It’s almost like we create a playground that has emotional resonance to it, and feels safe, so we can also talk about and share things that are otherwise hard to.”For a while, being theMuslim showrunner of the moment felt like a weighty responsibility. “There’s such little representation of our communities on TV,” he feels, “but now I’ve put that aside. I’m in an abundance mindset: I’ve spent years focusing on my specific corner of understanding, proving programmes from one specific point of view can repeatedly and returnable-y hit the target. That, I hope, creates more space for other really specific things to follow.”View image in fullscreenWingman and a prayer … Youssef with Mahershala Ali in Ramy.Photograph: Craig BlankenhornCertainly, Youssef says, he’ll keep making work that mines his personal experience, but his horizons now feel more expansive. “That’s what was so fun aboutPoor Things,” he says (Youssef starred in Yorgos Lanthimos’s 2023 Hollywood hit), “and [acting in] Seth Rogen’s new show,The Studio, and some of the standup I’m working on. It doesn’t touch on any of those themes that defined my life. Doing projects that are so close to the core of who I am has shown me how I like to craft a story, but now it’s fun to widen the palette of what I’ll do with that.”Mo season two review – one of the most hilarious, heart-rending shows on TVRead moreThe effects of Trump 2.0 are already being firmly felt by those in his crosshairs – the trickle-down effect on culture, though, will take a little longer to calcify. However, it’s easy to imagine a shift in streamers’ slates. Big tech has been cosying up to the new US administration. The future of commissioning is uncertain. #1 Happy Family USA is a Prime Video production: Amazon donated $1m to the Trump inauguration fund. Apple’s Tim Cook did the same. Does Youssef believe shows his latest would be green-lit today?“This feels like a glitch, honestly,” he replies. “If I walked in and pitched this today, they’d say no; what are you talking about?” He laughs, nervously. “They’d literally say what the hell are you thinking? We’d be told it was too polarising for now.”A few days previously, I’d seen Youssef perform a work-in-progress standup show at an intimate Brooklyn venue. His material mixed playful bits about his rescue dog and wedding, with the knotty: asking whether we should even try to laugh as a livestreamed genocide unfolds? The laughs were there, but so too was an edge; mania and tension.“I’m not going to pretend that this stuff isn’t getting to me,” he says. “I don’t think my comedy could be accused of leaving people with a warm, fuzzy feeling.” Deep breath. “I hope people laugh, but also feel gross, sweaty and confused.”‘No one knew what to do with me’: Ramy Youssef on privilege, fear and his friend Taylor SwiftRead moreHe started work on #1 Happy Family USA years ago, and couldn’t have predicted how pertinent its eventual release would feel. “It’s somehow 2001 and 2025 right now,” he says: Guantánamo repopulated; state-sponsored snatch squads on US streets; a relentless news cycle of destruction, hatred and war. “Look at the way you’re seeing mostly Muslims forced to denounce the violence of others, again, because of their faith or identity.” Youssef experienced this post-Hamas’ 7 October attacks in Israel. “People coming up to my face asking: do you like what happened? I’m like, what thefuckare you talking about? I thought you knew me … Everything that’s happening with immigration, with speech, with college students, the forced cosplaying of Americanness. It’s the same as post 9/11.”These days, he is moving in esteemed circles. After our interview, he’s off to a suit fitting to wear at the SNL 50 celebrations, then to Hollywood for pre-ski trip meetings; the likes of Taylor Swift attend his standup shows. When it comes to Gaza, much of America’s A-list has been mostly muted. It must, I suggest, be frustrating, shouting so loudly while plenty of peers hold their tongue.He pauses, then cautiously proceeds. “It’s a very difficult thing to tell anyone how to be in any relationship” he says, “let alone a work one. It’s hard to find that balance of me so clearly seeing what’s happening and meeting other people where they’re at. But yeah, it’s getting to the point …” A sigh. “Dude, I just know I’ve no reason to not speak. It feels a betrayal to not. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t deserve to be anywhere near a microphone.”#1 Happy Family USA premieres globally on Prime Video on17 April.Explore more on these topicsTV comedyRamyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She imagined the story would offer some explanation – perhaps the author had given up a child for adoption, for instance. “I was much more interested in not having a concrete answer but just exploring the situation itself,” she tells me. “I’m intrigued by the idea that you could be very settled in your life … and something could happen that could overturn everything that you understand about yourself and your place in the world.”The headline provided the inspiration for Kitamura’s fifth novel, Audition, a beguiling and unsettling book that opens with a meeting between an unnamed actor and a handsome college student, Xavier, who claims he is her son. As the story unfolds, the truth of their entanglement becomes ever harder to discern – is he a liar or a fantasist, or is she mad?Audition deliberately sets itself apart from the recent spate of popular novels – such as Rachel Yoder’sNightbitchor Claire Kilroy’sSoldier Sailor– that explore the viscerality and intensity of early motherhood. Kitamura wanted to write something that was “temperature wise, on the opposite pole”, a novel more concerned with maternal separation, the unavoidable and necessary estrangement that occurs as children grow up and away from their parents. Her fiction has always been interested in the moments when you look at a person you know well and they appear to you as a stranger, and it occurred to her that this happens often between parents and their children. Her own children, aged 12 and eight, are “very surprising creatures”, she says, and she marvels at how rapidly their relationship, and her experience of motherhood, changes as they change. When she speaks to friends whose grown-up children have moved back home, they tell her it’s “like living with a stranger”. “You do not recognise large swathes of their personality and their way of being in the world,” she says. “Talking with people, it doesn’t seem like it’s a reconstitution of the old family unit. It feels like a reorganisation of the family.”In Kitamura’s books, the female protagonists are so reserved that they are often accused of being cold or arrogant, but she herself is disarmingly warm and unassuming. “Is it OK if I get a cookie too?” she asks when we first meet, at a coffee shop in Brooklyn, New York. She is dressed elegantly, in a slouchy suit and big sunglasses, and she laughs a lot, generally at herself. At one point, she tells me that when a family friend said she was excited to read her book, Kitamura’s daughter challenged her. “She doesn’t have a book coming out,” her daughter insisted, “I’ve never seen her write!” “And that,” Kitamura says, “feels like a very accurate description of my life.”Who of us has agency? I mean, what kind of a fantasy world are we living in?“There’s something very interesting about being a parent, because suddenly there is another person in the world who is telling you who you are to them. And that is, in a lot of ways, the most important identity that you have, but it is somehow othered. I know very much that the person my children think I am is not the person I always feel myself to be – that crack in being, or experience, is something I wanted to explore.” The actor in Auditionstruggles to piece together the different parts of herself, her overlapping roles, on stage and in real life, as an artist, a wife and possibly a mother. Kitamura can relate. “Sometimes I feel like a teacher or a writer or a friend or a daughter or a wife or a mother, and there’s something that does feel a bit incommensurate about those parts,” she says.She is married to the British novelistHari Kunzru. Kunzru writes faster than her, she tells me, and he is better at sitting down to work after the children are in bed, or writing in 45-minute snatches during the day. Ah, I say, is that because of your role in the family: are you the one carrying the household’s mental load? But it isn’t. “My friend said something like, ‘Who does all the playdates and who books the appointments with the dentists?’ – and Hari does all that,” she says, laughing. He also does all the cooking.View image in fullscreenDo they ever get jealous of one another, I ask, now openly stirring. No, she replies, because they write such different books: his are big and multistranded, hers are more compacted. Then she leans forward and says: “What does happen is one of us will have an idea and we’ll say to the other, ‘That’s something you should write’.” Her manner is confessional, as though this weren’t the opposite of what jealous people would do. They are each other’s first editors and always undertake a final read of one another’s work before submission. On a day-to-day basis, Kitamura says, she appreciates her husband as the unloader of dishwasher and purchaser of laundry detergent, and then she’ll read his new book and think: “This is smart! You’ve had all this going on in your head as well!”In light of her family dynamic, it’s interesting that her female characters in novels such as Intimacies and A Separation are often married to writers but themselves work as interpreters, translators or actors – mediums for other people’s messages. Kitamura says she is uncomfortable with the idea of being a writer and sees her own role as closer to interpreting, to channelling other people’s voices. The women she writes about are often passive in their professional and personal lives, which she believes is true to life. “Who of us has that much agency? I mean, what kind of a fantasy world are we living in? We have the illusion of agency,” she says. “I’m interested in passivity in part because it’s the condition most of us live in. But I’m also interested in passivity because it is itself a kind of action.” She’s fascinated by the point at which passivity becomes complicity. Her characters often find themselves in ethically unsustainable positions: working for institutions they disapprove of, for instance, or accepting an inheritance although it isn’t rightfully theirs.View image in fullscreen‘I have to write from the middle of my life’ … Katie Kitamura.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianWe meet in late February, and it seems everyone I’ve passed today in New York has been discussing politics. Kitamura has not been sleeping well. She never sleeps well during a Trump presidency, she half jokes. She teaches on New York University’s graduate creative writing programme and says that the day after the 2024 election her students asked her what the point was of fiction: did they not have an obligation to resist Trump more directly? She had struggled with that question herself in 2016, but the secondTrump administrationhas been so extreme that she can now see with greater clarity the urgent importance of writing, art and education. This is, she says, “in part because they are being targeted so fiercely, but also because [Trump and his allies] are trying to take away everything I love and care about. It’s never been clearer to me that writing actually does matter. It’s not a frivolous or useless task.”In an immediate way, she continues, writers are well placed to respond to Trump’s attacks on language, the obfuscation and doublespeak, the moral panic over pronouns or the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. More broadly, fiction can act as an antidote to authoritarianism. If authoritarianism thrives when people are isolated, fiction brings people together, she says. “In the most basic way, writing is about opening yourself to another person’s mind. The most intimate thing I do on a daily basis is pick up a book and open myself to another person.” And, while the Trump administration may be forcing one way of life on the world, fiction’s job is, as always, to remind people that there are “other ways of being”.Before Kitamura wanted to be a writer, she wanted to be a ballerina. She was raised in California, where her parents had moved from Japan for her father’s job as a professor of engineering at the University of California. Throughout school, she left class at noon to dance, and she planned to go professional. But she got injured and says that was “the nail in the coffin” because it was becoming clear that she wasn’t quite good enough to make it. Having never thought she’d go to college, she won a place at Princeton University, where she studied English. Kitamura sees similarities between dance and writing. Both require discipline: “It’s doing the same thing over and over again, reworking and reworking.” It strikes me too that if ballerinas excel at masking the pain and physical effort required for their art, Kitamura’s writing shows similar restraint and contrast, between the streamlined, exacting prose and its roiling undercurrents.It’s really a brutal exertion of power over another person – but it’s also just parentingIn 1999, after Princeton, Kitamura moved to the UK to study for a PhD in literature at the London Consortium. She worked part time at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (where she met Kunzru) in the early 00s, and found London’s art and cultural scene vibrant and exciting. “People were taking incredible risks with their work, and that was interesting to see,” she recalls. In 2009, she published her first novel, The Longshot, about a mixed martial arts fighter preparing for his comeback match. She has retained a keen interest in performance, “both the pressures and incredible freedom of it”. In Audition, the actor believes that “a performance existed in the space between the work and the audience” and Kitamura believes the same to be true of books. She wanted Audition to be open to multiple, mutually exclusive interpretations, so that a reader could form their own conclusions. She’s curious about what it may say about a reader that they settle for one reading over another, concluding ultimately that the “son”, Xavier, is a con artist, perhaps, or that the actor is a “bad” mother.Audition forms a loose trilogy with her two preceding books,A SeparationandIntimacies, novels that similarly have a keen eye for the sinister, for the subtle and yet threatening shifts in power between people, for the moments when closeness becomes dangerous or suffocating. “We have such a tendency to think of intimacy as something desirable, something we seek out with other people,” she says, “but it can also be an imposition.” In Audition, the narrator is almost pathologically attuned to the power renegotiations in the family. The person who is most desired holds the upper hand, the actor observes. Money also shapes how the characters relate to one another, sometimes in unexpected ways: at points, characters try to buy power, but their generosity only weakens them, exposing the extent of their need.Kitamura says she is both fascinated and horrified by the occasions when she has exerted power over her children. “Those moments make me very uncomfortable. It’s really simple things, like when you send them to their room or you lose your temper, or when they are little, you pick them up against their will. It’s really a brutal exertion of power over another person, but it’s also just parenting,” she says, revealing her ability to identify the disquieting elements in everyday interactions. At the same time, she observes, parenthood can make you feel powerless. She often feels powerless to protect her children from the world.She has already started on her next novel, which she says will be very different from her previous books. She checks herself: “Well, it’s not a maximalist … it’s a difference that will be significant to me and nobody else.” She is itching to write, but there’s the book tour, her teaching and, of course, family life. Like any working parent, the fact that she has so little time to herself, so little solitude, could make her unhappy, but she’s come to accept that “work comes from the mess of life”, creativity doesn’t come from a vacuum. “I have to write from the middle of my life, that’s all I can do,” she says. “I’m not going to wait for a decade to pass until I have more time.”Audition by Katie Kitamura will be published by Fern on 17 April.

Photograph: Pablo Xavier/MidjourneyFrom the pope in a puffer to the Princess of Wales and family, baby Hitler to Mussolini on horseback, people have always manipulated photographs, whether for political power, image control – or just for fun …ByJonathan FreedlandSat 12 Apr 2025 02.02 EDTLast modified on Sat 12 Apr 2025 09.16 EDTShare“Pictures or it didn’t happen.” So runs the immediate social media retort to any claim deemed too extraordinary to be true. Carried within it is an assumption shared across the globe which has held firm almost since the invention of the camera: that the ultimate form of proof is the photograph. The idea is so strongly fixed in the human mind, it has acquired the status of a law of nature, one obvious even to a child: the camera never lies.Except it does, as the images collected here vividly attest. We may think of AI deepfakes, and their Photoshop predecessors, as thoroughly modern menaces, corrupting a previously innocent, reliable medium, but we would be wrong. It turns out people have been doctoring photos, manipulating and meddling, from the start. “Honest” Abe Lincoln was not only thefirst sitting president to be photographed, but the first to be the subject of a photo fake.It’s not hard to fathom why those in the darkroom were tempted to play tricks with the technology as soon as they learned that they could. The most obvious motive is the one that fuelled so much early photographic output: PR, or propaganda. It must have seemed only natural to superimpose Lincoln’s head on to the body of another man – an enslaver, as irony would have it – if that would yield a more heroic image of the president. The same goes for the portrait of civil war general Ulysses S Grant, depicted at the centre of a military scene that was in fact three scenes combined into one. You want the leader to look as strong and noble as possible. If that means showing him on horseback, while quietly removing the handler who kept the animal under control as the snap was taken, you’ll do it – or at least you will if you’re in charge of optics forBenito Mussolini.The beauty of photo manipulation for those practising politics’ black arts is it can be deployed both to make your side look better and to make the other side look worse. The North Koreans could add extra hovercraft to make their military appear more lethal, while Republicans in the 2004 US presidential campaign could put Democratic contender John Kerry alongside “Hanoi Jane” Fonda, as if the two had appeared on a platform together, denouncing the Vietnam war, a generation earlier. It never happened, but the picture says it did – and, as we all know, a picture is worth a thousand-word correction.Politics is never far away, even when those in the frame are not politicians. Look no further than the darkened image ofOJ Simpsonthat appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1994, when the former sports star became a murder suspect, the picture seemingly altered to make a Black man look blacker.‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on cameraRead moreLess than a decade later, the then editor of the Daily Mirror,Piers Morgan, resigned after the paper ran staged photographs that purported to show the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. It seemed clear that the source of the pictures was motivated by opposition to the war, but that same sentiment surely also explained Morgan’s readiness to be taken in by them. After all, British soldiershadcommitted abuses in Iraq. Sometimes, that’s how fakes sneak through: though false, they point to a truth.But if the political benefits, and dangers, of fakery are obvious, more intriguing are the manipulated images that serve no such clear purpose. Vanity can play a role – including that of the photographers, seeking acclaim as even more accomplished artists than they already are. Witness the forensic evidence suggesting Robert Capa’s stunning image of a falling soldier is likely to have been posed.Money is a factor, naturally. The bigfoot footage might have been a commercial scam, although if it was, it was one that required an almost obsessive commitment. Even revenge can drive someone to concoct an optical illusion: think of the hunter of the Loch Ness monster who, humiliated by the Daily Mail, got his own back by duping them with an image of the sea monster that was too good to be true.But more mysterious are those fakes that have no clear explanation. The prankster who concocted a snap of himself on the roof of one of the twin towers just before a plane crashed into the building did it as a poor taste joke, to be circulated among his friends. Yet we know there are others who claimed, falsely but in earnest, thatthey survived 9/11or other terror attacks. What accounts for that, beyond the desire for attention, to be at the centre of a historic event?Of course, none of it would work without us, the viewer. Fake images proliferate and endure because they show us what we want to see. Posters ofUFOswere captioned “I want to believe” for a reason. They realise fantasies, or dreads, that would otherwise linger only in our imaginations. They make our dreams – or our nightmares – come true.Picture captions by Felix Bazalgette, Gabrielle Schwarz and Emma LoffhagenLeap into the Void, 1960ByYves KleinView image in fullscreenThe image the world saw …Photograph: Metropolitan Museum/Art Resource/ScalaView image in fullscreen… and the one it didn’t.Photograph: Shunk-Kender © J Paul Getty Trust/Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (2014.R.20), gift of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation in memory of Harry Shunk and János KenderIn 1960, French artist Yves Klein stunned the world withLeap into the Void, an image that appeared to capture him mid-flight, fearlessly leaping from a rooftop in Paris. In reality, it was two negatives combined – and the tarpaulin held by friends was removed in post-production.Klein forbade photographers Harry Shunk and János Kender from revealing how they had created the photos, with Shunk claiming he was threatened with legal action. It wasn’t until 50 years later that the mechanics of the leap were fully revealed.ELWales family photograph, 2024Edited by thePrincess of WalesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kensington Palace/Reuters“Like many amateur photographers,” the Princess of Wales said, “I do occasionally experiment with editing.” This inexpert attempt at Photoshopping might have been a mildly embarrassing royal footnote last year, were it not for the fevered context in which it was released. The princess had made unusually few public appearances in late 2023 and early 2024; a palace announcement that she was recovering from abdominal surgery did not quieten public curiosity as to her whereabouts. When this family photograph was released to mark Mother’s Day, several news agencies quickly issued a dramatic “kill notice” for it, identifying several signs of heavy editing, including around Princess Charlotte’s hand, contrary to guidelines for news images. The princess apologised “for any confusion” and later that month announced she had been diagnosed with cancer, dampening the speculation that had gripped the press.FBOJ Simpson on the cover of Time, 1994ByLAPD/Matt MahurinView image in fullscreenOJ Simpson as seen on the cover of Time …View image in fullscreen… and NewsweekAfter American football star OJ Simpson was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Time and Newsweek both made his mugshot their cover. But while Newsweek used the original image, Time showed Simpson’s skin drastically darkened – done, critics claimed, to make a Black man appear more threatening. Time apologised, but insisted the alteration was simply an artistic decision.ELMussolini on horseback, 1937ByLuigi LeoniView image in fullscreenPhotograph:  FAF/Toscana/Fondazione Alinari per la Fotografia/akgWhen Italy first invaded and occupied Libya in 1911, Benito Mussolini, at the time a socialist, publicly opposed the colonial attack. Two decades later, the fascist Mussolini would declare himself ruler of “Italian Libya” and a “Protector of Islam”, to mark which title he was photographed in 1937 holding aloft the sword of Islam, a ceremonial weapon.The original image, taken by photojournalist Luigi Leoni and showing a groom dutifully holding the leader’s horse, initially appeared on newspaper front pages – but editors soon learned to crop and airbrush out the groom, to better foster the image of an independent, aristocratic, warlike leader. By the 1940s, the image without the groom had become the standard version, and it created the enduring visual signs of the strongman leader – when Nigel Farage makes a speech atop a tank, or Vladimir Putin displays his bare chest, both are drawing on iconography developed by the Italian fascist.FBFrame 352 of the bigfoot film, 1967ByRoger Patterson and Bob GimlinView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Science Source/akg-imagesNo other scrap of film – apart from perhaps the Zapruder footage showing JFK’s assassination – has been so exhaustively analysed as the Patterson-Gimlin film, named for the two cowboys who shot it, Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin. In October 1967 the two men rode into the woods of northern California with a camera after a number of sasquatch, or bigfoot, sightings in the area. As the hairy figure emerged, Patterson said, his horse panicked and reared up; after a few seconds, he was able to grab his camera from a saddlebag and record a short snatch of footage, before the creature disappeared into the tree line. Frame 352, of the figure turning to look at the camera, remains the iconic image of the bigfoot movement.“The Patterson-Gimlin film stands at a crucial place in photographic history,” says Steven Streufert, who has made a long-term study of the footage. “It’s either the greatest hoax ever or a stunning piece of wildlife imagery.” Streufert co-led an expedition in 2011 to identify the film’s remote wooded location, an effort that led to him being named Bigfoot Times’s Bigfooter of the Year.For Streufert, the film stands “closer to the moon landing than the Cottingley fairies” as, unlike the latter, it has never been conclusively debunked and still inspires obsessive study. Patterson died a few years after it was filmed, while Gimlin, now in his 90s, maintains that the footage shows a real sasquatch.To true believers (and some scientifically trained commentators), the figure has inhuman proportions, a distinct gait and visible muscle mass moving beneath its fur, all of which would be difficult to achieve if it was a person wearing a furry suit. Comparisons with the unconvincing costumes in the Planet of the Apes, released a year later, suggest that if they were faking it, Patterson and Gimlin – both rodeo riders and horse wranglers – were highly skilled costume designers for their time.“I’m a sceptic,” Streufert says, reflecting on his lifelong engagement with the film, “but to me that means being curious.” The footage, and the culture around it, is compelling to him because of the broader question it poses: “Why do humans believe in things that are not supposed to exist?”FBThe Book of Veles, 2021ByJonas BendiksenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonas Bendiksen/Magnum PhotosPhotojournalist Jonas Bendiksen first heard about the run-down North Macedonian city of Veles in 2016, when it was identified as a hub for fake news production in the US presidential election. Around then, he also became aware of computer-generated images, and “wanted to test whether we were prepared for a world where we cannot tell CGI from photojournalism”.TheBook of Veles(a title borrowed from a known literary forgery, which purported to be an ancient Slavic text) is the result. Using 3D modelling tools, Bendiksen inserted digital avatars into empty backdrops shot in Veles, claiming they were real portraits of tech-savvy local youths who had found an unlikely source of income operating websites that churned out pro-Trump stories. He published the images in a photobook alongside an essay written with a prototype of ChatGPT.To Bendiksen’s surprise, no one clocked him – on the contrary, he was invited to present the project at a prestigious photojournalism festival. So he decided to drop clues on social media, creating a fake user who accused him of paying his subjects. Eventually a real user, Benjamin Chesterton, noticed that the fake account’s profile picture looked like one of the avatars in the book.“It shows we see what we want to see,” says Bendiksen. “If something is packaged up in the right way and conforms to what we expect, we are at risk of buying into anything.”GSAbraham Lincoln portrait, 1865ByWilliam PateView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Library of CongressThe US president’s assassination in 1865 led to demand for heroic portraits of him – and to one printmaker getting a little too creative. In this print, attributed to engraver William Pate, the Great Emancipator’s head is superimposed on to an engraving of John C Calhoun, a political rival and supporter of slavery. The source photo was flipped, so Lincoln’s mole appears on the wrong side of his face.GSAlpine UFOS, 1970sByBilly MeierView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty ImagesIn 1976 the unusual claims of a Swiss man began to appear in the press. Eduard “Billy” Meier maintained he had made contact with a race of aliens hailing from the Pleiades, and offered as proof dreamy images of their spaceships over rolling alpine landscapes – supposedly taken with their permission. In the coming decades, Meier would release a flood of such images, write bestselling books about his alien friends and become a media fixture and countercultural icon. Mulder’s office in The X-Files features one of his images, with the slogan “I want to believe”.Julio Rojas, a writer and film-maker who has spent the last two years making adocumentary about Meier, says the pictures are “possibly the most beautiful ever captured of an unidentified flying object”. Though many, including Meier’s ex-wife, have observed that some of the UFOs are clearly household objects such as bin lids, Rojas finds the images fascinating – not only because they “established the visual canon” of flying saucer imagery, but also for their beauty and variety, “ranging from technical awe to deliberately careless and mocking images”, which seem to taunt the viewer.Meier, now 88, insists his images depict a race of aliens who have been in contact with him for decades. Interviewing him, Rojas thought he perceived “a quiet certainty” rather than an intention to deceive. “His world – whether real or false to us – is entirely real to him.”FBBaby Hitler, 1933ByAcme NewspicturesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Warren family collection“They’ve made a sourpuss out of my son,” complained Harriet May Warren Downs to Life magazine on 2 May 1938. Five years earlier, doctored images of her baby, purporting to show the newly elected fuhrer as a one-year-old, had been distributed by Acme Newspictures. “This is a picture of a man who controls the destiny of a mighty nation,” said the Winnipeg Free Press, while the Chicago Tribune ran the picture next to one of Hitler as an adult, addressing a meeting of farmers.The latter caused a diplomatic scandal, with the German consulate complaining of blatant “falsification”. The Tribune blamed the picture agency, which “insisted the original came from Austria”, according to Life. Downs’s letter, about “the dreadful monstrosity”, would finally confirm the true identity of the baby, but the hoaxer who stole and doctored the image remains a mystery.FBNorth Korean hovercraft, 2013ByKorean Central News AgencyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: KCNA via KNS/AFP/Getty ImagesAmid heightened tensions, with the US and South Korea carrying out military drills, the North Koreans released a series of photos of a hovercraft assault drill on a desolate, snowy beach. The images had already been distributed by some western news agencies, including AFP and Getty, before Alan Taylor, an editor at the Atlantic, spotted some“digital twins”, cloned by a photo editor to create a more menacing impression of multiple hovercraft bearing down on the beach.FBRalph Lauren Blue Label jeans poster, 2009By Ralph LaurenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Universal News and Sport (Scotland)While photo editing has long been standard practice in fashion, one 2009 incident broke the unspoken boundaries of acceptability. In a poster for Ralph Lauren Blue Label jeans, the fashion house so severely slimmed a photo of 23-year-old Swedish-French model Filippa Hamilton (a UK size eight) that her head ended up appearing bigger than her pelvis.The results were ridiculed online, and Ralph Lauren was forced to apologise, saying, “We have learned that we are responsible for the poor imaging and retouching that resulted in a very distorted image of a woman’s body.”The saga took another turn when Hamilton claimed she had been fired by Ralph Lauren for being“too fat”. On the US TV show Today,she said she had received a letter stating, “We’re terminating your services because you don’t fit into the sample clothes you need to wear.”Hamilton said of the Photoshop debacle, “They owe American women an apology … I’m very proud of what I look like, and a role model should look healthy.”ELThe Cottingley fairies, 1920ByFrances Griffiths and Elsie WrightView image in fullscreenPhotograph: SSPL/Getty ImagesOne day in the summer of 1917, nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her 16-year-old cousin Elsie Wright went down to the stream at the foot of their family garden in West Yorkshire. They took a camera – to get proof, they said, that fairies lived there, as Frances had always told her parents that was the reason she kept coming home with wet shoes. This is the fourth of five images the girls captured over a few years at Cottingley Beck – in some you can almost detect a mischievous glint in Frances’s eyes.Merrick Burrow, an academic and curator of an exhibition of the Cottingley fairy photos, describes them as an “accidental hoax”. “The prank was intended only for their immediate family, and it was only after Arthur Conan Doyle got wind of the photos that they reached wider attention.” Doyle was (somewhat incongruously, as creator of the arch-rationalist detective Sherlock Holmes) a dedicated spiritualist – these photos, he argued, clearly established the reality of the supernatural realm.Amazingly, they weren’t conclusively debunked until the 1980s, when the cousins finally admitted they had staged the scenes using hatpins to prop up cut-out drawings of fairies based on children’s book illustrations, then disposed of the evidence in a stream. Until her death, however, Frances still claimed that the last photograph the pair took was real.GSElvis gets a buzzcut, 1957ByUnited PressView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Metropolitan Museum/Art Resource/ScalaWhen it was announced in 1957 that, at the height of his fame, Elvis was to be drafted into the US army, it was his hair that quickly became the focus of media attention. His legions of fans were so worried about him having to shave his signature pompadour and sideburns that some politicians even investigated whether he could get an exemption from military buzzcut regulations.Amid the furore, the United Press agency decided to create a mock-up of what the king of rock’n’roll might look like with the typical GI hairstyle, retouching a photo of the singer to remove his quiff (and leaving him with a somewhat disfigured head). “Not all manipulated photographs are intended to deceive,” notes Mia Fineman, a curator at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and author of Faking It: ManipulatedPhotographybefore Photoshop.The following year, hordes of photographers and reporters gathered at an army training centre in Arkansas to document the real thing. The widely circulated photographs of Presley’s actual army haircut have long since eclipsed the imagined version.ELGeneral Grant at City Point, 1902By LC HandyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AlamyThis one-time historical document, depicting Union forces commander Ulysses S Grant at City Point, Virginia, during the American civil war, sat quietly in the US Library of Congress for more than a hundred years before a reference assistant at the prints and photographs division raised questions about it in 2007. Kathryn Blackwell noticed a number of anomalies: the strange angle of the famous general’sneck; the stiff, uncertain pose for someone known to be an expert rider; the horse that does not resemble any of Grant’s known horses; and the uniform, which did not reflect Grant’s rank. Blackwell established that the image was actually a composite of three photographs – the general’s head, a major general’s body and horse, and a background of Confederate prisoners – probably produced by photographer LC Handy for commercial purposes in 1902, well after the American civil war.FBRoosevelt on a moose, 1912ByUnderwood and UnderwoodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty ImagesTeddy Roosevelt was famously outdoorsy, but this cut-and-paste image was debunked soon after it appeared online 15 years ago, when the archives of the photography firm that produced it, Underwood and Underwood, were digitised. It was part of a triptych of 1912’s presidential candidates, each atop the animal associated with their party; Roosevelt’s new Progressives were nicknamed the Bull Moose party.Going Places, 1998Bythe Leeds 13View image in fullscreenPhotograph: courtesy of the Leeds 13In May 1998, art students from the University of Leeds, later dubbed the Leeds 13, pulled off one of the most notorious media hoaxes in British history. As part of a conceptual art project, they documented a fake luxury holiday to Spain, photographing themselves sunbathing, swimming and sipping cocktails, supposedly on the Costa del Sol, in a trip funded by a university grant.In reality, the group never left the UK. Using inflatable paddling pools, sunbed tans and carefully angled shots, they staged the photos in a project titled Going Places, even going so far as to film themselves coming through arrivals at Leeds Bradford airport.Sensationalist headlines followed, with tabloids condemning the group’s supposed misuse of taxpayers’ money. A few days later, they revealed live on Radio 4 that the whole thing had been staged. “We had to disappear for a week, laying low in our student houses and only nipping to the corner shop in disguise,” recalls one member of the group, who wants to remain anonymous. “Until the moment we walked out of arrivals, hauling luggage and gifts supposedly from the Costa del Sol, we lived in a perpetual state of paranoia.” All the Leeds 13 received a first for their final exams.ELAbraham Lincoln’s ghost, 1870By William H MumlerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Indian State MuseumBefore “ghosts” started to appear on William H Mumler’s photographic plates in the early 1860s, spiritualism had been a religious movement defined by knocks and taps, seances and mediums. Now spirit photography spread around the world. Mumler credited the images to the “wonderful magnetic powers” of his wife, a medium, but sceptics claimed they were simple double exposures, and Mumler was hauled into court in the late 1860s, after he had made a fortune selling his images to Americans grieving after the civil war. He was ultimately acquitted for lack of evidence, but not before his reputation had been ruined.After the trial, Mary Todd Lincoln, the famous spiritualist and widow ofAbraham Lincoln, visited Mumler to test his powers, leading to his most famous image. According to his autobiography, she used a false name and hid her identity with a veil up until the moment the photograph was taken. When the figure of her husband appeared on the plate, Mumler’s wife reported that Mary wept “tears of joy”.FBFalling Soldier, 1936ByRobert CapaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Robert Capa/ICP/Magnum Photos“It happened in Spain,” Robert Capa recalled in a radio interview 11 years after the photograph was taken. “It was very much at the beginning of my career.” He recalled how he huddled in a trench with Republican soldiers, taking cover from fascist machine-gun fire. As a few doomed soldiers tried to charge the enemy, Capa held his camera above his head and snapped a picture without looking; he sent the undeveloped films straight to an editor in France, never seeing the image of a soldier at the moment he was shot until he returned from the war months later. By then it had been published in the French magazine Vu to great acclaim, establishing his reputation at just 22.That, at least, was Capa’s story. After his death in 1954, people began to ask questions about the image – was it really taken at the Battle of Cerro Muriano on 5 September 1936? Does it really show someone being shot? For Professor José Manuel Susperregui, at the University of the Basque Country, study of the image has become his life’s work. “What caught my attention,” Susperregui says over email, “was the geometric shape of light-coloured terrain in the lower right corner. It seemed strange to me, and became my main reference for locating the photograph.”Susperregui couldn’t find this distinctive form in the landscape of Cerro Muriano, so he assembled a wider panorama of the area from other photos Capa took on the same day, and circulated it to town halls across the country, asking for assistance. Eventually a student recognised it as a piece of open ground known locally as Llano de Vanda – 55km south of the frontline at the time the image was supposed to have been taken. This cast doubt on Capa’s tales of trenches and machine gunners.Susperregui’s work has brought him into conflict with powerful photography institutions, including Magnum, the agency founded by Capa, and the International Centre of Photography in New York. The image still provokes debate; some argue its symbolic value is more important than whether it was staged. Susperregui is not convinced: “According to press photography association statutes, no staging or falsification is allowed.”FBIraqi detainee, 2004Hoaxer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Bebber/ReutersOn 1 May 2004, the Daily Mirror published a series of incendiary images apparently depicting the abuse of an Iraqi detainee by the Queen’s Lancashire regiment in Basra. The photographs, published just days after the infamous images of abuse by the US army in Abu Ghraib, seemed to show British soldiers beating a handcuffed prisoner and urinating on him. Prime minister Tony Blair condemned the images as “utterly unacceptable” and foreign secretary Jack Straw promised a thorough investigation.Within two weeks, however, the editor who had published them – one Piers Morgan – would be leaving in disgrace, after military sources insisted the images were fake: the rifle seen was not issued to soldiers in Iraq, nor were the hats they wore, and the truck shown was not used there at the time. They argued, therefore, that the images were staged. Morgan was sacked on 14 May.The furore threatened to overshadow the fact that regiment members were linked to horrific abuses in Iraq, including the torture of 26-year-old hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, who later died of his injuries. Though nobody was convicted, an inquiry found serious failings in army leadership, planning and training had led to the abuse, with British soldiers inflicting “violent and cowardly” assaults on Iraqi civilians. Morgan has continued to stand by his decision to publish the images,telling Politico in 2013, “I refuse to apologise. And to accept they were necessarily fakes.”FBThe doomed tourist on 9/11, 2001ByPeter GuzliIn the days after the September 11 attacks, a chain email with a photograph of a man on the observation deck of the World Trade Center, seemingly moments before one of the planes hit, started doing the rounds. “This was from a camera found in the wreckage,” the message claimed. “The guy still has no name and is missing.” Soon he was identified asPeter Guzli, a very much alive Hungarian tourist who had digitally edited a holiday snap taken four years earlier (a “joke intended for my friends only”, he later insisted).In retrospect there were obvious clues of fakery, not least the heavy coat worn by Guzli on a warm September day. “Tourist Guy” soon became a meme, appearing in online images at the sites of other historical disasters, from the sinking of the Titanic to JFK’s assassination.GSSnowball the giant cat, 2000ByCordell HauglieView image in fullscreen“My daughter wanted to send an electronic photo of her cat to her friend,” Cordell Hauglie told reporters. “I got a little carried away.” The image, a modest experiment with Photoshop, spread across the internet, often with a tongue-in-cheek report blaming atomic radiation. It sparked arguments online and was even featured on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Good Morning America. The experience led Hauglie to warn about “the dangers of email … if some dumb guy and his dumb cat can go around the world, you’ve got to be careful”.FBJohn Kerry and Jane Fonda, 2004ByRichard TaylorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: newsmax.comThis image, appearing to show presidential candidate John Kerry next to Jane Fonda at an anti-Vietnam war rally in the 1970s, was part of arightwing smear campaignfocused on his military record. Kerry, a Vietnam vet,hadspoken out against the war – but this scene linking him to “Hanoi Jane” never happened. A man called Richard Taylor had digitally spliced together two photos and added a fake headline and credit to create the look of an old newspaper clipping. Several media outlets, including The New York Times, ran the image before it was debunked.Photographer Ken Light, who shot the original Kerry photo in 1971, was “incredibly upset” and, looking back, thinks this image influenced the election: “A colleague told me his father was going to vote for Bush because of it.”His advice for spotting fake images today? “Trust the photographer, know the source. Look closely – if photos seem too fantastic, they probably are.”GSHelicopter Shark, 2001Hoaxer unknownView image in fullscreenHelicopter Shark spread like wildfire across the internet in 2001, the text assuring viewers that “although this looks like a picture taken from a Hollywood movie, it is in fact a real photo”. It was in fact two real photos: Charles Maxwell’s shark and Lance Cheung’s US air force helicopter. The text also stated this was National Geographic’s photograph of the year, a claim the magazine had to publicly deny.To this day the hoaxer is unknown. “I’d like to make contact,” Maxwell said at the time, “not to get him or her into trouble, but because it’s fun and a good job.”FBJennifer in Paradise, 1987By John KnollView image in fullscreenThe original image …View image in fullscreen… and after Photoshopping. Photographs: © 1987 John Knoll, all rights reservedJohn Knoll took this photograph of his future wife Jennifer (“The next day I proposed to her”) on a beach on the South Pacific island of Bora Bora in 1987. Back home, he and his brother Thomas started using “Jennifer in Paradise” to demo the new image-editing software they were developing, doing things like cloning her figure or adding another island. “It presented good opportunities to show the capabilities of the tool we were building and I found it pleasant to look at,” says Knoll, who keeps a copy of the first test image – untampered with – as a personal memento. After Adobe bought Photoshop in 1988 and released it in 1990, the brothers’ creation went on to became a worldwide phenomenon.GSSelf-Portrait as a Drowned Man, 1840ByHippolyte BayardView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AlamyIn 1839, to much fanfare, the French government announced it had obtained the rights to the daguerreotype – and would give it “free to the world”. Billed as the first viable photographic process, it was named for inventor Louis Daguerre. But fellow Frenchman Hippolyte Bayard felt unjustly overlooked as creator of the equally viable “direct positive” process. In response, he staged this dark joke: an image of himself apparently driven to suicide by neglect of his work. “The corpse you see here is Monsieur Bayard, inventor of the process you have just seen,” he wrote on the back of the print.GSThe Balenciaga pope, 2023ByPablo XavierView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pablo Xavier/MidjourneyThe danger of deepfake tech was memorably demonstrated when this shot of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket wentviralin March 2023. It was made using Midjourney, an AI tool that turns text prompts into images. The eagle-eyed may spot clues to its origins, such as the wonky shadow cast by the pope’s glasses and the strange grip of his hand – not to mention the unlikelihood of his flashy attire. But many were fooled.The image’s creator, a man from Chicago called Pablo Xavier (he withheld his surname, fearing a backlash), told reporters he’d been messing around with Midjourney for a laugh: “I just thought it was funny to see the Pope in a funny jacket.”GSThe Loch Ness monster, 1934ByRobert Kenneth WilsonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AllstarAmong more than1,100reported sightings of the monster said to inhabit the Scottish Highlands loch – including one in January this year – none has made as big a splash as the “surgeon’s photograph”, credited to a physician named Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail in 1934.Many were sceptical, but no one could explain the photo either – until the 1990s, when retired art teacher Alastair Boyd unearthed a little-read article from 1975 in which a man called Ian Wetherell admitted helping stage the image. His father Marmaduke, a big-game hunter, had wanted to get back at the Mail after they debunked his previous claim to have found Nessie’s footprints (actually from a cast made of a hippo’s feet). The long-necked creature seen here was fabricated from wood putty attached to a toy submarine – later sunk in the mud when a water bailiff approached – and Wilson was recruited as a frontman to submit the photos.Despite what he’d uncovered, Boyd remained convinced of Nessie’s existence: “I would stake my life on it,” he said.GSStalin and Nikolai Yezhov, 1937Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenNow you see Nikolai Yezhov …View image in fullscreen… now you don’t. Photographs: Samuel Cole/David King Collection/Tate ImagesThe era of Stalinist purges in the late 1930s, with its dizzying re-evaluation of political figures and past events, was a busy time for photo retouchers. “So much falsification took place during the Stalin years,” wrote the author and collector David King, “that it is possible to tell the story of the Soviet era through retouched photographs.” King’s book from 1997, The Commissar Vanishes, documents how retouchers – working by hand, using brushes, scissors and glue – diligently removed from the historical record figures who had fallen out of favour (they even smoothed out Stalin’s pockmarks).Leon Trotsky was a common target, systematically erased from many photographs documenting his prominent role in the Russian Revolution of 1917. Another famous victim was Nikolai Yezhov, Stalin’s one-time confidant, who went from being head of the NKVD, the secret police, to execution in little more than three years. In the original of this image, Stalin walks with Yezhov next to the Moscow-Volga canal; after his fall from favour, he was scrubbed out.FBThese 28 images show photographic fakes that have fooled the world.

After decades of high-octane feuding (more of which anon), Madonna recently turned up impromptu backstage when John was appearing on late-night television sketch show,Saturday Night Livein New York to “confront” him. Her ensuingInstagram post, liked 420,605 times and counting, said: “Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist”.Madonna continued: “When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was ‘Forgive me’, and the walls between us fell down.”Thespat between the musicianswas one for the ages: a dense matrix of jibes, counter-jibes, and outright insults (“She looks like a fucking fairground stripper”). Throughout, John seemed the most vocal and volatile. At the 2004Qmagazine awards, receiving the classic songwriter award, he said of Madonna’s nomination: “Madonna, best live act, fuck off! Since when was lip-synching live?” Before her 2012 US Superbowl half-time show, his publicly bequeathed advice was: “Make sure you lip-synch good.” (John later softened, if not entirely retracted, his lip-synch criticisms.)It was such a long-running contretemps, it had its own eco-system and supporting players. At the 2012 Golden Globes, after John was beaten by Madonna for best original song his husband, David Furnish, said: “Her acceptance speech was embarrassing in its narcissism.”When Madonna noted that Lady Gaga’s Born This Way sounded like her own song, Express Yourself, John professed outrage at how “ungracious” she was.Now a Madonna-John collaboration is mooted, and the world can be relieved that the artists have finally buried the hatchet, and for once not in each other’s metaphorical skulls.Alternatively, it could be that deep in our dark, damaged hearts, we enjoy such feuds. That celeb-strata hostilities are considered part of the entertainment: watching the rich and famous, the great and the good debase themselves, splash about in the bin-juice of human discord, revealing themselves to be just as imperfect, short-fused and obstinate as the rest of us. All of which proving that a feud can be many interesting things but it is also a great leveller.Still, what are such feuds really about? Why would any famous people publicly go to war, especially these days, in a social media era when every slight, snub and smear is distributed, amplified and preserved for ever in online amber? In psychological terms – on any measurable level – what do they get out of it, how is it feeding them? And what of those of us who avidly watch these A-list bloodbaths play out? Who reach for the XXL tub of popcorn when celebrities openly diss each other on social media or via carefully cryptic but deadly comments in magazine interviews. What fault-line in the human condition explains that?Dr Audrey Tang is a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, and the author ofThe Leader’s Guide To Wellbeing. She explains to me that generally with human beings, feuds can be a manifestation of something that’s been going on for much longer beneath the surface. “It doesn’t seem right to say that person also plays music, they’re in the same space, therefore they’re going to be competitive,” she says.“It’s not necessarily professional. It may be that something personally triggered something in the other one and they’re reacting to that inner trauma.”View image in fullscreenBette Davis and Joan Crawford.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAccording to Tang, in psychological terms, feuding can be a highly complex matter involving primitive natures, hierarchies, fear-based impulses, familial structures, building personal needs on self-esteem (based on comparison) rather than self-compassion, not possessing strong enough conflict resolution skills, and more.Why are relatively few feuds successfully resolved? “Then the question comes: what part of that feud is performative? What are people gaining? Is a feud performative because it gets ratings, it sells papers? Even if it’s not performative, how are you benefiting from prolonging this action and this experience?”As for the public appetite for relishing the fall-out from high-profile feuds, Tang thinks it’s not onlyschadenfreude: “In a healing sense, it can spark discussion … You can remove yourself directly from the situation but you can discuss the same feelings, behaviours and actions talking about someone else … It allows us to explore these feelings safely.”Certainly, the global stage has never been short of feuds, panning out across popular culture and far too numerous to list in full here. Sometimes the differences are resolved; other times, people double- or triple-down, taking their antipathy all the way to the grave.View image in fullscreenNoel and Liam Gallagher.Photograph: Zak Hussein/PAThe highways of rock’n’roll are littered with the firebombed wrecks of former creative closeness. The familialfroideurof the now re­united Oasis brothers, Noel andLiam Gallagher, resulted in many a snipe (Noel, 2009: “Liam is the angriest man you’ll ever meet … a man with a fork in a world full of soup”).Decades after Johnny Marr prompted the Smiths’ 1987 split, Morrissey still appears intent on feuding with him, in 2022 asking that Marr “please stop mentioning my name in interviews” (cue much hollow laughter from any hacks who, like myself, have ever tried to crowbar a Morrissey-quote out of the famously disinclined Marr).Elsewhere, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry (now reconciled) initially dispatched each other to the wilds of social Siberia over some allegedstolen tour dancers. Kanye West’s beef with Swift is bizarre and ongoing: just a few days ago, he accused her (via her relationship with Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs) of being why hehasn’t been invited to play the Superbowlhalf-time show. Kelce is reported to be “furious”.Nor have feuds been confined to musicians. In football, Brian Clough and Don Reviefought over the soul of circa-1970s Leeds United. In Hollywood, sisters Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havillandfeuded, and there was bloodcurdling enmity betweenBette Davis and Joan Crawford. On Crawford’s death, Davis was quoted as saying: “You should never say bad things about the dead, only good. Joan Crawford is dead. Good.”With royalty: did we ever solve the mystery of who made who cry (Catherine? Meghan?) overPrincess Charlotte’s wedding tights? In politics: the sibling fireworks of the 2010 Labour party leadership contest led to David and Ed Miliband beingrebrandedas the Cain and Abel of New Labour.View image in fullscreenEd and David Miliband.Photograph: Nick Ansell/PAThen there are writers. The 18th-century poets Lord Byron and John Keatsgrated on each other. Novelist Julian Barnesstarted a feudwith Martin Amis (later resolved) when he dropped his wife, Pat Kavanagh, as his literary agent. In US literary circles, Gore Vidalremarked of fellow authorTruman Capote’s death: “A wise career move.” Norman Mailer alsofuriously feudedwith Vidal, at one point punching him to the floor. Getting up, Vidal is supposed to have said: “Once again, words fail Norman Mailer.” Another literaryfeud involved novelist sisters, AS Byatt and Margaret Drabble, the latter observing: ”Discussing my sister just makes trouble.”Some might prefer to think that all these celebrity skirmishes say something: that the famous are the absolute worst for feuding, and it’s all about paper-thin skins and giant egos, with social media pouring on the rocket fuel. For new kids on the block, there may even be cynical advantage to linking your name to a more successful person via a well-timed online fracas. (There is a food chain in feuds, just as there is anything else.) But again, what about our own part?It’s somehow the famous sibling rivalries, the fraternal/sororal scuffles that bring the concept of feuding, the whole messy all-too-human shebang down to earth. Perhaps because sibling rivalry is a reminder that all of us are capable of feuding, even ifEntertainment Weeklywouldn’t be remotely interested in whether we achieve conflict resolution; even if ordinary folk don’t make up in dramatic scenes backstage atSaturday Night Live, with thousands of likes onInstagram.In the comments beneath Madonna’s post, John wrote a message, thanking her for “forgiving me and my big mouth”. John and Madonna’s well-cooked beef is done, but at 78 and 66 years old respectively, you really do have to marvel at the precious battery-life expended on verbally tearing lumps out of each other over the years. To paraphrase John’s own song, sorry wasn’t the hardest word, it was just a bit of a long time coming.Explore more on these topicsMadonnaThe ObserverElton JohnPsychologyCounselling and therapyInstagramRelationshipsNoel GallagherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Greek epic about Odysseus’s tortuous, adventure-filled journey home after the end of the Trojan war, composed probably between the late eighth and late seventh century BC, is surfacing in our culture right now. Great artworks from the past, ones that are read and reread across centuries, have a way of doing that. You examine them on a particular day, and their intricacies look suddenly singular, different from how they seemed 20 years ago, 50 years ago, yesterday; they offer something new, something that illuminates the world afresh. It is the Odyssey’s moment to catch the light.Homer’s epic has resurfaced most obviously through two major recent translations and two major films. British classicistEmily Wilson’s translationwas published at the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017, and not long before the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. Her alertness to the poem’s interest in structural power dynamics, including gender dynamics – themes she drew out in her introductory essay and public conversations about the translation – seemed to hit the political moment directly, and her version has become a cultural phenomenon in its own right. Another, by American literary scholar, writer and classicist Daniel Mendelsohn, is due out this month; it will be the new Penguin Classics edition, a successor to the now 30-year-old Robert Fagles translation and, before that, to EV Rieu’s version, which he worked on during the second world war, while bombs fell on London.Wilson and Mendelsohn’s translations, in some ways, are contrasting pairs: Wilson’s, in the English epic metre of iambic pentameter, is fleet, pared-back and exciting, foregrounding the rapid storytelling and thrilling pace of the original. Mendelsohn’s is much more ample; he has chosen a roomier, six-foot line that cleaves as close as possible to the original hexameter without losing the intricacies and force of Homer’s language. The result is more languorous: if Wilson’sHomerdashes, Mendelsohn’s spools out. Translation is a game of choice and compromise. By definition, a translator cannot carry over every aspect of the original into another language and cultural context. To read any translation, perhaps especially of a poetic text, is to read an interpretation, a poem that has been filtered through the capacities and preoccupations of another intelligence.Odysseus is a lonely man, an isolated man, set against forces bigger than himselfMendelsohn has been preoccupied by the Odyssey for a long time: his brilliantmemoirabout teaching it was published in 2017. Part of the reason it is in the air right now, he thinks, is that it is “maybe not just postwar, but maybe post-ideological. It’s about a world in which all the old certainties have crumbled.” What he calls the “post-ness” of the Odyssey is, he says, “not just that the Trojan war is over, but that everything everyone counted on during the war, including the model of heroism that made the war possible, is now over”. The cover of his new translation is an illustration, clean and stark with the hint of a Japanese woodblock print about it, of a tiny figure silhouetted against the backdrop of mountains, sun and sea. A lonely man, an isolated man, set against forces bigger than himself.View image in fullscreenFilms are another form of translation, from one medium into another. It will be another year beforeChristopher Nolan’s Odyssey is released, starring Matt Damon as Odysseus. One characteristic of the Odyssey is its curlicuing, looping narrative structure, which echoes the scheming, complex mind of its protagonist. The fifth word of the epic ispolytropos, literally “turning many ways”: it is an epithet for Odysseus, carrying the force of him as cunning and devious as well as much-travelled, much-wandering. Wilson renders it as “complicated”, to carry the moral ambiguities; Mendelsohn goes with “who had so many roundabout ways”, hinting at a geographic as well as mental involution.Nolan – who has form with narrative complexity, especially in movies such asInceptionandTenet– might be said to have a polytropic creative mind. It is hard to imagine that he will not want to dramatise the Odyssey’s sea-caked adventures: the hero’s entanglements with the Cyclops, the man-destroying sirens, the witch Circe – stories that are, in the poem, told in flashback by Odysseus himself, casting intriguing doubt on their veracity and drawing attention to the work’s own status as an artwork, a piece of storytelling told by another. But another new Odyssey-based film,The Return, by Uberto Pasolini, chooses instead to do something very particular with the Homeric text. Its screenplay, by John Collee and the late Edward Bond as well as Pasolini himself, strips away all notion of gods, monsters and witches; there are no seaborne adventures for Ralph Fiennes’s Odysseus, no tinges of Homer’s folklore and magic (or humour). Instead, it focuses all its attention on what unfolds on Ithaca, the island home where Odysseus’s wife Penelope, played by Juliette Binoche, and son Telemachus, await his return after 20 years’ absence.That island is hardly an Aegean paradise: it is harsh, isolated, windswept – a bleak landscape that reminded me of Colm Toíbín’s 2017 novelHouse of Names, which is also concerned with the aftermath of the Trojan war, loosely based on Euripides and Aeschylus, and which is similarly shorn of the gods. When Fiennes’s Odysseus lands on his island, his battered, ageing, naked body is face down and near death on the beach. This is a departure: in Homer’s poem, Odysseus’s eventual return is goddess-protected, and he makes it home with a stash of riches; rightly suspicious of what might await him, he disguises himself as a beggar. Pasolini’s Odysseus, though, is truly a man who has nothing left to him but his wits and his stringy old warrior’s body.What has kept him away for so long, in this version of the story, is shame – he has lost all the men who set out with him from Ithaca – and, we infer, war trauma. He has been living with another woman in a place that is easier to be than home; and it is not clear why he has returned. Above all, Fiennes’s Odysseus is, unlike Homer’s loquacious charmer, a man of silence, a man who rejects storytelling, whose life is hidden deep within himself. It is a bleak reading of the poem, but one that is in tune with our times; across the world soldiers really are returning home, changed and scarred in myriad ways, with stories they cannot tell.For Pasolini and his two mesmerising central actors, the manner in which Odysseus and Penelope gradually come to recognise each other, in the fullest sense of the word, is anxious, full of mutual suspicion and suppressed anger, before a final, tentative deliquescence into tenderness. Perhaps the film’s most striking passage, though, is when Odysseus turns his arrows on the suitors who have been harassing Penelope and consuming his wealth. He kills them all, transforming his own house into a bloody battleground, and inducting Telemachus into the brutal codes of violent manhood. All of this is there in the original. The poem has been interpreted through the lens of war trauma at least since Jonathan Shay’s 2002 book Odysseus in America, in which the psychiatrist reads the poem alongside the problems faced by US soldiers who had returned from Vietnam – trauma that on occasion played itself out as outbursts of terrible violence.View image in fullscreenThe Cyclops takes aim at Odysseus in Arnold Böcklin’s Odysseus and Polyphemus (1896).Photograph: AlamyOdysseus, then, brings war home with him. But in the Iliad, the Homeric poem set during the Trojan war, he is a very different character. Here, Odysseus is part of a collective unit, an ensemble player in an army. He is a merciless fighter, an excellent negotiator, an occasional spy; he lives by heroic codes. The Odysseus of the Odyssey, by contrast, is a loner, a man who disguises himself, who lies his way out of trouble; who dissembles so much that his identity may be lost even to himself, as Mendelsohn points out in his introduction to the new translation. When the Cyclops asks his name, Odysseus famously answers, “Ou tis” – meaning, No one. In a way, it is a comic moment: the hero has just blinded the terrifying Cyclops, so that when the one-eyed giant tries to summon help he yells to his friends: “‘No one’ is attacking me!”But the moment also serves, suggests Mendelsohn, to hint towards one of the poem’s most profound – and modern-seeming – questions: “How do we know who someone is? How do we know who we ourselves are? What is the difference between our inner and outer lives?” These questions follow the character all the way to the end of the poem. The reader is left wondering: in what sense are he and Penelope the same people who said goodbye to each other 20 years earlier? “Although the goal is the reintegration into the collective, the family, the marriage, the community, and the kingdom, the poem never shows you that,” says Mendelsohn. “The poem ends on the brink of all that, but you actually never see him as part of anything, except as the subject of his own machinations.”EV Rieu’s translation of the Odyssey, the first ever Penguin Classic, became a bestseller in 1946, its story of a returning soldier falling into the hands of thousands of returning soldiers. If there are things too full of pain to be looked at directly, the distance of myth can help.The Iliad is the poem of death. Death stalks its lines, blood soaks it. Countless young men appear in the poem only to be cut down. Its hero, Achilles, scythes mercilessly through hundreds of bodies in an attempt to slake his grief and fury at the killing of his beloved companion, Patroclus. But at the heart of the Odyssey there is life, and survival. This survival isn’t pretty, or comforting, or dignified. It involves deep loss: of comrades, of home, of a sense of place, of status, of belonging, of identity – and when those things are restored, it is not certain, exactly, what has been regained. But Odysseus is alive. He is alive, he breathes, he goes on.Daniel Mendelsohn’s translation of the Odyssey is published by Penguin Classics on 24 April. The Return is out now.Explore more on these topicsBooksHomerPoetryRalph FiennesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You think of him as a comedian, but he’s a really, really good actor. It’s not the same as the film, but it translates very well. The set was incredible.

At the moment it’s displaying this unusual 17th-century painting: often you’ve got a white woman next to a black woman, but the black woman is subservient. This is one of the few paintings where both women are the same size and position. They’re wearing these little spots of paper in the shape of a sun, moon and stars. They were a vanity thing: “Oh, look at me. I look fabulous.” They look very strange, in fact – like when a man has shaved and he’s got a bit of toilet paper on his face.3.MusicScott MatthewsView image in fullscreen‘His lyrics are extraordinary’: Scott Matthews.Photograph: Shedio RecordsI recently went to see Scott Matthews, a folk singer I absolutely adore. He has won an Ivor Novello award but he’s very under the radar. I’ve probably seen him five times. He’s a sign writer by trade, so a friend of mine got him to write out the lyrics to my favourite song of his, calligraphy style. It’s calledMona, which was the inspiration for my second novel: it’s about a woman who doesn’t come home, and it’s about yearning. His music’s fantastic, but the lyrics are extraordinary. I think the only person who has lyrics as good is Joni Mitchell.4.ExhibitionParis Noir, Centre PompidouView image in fullscreenParis Noir runs at Centre Pompidou until 30 June.Photograph: Foc Kan/WireImageAt the weekend I’m going to Paris, and I can’t wait. This is an exhibition of 150 black artists in France from 1950 to 2000, tracing their influence on French life, Paris and the international scene. I saw that it was coming and I couldn’t have got tickets any faster. I think it’s great to have something dedicated to black art at such a prestigious venue. I really applaud them for doing that. The work being showcased in the publicity material looked incredible.5.ClassicalRachmaninov 2nd Piano Concerto by Candlelight,St Mary le Strand, LondonView image in fullscreenSt Mary le Strand church, recent host to Rachmaninov’s 2nd Piano Concerto.Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockI go to hear this at least once a year – it’s my favourite piece of music. I call it the theme music toBrief Encounter, which is probably a bit of an insult. It’s a wonderful pairing of music and film: it speaks about sadness and deep love. I first saw the film when I was 18, and since then I can’t bear to just hear one of the three movements. If ever I put it on, I make sure I’ve got 33 minutes to myself, so I can hear the whole thing.6.PlaceWhitby AbbeyView image in fullscreen‘Very beautiful, atmospheric’: Whitby Abbey.Photograph: Paul LindleyLast weekend, I went to Whitby and took the 199 steps up to Whitby Abbey to see where Bram Stoker got the inspiration forDracula. It’s very beautiful, atmospheric. I can absolutely see why he got the idea for a vampire from there. It’s a gothic ruin on the top of a hill, overlooking the sea. It’s black stone. While he was waiting for his wife to join him in Whitby, he found a book that talked about this count in Romania who used to kill his enemies with a stake through the heart, and he just put two and two together.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarTheatreArtClassical musicSteve CooganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On paper, this tale of a rural teenage delinquent who dreams of glory in the annualcomté cheesemaking competitionsounds like any number of generic feelgood underdog tales. But there’s a knack to making great rural cinema, which boils down to capturing the grit and spit and personality of the place rather than some sun-dappled romantic projection of a simpler life.It helps immeasurably that Courvoisier grew up in the same remote Jura farming community in easternFrancewhere the film is set. It shows in every rough-edged, beer-drenched frame – this is earthy, sweaty, unvarnished film-making with dirt under its nails – and in particular it benefits the casting and direction of the phenomenal, largely nonprofessional actors.The full comté: quest to make a semi-hard cheese is French cinema’s breakout hit of the yearRead moreCourvoisier’s storytelling approach is sensitive but resolutely unsentimental, despite the tragedy that underpins this coming-of-age story. Teenage deadbeat Totone (Clément Faveau) spends his summer drinking, fighting, chasing girls and tooling around on battered dirt bikes. Then his alcoholic, widowed father dies, leaving Totone responsible for a failing farm and his seven-year-old sister. Totone latches on to the cheese competition, with its generous prize money, as a quick-fix solution to his predicament. But to make cheese, he decides to steal milk from young farmer Marie-Lise (Maïwene Barthelemy). Ultimately, the comté is beside the point: the nourishment in this terrific, big-hearted drama comes from Courvoisier’s satisfyingly full-blooded characters.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Holy Cow.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverWorld cinemaFranceDrama filmsCheesereviewsShareReuse this content"

At sunrise someone shoved Louisa Hardcastle, soon to be crowned head girl of Miss Mulligatawney’s School for Promising Girls, through the school’s stained-glass window. Your character, Verity Amersham, stands accused, and must present an account of her day that proves her innocence. This is achieved via aGroundhog Daystructure: you repeatedly play through the hours leading up to Verity’s expulsion as an interactive flashback, from the moment she woke, through to attending chapel and classes, and the accusation on which the story pivots. There’s no magic involved: you’re simply recounting the day’s events to your concerned father as you construct your alibi, establish whether Verity committed the crime – or if not, by whom she has been framed.Along the way you meet various school archetypes: the sadistic prefect, the hand-waggling swot, the cruel matronDeveloped by British studio Inkle,Expelled!has many of the hallmarks of the developer’s magnificent previous title,Overboard!There’s a witty script, memorable Agatha Christie-esque characters (Verity’s roommate, the conflict-scarred Russian expat Nattie, provides a standout turn) and a lightness of touch that offsets the grisly act upon which the story rests. There are hefty themes behind the cartoonish presentation too. Set in 1922 after the first world war and a global pandemic, the setting trembles with interwar trauma and the sense that the world might again collapse at any moment into chaos.At the same time there are frivolities and teenage rivalries – a social web that hums with loyalty and envy. Your task, as you repeatedly play through Verity’s day, is to make different choices and thereby expose new threads that, when gathered together, provide the true picture of what has occurred. Along the way you meet various school archetypes: the sadistic prefect, the hand-waggling swot, the cruel matron, the bepearled headmistress, each of whom has their motives and secrets – as does the school itself. The result is a kind of narrative escape room from which you must flee a predestined conclusion. It’s an ingenious contraption, unique to its chosen medium, delicious in execution.Watch a trailer for Expelled!Explore more on these topicsGamesThe ObserverPuzzle gamesRole playing gamesAdventure gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

When called on stage with their instruments to take a curtain call at the end of WNO’s newPeter Grimes,the applause in Cardiff’s Millennium Centre was deafening. This dress code began last summer, when funding cuts to WNO were announced, referred to several timesin this column. At the risk of banging on, I’ll bang on. Industrial action continues, after a re-ballotlast month. We have watched a cash-starved English National Opera shrivel. WNO’s position is perilous, with no rescue rope in sight.Communal solidarity heightened the intensity in Melly Still’s new staging ofGrimes,perceptively conductedby the company’s admired music director, Tomáš Hanus. In Chiara Stephenson’s designs (lighting Malcolm Rippeth), the Suffolk coast of composer Benjamin Britten, and of George Crabbe, poet of the original story, has vanished into a generic, semi-urban no man’s land. Emphasis now is on psychology and character. A near empty stage and black backdrop offer simplicity for touring, but also reflect a need for thrift. The wooden boat suspended above the stage, slowly spinning, casting shadows, gives us a taste of the sea, now a frame for a starry sky, now a mandorla to hold the wan figure of Grimes’s dead apprentice, who becomes an almost sacred figure.Nicky Spence, mighty actor as well as fine singer, commands the stage without dominatingMaking his debut in the title role of the fisher-outcast, the tenor Nicky Spence led a formidable ensemble, with Sarah Connolly luxury casting as a Lycra-jeaned, spiky-haired Auntie, big-hearted but tough, and David Kempster as the morally conflicted Balstrode. All supporting roles were nimbly characterised: Catherine Wyn-Rogers as the neighbourhood snoop Mrs Sedley; Fflur Wyn and Eiry Price as Auntie’s cute-girl nieces; Dominic Sedgwick as the silky-smooth apothecary, among the many.Tousled but leonine in ginger wig, Spence, mighty actor as well as fine singer, commands the stage without dominating. From his first, floated words, his Grimes reveals himself as a figure of visionary intent, affectionate to Ellen Orford (a sympathetic Sally Matthews), impetuous, self-possessed but also quick to flare. As tension rises, Spence turns his fidgets and twitches into a terrible boogie of anxiety and obsession. Four young acrobats, rippling in breakdance moves, add resonance, if not necessarily relevance. Depleted in permanent numbers but here swelled with freelance singers, the chorus sang their lungs out.As WNO’s new co-directors, Adele Thomas and Sarah Crabtree, pointed out in a rallying address from the stage,Peter Grimeswas written in 1945, one year before WNO gave its first performance. Britten’s operahas never been in better artistic health. This company, achieving work of the highest standards, is on life support. Nicholas Serota, chair of Arts Council England, is reported to have been in the audience last week. I wonder if he was struck, entering the Millennium Centre, by the irony of huge hoardings announcing a new, enlarged gift shop selling treasures “inspired by the magic of Wales”. Nothing wrong with that, but a reminder that money can be found if the will is there.Still on matters Cambrian, or very nearly, it may have escaped your notice that Parsifal, knight of the holy grail, was Welsh. Chrétien de Troyes, who first put Arthurian legend into writing in the 12th century, called him “le Gallois” – the Welshman. Conversely, or perversely, Wagner preferred the idea that the name was Arabic, meaning “perfect fool”. It suited his purpose for his final opera,Parsifal(1882). Full of Christian symbolism but equally pagan – a long and knotty subject – the work has become associated with Easter. Last week, on two evenings, Act 3 was stagedin Temple Church, which dates back to the time of Chrétien.View image in fullscreenOrpheus Sinfonia, conducted by Peter Selwyn, perform Act 3 of Parsifal at Temple Church.Photograph: Ben MeadowsPerformed in a deft new orchestration by Matthew King, directed by Julia Burbach, the simple action took place on a platform along the nave of the church, with Simon Wilding as a grizzled Gurnemanz, Neal Cooper as the wandering Parsifal and Freddie Tong as a sharp, besuited Amfortas. These expert soloists, Orpheus Sinfonia and a small, elite chorus conducted by Peter Selwyn, mustered all the conviction needed to fill this ancient space with Wagner’s perplexing religiosity and, arguably, his most magnificent score. Quite how this event came about is nearly as mysterious as the meaning of the opera itself, but the performances were sold out and the Wagner-hungry audience cheered.Spoken of as the next big star of the coming half century, 21-year-old South Korean pianistYunchan Limhas travelled the world in recent weeks performing Bach’s Goldberg Variations. For a player renowned for the Romantic repertoire – his Van Cliburn competition-winning performance of Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No 3, when he was only 18,went viral– the Bach, written for a two-manual harpsichord, is an adventure. Lim, who rushes straight to the piano stool, face obscured by long dark fringe, conjures every kind of effect, never shy of maximising the potential of a modern piano. Leading voices punch out from the counterpoint, as in Variation 10, Fughetta, with eccentric, wilful energy. He takes intrepid leaps at the airborne runs and ornaments of, say, Variation 28. Each shift of mood is a discovery.View image in fullscreenYunchan Lim at Wigmore Hall.Photograph: Wigmore Hall TrustThis is intelligent playing of spellbinding virtuosity. Lim will refine it, distil it, find more inner voices, as he did in the introverted Variation 25, the so-called “black pearl”. You may be wedded to Glenn Gould or András Schiff or Igor Levit or, on harpsichord, Mahan Esfahani: whoever delivers Bach the way you want. For now, enjoy the exuberance of this brilliant young player in all his coltish glory.Star ratings (out of five)Peter Grimes★★★★Parsifal★★★★Yunchan Lim★★★★Peter Grimestours toSouthampton(30 April),Birmingham(10 May),Milton Keynes(17 May) andPlymouth(7 June)Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe ObserverWelsh National OperaOperalive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

His new book,The Determined Spy, is about Wisner, a man who lived an extraordinary life but came to be buried at Arlington national cemetery, under asimple headstone, identified merely as a commander in the US naval reserve.“I’ve always gravitated toward controversial characters,” Waller said. “People who had loyal followings and charisma, and just as many people who hated them, who even considered them evil.”‘Have you no sense of decency, sir?’ Joe McCarthy and the road to TrumpRead more“The first was ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan, who headed up Franklin Roosevelt’s spy service, the Office of Strategic Services. He was charismatic, his agents revered him, but there were people in the Pentagon and even the state department who thought he was as evil as Hitler. I recall during that time running across Wisner among hundreds of OSS officers and thinking: ‘Gee, this is kind of an interesting guy.’ What little I had on him, I put in my stories file, and thought: ‘Well, I’ll get back to him.’“The next book I wrote was Disciples, an ensemble biography of [CIA leaders] Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, Bill Colby andBill Casey. And again, I ran across Wisner, particularly when he was working for Dulles in Germany after the war, in charge of 200 operatives. And I talked at that point to Wisner’s oldest son, Frank Wisner II.”Wisner II, whodied in February, aged 86, did not just look like his father. He also carved out a high-level government career, as ambassador to Zambia, the Philippines, Egypt and India, and US envoy to Kosovo.“This is the first time the family opened up,” Waller said. “They made all the material available. Wisner’s personal papers are at the University of Virginia. His middle son, Ellis Wisner, provided a lot, particularly medical material, stuff that hadn’t been released.“Frank Wisner II had gotten declassified material from the CIA that he turned over to me, which was a big help. With the three sons –Graham Wisneris unfortunately deceased too – I spent probably 50 hours on interviews about their father. There were some very painful sessions. His death was quite a blow.”Wisner was 56 when, in October 1965, he killed himself. It was the awful culmination of a long struggle that saw Wisner committed to a psychiatric hospital in 1958. He experienced bipolar disorder, little understood in his time.Psychiatrists gave Waller “a whole stack of reading to do, to get a sense of how bipolar disorder can evolve, and a lot of the myths behind it”. Waller “tried to accurately portray the shock Wisner’s suicide was for everybody.“Ellis Wisner told me he thought that maybe his father, at the very end, was debating whether or not to kill himself, by the fact that he went to the family farm [in Maryland], he got his work clothes on.“But when you read the scientific literature, you find that this is a normal way that suicide can play out, that the disease can be so unrelenting, so oppressive, that suicide seems the only option, and the person about to commit it becomes almost at peace with himself, with how his life is going to end. That’s what you saw with Wisner … the symptoms for this disease, if untreated, can be so relentless.”So could Wisner, in work, family life and intense socializing with the Georgetown set, a hard-drinking group of government officials and journalists, among them Phil Graham, a publisher of the Washington Post“People confused that side of Wisner with the manic depression,” Waller said. “A world war two buddy wondered whether Wisner’s deep hatred of the Russians was part of his disease. But the Russians gave him a lot to hate in their takeover of eastern Europe. He was ahead of the US government when he was posted in Romania [during the second world war], in terms of warning that the next enemy was going to be the Soviet Union, which at that time was an ally.“There’s parts in the book where you see even Donovan worried about Wisner having to dial it back. He wasn’t a religious man but he took his own role in history very, very seriously. And eventually, I think you see the country coming up to where his view is, and viewing the Russians as an existential threat. You have to see yourself in that period, in 1950 or so, when Americans firmly believe the Russians are bent on world domination. The Pentagon even picked out a day they thought the Soviets might invade western Europe: 1 July 1952. Nothing happened, but the paranoia which Wisner felt, at the tip of the spear? It existed.”View image in fullscreenFrank Wisner, second from right, with other US officials and officers at the time of the Berlin airlift, circa 1948. Photograph: Wisner family collectionPhotograph: Wisner Family CollectionTurned inward, that paranoia fueled the red scare, anti-communist witch-huntsled by Joe McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican senator now on many minds as Donald Trump purges the federal government.“Wisner had a view on the red scare,” Waller said. “He saw a huge threat of communism, but it was outside communism, Russian communism, not the Communist party in the US. He didn’t think much of that. He thought guys like McCarthy were really barking up the wrong tree.”Wisner was surveilled himself, by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI. Suspicions largely arose from a wartime affair with a Romanian princess, one of many parts of Wisner’s story that seem stranger than fiction, or at least evoke novels by Graham Greene or Ian Fleming, who was Wisner’s friend in London.Waller notes the immense human cost of Wisner’s efforts to topple elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala, in 1953 and 1954. He also describes CIA failures, many in eastern Europe and notably in Hungary in 1956, when Russia crushed an uprising.Few think Wisner broke down due to guilt over Iran and Guatemala. Some think Hungary broke him. Waller does not. Wisner’s illness was powerful enough on its own.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Waller said Wisner’s work before his breakdown should all be seen in context:“The popular view is that the CIA are rogue actors, hatching these coups in the dark without anybody in the US government really knowing about it – which is a bunch of baloney. [Harry] Truman knew full well about what [under Wisner] was blandly called the office of policy coordination, which eventually became 6,000 men and women involved in clandestine operations worldwide. [Dwight] Eisenhower … was more than eager to point the CIA and Wisner’s forces toward third-world targets. The Eisenhower view was you’re either for the US or against it. What was happening was exactly what the White House wanted.”Sometimes, the White House wanted even shadier work. Nazis and Nazi sympathizers wererecruitedto the anti-communist cause.Waller said: “The whole issue of working with Nazis wasn’t as bad as has been portrayed, and it wasn’t as good as has been portrayed. There were a handful of Nazis they brought in to the US. They worked with a lot more overseas. But Wisner was always a diehard anti-Nazi.”Waller keeps an eye on current events. As the war in Ukraine drags on, Trump not having delivered peace as promised, the US president’s attitudes toward Russia and Vladimir Putin are in perpetual question.“We are now in the middle of the second cold war against the Russians,” Waller said. “Wisner was there at the beginning of the first, 70 years ago. And I think there’s lessons to be learned from that. You’re seeing history repeat itself, in some respects. Not sure we’re winning at this point, but we’re in, definitely in a second cold war.“Another question I get asked is: ‘How do you compare the quality of Wisner’s CIA with the CIA now? And the answer is, it’s vastly superior today.”In 2022, US intelligencepredictedRussia’s invasion of Ukraine with striking accuracy. Failures, particularly overwhetherIraq had weapons of mass destruction, also dot the record.The Determined Spy is a serious book, a study of American covert power and its lasting effects on those who attempted to wield it, as well as on the world at large. But though Frank Wisner was a powerful man, Waller focuses on his human side, his weaknesses as well as his strengths. Some episodes from Wisner’s career, particularly from the early stages, as the CIA was born, produce a kind of comedy of trial and error.View image in fullscreenThe Determined Spy.Photograph: DuttonIn Turkey during the second world war, Waller said, a “former savings and loan business executive from Illinois, Lanning ‘Packy’ MacFarland, just made a complete mess of the Istanbul station.“Frank Wisner II said his dad told him about his first meeting with MacFarland in Istanbul. Wisner went to a nightclub, hoping to see him there, kind of incognito. And the lights to the stage turn on, and there’s Packy MacFarland with a line of chorus girls, dressed in drag, singing, ‘Boo Boo, baby, I’m a spy.’ That was a favorite song among a lot of other spies there. Packy wasn’t the only one with poor operational security.”The Determined Spy ispublished in the USby DuttonIn the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

He stops short, though, of scaring his daytime TV fansKitty EmpireSat 12 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShare“I’m all about playful subversion,” declares Olly Alexander with a grin on the final night of his UK tour. Clad in a series of outfits whose shiny buttons nod towards London’spearly kings and queensand the dressing-up box – there’s one handily located on the left side of the stage – he is outlining the essence ofPolari, the slang once used by the LGBTQ+ community, showfolk and the denizens of London’s Soho, as was.Evolving out of the vocabularies of Italian immigrants and Travellers to evade the understanding of law enforcement and mainstream society in the 19th and early-mid 20th centuries, Polari also doubles as the title of Alexander’s latest, queer-club pop-themed album. Released two months ago, it was the first under his own name; previously, he had traded as Years & Years, first as a band, then as a solo project.The red tights and codpiece from the singer’s Eurovision outfit are paraded around with a kind of wistful fondnessThe gravelly tones of Ian McKellen provide a few booming Polari phrases during the show’s opening sequence; the great man himself occupies a box up to the right. Aptly, we’re in a plush, famous theatre on the fringes of Soho where thekhazismay bebijoubut in no waymanky. Aptly as well: throughout Alexander’s set, it sometimes feels a bit like watching a West End theatre show about a national treasure gamely regrouping after some career contretemps, returning to musical theatre as his first love. There really should be a glossy souvenir programme to parse on the tube home.Chart-wise,Polarididn’t match Alexander’s previous outings, two of which went to No 1 (most recently with 2022’sNight Callalbum). Then there was hisrout at last year’s Eurovision, his performance garnering the dreaded nul points in the public vote. Postmortems abounded online; many wondered whether the UK should have taken part at all, given the participation of Israel.View image in fullscreenAlexander’s jacket underlines his desire to ‘pay tribute to the gay club sounds of the past’.Photograph: Andy Hall/the ObserverGamely, Alexander keepsDizzy, his Eurovision song, in the set, but performs it at the piano, accompanied by two backing vocalists whose dulcet tones and dance moves flesh out the night’s bare bones set-up (a drummer and a multi-instrumentalist are housed behind a strip of feathery pampas grass). The red tights and codpiece from the singer’s Eurovision outfit are paraded around with a kind of wistful fondness – “I wouldn’t change a thing,” he says – before he returns them to the dressing-up box, where they stick out “like the legs of the Wicked Witch of the West”.It’s all a far cry from what aPolaritour could have been. On paper, the choice of producerDanny L Harle(also in the house tonight) seemed inspired. An alumnus of the hyperpop incubator PC Music, he has had a hand in critical and commercial successes for artists such asCaroline PolachekandDua Lipa, as well as his own ear-ringingHarlecoreLP of 2021. Harle’s fondness for hi-NRG and Eurodance tropes were a good match for Alexander and his desire to pay tribute to the gay club sounds of the past (and fully author his own work – no band members, no external writers, just two people in a room).Watch the video for Polari by Olly Alexander.Had they maxed out these convictions, Alexander the light entertainer might have been reborn as an outre night creature, feted as an auteur alongside Charli xcx. There’s a tantalising hint of that alternative outcome in the title track itself, a festival of whacking greatJam and Lewissynth beats last heard on Janet Jackson’s 1980s albums, lit by harsh strobes and full of attitude at people who are “saying nothing”.A song calledI Knowturns the phrase “I know what you are” from accusation to come hither on another promising Jackson-meets-2020s cut. The more fluorescent sounds of thePolarialbum rightly belong in a nightclub, with its livelier production choices turned up to 11, rather than a velvet-seated institution.As it is, this tour seems to be designed not to scare theLorraineandMichael McIntyreaudiences any further, one that merely adds thePolarisongs to Alexander’s Years & Years back catalogue –King,DesireandShine, three foundational 2014-15 hits are here, alongsideIf You’re Over Mefrom 2018’sPalo Santo.View image in fullscreenAlexander at his dressing-up box.Photograph: Andy Hall/the ObserverIt’s a Sin, the Pet Shop Boys track that lent its title to the Channel 4 drama set amid the 80s Aids crisis, which established Alexander as beloved multi-hyphenate, is also in the mix. It’s hard to imagine synth master Chris Lowe voluntarily signing off on the track’s electric guitar solo, however, or Harle being OK with the unnecessary axe work on the songPolari. The tour of an album dedicated to the pleasures of the synthetic might be better served as a guitar-free zone.Alexander himself is never less than good company, warm in presence and professionally loose-limbed, but there is something a little self-limiting about even this new batch of songs, tracks that were intended as a candid, authentic reset. Changing into a differentcapella(hat), he launches intoMake Me a Man, a bouncy synth-pop number replete with double entendres. “When I wake in the morning will you have something for me?” sings Alexander. “Won’t you fill this hole” – he pauses – “in my heart?” What’s Polari for “missed opportunity”?Explore more on these topicsOlly AlexanderKitty Empire's artist of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

My name is Nobody, a name is nothing, like family, like childhood, I don’t believe in it, I don’t want it.” Constance Debré has a grand name – her grandfather was the prime minister who drafted the French constitution – and she’s long been trying to disgrace it. She is driven by a mixture of petulant rebellion, existential longing for erasure and revolutionary anarchism. A decade ago she left behind her husband, job as a criminal defence lawyer, furniture and crockery to embark on a new life of casual sex with women and iconoclastic, fervent writing.FollowingLove Me Tenderand Playboy, Name is the final instalment in the autofictional trilogy where, with fury, disdain and panache, Debré has recorded her revulsion at bourgeois life and at the legal system that allowed her ex-husband to remove their son because of her homosexual promiscuity and writing. Now, as she witnesses her father dying, she goes further in renouncing family, childhood and the name she hopes can die with him – though it’s nonetheless emblazoned on the cover.In this book D, the adult Debré, tells the story of her addict parents; we have glimpsed them in previous volumes, but here they come into focus in scenes that bring fairytale elements to her hyper-realism. There’s her father, the elegant war reporter, trying in his own way to disgrace his illustrious name, coming together with a beautiful woman who grew up in a chateau for a violent, ecstatic love affair. They begin with opium, smoking from picturesque pipes while their daughters look on. Then opium becomes scarce so they move on to heroin (“the great equaliser, more effective than unemployment, than Mitterand”), lose their income, home and health, leaving the young Constance to beg them to snap out of it, to parent. Her mother dies when Constance is 16.Debré’s attitude towards this material is complex and ultimately unresolved. She’s lucky, she rather wildly announces, to have had addict parents, because addicts create their own laws. “Having junkies for parents makes you grow up within a strong moral system.” So there’s a strand here adumbrating a moral system – indeed, her publishers describe it as a manifesto. She wants to do away with inheritance, marriage and the family, and childhood itself. She wants to do away with literature, except possibly Proust. Let’s burn some books! But I felt there was desperation within the bravado with which Debré churns out judgments and injunctions. The book is at its most powerful when feelings too complex for Debré’s own moral systems begin to seep in. Indeed, it is more a breakdown than a manifesto.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Her lover asks how she feels, and her answer is wild and blank. “It is stupefying. To see her. Or to remember that all that existed. She. She and I. She for me. She was everything. And then nothing. I tried to find something other than stupefaction, I couldn’t. Not that day and not since. Nothing else is left.” Typically, Debré ends the section here, just when she’s begun to acknowledge the confusion of grief. She shuts the reader out as she shuts out her lovers, until eventually she meets a woman who’s allowed to stick around because she plays along, pretending there’s no real feeling involved: “the word love, of course, is never spoken”.Heaven forfend I should claim to love her books! Debré’s trilogy has shaken up the French literary scene but it’s gloriously unclear what it amounts to. The French love their rebels, which makes it harder to really be one. For all her claims to be entirely apart from the literary world, Debré has much in common withEdouard Louis, another writer renouncing name and class and denouncing hypocrisy in violently stripped-down prose. Because the working-class Louis is concerned with inequality – with the appalling bodily injustice meted out by the class system – there’s some sense that his books offer a vision of social regeneration. Though their verve and delight comes from his own ascent, with its particular mix of luck, desperate exploitation and loving redemption, they do suggest how change might work on a less makeshift and individual scale.Debré, on the other hand, offers only destruction, and makes the experience of reading her books wilfully claustrophobic. But perhaps this destruction may be necessary. Angela Carter talked about the Marquis de Sade as a moral pornographer, justified because the destruction pursued by characters such as his Juliette assaults the structures of our social world so much that renewal starts to seem thinkable, even if neither Sade nor Juliette were particularly interested in it. Something similar may be true of Debré’s lurid moral starkness. And certainly for a while after finishing Name, much else I read felt artificially sugary in the book’s aftertaste. Debré makes it harder to be hypocritical; harder to contrive stories about sophisticated made-up people. Name isn’t a manifesto for a new world, but it’s all the more effective as a work of demolition that makes new manifestos possible.Lara Feigel is the author ofLook!

Gia Coppola’sThe Last Showgirl– streaming on Mubi from 18 April – is quite rare in its focus on one such person: Shelly, a dancer in a long-running revue on the Vegas strip, now pushing 60 and at a crossroads when said revue announces its imminent closure. Short and light on plot, it’s a character study built on a poignant night-and-day contrast, as Shelly literally performs a glitzy Vegas dream that all looks a bit shabby by daylight in her modest bungalow in the desert suburbs. Pamela Anderson affectingly brings her own career baggage to the role of someone who takes her art more seriously than anyone takes her, in a film intent on stripping the city of some varnish.View image in fullscreenElizabeth Berkley in the ‘vastly entertaining’ Showgirls (1995).Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockIt certainly gives Vegas showgirls a better name than, well,Showgirls, Paul Verhoeven’s tacky (and, despite the critical mauling it received in 1995, vastly entertaining) tale of a young dancer intent on working her way up a slippery pole – with all manner of exploitative svengalis and sharp-clawed rivals standing between her and her showgirl dream. If she saw Coppola’s film, she might not be so keen.Not that any Las Vegas film winds up showing the city in a wholly glowing light. TheOcean’s11films – whether you prefer the1960 Rat Pack original, orSteven Soderbergh’s trilogyof casino-world escapades – are about as close as you can get to good clean fun in a location literally built on underworld activity, which is to say their various cheery heists mostly amount to crime without consequences. (Soderbergh would get more seamily under the skin of Vegas in his wonderfully rueful, richly detailed Liberace biopic,Behind the Candelabra.) For long stretches ofDiamonds Are Forever, meanwhile, Vegas just serves as a gaudier-than-usual backdrop to the usual James Bond derring-do: it suits his interests rather well.You can’t think of Vegas without thinking of Elvis, of course, and his 1964 starring vehicleViva Las Vegasis a romp so bright and bouncy it may as well have been made by the city’s tourism board – even the marketing pitched the place as “the fun capital of the world”. The film itself, co-starring a game Ann-Margret and mixing standard Vegas hedonism with grand prix action, is jaunty nonsense, which puts it at the upper end of the Presley filmography. Baz Luhrmann’s whirling, thrilling biopicElvis(Netflix), however, rather sours the icon’s association with the city: behind its feverishly cut Vegas performance montages and eye-popping production design is a sprawling sadness.View image in fullscreenFrank Sinatra and Patrice Wymore in Ocean’s Eleven (1960).Photograph: Cinetext/ Warner Bros/ AllstarFlying Elvis impersonators are the signature sight gag ofHoneymoon in Vegas, an appealing fizzy, scatty 1992 romcom that might be the most upbeat of all romance-in-Vegas movies: Nicolas Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker’s love is tested by the manipulations of James Caan’s older Vegas high-roller, but all comes right in the end. (Weirdly, Adrian Lyne’s ludicrousIndecent Proposalplayed pretty much exactly the same plot for melodrama, in Vegas to boot, the very next year.)Mostly, Hollywood has taught us that the city isn’t really conducive to everlasting love: see recent Oscar champAnora, with its harshly updated Cinderella story that all starts to go south with a hasty Vegas chapel wedding, or Francis Ford Coppola’s underrated, iridescent musicalOnefrom the Heart, in which a Vegas-dwelling couple drift apart on the night of their fifth wedding anniversary. It’s a melancholy affair, but feelgood viewing compared to Mike Figgis’s shatteringLeaving Las Vegas, in which Cage’s suicidal alcoholic screenwriter and Elisabeth Shue’s ill-treated sex worker forge a soul connection amid surrounding despair.View image in fullscreenAnnette Bening and Warren Beatty in Barry Levinson’s Bugsy (1991).Photograph: Tri-Star/Rex/ShutterstockThe little-remembered 1949 noirThe Lady Gambles(Internet Archive) serves up a slice of married life dimmed by the city’s distractions: Barbara Stanwyck is compelling as a well-to-do housewife drawn swiftly into ruinous gambling addiction on a trip to Vegas. For better or worse, casinos remain the lifeblood of the city, as demonstrated in Martin Scorsese’s dizzily expansive crime opusCasino, which lays bare the often grisly business workings behind the scenes. But it’sBugsy, Barry Levinson’s handsomely dressed biopic of 1940s mobster and driving Vegas strip founder Bugsy Siegel, that gives the city a somewhat glamorised origin story.All titles in bold are widely available to stream unless otherwise specifiedAlso new on streamingPaddington in Peru(Netflix)The third big-screen outing for Britain’s best-loved bear is the weakest: cheerful, amusing in spots (particularly wherever Olivia Colman’s shady nun character is involved), but missing the ironic, innovative touch that absent director Paul King brought to the first two. Kids were still delighted, however, and its arrival on Netflix this week is a half-term coup.View image in fullscreenPaddington in Peru.Photograph: StudioCanalThe Balconettes(BFI Player)French actor Noémie Merlant makes her directorial debut with this chaotic but enjoyable melange of ghost story, farce and feminist revenge tale, following three female roommates who wind up in bloody trouble over a scorching midsummer weekend in Marseille – the humid atmosphere is half the pleasure here.September 5Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum delivers a tight, in-the-moment dramatisation of how one American newsroom responded to the Munich massacre as it unfolded during the 1972 Olympics: strenuously apolitical as it narrows its focus strictly to immediate, clock-ticking stakes, it’s certainly absorbing but adds little perspective to previous accounts of the event.Explore more on these topicsFilmGuy Lodge's streaming and DVDsLas VegasPamela AndersonOcean's ElevenBehind the CandelabraSteven SoderberghDiamonds Are ForeverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this revealing documentary, created with director Jane Mingay, she tells her own story, and also a sobering parallel history of 20th-century British race relations. Adopted by a white Essex couple as a baby, Black grew up surrounded by racism. She left to study in Coventry, the birthplace of two-tone, and became “the first rudegirl” with her androgynous look and confident stage presence.

On my first evening in the Algarve’s most easterly city – just 18 miles from the border with Spain – tangerine skies smudged by pillowy clouds unfurl above the old town, with its jumble of church towers and terracotta roofs.For such a romantic spectacle, the best vantage point proves to be the seven-arch Roman bridge spanning the meandering Gilão river, where I join an appreciative crowd of locals and off-season travellers. Small talk ripples through the group, and a young Portuguese couple choose this moment to surreptitiously bolt a padlock bearing their initials to the metal lattice. Even the living statue gets off his box to soak it all in.View image in fullscreenOn either bank, street lamps gild the cobblestone promenades and pavement restaurants. Upriver, beyond a pretty bend of houses generously dubbed “Little Venice”, the terrain climbs towards the Serra do Caldeirão mountains; downriver, the landscape opens expansively, shifting through gleaming salt pans to where the lagoon system and beaches of Ria Formosa kiss the ocean, two miles away and out of sight. The scene could almost be stolen from another century.I’m in this former fishing community, which is now geared towards tourism, in early March and the city is warming up, in every way, after winter’s hibernation. “Come back in the summer – there’s nightly music, local festivals. It’s a whole other place,” says Hélio Soares, birding guide and captain of my sun-powered boat tour with Solar Moves the next day. But I’ve already fallen for the serenity. With no other vessels in sight, we admire flamingos, ospreys, spoonbills and oystercatchers foraging in the rich marshlands.View image in fullscreenThe Roman bridge on the Gilão River.Photograph: Picture That/AlamyThe weather is bright but far too brisk to dive off the boat for a swim, so we settle for sightseeing: first, the village of Santa Luzia, the “octopus capital of Portugal”, with its battered fishing boats and wooden tackle sheds, and then Isla Tavira. At more than eight miles long, it’s the largest of the area’s barrier islands and boasts some of the Algarve’s wildest beaches, with several spots for naturists.Tavira’s wealth peaked during the Age of Discovery, from the late 15th to 17th centuries, and it still bears faded hallmarks of grandeurMost sunseekers will take the passenger ferry from the city to Praia da Ilha de Tavira, or drive four miles south to ride the quaint tourist train across the dunes to Praia do Barril, both of which have excellent facilities and restaurants. Instead, Hélio points out his favourite stretch of the island, the lesser-known Terra Estreita. We dock and I follow a long boardwalk to greet the Atlantic at a shell-strewn expanse of sand.Back in the old town, I meet up with professional storyteller Maria Luísa Francisco from Genuine Algarve for a walk around Tavira’s monuments. It would be easy to quickly tick off the medieval castle and a handful of the city’s 21 churches – Igreja Santa Maria do Castelo and Igreja da Misericórdia are among the most elaborate, both built on sites of former mosques from the time of Moorish rule. But Luísa shares folktales like only a local can, even taking me to an archaeological dig boasting Phoenician relics from the eighth-century BC.“Historically, we’ve always welcomed foreigners and benefitted from cultural exchange. I consider Tavira still a work in progress, although perhaps that’s an unpopular opinion these days,” Luísa says, referring to the growing sentiment against the number of foreign nationals settling in the Algarve.View image in fullscreenThe church of Santa Maria do Castelo.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyTavira is the closest Portuguese port to Morocco and its wealth peaked during the Age of Discovery, from the late 15th to 17th centuries, when Portuguese kings sponsored campaigns in north Africa and beyond. A series of seemingly biblical misfortunes followed – plague, earthquake, silted river channels and overfishing – but, as Luísa points out, the city still bears faded hallmarks of grandeur, including facades adorned withazulejotiles and Juliet balconies, and distinctive “hipped” roofs allegedly inspired by trade links with the east.I’m staying in a building dating back to 1888. Casa Beleza do Sul is a guesthouse lovingly renovated by owner Paola Boragine at the turn of the millennium using only natural and authentic materials. The results are stylish, light-filled rooms, some with self-catering kitchenettes, and twin sun terraces on which to take coffee. Sitting just one road back from the riverside main square of Praça da República, it couldn’t be more central; some of Tavira’s best restaurants are just a short amble away.It’s easy in low season to get a table at the city’s most popular establishments. On successive evenings, I sample octopus caught in Santa Luzia on a bed of sweet potato at chicO Tonel, try local delicacies such asmuxama(salt-cured tuna) at lively gastro-barCome na Gaveta, and demolish a buttery catch of the day atMesa Farta, an upmarket new opening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our chatter is punctuated by the thud of fish hitting fishmongers’ slabs, but Inêz demystifies the stalls of crustaceans, clams and cephalopods, finally picking the freshest snapper to take back for a cooking class.“Fishing in Tavira has always been connected to the production of salt, which was used to preserve and export the catch. Both traditions date back well over two millennia, before even the Romans,” she says, adding that she prefers to use delicate, hand-harvestedflor de salas a final garnish for her dishes, rather than coarse or industrially processed alternatives.View image in fullscreenSérgio Cupertino, founder of Cavalos à Ria.Photograph: Amelia DugganInêz’s elegant farmhouse and B&B, Monte do Álamo, sits amid 17 acres of carob, olive, almond and fig trees in the highlands overlooking Tavira. I whip up three courses under her tutelage, including a classic Algarvecataplana, a riot of peppers, tomatoes, fish and clams, steamed into a seafood stew. As we dine outside on the hilltop, I begin to suspect Tavira’s greatest draw might be how easily it offers up the surrounding countryside.This is something horse-riding guide Sérgio Cupertino, founder of Cavalos à Ria, specialises in. It’s my last morning in the south of Portugal before I return home to Lisbon, so he adapts his classic sunset tour to meet me just after dawn at his avocado farm seven miles east of Tavira. We saddle up and trot into the Ria Formosa natural park, following empty river beaches through samphire and flowering cacti until we reach Cacela Velha. It deserves its reputation as the Algarve’s best-preserved village: stone cottages with brightly painted lintels climb towards a whitewashed 16th-century chapel overlooking the river and pearlescent ocean beyond.“In summer, this cottage opens as atasca(tavern) and we can rest here and enjoy oysters, champagne and this view. I hope you come back to Tavira, so you can know it in all seasons,” Sérgio says, echoing the invitations I’ve encountered throughout my time here. Now, finally, I’m convinced.Doubles atCasa Beleza do Sulfrom €80.

Although there are many recipes in the world for tiramisu, it is in the Top Three Sodha Family Puddings and will therefore always have a place on our table. Given that we, as a family, often take our food down a Middle Eastern route (this year, we’ll be eating Iranianfesenjanandghormeh sabzi), I wanted the tiramisu to join us on the journey, hence the rich, creamy tahini and the heavenly combination of coffee and cardamom.Tahini tiramisuYou’ll need a tin or baking dish that’s about 30cm x 23cm x 6cm (I use a typical American 9-inch x 13 inch one). These quantities make abigtiramisu, so simply halve them if you want to serve six. Either way, you’ll need to make it the day before serving, or start in the morning to serve in the evening.Prep10 minCook50 minChill4 hr+Serves12360ml hot brewed strong coffee– I used espresso120mlDisaronno1½ tsp ground cardamom4 large eggs180g caster sugar400g mascarpone¾ tsp fine sea salt300ml fridge-cold double cream160g tahini(8 tbsp)30 sponge fingers(AKA ladyfingers or savoiardi) – ie, 2 x 200g packets1 tbsp cocoa powder1 tbsp black sesame seeds, to finishMix the coffee, Disaronno and cardamom in a jug, then pour half of it into a deep-sided dish and put the jug and dish to one side.Grab two big bowls. Separate the eggs, and put the whites in one bowl and the yolks in the other. Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks.Add the caster sugar to the egg yolk bowl and whisk until the mixture has doubled in size and turned pale and creamy. Add the mascarpone and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and whisk again for three minutes on a slow to medium speed until well combined. Tap the whisks to knock any lingering mascarpone into the bowl, then put it to one side (don’t wash the whisks just yet).Pour the cold cream into another big bowl and whisk to stiff peaks. Add the tahini and mix well with a whisk until well combined. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, fold and mix the cream and tahini mixture into the egg yolk and sugar mixture, until well combined. Very carefully (so as not to deflate the whites), fold the egg whites into the cream mixture with a spatula, then set to one side.Put your baking dish/tiramisu tray in front of you. Working with one biscuit at a time, roll and soak each biscuit for a second or two in the dish of brewed coffee, Disaronno and cardamom, then lay it in the tiramisu tray. Repeat, neatly laying the biscuits side by side, until you’ve used up half the biscuits and all the coffee mix in the dish. Pour half the mascarpone cream on top of the biscuits and spread it out evenly.Refill the now-empty dish with the remaining coffee, Disaronno and cardamom mix from the jug , roll and soak the remaining biscuits in it as before, and arrange them neatly on top of the layer of mascarpone cream. Spread the rest of the mascarpone cream evenly over the top.Put the cocoa powder in a small sieve, sprinkle it evenly over the top, then finish with an even scattering of black sesame seeds. Cover the tiramisu and pop it in the fridge to set for at least four hours, or overnight, before serving.Explore more on these topicsEasterMeera Sodha recipesDessertFoodCakeCheeseEggsBiscuitsrecipesShareReuse this content"

To be honest, a lot of them tasted pretty similar and the spicing was almost universally far too subtle for my tastes. The differences mainly came in the quality of the dried fruit, the level of citrus and how dry some of the buns were. Even so, and while nothing beats a hot cross bun bought from a traditional bakery or one made at home, there were a couple of supermarket versions that are worth buying.The best supermarket hot cross bunsBestall-rounderWaitrose richly fruited hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 4 at Waitrose★★★★☆A good amount of fruit, but what really makes these stand apart is the flavour of the fruit, which is plumper and richer than most of the other buns. I like these a lot, but wish they had a touch more spice.Best splurgeM&S luxury fruited hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£2 for 4 at Ocado★★★★☆A very good, classic hot cross bun. Generous with the fruit, light on spices and with just a hint of candied peel. If you like dried fruit, these are a great choice.Best bargainAldi Specially Selected luxury fruited hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£1.09 for 4 at Aldi★★★☆☆Possibly the least spiced of the entire bunch, but they are very generous with the fruit and have a gentle citrus flavour. Equally as good as some of the other supermarket offerings, but a pretty basic classic bun.And the rest …AsdaExceptional extra fruity hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£1.43 for 4 at ASDA★★★★☆These have the highest percentage of candied peel and are very nice hot cross buns.

They’re very pale and oddly wrinkly, as if something went wrong when they were made, although that might be just the batch I received. But they also have a really high percentage of dried fruit, a wider variety of spices and a pleasant combination of orange oil and zest, although the orange flavour is much more present than the spices. Overall, a nice flavour and texture, but not a looker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I don’t think the flavour is particularly special, but the texture is lighter than many of the others, so I’m sure some people would like these. I would buy again, but not my first choice.Co-op Irresistible richly fruited hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£2 for 4 at Co-op★★☆☆☆A good amount of dried fruit, but a tad dry. There’s a hint of lemon from the mixed peel, but overall these are a bit forgettable. A pass from me.Tesco Finest extra fruity hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£1.80 for 4 at Tesco★★☆☆☆These may be labelled as extra fruity, but they have a lower percentage of fruit compared with many other buns in this roundup. The bun itself is very soft and the fruit plump, but these don’t stand out from the contenders. Average.Ocado hot cross bunsView image in fullscreen£1.35 for 6 at Ocado★★☆☆☆Not very sweet or very flavourful, and also quite dry.

Inspired by Italian chefGennaro Contaldo, the approach creates a delicious sauce that coats the pasta beautifully. Trim just a few millimetres off the discoloured end of the broccoli stalk, then, to ensure it cooks down and becomes tender, slice the rest of the stalk into 1cm-long pieces.Italian-style whole broccoli pastaThis is Italian simplicity at its best. The whole broccoli is cooked until it’s soft, so it breaks down into a delicious sauce that coats the pasta. In its simplest form, with just olive oil, broccoli and pasta, when seasoned generously, it makes a three-ingredient dish that’s delicious just as it is, but to take it up a notch add a few capers (the ones packed in sea salt rather than brine have an even more exceptional flavour), garlic, lemon, chilli flakes and pangrattato (toasted breadcrumbs) or parmesan. It also costs about £1 a portion even when made using organic ingredients, so it’s a firm family favourite in our house.Salt and black pepper1 whole broccoli(350g), or turnip tops or other greens30ml extra-virgin olive oil375g pasta(I used wholewheat)25g capers, drained or rinsed, and dried (optional)2 small garlic cloves, peeled and roughly choppedGrated zest and juice of ½ lemonGrated parmesan or pecorino, to serve, orpangrattato(toasted breadcrumbs), to tasteChilli flakes, to tasteBring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, cut the florets off the broccoli, slice the tough end of the stalk into thin rounds, then cut the more tender parts into quarters lengthways. Drop the lot into the boiling water, return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, warm the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the capers, if using, fry until crisp, then add the garlic and fry-cook for just a minute more. Take off the heat.Once the broccoli is cooked, use a slotted spoon to lift it out of the water and into the frying pan (keep the pot of hot water). Return the frying pan to the heat, and saute the broccoli for a couple of minutes, breaking it down slightly with a potato masher.Meanwhile, bring the pan of broccoli water back to a boil, add the pasta and cook according to the packet instructions. Transfer the pasta directly into the broccoli pan, adding a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen the sauce, if needed. Stir and toss over a medium heat until well combined, then add the lemon juice (and grated zest, too, if your lemon is unwaxed and organic). Season to taste and serve with optional parmesan or toasted breadcrumbs or gratedcured egg yolksand chilli flakes sprinkled over the top.Explore more on these topicsPastaWaste notFood wasteFoodVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We buy the whole animal and use every part of it, but my favourite cut is definitely the chops. When I was growing up, my mum would always roast lamb onEasterSunday and serve it with potatoes and a tangy green sauce, so we usually do something similar at Cafe Cecilia.Herb-crusted lamb rack, baked potatoes, radicchio and green saucePrep20 minCook1 hrServes23tbsp curly parsley, finely chopped1tsp finely chopped rosemary leaves1tbsp finely chopped oregano leaves170gfresh white breadcrumbs(made from 2- to 3-day-old bread, ideally)Salt and pepperOlive oil8-10-rib rack oflamb, french-trimmed (ask the butcher to do this, if need be)1tbspdijon mustardFor the potatoes and radicchio6 pink firpotatoes, or 2 large chipping potatoes, washed but unpeeled½ head radicchio1tsp thyme leaves, choppedFor the green sauce1 garlic clove,peeled4 good-quality salted anchovies1large handful parsley leaves, chopped1 small handful mint leaves, chopped1 small handful dill leaves, chopped1tsp dijon mustardZest of1 lemon200ml olive oilHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. In a bowl, mix the parsley, rosemary, oregano, breadcrumbs, a teaspoon of salt, a good grind of pepper and a tablespoon of olive oil.Warm a grill pan, then oil it. Season the lamb, then lay it fat side down in the hot pan and grill for nine minutes, slightly moving it around every now and then so the fat gets evenly coloured.Transfer the lamb to a baking tray fat side up, then spread the mustard evenly all over the fat. Press in the herb mix, then roast for 22 minutes, until the meat has an internal temperature of 54C (use a meat thermometer). Remove and leave to rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, thinly slice the potatoes, ideally using a mandoline, then thinly slice the radicchio. Put both in a large bowl, add a glug of olive oil, the picked thyme, and some salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Tip on to a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, then roast for 25 minutes, until the potatoes are totally soft to the tip of a knife and have coloured a little on top.To make the green sauce, crush the garlic and anchovies in a mortar, then combine with the herbs, mustard, lemon zest and olive oil. Season to taste, and add more olive oil if you prefer a looser consistency.Carve the rested lamb and serve the chops on a bed of the potatoes and radicchio and spoon the green sauce on top.Max Rocha is chef-owner ofCafe Cecilia, London E8Explore more on these topicsEasterLambFoodVegetablesPotatoesMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"
