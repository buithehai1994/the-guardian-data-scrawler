But behind the scenes, he was unravelling into psychosisMichael SegalovSat 28 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareFrom the road, it’s barely visible; glimpsed, maybe, if peered at with cheeks pressed against the property’s imposing iron gates. There is otherwise little out of the ordinary in this quiet Kent corner of London’s affluent commuter belt – St Michael’s has a village hall, a country club, a farm shop. But at the end of a snaking, hedge-lined driveway is an incongruous home: a sprawling, six-bedroom neo-Georgian mansion, almost every inch, inside and out, covered in the trademark black-on-white line drawings of its owner, Mr Doodle, the 31-year-old artist Sam Cox.A car honks twice behind me. A woman in her 80s steps out. “It’s mindblowing, isn’t it?” Sam’s grandmother Sue says, eyebrows aloft. “And terribly … different.” The gates ahead buzz open. “Take it slowly,” she offers, by way of warning. “You’ll want to give your eyes a few minutes to adjust.”Corner turned, the house comes into unobstructed view: an imposing modern manor enveloped floor to roof in lines, curves and cartoon-ish characters. All exterior walls are doodled over: statues, plant pots, phone box, chimney, guttering and window sashes, too. Standing in the doodled doorway to greet me are Sam and his artist wife Alena, 35, both in full doodle dress-up. “I sometimes say it’s like graffiti spaghetti,” Sam says of his style, inviting me to step over the doodled doormat. “It’s influenced by early-era New York street art, but intertwined, overlapping and cartoonish.” Six-foot-something Sam is gentle and softly spoken – most animated when talking about his work.He’s joined by younger brother Tom – now Sam’s manager – and mum Andrea. Dad Neill and grandpa David are also on the payroll, today tasked with entertaining Sam and Alena’s two-year-old son Alfie. Having first found success in viral videos during the late 2010s, Sam’s various artistic ventures now earn significant sums: during one nine-month period in 2020, his artwork racked up $4.7m in sales – one piece fetched nearly $1m. That year, he was the world’s fifth most successful artist aged under 40 at auction.Sam purchased his St Michael’s property for £1.35m in 2019. Its evolution from rural residence to live-in illustrated installation was the realisation of an ambition held for a decade. “I must have been 15 when I first planned it,” he says. “I was set a project called Obsession by my graphics teacher. He wanted me to document my fixation with drawing. I doodled on some furniture, clothes and my childhood bedroom.”“I was fine with that,” Andrea interjects, as we step into the kitchen: doodled oven, doodled taster, doodled extractor fan. “He also asked to do the family bathroom. That was a no.”“The obvious next step was a whole house,” Sam says. “It was always a target in my head.”In December 2019, the purchase complete, Sam’s uncle Graham Wells – a builder – was tasked with stripping the house back to its bones. Every surface, inside and out, was painted white – a nearly 5,000 sq ft blank canvas. It took a little over two years, all in, for Sam to decorate the house in its entirety: spray paint on the outside, black acrylic and bingo markers indoors. The result is a truly transfixing optical overload.View image in fullscreen‘A whole house was always a target in my head’: Cox’s home.Photograph: Julian Anderson/The GuardianWe all settle on the doodled sofas. His parents’ house – where Sam was raised – is a short walk through the village. “I tried to talk him out of it at first,” Andrea says, sipping from her doodled teacup. “We looked around with the last owners who asked if Sam was going to doodle it. No, he told them. I’m not sure it would have been sold to him if they’d known. For the exterior, I came up with all sorts of alternative suggestions. Why not try projections? Then you could switch it off.” Sam was having none of it. “We’ve had no complaints from the neighbours. I know it was your dream,” she glances over at her adult child, “but it was like being in a nightmare at the time.”Sam, who is listening quietly, fidgets his fingers. To the millions of followers who watched online, the house’s transformation was a triumph. Set to jaunty music,one time-lapse victory videodocumenting his efforts has been watched someseven million times. What it fails to capture is the devastating toll of the undertaking, now explored in a feature-length documentary due to air on Channel 4. “Midway through the project,” Sam says, “I had a psychotic episode …”Andrea puts it bluntly: “At one stage, we were worried Sam was going to doodle himself to death.”The drawing started when Sam was a toddler. “He drew when he was small,” Andrea says, “but, we thought, so do all children. The older he got, the more he doodled. Comics and cartoons first, then video games became his inspiration. By his early teens, drawing was pretty much all he did.” Occasionally, she felt creeping concern .“I’d say, ‘Sam, are you sure you don’t want to go outside for a bit?’ But he was just happy, hurting nobody. Evenings, weekends, any spare time - it was constant.” Socialising seemed of little interest. At night, he could be found doodling under the duvet. “We’d be watching TV, and I’d turn to see him face-down in a page.”“It was a fun place to disappear into,” Sam explains. “I’d get stacks of A4 printer paper from the supermarket and fill up every page.” All through school, this carried on, encouraged by graphics teacher Morgan Davies, now Mr Doodle Inc’s creative director. “Morgan introduced me to graffiti, and artists like Keith Haring, Yayoi Kusama and Jean Dubuffet.” Aged 15, there was an evolution in his artwork: “What poured on to the page changed from drawings that looked like characters from the Simpsons into what it is today.”Sam kept it up while studying illustration at the University of the West of England. Friends would often find him doodling in the corners of pubs and clubs. Fuelled by energy drinks, he’d draw for 16 hours a day, sometimes more, as his obsession deepened. “Every day I’d wake up and want to draw,” Sam says. “Anything else was an inconvenience.”“Must not sleep” became a mantra, scrawled across notebooks – wasted doodle-able hours. During his student days, Sam started to experiment with the idea of an artistic alter ego – a character to accompany his work. He turned up to give a third-year presentation in a fully doodled suit, replete with doodled accessories (fedora, briefcase), announcing he was The Doodle Man from Doodle Land. Friends accepted their quirky mate; others found the vibe … unusual.The Mr Doodle moniker stuck. Sam began to inhabit this kooky persona with increasing regularity. “I was already handing out Mr Doodle business cards on the street, leaving them on train seats, and throwing them out of my university flat window to try to generate attention. Dressing up and becoming this character felt a natural extension to getting myself out there: a backstory and narrative formed.”I thought I’d live here as Mr Doodle. Never seen out of clothes and character. The boundaries between me and him blurredIn early YouTube videos, Sam would traverse the streets of Bristol in doodled clothes looking to use his drawings as currency: “I’d try to trade them for stationery, bus rides, a portion of fish and chips. Mr Doodle gave me confidence.”“It offered him a mask, we thought at the time: a way of being extroverted that didn’t always come naturally,” Andrea says. She wasn’t thrilled by his antics; certainly, she resented being asked to film him bouncing around their garden in a doodle bunny costume. “Only, how could I tell him to stop, when it made him happy?”After graduating in 2015, Sam set up a studio in his parents’ garage. Commissions started small: office walls, street murals. Then, in 2017, while drawing in an east London pop-up shop, a passerby filmed him at work. That recording ended up going viral on Facebook, and his online influence started to snowball: hundreds of thousands of followers flocked to his accounts. Lucrative brand collaborations followed: Samsung, Disney, Red Bull, Fendi. At auction, his canvases started fetching tens of thousands.An admirer of Sam’s work, Ukrainian-born Alena – then living in Kyiv – got in touch, and the pair started talking. There were visits to their respective countries, and the relationship got serious.View image in fullscreenCox with his mother Andrea and wife Alena in the doodled house.Photograph: Julian Anderson/The GuardianAt the time, Sam oversaw every aspect of his booming business – in part down to his determination to pour every penny into savings, eyes firmly on the doodle-house prize. Sam was stretched beyond his limits: less sleep, more drawing, travelling to Bangkok, Tokyo, Seoul for commissions. He also spent extended periods inhabiting his alter ego, his longest drawing marathon lasting 36-plus hours. That’s when he got the keys to this house. “I thought I would live here as Mr Doodle,” he says, “never seen out of the clothes and character. The boundaries between me and him would blur.”Work started in February 2020. Those first few weeks Sam felt unwell. “It was physical, initially,” he explains. “Like I had the flu: cloudy head; I was slow to respond in conversation and couldn’t keep up with TV.” A cold, Sam thought. Severe stress, maybe. “I had weird daydreams, hallucinations, panic attacks …”Once, when Alena was visiting, the pair got an early night. “As Alena was winding down,” Sam says, “I turned to her and said: ‘I’m really worried if I go to sleep I’ll never wake up.’” She tried to calm and console him.“I’d never seen Sam cry before,” she says, “but I woke up in the night and he was still awake, sitting up, in floods of tears, distraught. Then it escalated quickly.”Sam was driven to A&E, “convinced he had dementia”, Andrea explains. “He insisted on saying goodbye to us all, certain he wouldn’t survive until morning.” A series of emergency brain scans found nothing. A woman in the waiting room kept catching Andrea’s eye. “This lady was marching around erratically, shouting about the Bible.” It wound up an anxious Andrea. “For God’s sake, I thought, will you just sit down? I was entirely unaware that the next day, that would be my son.” A psychiatrist assessed Sam. His suggestion: take him home and keep an eye on him.Back at his parents’ house, Sam wouldn’t settle. “There was a look in his eyes,” Alena says. “It wasn’t the Sam I knew in there.”Sam nods: “The only way I can describe it is that I didn’t know who or where I was.”His parents reverted to basic instincts. He climbed into their bed and they held him tight, stroked his hair, and encouraged slow, deep breaths. They told him he was loved. “But he wasn’t having any of it.” Andrea shakes her head. “He jumped up and started shouting out the windows and yelling down the stairs. All sorts of nonsense was coming out of his mouth. There was no reasoning with him. So Neill took him back to hospital.”This time, the psychiatrist was clear: Sam needed to be sectioned. “They were trying to sedate him,” Andrea continues, “but Sam was so manic that the drugs didn’t have an effect. He was convinced his brain was inside the heart monitor, that people were trying to kill him, and that he was no longer Sam. He was running through the corridors shouting: ‘I’m Mr Doodle, and I need help.’ It was as if someone else was inside him, and had taken over his body. Like he was possessed.” He was diagnosed as havinga psychotic episode and psychosis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He knows he was taken to an ambulance. “I was convinced the paramedic was my friend Steve, and kept trying to escape, running around the hospital car park. It was like I’d entered this alternative, Matrix world that I’d invented in my head.”Eventually, he was corralled into a psychiatric ward in Canterbury, where his psychosis worsened. The next six weeks were a blur: two weeks at one secure unit, then a month at another. “I wasn’t able to understand who or what was in front of me.” He became conspiratorial, believing meals and medication were laced with poison. He was consumed by religious and spiritual delusion. “I believed I was connected to God. That if I breathed deeply, I could control things. If I tapped my right foot, I’d send someone to heaven, or my left foot could send someone to hell. I thought screaming certain words gave me specific powers.” He looks to the family now sitting around him. “And I know I said the worst things to all of them.”Sam believed he had become the character he’d constructed. On one visit, he turned to Alena and announced, “Sam is dead, call me Mr Doodle now.”View image in fullscreenA prototype for a Mr Doodle doll.Photograph: Julian Anderson/The GuardianArt was intertwined with his psychosis; at times, it was the only connection the family found to the Sam they knew. “I wanted to draw on the hospital walls,” says Sam, which wasn’t exactly encouraged. “They’d put me in a confined room, and I’d draw on the walls in soup and bread. People coming and going seemed, to me, to be artists I’d been inspired by.” His senses were heightened. “Colours were so intense; if I heard music, it would feel like my whole body was vibrating.” On the psychiatric ward, Sam’s doodling remained relentless. He still has the sketchbooks. “If I drew something square or angular, it was an evil character. Circular, bouncy shapes were happy and angelic. There are lots of notes about God and religion scattered through.It was like I was living in Doodle Land, and I didn’t know how to get back again.”When doctors discharged Sam in April 2020, he was still unwell. At home, he’d sit, having imagined conversations with Donald Trump and Kanye West. One time, midway through a chat with his mother, Sam declared: “You’re not my mum, you’re Nigel Farage.” It didn’t help that the pandemic was in its early stages. “I was already distrusting of things – then there was talk of this disease. I was convinced it was a plot.”“We could be anywhere,” Andrea expands, “and something would switch: he’d see something not there, or believe something entirely irrational. We’d be quietly watching TV, and Sam would turn around and ask: ‘Why are they talking about me?’ It could take hours to talk him down. We couldn’t even watch David Attenborough – Sam thought the rocks were giving him dirty looks.”Occasionally, flickers of the old Sam returned – initially, in conversation with his grandparents. Over months, these became more regular. He only came off the last of the medication in early 2024.View image in fullscreenCox at work …View image in fullscreenand some of his more colourful doodles. Photographs: Julian Anderson/The GuardianPsychotic episodes can be triggered by substance abuse, sleep deprivation, stress or specific physical conditions. “I didn’t feel stressed at the time,” Sam says. The family doesn’t seem convinced. “But there was definitely too much in my head.” Episodes such as this have no clear end point, and doctors couldn’t guarantee it wouldn’t strike again. Sam was unperturbed and, within weeks, wanted to return to project Doodle House. “I thought you should never draw, never be Mr Doodle again,” Tom says. “That this place would have to be abandoned.”“I tried to talk him out of it,” Andrea says. “But he was determined. So we just encouraged him to take it slow, not all day and all night: stop, walk, break, breathe. Alena was here, keeping Sam under control, making sure he took breaks and his tablets.”The pandemic helped, slowing Sam’s other projects. His parents took over the business admin. “Plus, I was sleeping a lot more because of the medication,” he says. “There was no 24 hours of nonstop drawing, as before.” Joey the cockapoo’s arrival was a boon. “I’d stop drawing to take him out for walks.” Soon, Alena was pregnant – another responsibility.The documentary, the family hope, marks an end to this chapter. “Speaking about it has made the whole thing feel more normal for all of us,” Andrea explains. “Before this, I’d never been inside a psychiatric hospital.” The topic feels taboo, perhaps, even in an era of mental health awareness. “When Sam first got ill, I wasn’t telling people – not embarrassed, but I didn’t understand, or know how to explain. Now we just talk about it as if he had appendicitis.”Sam and Alena take me on a tour, past doodled walls, floors and ceilings; lamps, log burner and chandelier; dressing gown and laptop; toilet and bathtub. There’s a doodle garage, complete with doodled Tesla. Dream-themed doodles decorate the bedroom; each of the 2,000 tiles in its en suite bathroom are adorned with appropriately aquatic doodle designs. We step outside, passing the doodle water butt and American yellow school bus, through the evolving sculpture park.In the back corner of the four-acre estate is an imposing, newly constructed modern studio, designed by architect Guy Hollaway. Its exterior is wrapped in metal panels, each with intricate laser-cut doodle shapes. Inside, white double-height walls provide Sam with a blank backdrop to work on. In one corner, floor-to-ceiling racks display his recent works. The smallest among them sells for roughly $80,000. Another corner displays a grid of square drawings, each with crisscross coloured lines. It’s a new style he’s experimenting with, inspired by the NHS-issue felt-tip pens he relied on while hospitalised.View image in fullscreen‘When we first started,’ Alena says, ‘I couldn’t imagine living there …View image in fullscreenNow it’s home.’View image in fullscreenPhotographs: Julian Anderson/The GuardianThe studio is a flurry of activity: Tom is taking a phone call, Alena moves materials around. Photographs are being taken. In the corner, at a table, Sam sits, thick, black pen in hand, entirely at ease. Smooth, freeform lines fill up the white page. Swoop, circle, dot dot dot. Up to the corner, looping down. Squiggle, glide, squiggle.Alena perches next to me. “The first time we met,” she tells me, “Sam told me this was his dream: to buy the big house, and to doodle it. I knew what I was signing up for.” I’m not convinced that grandma Sue was right, I say: my eyes haven’t yet adjusted. “When we first started,” Alena replies, “I couldn’t imagine living there. It was so sterile. But I started to make it homely, with little softening details. Now it’s home. It’s not too much for me, honestly, any of this. Without doodles, Sam and I would never have met. I find them comforting.”“When I start drawing,” Sam says, “I don’t think before shapes and characters just merge into something. I enjoy the physical feeling of moving the pen along the paper – it’s like that sensation of spreading soft butter on toast. It just feels satisfying. The noise that it makes. I feel content in myself when I do it, emotionally. It’s when I’m happiest. Seeing the work made in front of me is a high – it’s that feeling I’m chasing each time I draw. This itch that’s satisfied by seeing work appearing in front of me.” He still feels that intense pull to draw: “I don’t get lost in it now, but left to my own devices, I could do this for ever”The Trouble with Mr Doodleairs on Channel 4 on9 July at 10pm.Explore more on these topicsArtMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The inside story of Palestine Action – and the plan to ban itIt started as a group of activists on a budget – now it could be banned under terrorism laws. But were lobbyists behind the proposed ban?Haroon SiddiqueLegal affairs correspondentSat 28 Jun 2025 01.01 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 10.11 EDTShareIf this interview had taken place in a week’s time, Huda Ammori might have been arrested. If this interview had been published in a week’s time, the Guardian might also have been breaking the law.Ammori, a co-founder of Palestine Action, said she was finding it “very hard to absorb the reality of what’s happening here”. She said: “I don’t have a single conviction but if this goes through I would have co-founded what will be a terrorist organisation.”By “this” she means the UK government’s hugely controversialproposal to ban Palestine Actionunder anti-terrorism laws, placing it alongside the likes of Islamic State and National Action – the first time a direct action group would be classified in this way.If the group is proscribed next week, as is expected, being a member of or inviting support for Palestine Action will carry a maximum penalty of 14 years. Wearing clothing or publishing a logo that arouses reasonable suspicion that someone supports Palestine Action will carry a sentence of up to six months.View image in fullscreenPalestine Action protest in London after the hugely controversial UK government proposal to ban the group under anti-terrorism laws.Photograph: James Veysey/ShutterstockAs far as the government is concerned – and campaign groups that have been lobbying ministers – Palestine Action deserves it. This weekYvette Cooper, the home secretary, decried its “long history of unacceptable criminal damage” and claimed: “Its methods have become more aggressive, with its members demonstrating a willingness to use violence.”Beyond the claim and counter-claim, the debate over the decision to ban Palestine Action is as much about free speech and the use of counter-terrorism laws to stop protests.If Ammori is concerned for herself, she does not show it. In an exclusive interview, she said: “Obviously people in Palestine Action understand the severity of what’s happening and there’s a sense of frustration, but there’s also a lot of unity in terms of wanting to fight this and not crumble to pressure.“I think they’re completely shooting themselves in the foot if they do this – they are completely delegitimising their own laws, which I think are already quite illegitimate, but in the sense that there have been thousands of people who’ve come out on the streets, so many people on social media, people in the media etc who’ve come out in support. I can’t think of any precedent for that, where a group is facing proscription and there’s an outpouring of support from the general public. I think that says enough about whether or not we should be labelled terrorists.”Cooper announced the proscription plan on Monday, three days after Palestine Actionbroke into RAF Brize Nortonin Oxfordshire and sprayed paint into the jet engines of two military aircraft that it claimed were helping to refuel US and Israeli fighter jets. It was a deeply embarrassing security breach at a time when the government is trying to bolster its defence credentials.0:40Footage shows Palestine Action breaking into Brize Norton airbase – videoIt was a far cry from when Palestine Action started out in 2020. Ammori said they had so little funds that they would go to actions carrying supplies in plastic carrier bags and make stencils out of cardboard.The 31-year-old said her activism was piqued by volunteering with refugees in Greece while she was at university. Many of them were from Palestine and Iraq, where her father and mother respectively are originally from, and she realised “you have to tackle the root cause of these issues”.She later worked for the Palestine Solidarity Campaign on boycott and divestment campaigns and lobbying MPs, but she left after two years after feeling as if “you’re constantly banging your head against a brick wall, you’re constantly trying to reason with people, with the facts, and what you get back is nothing and the complicity continues”.Ammori then joined up with others who had carried out direct actions (as she had done in 2017) against the Israeli arms manufacturer subsidiary Elbit Systems UK, to form Palestine Action “with the aim of ending British complicity with the colonisation of Palestine”.View image in fullscreenHuda Ammori, co-founder of Palestine Action.Photograph: Abdullah BaileyShe estimates the group has carried out hundreds of actions, occupying buildings, spraying red paint and destroying equipment, taking video footage to share on social media, going from “strength to strength”.As its activities have increased since Israel began its assault on Gaza after the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas, so has pressure on the government to clamp down on the group, even though its activists are already routinely arrested and charged under existing laws for offences such as criminal damage, violent disorder and burglary.Cooper said they had caused millions of pounds of damage during a “nationwide campaign of direct criminal action against businesses and institutions, including key national infrastructure and defence firms”.Ammori believes part of the reason for proscription is that Palestine Action activists have regularly been acquitted, and where convicted jail time has been rare, although she estimates that dozens have spent time in prison while awaiting trial.“They’ve tried to do a few different things to try and deter us, from making it harder to rely on legal defences or increasing use of remand, or they raid you a lot more and then put more severe charges on you,” she said. “It hasn’t [deterred us] so now they’re hugely overreaching because they don’t like us or agree with our cause.”She cites activists previouslycleared by courtsfor actions against UK military bases trying to stop war crimes in Iraq, East Timor and Yemen, “but as soon as it’s done for Palestine that’s it, you’re branded as a terrorist. It’s terrifying for everyone that Britain thinks it’s appropriate to call to label this a terrorist organisation. The counter-terrorism laws in Britain are so extreme – it’s one of the only countries, the only country, where it’s actually an offence to recklessly show support for a proscribed organisation. So it’s a complete assault on free speech.”She also points out that none of the overseas chapters of Palestine Action – unaffiliated to but inspired by the UK group – have been banned as terrorists.View image in fullscreenPalestine Action activists are already routinely arrested and charged under existing laws for offences such as criminal damage, violent disorder and burglary.Photograph: Martin Pope/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockAmmori believes the Conservatives would not have resorted to proscription, as they had ample opportunity to do so while in government, and it is only under Labour that activists have been arrested – but not charged so far – under the Terrorism Act, which allows for them to be held without a charging decision for 14 days.“[Ministers] have gone off the back of what pro-Israel lobby groups have said about us, from probably Elbit Systems and the Israeli government over the years as well, rather than do any factchecking,” she said. “It’s just completely rushed and done for political agenda, and without any consultation with us.”Freedom of information requests have shown that the UK government has separatelymet Elbit and Israeli embassy officials, although documents have been heavily redacted so that details are scarce. A 2022 briefing note for the then home secretary, Priti Patel, before a meeting with Elbit had a section titled “Past lobbying” but all details had been redacted. When asked previously about the document, Elbit did not comment. It did not respond to a request to comment on the matters raised in this article.Elements of Cooper’s ministerial statement mirrored claims made by We Believe in Israel in a reportpublished this monthcalling for Palestine Action to be banned – namely references to activists targeting infrastructure supporting Ukraine, Nato and Jewish-owned businesses and universities.Ammori insisted Palestine Action targeted “all companies who work with Elbit Systems, regardless of the owners identity.”The We Believe in Israel report also said the group had been investigated in 2022 for links to Hamas-aligned networks abroad, citing a “classified Metropolitan police briefing”, although no charges resulted. It did not say how or why it had seen the briefing, but it reinforced Ammori’s fears about UK government and law enforcement being swayed by external forces.A week ago, We Believe in Israeltweeted: “Behind Palestine Action’s theatre of resistance stands a darker puppeteer: the [Iranian] Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.” The only evidence it provided was that the IRGC’s vocabulary “echoes in Palestine Action’s slogans”.Two days later,the Times was briefedby anonymous Home Office officials that they were investigating whether Palestine Action was funded by Iran, although Cooper did not mention this in her statement.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

As proof, she pointed to a fundraiser for legal fees for the fight against proscription, which by Friday morning had raised more than £150,000, with an average donation of about £35.She said Palestine Action had shown people “that you really have a lot of power and that you don’t have to accept the fact that when our own government’s breaking the law, when these factories are operating building weapons to kill people in Palestine, or weapons that they market as battle-tested on Palestinians and they are openly committing war crimes, that you actually have the power to stop that.“I think that’s something that’s captured a lot of people’s attention and hearts, and that’s why we’ve gained so much support. People in these areas resonate more with the people on the roof than they do with the company building weapons to massacre people.”The Home Office was approached for comment."

Twelve months and some provocative onstage comments about Palestine and Conservative MPs later, they’re both folk devil and cause celebre, whose appearance at the festival is the most hotly debated of 2025 – both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition have had strong opinions about it.Kneecap lead anti-Keir Starmer chant during politically charged Glastonbury setRead moreIt’s a perfect example of how quickly stories can become overheated in the 21st century: vastly more people now have a opinion about Kneecap than have ever heard their music, which is, traditionally, a tricky and destructive position for a band to find themselves in. Invoking a name one probably shouldn’t invokeunder the circumstances, you might want to ask the surviving members of the Sex Pistols how that worked out for them.Still, the West Holts area is so packed, it has to be closed down to prevent a crush. The stage is barely visible for flags, most, but not all of them, Palestinian (there’s still room for WE LIKE TO MOVE IT MOVE IT, SMITHY’S ON A BENDER and indeed I EAT ASS – THAT’S AMORE). Kneecap themselves seem happy to lean into the controversy: their appearance is preceded by a montage of voices condemning the band – Sharon Osbourne figures heavily – and much booing from the audience. Their ongoing travails are regularly referenced – “everyone in that fucking tent agreed with me”, protests Mo Chara (real name Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) about the Coachella appearance that intensified the whole business. Bandmate Móglaí Bap (Naoise Ó Cairealláin) suggests that the audience should attend Ó hAnnaidh’s forthcoming court hearing – he’s been charged with what Bap calls a “trumped up” terrorism-related offence for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a London gig, for which Mo Chara has been unconditionally bailed – and “start a riot outside the courts … the Daily Mail will love that! Fuck the Daily Mail! Fuck Keir Starmer!” The latter is among a longer list of enemies that also includes Rod Stewart, who’s made the impressively ballsy choice to preface his Glastonbury appearance with an expression of support for Nigel Farage.View image in fullscreenTriumphant … Kneecap at West Holts.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIt’s probably too late to say that it would be a shame if said controversy completely drowned out Kneecap’s actual music, but the point stands. Behind the furore, the trio are really good at what they do. Mo Chara and Móglaí Bap are impressive rappers – raw-throated but dextrous, far funnier than you might expect if the only stuff you heard about Kneecap revolved around recent events. And live, their sound comes into its own, a fizzing stew with a bassy intensity that has a hint of the Prodigy about it: Fine Art’s sudden lurches from dubstep to four-to-the-floor pounding; Get Your Brits Out’s warped take on classic Chicago house.As the crowd break into circle pits and moshing, with a degree of encouragement from the band, it feels genuinely exciting, a feral moment in a festival that’s thus far tended towards sunkissed good vibes. What happens next – whether Kneecap’s ongoing notoriety turns out to be a brief flashpoint, something more lasting, or indeed ultimately the undoing of them – remains to be seen. For now, for this audience, they are triumphant.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025KneecapRapGlastonbury festivalFestivalsMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

This is never more true than in the countryside, where the impacts of an extreme concentration of ownership and control are blamed on those who have nothing to do with it. Rural people are endlessly instructed that they’re oppressed not by the lords of the land, but by vicious and ignorant townies – the “urban jackboot” as the Countryside Alliance used to call it –stamping on their traditions.Near Bridport in Dorset right now, an entire village is facing eviction, following thesale of the Bridehead Estatefor about £30m. The official new owner,Bridehead Estate Ltd, is registered to the same address, with the same officers, as a company calledBelport. TheTelegraph reportsthat the estate “was bought by Belport, a private equity firm, on behalf of a wealthy client last autumn”, but no one knows who the client is. So far I’ve received no response to the questions I sent to Belport.The people of Littlebredy, a village of 32 homes,wholly owned by the estate, say they have been ordered to leave from January. At the beginning of this month, access to parts of the 800-hectare (2,000-acre) grounds, widely enjoyed by local people,was terminated, withred signsto this effect and padlocks on all the entrances. No one knows who is doing this to them. The sense of powerlessness is overwhelming.One person has been evicted already, to make way for an estate office. When she complained about her treatment on social media,the first replystated, without a shred of evidence: “You’re being evicted so that young fighting age male refugees, who are escaping war in France, can have somewhere safe to live, who, as far as our government is concerned, have priority over you … VOTE REFORM!” That’s how divide and rule works: never mind the anonymous plutocrat evicting her, the true culprits, somehow, are asylum seekers.We are lectured by rightwing parties and the rightwing media about the need for “integration”. But that word is used only as a weapon against immigrants. It is not they who rip communities apart, tear people from their homes and shut us out of the land, causing social disintegration. It is the power of money.But look, a spider! The cosmopolitan city, swarming with immigrants and trans people, is coming to get you! It willterminate the traditionscountry people love andimpose its own cultureinstead. It is drummed into our heads that what rural people want is different to what the oppressive urbanites desire. But it’s not true.Embarrassingly for the self-professed guardians of the countryside, some of the evidence comes from their own surveys. Future Countryside – which tells us it is “powered by the Countryside Alliance Foundation”, the charitable arm of the Countryside Alliance – commissioned polling in 2023. Its question about a wider right to roam in the countryside was phrased in a way that made it sound threatening: “To what extent do you agree that the public should have the ‘right to roam’ meaning that anyone can wander in the open countryside regardless of whether the land is privately or publicly owned?” Even so, there was almost no difference between the responses of urban and rural people: 55% of urban people and 54% of rural people agreed it was a good idea. Even more strikingly, when asked which political party “would do the most to prioritise/protect/promote the countryside?”, only 9% each of urban and rural people named the Conservatives, while 38% in both categories said the Green party.Perhaps unsurprisingly, these answers failed to find their way into Future Countryside’s public presentation of the results. Instead, the only mention of a right to roam was a comment from an anonymous rural respondent: “They weren’t brought up in the countryside. They think they can wander across all the fields with the right to roam.” Links to both the rawpolling data and the public presentationon the organisation’s website currently show a “404 error” when you try to open them.View image in fullscreenA thatched house in the village of Littlebredy on the Bridehead Estate, Dorset.Photograph: Graham Hunt/AlamyStrangely, writing a year after these results were published, the chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, Tim Bonner, claimed that a wider right to roam is “completely contradictoryto what the public actually wants”. With admirable chutzpah, he accused those calling for it of waging a “culture war in the countryside”.WhenYouGovframed the question more objectively, for a poll commissioned by the Right to Roam campaign, it found that 68% of urban people and 68% of rural people supported it. Italso discovered, in stark contrast to the claims of certain rural “guardians” who call it “the social gluethat keeps rural communities together”, that opposition to hunting with dogs is strong everywhere: 78% of urban people and 74% of rural people are against it. As the access campaignerJon Moses points outin an article for the Lead, “the issues over which we’re told we’re most divided are often the issues on which we actually most agree”.That view is supported by somefascinating researchpublished in the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties. It found that while in several other western countries there is a stark political divide between urban and rural people, this does not apply in Britain. “We do not find any evidence that rural Britons are more resentful, dissatisfied or ‘left behind’ compared to their urban counterparts.” On cultural issues, it found, “ruralites are often less – not more – authoritarian than urbanites … and are less likely to support an undemocratic leader”.We are fundamentally the same people, despite the best efforts of the culture warriors to divide us. But we must be persuaded that other people don’t want what we want: that we are the outsiders, the interlopers, the weird minority, pushing against the social current.In reality, the weird minority are the 1% who ownhalf of all the landin England, and the subset of that groupwho hide their ownershipbehind front companies and opaque trusts. If the government’sproposed changesto the Land Registry go ahead, it may become easier to discover the true owners of places such as Bridehead, though I suspect we will still struggle.On 5 July, the Right to Roam campaign will organise apeaceful trespassat Bridehead, to draw attention to the almost feudal powers blighting rural life. The real conflict is not town v country, but money and power v people. That holds, regardless of where you live.

Is it yet another way in which Trump’s worldview is reshaping the culture?Jess Cartner-MorleySat 28 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 01.52 EDTShareIt was, almost, a proud feminist moment. On inauguration day in January, the unthinkable happened. President Trump, the biggest ego on the planet, was upstaged by a woman in a white trouser suit – the proud uniform of Washington feminists, worn by Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton andAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezin solidarity with the traditional colour of the suffragettes. In the event, the white trouser suit barely got a mention. The show was stolen by what was underneath: Lauren Sánchez’s cleavage, cantilevered under a wisp of white lace. The breasts of the soon-to-be Mrs Jeff Bezos were the ceremony’s breakout stars. The only talking point that came close was Mark Zuckerberg’s inability to keep his eyes off them.Call it a curtain raiser for a year in which breasts have been – how to put this? – in your face. Sydney Sweeney’s pair have upstaged her acting career to the point that she wears a sweatshirt that says “Sorry for Having Great Tits and Correct Opinions”. Bullet bras are making a sudden comeback, in sugar-pink silk onDua Lipa on the cover of British Vogueand nosing keen as shark fins under fine cashmere sweaters at the Miu Miu show at Paris fashion week. Perhaps most tellingly, Kim Kardashian, whose body is her business empire, has made a 180-degree pivot from monetising her famous backside to selling, in her Skims lingerie brand, push-up bras featuring a pert latex nipple – with or without a fake piercing – that make an unmissable point under your T-shirt. Not since Eva Herzigova was in her Wonderbra in 1994 – Hello Boys – have boobs been so, well, big.View image in fullscreenLauren Sánchez flanked by Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos at Trump’s inauguration …Photograph: Kenny Holston/ReutersView image in fullscreenSydney Sweeney on Saturday Night Live in 2024 …Photograph: NBC/Will Heath/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreen… and Kim Kardashian modelling a bra from her lingerie line.Photograph: SkimsIt is oddly tricky to discuss boobs without sounding as if you are in a doctor’s surgery or a fraternity house. The word breasts is rather formal. Boobs is fond and familiar, which feels right, but sniggery, which doesn’t. Bosoms are what you see in period dramas. Knockers, jugs, melons, hooters, fun bags? Whatever we call them, they are full of contradictions. Men see them and think of sex; babies see them and think of food. They contain a liquid without which the human race could not until recently have survived, but they are also one of the most tumour-prone parts of the body. You can admire them in the Uffizi, the Louvre and the National Gallery, but they are banned on Instagram (Free the nipple!). They are nursing Madonnas, and they areMadonnain a conical bra. They are topless goddesses and top shelf; entirely natural yet extremely rude; and they are, right now, absolutely everywhere.There is a whole lot going on here. In America, the impact of the Trump administration is going way beyond policy, reshaping culture at a granular level. The Maga ruling class has a thirst for busty women in tight clothes, which fuses something new – what Zuckerberg has called “masculine energy” – with nostalgia for 1950s America. (The “again” in Make America Great Again may not have a date stamp, but it comes with a white picket fence.) As a symbol of fertility, full breasts are catnip to a regime obsessed with breeding and keen to limit reproductive freedoms.Boobs are in the eye of the storm of the current gender fluidity rollback, too. Nothing says boys will be boys and women should look like women more than Bezos’s Popeye biceps next to Sánchez’s lace-edged curves. They used to say that a picture was worth a thousand words; in today’s ultra-visual culture, that rate of exchange has steepened. The fact that a culture that was, until a few years ago, sensitively exploring gender as a complex issue has now regressed to the level of teenage boys watching American Pie for the first time says everything about how things have changed.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Dan Matthews/The Guardian. Styling: Jack SargesonSince 1962, when Timmie Jean Lindsey, a mother of six from Texas, became the first woman in the world to have silicone implants, breasts have been a lightning rod for the battleground between what is real and what is fake. The debate that catapulted Pamela Anderson to fame in the 1990s has become one of the defining issues of our time. It turns out that breasts, and beauty, were just the start. Artificial intelligence has jumped the conversation on. From Mountainhead to Black Mirror, we are now talking not just about real boobs v fake ones but about real brains v fake ones. In the battle between old-school flesh and blood and the prospect of a new, possibly improved, version of the human race, breasts have been leading the culture for 63 years.In a nutshell, the world is losing its mind over the girls. “The State of the Union is … boobs” was theNew York Post’s succinct verdicton the charms of Sweeney, whileAmy Hamm wrote in the National Postthat they were “double-D harbingers of the death of woke”. On inauguration day, onlookers were divided between outrage at an inappropriate level of nudity and admiration for howSánchez’s “Latina auntie”energy showed her, um, balls.All of which makes it a weird time to have breasts. When writer Emma Forrest saw the author portrait taken for the jacket of her new novel, Father Figure, her first thought was, “Oh wow, my boobs lookhuge.” She is wearing a plain black T-shirt, “so that must be OK, right? It’s not like I’m wearing a corset. I feel I should be allowed to have people review my books without having an issue with my boobs. But who knows.”Breasts have always had the power to undermine women. After a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, Sarah Thornton found herself with much bigger breasts than she had wanted – having asked for “lesbian yoga boobs”, she woke up with D cups – and wrote her book, Tits Up, to make peace with her “silicone impostors” by investigating their cultural history. Breasts, she writes, are “visible obstacles to equality, associated with nature and nurture rather than reason and power”. Since she was a teenager, Forrest has lived with “the assumption that having big breasts means being messy, being sexually wild, having no emotional volume control. I have had to learn to separate my own identity from what other people read on to my body.” It’s Messy: On Boys, Boobs and BadassWomenis the title of Amanda de Cadenet’s memoir, in which she writes about developing into “the teenage girl whose body made grown women uncomfortable and men salivate”, recalling the destabilising experience of having a body that brought her overnight success – she was a presenter on The Word at 18 – while simultaneously somehow making her the butt of every joke.View image in fullscreenFlat-chested flappers in the 1920s …Photograph: AlamyView image in fullscreenJayne Mansfield in 1957 …Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveView image in fullscreenMadonna in Jean Paul Gaultier conical corset in 1990 …Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenand a bullet bra on the Miu Miu catwalk in March 2025.Photograph: Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesIf the length of our skirts speaks to the stock market – short hemlines in boom times, long when things are bad – breasts are political. Thirty years after the French Revolution, Eugène Delacroix painted Liberty Leading the People with a lifesize, bare-breasted Liberty hoisting the French flag, leading her people to freedom. A century and a half later, women burning their bras at the 1968 protest against the Miss America pageant became one of the defining images of the feminist movement – never mindthe fact that it never happened. (Protesters threw copies of Playboy, and some bras, in a trash can, but starting a fire on a sidewalk was illegal.) Intriguingly, decades when big breasts are in fashion seem to coincide with times of regression for women. Think about it. The 1920s: flat-chested flapper dresses and emancipation. The 1950s: Jayne Mansfield and women being pushed away from the workplace and back into the home. The 1970s: lean torsos under T-shirts, and the women’s liberation movement.Sarah Shotton started out as an assistant in Agent Provocateur’s raunchy flagship store in Soho, London, in 1999, when she was 24, and rose to become creative director of the lingerie brand in 2010. Her 15 years in charge have seen Agent Provocateur rocked by the changing tides of sexual politics. In 2017, the year#MeToohit the headlines, the company went into administration, before finding a new distributor. Shotton says, “I have always loved sexy bras, and it’s what we are known for. But there was a time when it felt like that wasn’t OK. Soon after #MeToo, we had a campaign lined up to shoot and the phone started ringing with all the agents of the women who were supposed to be in it, pulling their clients out, saying they didn’t want to be seen in that way.”But the brand’s revenues have doubled in the past three years. “Last year we shot a film with Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch, where she’s in really sexy lingerie and he’s playing pool. I remember saying, ‘This is either going to go down like a ton of bricks or people are going to love it.’” It seems as if they loved it: the company’s sales are expected to hit £50m this year. “I think a younger generation now want what we had in the 1990s and 2000s,” Shotton says, “because it looks like we had more fun. My generation of women had childhood on our BMX bikes, then when we were in our 20s, your job finished when you left the office and you could go out drinking all night if you wanted to. I think we really did have more fun. Life just didn’t feel as complicated as it does now.” The bestselling bras, she says, are currently “anything plunging and push-up. Racy stuff.

Before that, the lines were pretty simple – the flappers throwing off their corsets, the feminists protesting over Page 3. But Liz Goldwyn, film-maker and sociologist (and granddaughter of Samuel Goldwyn Jr), whose first job was in a Planned Parenthood clinic and who collects vintage lingerie, doesn’t fit neatly into any of the old categories. “Third-wave feminists like myself grew up in theriot grrrland burlesque days, where we embraced corsets and kink along with liberation and protest,” she says. Goldwyn collects, loves and wears vintage lingerie, while abhorring Spanx. “I would rather go to the dentist than wear shapewear, but I find nothing more satisfying than to colour-coordinate my lingerie drawers.” Wearing a corset, she says, “makes me breathe with more presence”.Breasts have always been about money and class as well as sex and gender. The Tudor gentlewomen who wore dresses cut to expose their small, pert breasts were proudly indicating they had the means to afford a wet nurse. Sánchez’s inauguration outfit – tiny white Alexander McQueen trouser suit, lots of gravity-defying cleavage – “taps into the fact that people who are that wealthy can have the impossible,” Forrest says. “It is pretty difficult to have a super-slim body and big breasts. Her body is a physical manifestation of something much bigger, which is the hyper-wealthy living in a different reality to the rest of us. The planet might be doomed, but they can go to space. It’s a ‘fuck you’ marker of luxury and arrogance.” The vibe, Goldwyn agrees, “is very dystopian 1980s Dynasty meets ‘let them eat cake’. I would never disparage another woman’s body, but I have no problem disparaging her principles … in claiming to stand for women’s empowerment, yet attending an inauguration for an administration that has rolled back reproductive freedoms.”Surgery – the blunt fact of boobs being a thing you can buy – has crystallised the idea of breasts as femininity’s biggest commercial hit. (They are at times referred to, after all, as prize assets.) The primitive – survival of the fittest, in the thirsty sense of the word – is now turbocharged by capitalism.Breast enlargement is the most popular cosmetic surgery in the UK, with5,202 procedures carried out in 2024, according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.When Jacqueline Sanchez Taylor interviewed women in 2010 about their experiences of breast augmentation for her research into the sociology of cosmetic surgery, “a lot of young women told me they were doing it for status”. Not to show off, but to show “they had made it. They felt they were being good citizens: going out there and making money, but also wanting to play the part of being feminine.” Breasts, Sanchez Taylor says, “say everything about who a woman is: about femininity and fertility, class and age.” They are at the centre of the industrial complex that has grown up around female beauty. “I remember sitting in a consultation with a woman and her surgeon, and him saying cheerfully, ‘Oh yes, you’ve got fried egg breasts. But we can fix that.’”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotographs: Dan Matthews/The Guardian. Styling: Jack SargesonFake is no longer scandalous or transgressive. The vocabulary of plastic surgery has been gentled and mainstreamed to become the more palatablecosmeticsurgery. The older women of the Kardashian family have been coy about having hadwork, but 27-year-old Kylie Jenner recentlyshared on social media the details of her breast surgery– down to the implant size, placement and name of surgeon. Unreal is here to stay, and the new battle line is between perfection and imperfection. The generation growing up now, who have never seen a celebrity portrait that wasn’t retouched, have never used a camera that doesn’t have filters, take 20 selfies and delete 19 of them, have an intolerance of imperfection. To put it bluntly: normal looks weird to them.So it seems natural – even if it isn’t really natural – that celebrity boobs are getting bigger even as celebrity bodies are getting smaller. “We are in a really weird place with the body, particularly in America,” says Emma McClendon, assistant professor of fashion studies at St John’s University in New York, who in 2017 curated the New York exhibition The Body: Fashion and Physique. “What we are seeing now is definitely not about the bigger body. It is a very controlled mode of curviness, which emphasises a tiny waist.” (Very 1950s coded, again.) “GLP-1 weight-loss drugs are having a cultural impact on all of us, whether or not you or people you know are on them,” McClendon says. “The incredible shrinking of the celebrity body that is happening in America is creating this idea that your body is endlessly fixable and tweakable.” Hairlines can be regrown, fat melted, wrinkles erased.For most of the past half-century, fashion has held out against boobs. With a few notable exceptions –Vivienne Westwood, rest her soul, adored a corset-hoisted embonpoint – modern designers have mostly ignored them.Karl Lagerfeldinsisted his models should glissade, ballerina style, and disliked any curves that veered from his clean, elongated lines. And yet in the past 12 months, the bullet bra has come back. A star turn on the Miu Miu catwalk was presaged last year by a cameo in the video for Charli xcx’s 360,worn by photographer and model Richie Shazam, and by influencer and singerAddison Rae, whose lilac velvet corsetcreamed into two striking Mr Whippy peaks at a Young Hollywood party last summer. To seal the revival, none other than the queen of fashion – Kate Moss – wore abullet bra under her Donna Karan dressin a viral fashion shoot with Ray Winstone for a recent issue of Perfect magazine.‘Your body, my choice’: what misogynistic Trump supporters feel about sexual power | Moira DoneganRead morePerhaps the bullet bra, which can be seen as weaponising the breast, is perfect for now. “Fashion is the body, and clothes turn the body into a language,” McClendon says. The bullet bra is steeped in a time when “domestic femininity was repackaged as glamour”, Forrest says. “A postwar era, coming back from scarcity and lack and hunger, when Sophia Loren was sold as a kind of delicious luxury truffle.”Goldwyn is a fan. “A perfectly seamed bullet bra lifts my spirits (and my breasts) if I am in a foul mood,” she says. “I hope we can reclaim it as symbolic of resistance, defiance and armour.” In the backstage scrum with reporters after she had made bullet bras the centrepiece of her Miu Miu catwalk show, Miuccia Prada said the collection was about “femininity”, then she corrected herself: “No – femininities.” Prada has been using her clothes to articulate the complexities of living and performing femininity for decades, and this season it led her to the bullet bra. “What do we need, in this difficult moment for women – to lift us up?” she laughed, gesturing upwards with her hands, surrounded by pointy-chested models. “It’s like a new fashion. I think the girls are excited.”Half a millennium after Leonardo da Vinci painted theMadonna Litta, his 1490 painting of the Virgin Mary baring her right breast to feed Christ, which now hangs in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia, another Madonna found her breasts in the spotlight. In the late 1980s,Jean Paul Gaultierwas experimenting with conical bras in his Paris shows. “He took inspiration from his grandmother’s structured undergarments,” says fashion historian Amber Butchart, “and used them to herald self-liberation. I don’t generally like the word empowering – it doesn’t tend to mean much – but that was very much the idea.” In 1989, while Madonna was preparing for her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour, she phoned Gaultier and asked him to design the wardrobe. On the opening night, in Japan, Madonna tore off her black blazer to reveal that iconic baby-pink satin corset with conical cups. “Do you believe in love? Well, I’ve got something to say about it,” she declared, before launching into Express Yourself. The silhouette, which could be seen all the way from the cheap seats, would end up scandalising the pope and costing the world’s biggest female pop stara lucrative Pepsi deal. Boobs have always been good at capturing our attention, and they have it right now.

They need to learn lessons from that.”She added: “I’m disappointed that something has been plucked from the air without engaging disabled people.”There have been several days of frantic negotiations by the government as ministers tried to quell a rebellion of 120-plusLabourMPs over next week’s welfare bill.Under the original plans, the personal independence payments (Pip) system would have its eligibility significantly tightened while out of work sickness benefits would be cut. The work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, has now promised to exempt current disability claimants from the changes, and to increase the health element of universal credit in line with inflation.On Friday, Kendall was asked whether the changes to the bill would create a two-tier system if passed. She said existing claimants would be unaffected but added “there do need to be changes in future to make sure that people who can work do so, we protect those who can’t, but that we make the welfare state sustainable for the future”.“We have listened to people, we have engaged with them, I think we are in a good place now, alongside the huge investments we are putting in to create the jobs that people need in every part of the country, to get waiting lists down in the NHS, to ensure stronger rights at work, but also to make sure there’s employment support for those who can work and protections for those who can’t,” she said.Blake is adamant the proposed changes are not enough. “There are other ways forward and concessions made on this bill can’t lead to future claimants suffering consequences that today’s claimants may be able to avoid,” she said.“We can’t kick the can down the road. We certainly can’t take away the already limited support disabled people rely on, condemning many to a life of poverty and deteriorating health.”The government has promised that the entire criteria system will be reviewed in conjunction with disabled people, but there is growing resentment among disability advocates that this was not done sooner.Blake said she agrees with their anger. “I think the government needs to listen to disabled people, starting with its own backbenchers because it’s clear our voices are still locked out,” she added.Vicky Foxcroft, who hasrheumatoid arthritis, resigned as a whip in protest over the bill. With so few MPs in the party having a disclosed disability, Blake is disappointed the leadership has sidelined their input. “It’s hugely frustrating especially when colleagues have been going on the media day after day [incorrectly] calling Pip an out of work benefit,” she said. “I’ve tried to flag that.”Blake is also one of the few MPs who has direct experience with the disability benefits system. In 2023, she applied for Pip herself, in part to understand what her constituents are facing.“I’m in daily pain. I have to plan around flare-ups, hospital visits, and treatments that wipe me out for days,” she said. “Even getting to work can mean pushing through fatigue and discomfort most people never experience. Sitting in the chamber is often excruciating.”Despite this, she was rejected for Pip, scoring just 2 points overall. She said: “I found it staggering that the only one of my conditions that scored a point was my dyslexia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I thought there was a deep irony that the accessible form I had requested [for my dyslexia] arrived after their own deadlines.”Blake recalls there were multiple factual errors in the report but didn’t feel confident enough to appeal. “It made me question myself, as if I’d done something wrong.”The experience left her with an understanding of what other disabled people who rely on benefits are going through. “This is not a system designed to support, it is a system that is toxic and makes people more ill.”This is the first time Blake, who was elected in 2019, has spoken publicly about her physical disabilities.She said that she has not done so lightly. “I worry people will think it means I can’t do my job effectively or as a weakness,” she said. “But I think it makes me a better representative because I get it.”Now, that means making a plea to her colleagues: “This isn’t about us. It’s not about the games in Westminster. This is about the lives of disabled people that have continuously been undervalued.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsLabourKeir StarmerWelfareDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Police said the seven-year-old girl died in hospital.Three other children suffered minor injuries following the incident in Southend-on-Sea.Essex police said they were called to Chalkwell park shortly before 3pm, where they found “a number of casualties”.Ch supt Leighton Hammett said: “Families are facing unimaginable hardship this evening and all of our thoughts are with them at this time.“I cannot begin to put into words how difficult today’s events have been, and continue to be, for them.“It’s also not lost on me how traumatic it must have been for the members of the public who witnessed this awful incident.”An East of England ambulance service spokesperson had earlier said: “Two children were transported by road to Southend university hospital.“A further three children were later transported by road to the same hospital with minor injuries.”Police advised the public to avoid the area.Ishan Madan, 39, from Westcliff-on-Sea, was playing in a cricket match nearby when he heard a “horrendous, screeching scream”.Madan, an accountant, said: “Everyone ran towards the clubhouse, where the tree is.“The tree had snapped and I think there were four children, the fifth one was slightly further away, I think she’d been hit by a branch.“Two of them were under a smaller branch, they were rescued easily, and unfortunately, the other two girls, they were stuck under this massive tree.“So we got bystanders to help, it must have been 40 to 50 people who then tried to lift the fallen tree up and to our horror, these two little girls, poor girls, were stuck underneath it.“Their mother was on the corner. It was horrendous.”Adam Hutchins, 47, told the EssexLive website: “I heard there were kids playing on the tree. They heard a big crack.“It must have [been] pretty loud. They went running over and there were kids underneath the tree.“All the cricket guys ran over and tried to loft the tree up. I think it’s one of the oldest trees. It had metal stands propping it up.”David Burton-Sampson, Labour MP for Southend West and Leigh, said: “The news of the sad death of one of the children involved in the incident at Chalkwell park today is truly devastating.“I am sure I reflect the thoughts of all our residents here in Southend in sending my deepest condolences to the child’s family and friends.“My thoughts are also with the other children injured and I wish them a full and speedy recovery.“At the time of the incident, the park was very busy and a number of people witnessed what happened.”Daniel Cowan, the leader of Southend’s city council, said on Saturday: “I’m aware of this very serious incident. We’re working with Essex police, the ambulance service and fire service, who are still at the scene.“I do understand that a tree has fallen, there’s a number of casualties and we’re just asking the public to avoid the area while those services carry out their work, and my thoughts are with those affected.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he boldly gambled by taking off Elliott and the captain, James McAtee, and was rewarded by the substitute Jonathan Rowe scoring with almost his first touch. It means the Young Lions have followed in the footsteps of Dave Sexton’s sides more than 40 years ago by winning successive European titles and their fourth in total. On this evidence, the future looks very bright indeed.Carsley could barely contain his emotions as he pumped his fist in delight at the final whistle while England’s players celebrated wildly, with some of their family members in the stands bursting into tears. It has been a whirlwind six months for the former Everton midfielder, who was criticised for saying during his spellas interim England managerthat he was hoping to return to the under-21s.Quick GuideEngland U21 v Germany U21: teams and scorersShowEngland (4-2-3-1)Beadle; Livramento, Quansah, Cresswell, Hinshelwood; Anderson (Egan-Riley 99), Scott (Morton 44); Elliott (Rowe 90), McAtee (Nwaneri 90), Hutchinson (Iling-Junior 98); Stansfield (Norton-Cuffy 62).Subs not usedEdwards, Fellows, Gray, Hackney, Sharman-Lowe, Simkin.GoalsElliott 5, Hutchinson 24, Rowe 92Germany (4-3-3)Atubolu; Collins, Arrey-Mbi, Oermann (Wanner 105), Brown (Ullrich 86); Nebel, Martel (Tresoldi 98), Reitz; Weiper (Röhl 80), Woltemade, Gruda (Knauff 73)Subs not usedBaum, Ernst, Jander, Noll, Rosenfelder, Siebert, Thielmann.GoalsWeiper 45+1, Nebel 61Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Yet with several players missing due to the Club World Cup and senior call-ups, Carsley has once again showed how effective he is coaching England’s next crop of promising talent after arriving in Slovakia with an inexperienced squad that was not among the favourites to triumph. With Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson excelling in midfield, it is a testament to their team spirit that heads never dropped even after conceding the equaliser.View image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott celebrates scoring an early opener for England.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersCarsley had been calmness personified before kick-off as he cracked jokes with his assistant Ashley Cole and he had the luxury of being able to name an unchanged side from the semi-final victoryagainst the Netherlands. Such was the interest in this game Tuchel had flown more than 5,000 miles from the Club World Cup in the US to be in attendance, while the Germany manager, Julian Nagelsmann, cut short his holiday in Mallorca.Both could not have failed to have been impressed with the way England started as Elliott, who was later presented with the player of the tournament award for his five goals butfaces an uncertain future with Liverpool, gave them an early lead after Nnamdi Collins made a hash of a clearance.Charlie Cresswell – who is the other remaining member of the winning squad from 2023 – was inches away from doubling the lead when McAtee fired across the face of goal. Germany were caught out again on the break soon after and, having been set up by McAtee, Hutchinson finished with aplomb and he celebrated with an acrobatic flip. The usually understated Carsley could barely contain his delight on the touchline.View image in fullscreenOmari Hutchinson delivers an acrobatic flip after scoring England’s second goal.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APWith Germany’s main threat Nick Woltemade having to drop increasingly deeper, the manager, Antonio Di Salvo, seemed to have no answer. But the loss of the limping Alex Scott, replaced by Liverpool’s Tyler Morton just before half-time, was a blow and that was compounded when Nelson Weiper pulled one back by heading home Paul Nebel’s cross in first-half injury time.McAtee was unlucky to see his effort drift just wide after a magnificent dummy left his marker for dead at the start of the second half. But Germany looked so much more threatening when they made it into the final third and the England goalkeeper James Beadle did well not to parry Nebel’s cross into the path of the waiting Woltemade, who is set to join Bayern Munich from VfB Stuttgart after this tournament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suddenly the game was on a knife edge as Norton-Cuffy could only direct his shot straight at Noah Atubolu after being set up by Hutchinson. There were hearts in mouths on the England bench when a deflected Germany effort struck the crossbar in stoppages but they made it to extra time.Carsley rolled the dice by taking off the exhausted McAtee and Elliott, and it immediately paid dividends as Rowe’s deft header from Morton’s cross restored England’s lead. “We have to dig in,” said Carsley as he gathered his players together in a huddle at the change of ends. “This is our time now.”Germany hit the bar again in injury time but Carsley and England would not be denied their place in the history books.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21sLee CarsleynewsShareReuse this content"

One of the boat’s reception areas is mud-soaked, cluttered and ruined, its upholstered sofas and chairs torn and stained.View image in fullscreenBayesian exterior.Photograph: TG/RAINEWSAnother shows an open hatchway leading down from the deck, while a side view of the hull and one of the vessel’s propellers reveals some of the mud that accumulated during its 10-month spell beneath the waves.The Bayesian was anchored near the port of Porticello when it sank during a violent storm shortly before dawn on 19 August 2024. Lynch had been enjoying a voyage around Sicily with his family and some friends celebrating his acquittal in a long-running fraud case regarding the sale of the technology company he founded, Autonomy, to Hewlett-Packard in 2011.Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, died, as did a lawyer, Chris Morvillo, and his wife, Neda; Jonathan Bloomer, a banker, and his wife, Judy; and the yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas. Nine other crew members and six guests were rescued.View image in fullscreenA hatchway leading down from the deck of the Bayesian.Photograph: TG/RAINEWSInvestigators hope the yacht will yield clues to the causes of the sinking. A forensic examination will seek to determine whether one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised.According to a preliminary safety report released last month by the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds when running on its engine. These “vulnerabilities” were “unknown to either the owner or the crew” as they were not included in the stability information book onboard.The MAIB said a possible “tornadic waterspout” headed towards the boats in the harbour. The docks seemed to divert the whirlwind, which went straight towards the Bayesian, and the vessel sank within a few seconds.Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into suspected manslaughter. The boat’s captain, James Cutfield, from New Zealand, and two British crew members,Tim Parker Eaton and Matthew Griffiths, have been placed under investigation. In Italy, this does not imply guilt or mean that formal charges will necessarily follow.The family of Thomas, a Canadian-Antiguan national, have said they were waiting to see what the MAIB experts found.View image in fullscreenDamaged equipment inside the Bayesian.Photograph: TG/RAINEWS“Lessons need to be learned from this tragedy, as well as establishing the truth of what happened and bringing those responsible to justice,” said James Healy-Pratt, a partner at Keystone Law, which is representing the Thomas family.Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mike and Hannah Lynch as well as those of Jonathan and Judy Bloomer.The complex operation to salvage the Bayesian was temporarily suspended in mid-May afterRob Cornelis Maria Huijben, a 39-year-old Dutch diver, died during underwater work.Additional reportingLorenzo TondoExplore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She had selected images which appeared to depict child abuse, and yet were easily and legally available on a popular website.“Unless you see it, you can’t quite believe how bad it is.” The minister appeared shocked and upset by the images, she recalls, so she quickly tidied them away and later shredded them.Bertin has noticed that her desire to talk frequently and openly about extreme pornography is not shared by all her Westminster colleagues. “I’ve definitely seen people swerve at lunch, not wanting to sit next to me for fear of what they’re going to hear coming from my mouth,” she told fellow delegates at the launch meeting of herpornography taskforcethis week, prompting a flutter of sympathetic laughter.Since being appointed by the former prime minister Rishi Sunak to lead an independent review into the regulation of online pornography in December 2023, Bertin has observed how a double taboo has made most politicians extremely reluctant to engage. Some simply find the subject hugely embarrassing; others stay silent because they do not wish to appear prudish by criticising the proliferation of extreme and often illegal pornographic material online.The Guardian view on pornography: the Obscene Publications Act needs an update | EditorialRead moreShe is frustrated by this reticence. “You can’t leave the pitch on this stuff just because you’re worried about being accused of being too strait-laced,” she says.The government needs urgently to appoint a minister for porn, she recommends, to ensure that the issue gets the attention it deserves, rather than being passed reluctantly between the Home Office and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. A former adviser to David Cameron, Bertin has gathered cross-party support for her work and says she emailsKeir Starmerso regularly about the issue that she has “practically become his pen pal” (if you can have a pen pal who delegates to officials the responsibility of replying).“We’re really British about it so we don’t want to have a graphic conversation about sex and porn,” she says, in an interview in the Westminster office she shares with several other peers. “But you’ve got to shout about it as loudly as possible. The reason why we’ve got into this mess is because nobody has really wanted to talk about it.”View image in fullscreen‘Unless you see it, you can’t quite believe how bad it is,’ Bertin says of some porn available online.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianBy mess she means a situation whereby online pornography (which is viewed by an estimated 13.8 million UK adults every month) is not regulated to the same degree as pornography watched in cinemas or videos, despite the fact that videos have been redundant for decades and vanishingly few people now visit cinemas to watch porn. The absence of scrutiny has created an environment where much of the content created is, she says, “violent, degrading, abusive, and misogynistic”.She also means a situation where a member of her own party had to resign after twice watching porn (perplexinglytractor-themed) on his phone, as he whiled away time on the green benches in the House of Commons.“People have slightly lost the plot on porn. Would someone 20 years ago have just taken Playboy into the Commons, and had it lying on their lap? It just shows what an extraordinary place we’ve got to,” she says. “You can do what you like in your private life – I don’t have a problem with that – but you can’t watch porn in the House of Commons, and you shouldn’t be watching porn at your desk. There’s a place for these things and it’s not in the office.”Herreview, published in February, made 32 recommendations. Last week the first of these became government policy, when officials announced that pornography depictingstrangulationwould be made illegal. Her new taskforce of 17 people, bringing together representatives from the police, the advertising industry, anti-trafficking organisations and violence against women charities, will focus on how to ensure harmful online content is better regulated, trying to bring parity between the scrutiny of offline and online content.She pays tribute to the “hugely innovative side” of the porn industry, which has long driven technological advances in webcams and internet speeds, fuelled by the sector’s enormous capacity to turn profit, but she has not invited any representatives on to the taskforce, wary of anything that might let the industry “mark their own homework”.This week Ofcom announced that major online providers, including the UK’s most popular pornography site, Pornhub, had agreed to implement strongerage-verificationmeasures in compliance with the Online Safety Act, to prevent under-18s from accessing adult material. Those platforms that do not comply with the measures face being fined 10% of global turnover or being blocked in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, other forms of harmful pornography that are regulated in physical formats are not subject to similar restrictions online.It is this grey, unscrutinised area that Bertin’s panel will focus on, as well as calling for better processes to respond to stolen content, working out how people depicted in pornographic videos can request that the clips be removed from sites, and how to build safety mechanisms into AI tools that create sexually explicit content.Officials at the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) guided her through short clips of extreme material to help her understand the nature of easily available harmful content. She remains disturbed by the material she saw – content designed to appear to be child sexual abuse, set in children’s bedrooms – roles played by young girls, who may be over 18 but are acting as children. “The titles are very problematic, things like: ‘Daddy’s going to come home and give his daughter a good seeing to’ or ‘Oops I’ve gone too far and now she’s dead’ or ‘Kidnap and kill a hooker.’” This content would be prohibited by the BBFC in the offline world, but is unregulated online.During research for her review, she met representatives from global tech companies, and told them how whenVolvoinvented the three-point safety belt they gifted the patent to the rest of the industry because staff realised the innovation was so vital to raising safety standards. “My pitch was that they have a duty and responsibility to double down on trying to get technology that can clean up these situations, and they should share that technology,” she says. “Taylor Swift can whip a song off a website as soon as anyone tries to pirate it.

That’s not my doing by the way – I share the office,” she says semi-apologetically, before rapidly adding: “I mean I love Thatcher, obviously.”But she may be making an important distinction. In a 1970Woman’s Hourinterview, Thatcher said the rise of pornography was a “frightening” manifestation of a newly permissive society that she believed was undermining family life. Bertin describes herself as a liberal conservative and wants to be clear she is neither anti-porn nor running a moral crusade.“Consenting adults should be able to do what they want; I have no desire to stop any kind of sexual freedom. But restricting people from seeing a woman being choked, called a whore, and having several men stamp on her – for example – is not ending someone’s sexual freedom.

In doing so, we know we will antagonise somebody somewhere sometime. But we do it because we believe it is our duty to tell important journalistic stories – especially those that aren’t being told elsewhere.”She added: “Doctors Under Attack was commissioned by another broadcaster, which took a different view of the original content and decided not to broadcast it.“That other broadcaster will have had its own reasons for not showing the programme.“For ourselves, after rigorous factchecking and assessing the film against our own editorial criteria as well as against all regulatory requirements, we decided that it was both compliant with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, but also that it was important journalism in the public interest.“Any small changes were carried out with the producers to update the film and give viewers as much information as possible.“The result is harrowing, no doubt. It will make people angry, whichever side they take, or if they take no side.“But while we would never judge anyone who decides that showing something could create a risk of being thought to be taking sides, we believe there are times when the same risk is run by not showing anything at all.”Basement Films said: “This is the third film we have made about the assault on Gaza since 7 October at Basement Films, and while none of them have been easy, this became by far the most difficult.”The production company said it owed “everything” to its Palestinian colleagues in Gaza and “the doctors and medics who trusted us with their stories”.It added: “We want to apologise to the contributors and team for the long delay, and thank Channel 4 for enabling it to be seen.”Gaza: Doctors Under Attack was greenlit for broadcast by Compton, and was made by reporter Ramita Navai, executive producer Ben De Pear, who was previously editor of Channel 4 News, and director Karim Shah for Basement Films.De Pear was also previously the executive producer on 2019’s For Sama, which won a Bafta and was nominated for an Oscar.The BBCpulled the documentary How to Survive a Warzonein February after it emerged that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.In a statement last week, theBBCsaid it had paused production of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack in April, having made a decision that it could not broadcast the film while a review into a separate Gaza documentary was ongoing.The BBC said that with both films coming from independent production companies, and both about Gaza, it was right to wait for any relevant findings – and put them into action – before broadcasting the film.The BBC statement said it had for “some weeks” been “working with Basement Films to find a way to tell the stories of these doctors on our platforms”.It added: “It became apparent that we have reached the end of the road with these discussions.“We have come to the conclusion that broadcasting this material risked creating a perception of partiality that would not meet the high standards that the public rightly expect of the BBC.“Impartiality is a core principle of BBC News. It is one of the reasons that we are the world’s most trusted broadcaster. Therefore, we are transferring ownership of the film material to Basement Films.“Contrary to some reports, since we paused production of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack in April, it has not undergone the BBC’s final prebroadcast signoff processes.”“Any film broadcast will not be a BBC film,” the BBC said.The statement concluded: “We want to thank the doctors and contributors and we are sorry we could not tell their stories. The BBC will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially.”Explore more on these topicsNews CorporationBBCGazaDocumentaryFactual TVMedia businessPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was sporting a black shirt and suit, while she wore a soft-pink off-the-shoulder dress. They kissed on the boat while greeting those around them.At the ceremony the bride wore a high-necked silhouette dress and a tulle and lace veil by Dolce & Gabbana, which she told Vogue magazine was based on Sophia Loren’s dress to marry Cary Grant in the 1958 film, Houseboat.Jeff in Venice: seven takeaways from the Bezos-Sánchez weddingRead moreSánchez was also wearing a pair of diamond earrings by Dolce & Gabbana, which, according to Vogue, was lent to her in keeping with the tradition that it brings good luck for a bride to wear something borrowed.Bezos, who is No 4 on Forbes’ global billionaires list, donned a black tuxedo and bow tie over a white shirt.Friday’s ceremony had no legal status under Italian law, a senior city hall official told Reuters, suggesting the couple may have previously wed legally in the United States to avoid the bureaucracy associated with an Italian marriage.While some residents and activists raged against Bezos as a symbol of inequality and arrogance, Venetian businesses and political leaders welcomed the luxury nuptials, hailing them as a major boost for the local economy.“Those who protest are in contradiction with the history of Venice, which is a history of relations, contacts and business,” mayor Luigi Brugnaro told Reuters.“Bezos embodies the Venetian mentality. He is more Venetian than the protesters,” said the centre-right mayor, adding that he hoped Bezos, who donated €3m (£2.5m) to local institutions, would return to the city to do business.Brugnaro said Bezos had attached no conditions to holding his wedding celebrations in Venice, and city hall had only learned about his donations after they had been made.Bezos, Amazon’s executive chair, got engaged to Sánchez in 2023, four years after the collapse of his 25-year marriage to novelist and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott.Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosVeniceItalyWeddingsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Some have spoken about suicide. This is worse than anything that happened under the Tories.”With the governmentoffering major concessions to the welfare bill, ministers will be hoping critics have at last been appeased. But many campaigners have reacted with anger and concern over the changes.View image in fullscreenAndy Mitchell, a disability campaigner and a member of Unite Community, says the community feels ‘totally let down’.Photograph: Andy MitchellDisabled people’s organisations, such as Inclusion London, WinVisible and Long Covid Advocacy, have told the Guardian thatplans to exempt only existing claimants from the cutswill create a “two-tier” benefit system that “condemns” future disabled people to poverty.The Labour welfare rebels are right. This hounding of disabled people will damage the party for years to come | Frances RyanRead more“Protecting entitlements for current recipients is the right thing to do and if it’s right for current recipients then it has to be the right thing for future claimants too,” says Tracey Lazard, CEO of Inclusion London.“Even with these concessions, the bill before parliament is not a reform – it’s still rationing. There is no moral or economic case for balancing the books on the backs of disabled people. MPs must not condemn future disabled people to the poverty and indignity these devastating planned cuts will cause.”Claire Every, spokesperson for Long Covid Advocacy said: “A last-minute napkin deal will not assure safety for disabled people. The concessions create an unfair two-tier system – it is unethical to only throw some people under the bus.“These changes will negatively impact people with long Covid as they discriminate against those with fluctuating disabilities and will see those who contract the illness in the future receive less support than those who fell ill earlier in the pandemic,” she added.Some campaigners warn that a system that treats new and old claimants differently could lead to future legal challenges against the government.View image in fullscreenTracey Lazard, the chief executive of Inclusion London: ‘The bill before parliament is not a reform – it’s still rationing.’Photograph: natasha@natashahirst.co.uk/Natasha Hirst“How can you justify someone with the same impairments getting two different rates of social security payments based solely on [when they applied or how long they’ve been ill]? Is it even legal?” says Linda Burnip from Disabled People Against Cuts. “The concessions are ridiculous and [effectively mean] anyone not already ill or disabled in Britain can’t become ill or disabled and expect to have enough money to live on in the future.”Others have accused the government of trying to sow division within the disabled community to quell opposition to the bill.“We refuse the government’s divide-and-rule between old and new claimants, and MPs should keep voting against the horrendous cuts they are planning,” says Claire Glasman from WinVisible. “We won’t stop campaigning – new claimants lose out massively across Pip and universal credit, especially women with invisible and fluctuating conditions. Labour is still going after sick and disabled people.“These offers of concessions are a glimpse into the window of the soul of the government; that they think people are protesting these cuts for their own gain not the wellbeing of all disabled people,” says Cherylee Houston, co-founder of the #TakingThePIP campaign.It is still unclear whether the concessions will protect eligibility for the connecting benefits to Pip, such as carer’s allowance, she added. “We don’t agree to anything which doesn’t safeguard future disabled people from abject poverty and despair. How can they draw a line to which people who become disabled after a certain date will not receive the support they need?”The government has pledged the entire criteria system will be reviewed in conjunction with disabled people, but disability groups told the Guardian they are concerned any changes from the review will not be made before the bill passes, while MPs will not have sufficient time to consider proposals.“MPs are going to be voting on these concessions without people having a decent enough time to look and understand them,” says Mitchell. “One of the points from the amendment was that disabled people hadn’t been properly consulted, so how can it be right when these concessions have not been consulted on at all?”“If concessions are possible, so is proper reform,” added Lazard. “Fast-tracking a bill with such major consequences is irresponsible and cruel. It denies parliament, disabled people and the public real scrutiny. We urge MPs to stand your ground, stop this dangerous bill and demand better for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityWelfarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hispolling numbers are down. His party is struggling to pass his signature legislation. Millions of people have marched in the streets to protest against him. Critics say the president who claims to put America First is in fact putting America Last.Trump is not the first president to find the foreign policy domain, where as commander-in-chief he recently ordered strikes on nuclear sites in Iran, less restrictive than the domestic sphere, where a rambunctious Congress, robust judiciary and sceptical media are constant irritants. But rarely has the gap between symbolic posturing abroad and messy politicking at home been so pronounced.The Donald laps it up as Nato leaders compete to shower him with sycophancy | John CraceRead more“There’s two presidencies,” saidLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. “The one on the domestic front is gruesome and involves long-drawn-out and disappointing negotiations with Congress and that’s exactly what Donald Trump is engaged in now. What emerges from Congress is not going to be as ‘big’ or ‘beautiful’ as he promised.“Meanwhile you’ve got staggering photographs of bombs falling from the sky, Donald Trump’s flamboyant description of what he’s achieved in Iran and Europe. That’s the kind of Hollywood performance thatDonald Trumpwants.”The presidentstunned the worldlast Saturday by announcing, on his Truth Social platform, that he had ordered more than 125 aircraft and 75 weapons – including 14 bunker-busting bombs – to hit three targets in Iran to prevent the country obtaining a nuclear weapon.He followed upwith a White House speech, choreographed to project an image of power, in which he declared: “Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”View image in fullscreenTrump promotes his ‘one big beautiful bill’ at a White House event, although the legislation is facing difficulties with congressional Republicans.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersThat narrative has since been cast into doubt by a leaked intelligence report suggesting that the operation set back Iran’s nuclear programme by only a few months. Still, Trump pivoted to the role of peacemaker, again using Truth Social to announce a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, prompting Republicans to gush that he shouldwin the Nobel peace prize.Trump’s barrage of speeches, interactions with reporters and social media posts about the Middle East were likened by some to a daily soap opera, dominating Americans’ attention and distracting them from his one big beautiful bill, a budget plan that threatens to slash the social safety net thatmany of his own supportersdepend on.Jacobs observed: “This is a classic deception. He’s like the carnival barker who’s waving his hands to keep the attention of the audience even as he’s hiding the part for the next trick.“What’s coming out of Congress is going to absolutely harm many of his voters. Politicians like to cover their tracks; there’s no covering the tracks here. There will be known cuts to widely used popular programmes like the healthcare for Medicaid and there will be no doubt as to who’s responsible. These are traceable, highly visible consequences of Donald Trump.”Now in the sixth month of his second presidency, Trump’s domestic honeymoon is over. A poll of 1,006 likely voters nationwide byJohn Zogby Strategieson 24 and 25 June found the president’s approval rating down three points to 45%. About 49% of voters approve of his handling of immigration while 47% disapprove but on the economy 43% approve and 54% disapprove.Asked if they expect Trump’s presidency will make them financially better off or worse off, 40% said better and 50% said worse. Zogby commented: “There is a lot of anxiety domestically, first and foremost on the economy. People are confused and insecure. The numbers are plunging.”View image in fullscreenRiders from Connecting Compton ride in a ‘cabalgata’ for human rights, following multiple detentions by immigration authorities, in Paramount, California, on Sunday.Photograph: Jill Connelly/ReutersConsumer confidence unexpectedlydeteriorated in June, a sign of economic uncertainty because of Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The anxiety reported by the Conference Board was across the political spectrum, with the steepest decline among Republicans. And the share of consumers viewing jobs as plentiful was the smallest since March 2021.Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator,argued in a floor speechthis week that Trump had broken him promise to lower costs “on day one”. She said: “American families don’t need another war – they need good jobs and lower prices, and that is what we should be focused on.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate continue to haggle over the contents of the bill as a 4 July deadline looms.Neera Tanden, president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress and a former domestic policy adviser to President Joe Biden, told an audience on Thursday: “This legislation is the greatest Robin Hood-in-reverse legislation that I have ever seen in my lifetime. It is cutting healthcare for working-class people and using those dollars to fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.”View image in fullscreenThe Nato chief, Mark Rutte, talks to Trump during a group photo at the 2025 Nato summit in The Hague on Wednesday.Photograph: Robin Utrecht/ShutterstockMeanwhile discontent is simmering over Trump’s signature issue of immigration, even among some of his own voters. Videos of people being snatched off the streets or beaten by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents haveprovoked widespread revulsion.There have also been cases such as that of Ming Li Hui, a popular member of staff at a restaurant in rural Missouri who was arrested and jailed to await deportation. Her friend Vanessa Cowarttold the New York Times: “I voted for Donald Trump, and so did practically everyone here. But no one voted to deport moms. We were all under the impression we were just getting rid of the gangs, the people who came here in droves.”Meanwhile aggressive workplace raids are hurting hotels, restaurants, farms, construction firms and meatpacking companies, including in conservative states. The alarm recently got through to Trump, who admitted that some undocumented immigrants were actually “very good, longtime workers” and ordered a temporary pause,only to then yield backto hardliners in his administration.Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “In a restaurant, if you lose your cooks, you can’t serve people and you lose money. If you are in a factory where people have been swooped up by Ice, you have to do more work.“It puts more of the burden on the same people who might have voted for Donald Trump – lower-income or middle-income factory workers or meat-processing people. They’re feeling the effects of this immigration sweep in ways that the administration did not anticipate.”View image in fullscreenA demonstrator in New York earlier this month makes a point about Trump’s plans for healthcare.Photograph: Gina M Randazzo/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockTrump’s second term has been further marred by the tech billionaire Elon Musk leading a “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, that fired thousands of federal workers but fell far short of its cost-saving target before Musk left amid acrimony. The president’s authoritarian attacks on cultural institutions, law firms, media organisations and universitiesfuelled “No Kings” protestsinvolving more than 5 million people in more than 2,100 cities and towns across the country on 14 June.In that context, it is perhaps not surprising that Trump should relish the global stage, where any world leader is just a phone call away and where he is now being feted as statesman and father figure. It has proven easier to drop bombs on Iran or pressure Nato to agree to a big increase in military spending than to tameThomas Massie, a rebellious Kentucky Republican defying him over both Iran and the spending bill.Schiller added: “It is true for every president, Republican or Democrat, that when things are going south domestically they turn to foreign affairs. Trump feels in some ways more powerful on the global stage than he does trying to get Congress to do what he wants. The House Republicans are giving him a hard time. The Senate Republicans are giving him a hard time. He’s annoyed by this so then he goes, well, we’re a global military power.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS domestic policyUS foreign policyUS taxationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In July 2020, the business filed for insolvency, owing more than €1bn to up to 25,000 investors around the world.Smethurst was convicted this month of “serious fraud” and sentenced to six years and 11 months in prison by a regional court in Hildesheim, in northern Germany. As part of a plea bargain, he admitted to four of 27 counts of commercial fraud,filed against him by the Hanover public prosecutor’s officelast October, for total damages of €56m. The other charges were dropped in return for his confession to speed up the trial, which was due to run into August.Dolphin’s glossy brochures promised readers double-digit returns for investing their money in a scheme that pledged to restore historic buildings acrossGermany– including the ruins of castle Dwasieden on the Baltic Sea island of Rügen – and turn them into luxury apartments. However, few were ever restored.Investors were mainly from the UK, Ireland, France, Singapore and South Korea and included financial institutions and individuals, many of whom lost their pension pots or other savings after regular interest payments dried up in 2019.Smethurst’s fraud conviction related to €60m in investments made by the French fund manager Horizon AM, including €30m in the Pariser Strasse project in Berlin. The court heard that the building was never bought, but the funds were used by Smethurst’s company to meet other obligations. He served a prison sentence for fraud between 2000 and 2003 in an unrelated case.Horizon said it was “led to believe we were partnering with an experienced and reputable real estate developer” as Dolphin provided the firm with “highly detailed due diligence documents” and sent regular reports wrongly suggesting projects were “progressing as planned”. The investor was not aware of Smethurst’s previous fraud conviction.“According to findings from the insolvency administrator and the criminal investigation, a significant portion of the funds was diverted abroad to jurisdictions with strict banking secrecy, notably the British Virgin Islands and possibly the Cayman Islands,” Horizon said.“These jurisdictions do not cooperate with European authorities, which means that the money trail goes cold. This illustrates the systemic failure of cross-border cooperation in cases of fraud, and why victims like us are left without meaningful recourse.“We are still wondering where the money went, what remains, and whether it is still possible to recover anything to compensate Horizon and its investors.”UK individual investors told the Guardian they are angry, and fear that Smethurst will be released early for good conduct and recover the hidden funds for himself.View image in fullscreenJanet and David Middleton invested £220,000 in DolphinMiddleton and his wife, Janet, invested in Dolphin in 2015: his pension lump sum of £100,000 and her inheritance of £120,000. Their financial adviser, the late Alastair Hooks, told them it was low-risk and supported by the German government, Janet Middleton recalls. “To be honest, I was nervous about it and strongly stated that as pensioners we could not afford to lose this amount of money, but again we were assured there was no risk.”After Dolphin filed for insolvency, Hooks did not return their calls, and the couple discovered he had unregistered from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2012. She says they have explored every avenue – even as they dealt with David being diagnosed with bowel cancer – but have not recovered any of their investment.Janet says Smethurst’s sentence “seems very lenient to me … Smethurst may well serve his sentence and even get early release for good behaviour while other people like David and I now serve a sentence in our retirement economically”.A former NHS nurse, she says the couple had been looking forward to a comfortable retirement but have had to budget their outgoings; they have not had a holiday in years and both drive 20-year-old cars.The Hildesheim court said it did not order Smethurst to make any payments to investors because it could not establish that he had personally siphoned off any funds.Justus von Buchwaldt, of the law firm BBL, the insolvency administrator who testified in June, subsequently said: “I fear that this is only the tip of the iceberg. It is still unclear if other people were involved in this large-scale fraud and where most of the investments ended up.” Of an estimated €1.3bn of investments received by the property company, about €800m is missing.The Hanover prosecutor’s office said it had investigated other company officials but could not find evidence of any wrongdoing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: “This seems a pathetically small price for Smethurst to pay for such heinous and convoluted levels of crime. Where’s the money gone is the big question … and six years 11 months doesn’t touch the sides.”Most of the listed buildings acquired by GPG were never redeveloped and left derelict. Von Buchwaldt at BBL has sold 20 of 75 properties so far, for more than €87m, and has yet to distribute the proceeds to investors. Those sold include castle Dwasieden, a listed former brewery in Bad Aibling in Bavaria and a period villa in Fürstenberg/Havel in Brandenburg. The property sales are expected to take years as the legal situation is often complex. Almost 8,000 creditors have filed claims with BBL against the collapsed property group, out of an estimated 15,000 to 25,000 investors globally.Von Buchwaldt has said BBL would work with the UK’s FCA, Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).Debbie Kay Randles, 67, invested £25,000 in Dolphin in 2015 and, like others, has also lost money in other investment schemes. She paid £6,000 to a financial claims company in an attempt to recover her Dolphin investment, but “they just disappeared”. She even enlisted a private detective to track down the claims firm.“It’s just been an absolute ongoing nightmare,” she says. “I’ve not got a lot left, so I’ll just keep working, probably until I’m 75, and then retire.” A former TSB employee, she now works for a window blinds business and lives in York.Moncrieff-Kelly says the trial “doesn’t address this issue of how incredibly badly regulated financial affairs are in the UK … I don’t know if it’s happening so much in any other country in the world.”She points to the “middlemen” – financial advisers who are typically paid commission of 20% to 30% and “kept that money” despite “selling a fraud”. She invested in Dolphin after her financial adviser suggested it.Moncrieff-Kelly has recovered about half her £80,000 investment – money she inherited from her late mother – from the FSCS, with the help of a claims company that took the other half as payment.The FSCS says it has paid compensation to more than 1,900 customers in relation to Dolphin/GPG investment products, and a further 150 people have open claims. Compensation may have been triggered in relation to unsuitable financial advice that customers were given. It says it cannot put a figure on the compensation paid because it includes payouts for other investment losses.The SFO declined to comment whilethe FCAsaid it could not comment on individual firms.“People don’t understand the trauma and the damage that [fraud] has done,” says David Middleton. “People think [with] white collar crime, slick City crime, there’s no victim. There is a victim.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessGermanyInvestmentsEuropePropertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And while a healthy, roaring crowd has assembled for Haim’s set, which they posted about on Instagram an hour before their stage time, it doesn’t necessarily feel like there is the same mania around Haim’s surprise appearance as there was around other artists such as Lorde, Pulp and Lewis Capaldi.Perhaps that’s because, in their 13 years as a band, Haim have basically become part of the furniture at Worthy Farm: they played in 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2022, and also performed on the festival’s Covid-era live stream. There is a sense, perhaps, that the chance to see Pulp on the Pyramid stage for the first time in 30 years or Lorde return from a performing hiatus is a bigger deal than rock’s most affable sisters.View image in fullscreenLyrics stretched into frenzied screams … Haim on the Park stage.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAIndeed, the sheer reliability of Haim is at the top of my mind during their Park performance. Although their set is themed around their recently released fourth album I Quit – the staging features a giant digital sign flashing slogans including “I quit dick” and “I quit caring about what people think” – it leans on big, eternally great hits from past albums. Danielle, Alana and Este gallop on stage to the irresistible stomp of The Wire, from 2013’s Days Are Gone, and the crowd saves its biggest sing-alongs for the urgent, frustrated The Steps (from the band’s 2020 opus Women In Music Pt III) and Want You Back, from 2017’s Something To Tell You.While it’s fantastic to hear these songs in such a gorgeous live setting, in the Park’s natural amphitheatre, it also feels like a slight shame, because the songs from I Quit are total standouts. Blood on the Street, an absolutely sizzling breakup song, is extended into what feels like an eight-minute cross between a cabaret show and a jam band, with Danielle punctuating one lyric with a yelled “What the fuck?” and imperiously stretching her arm out demanding a guitar at one point, and Este stretching her lyrics into frenzied screams. Down to Be Wrong, a highlight of the record, provides a spectacular final song: Danielle’s voice sounds sublime on the chorus, and it’s even better when sung back to her by a devoted, ardent crowd.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsHaimreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet there manages to be a genuine twist in the lineup: grime legend Skepta, as a last-minute replacement for alt-metal band Deftones, who have been forced to cancel due to illness. Skepta happens to be kicking around because last night, at Glade, he performed a DJ set alongside Mochakk from São Paulo and Carlita from Istanbul – an advertisement of his house-techno project Más Tiempo, launched with Jammer in 2023, with regular slots in Ibiza.But he’d not required the full force of his production for Glade, so stepping in for a billing just shy of the headline slot on Glastonbury’s second largest stage, Other, is certainly a challenge. On that, of course,Skeptasteps up to the plate with incredible energy and conviction, saying “Let’s go!!! No crew, no production but am ready to shut Glastonbury down. Victory lap time. Pre-Big Smoke 2025!” (his multi-genre festival taking place at Crystal Palace Bowl, south London, in August.)And who better to teleport to the slot than the MC and rapper who always seems to be in a million places at once, revealing numerous side missions, whether that’s heading up a luxury fashion house, auctioning off paintings to Sotheby’s, or getting a chieftaincy in Ogun State, Nigeria? That kind of calling requires someone as frenetic and spontaneous as the microphone champion.View image in fullscreenMicrophone champion … Skepta.Photograph: Anna BarclaySkepta only gets 30 minutes with the mic, but his performance is so kinetic and zesty and expansive that you feel that it is longer, and wonder what it might have been if he had been called to the stage with real notice (Skepta’s last Glastonbury performance of this kind was on this stage with Boy Better Know in 2017). A siren marks his arrival, and he’s accompanied only by long-term collaborator DJ Maximum. Though he has a forthcoming project, Fork and Knife – which will, among other themes, track his parents’ migration from Nigeria to London – he wisely reaches for the more recognisable bangers, kicking off with recent hit Cops & Robbers, his collaboration with Sammy Virji: “DJ play one for the badman, DJ play one for the ladies.” Dressed in shorts from his own Mains brand, a durag and frameless glasses, he flawlessly rattles through hits old and new: That’s Not Me, Redrum, It Ain’t Safe.What makes Skepta so remarkable and a cut above other MCs is that clarity in his rapping delivery. His flow is so explosive and complex and his tracks are peppered with memorable lyrics and puns such as: “We don’t talk about beef, by the way, did I mention I just turned vegan?” But what also shines through is the multigenerational appeal Skepta has over 20 years on from his beginnings in the Tottenham-based grime collective Meridian Crew. Archival footage played behind him takes us from his early days of clashing, to his 2008 1Xtra freestyle with his brother JME and videos of him rapping with his crew around the estates of north London. Yet while Skepta is spoken of among his grime peers like Wiley, Frisco, JME and Kano, he is also ranked alongside the younger generation such as Dave and Central Cee. And of course, the acclaim of Mercury prize-winning album Konnichiwa and his collaboration with A$AP Rocky, Praise the Lord, (which takes off well here) helped him to crossover stateside in a way that had been semi-unprecedented for British rappers.From this set, it is easy to see why Skepta has endured – that crisp, fresh delivery, that unceasing hunger and energy, but also the evolution. Of course he runs the full gamut of his discography, but as he closes he plays the newly released Victory Lap with Fred Again, a sickening 140bpm dubstep track with a modern electronic production and a Doechii sample. It’s indicative of how curious and genre-pushing Skepta is, and shows that his pursuits into other ventures have only complicated his music for the better. No doubt when he’s back again, with more preparation time, he’ll be an even bigger Glastonbury highlight.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025FestivalsMusic festivalsSkeptaGrimeRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

Monkeys ran ahead, gorillas bounded behind and bringing up the rear were a pair of handsome, ambling giraffes. Down Greek Street they marched, past pubs and cafes, resulting in an actual zebra crossing as the pack moved across Cambridge Circus, passing in front of bemused drivers, and on through lanes of shoppers in Covent Garden.This was central London on late Friday afternoon: streets overrun not by tourists but byThe Herds, a staggeringly ambitious public art project. In April, a menagerie of lifesize puppet animals began a 20,000km route from the Congo Basin to the Arctic Circle, signifying the displacement of animals and humans caused by the climate crisis. This weekend they are in London; next week they travel north for the Manchester international festival. I spent an hour following the herd on their journey from Soho to Somerset House, during which the puppets either joined in a series of performances – or watched them along with the rest of us.View image in fullscreenPuppeteers take the animals for a run near Tower Bridge on Friday morning before heading to the West End.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockFirst up, the animals (made by the South African collectiveUkwanda) circled the sundial pillar at Seven Dials during a performance of When I Grow Up from Matilda, the musical hit at the Cambridge theatre opposite. An anthem from one of London’s most popular shows, it served as more than just a quick crowd pleaser as it fitted the future-facing project. Watching them brought to mind Greta Thunberg’s speech at the UN climate summit in 2019: “The eyes of all future generations are upon you.”There was humour in seeing the giraffes amid the trees of Covent Garden, with the musical’s lyrics about growing “tall enough to reach the branches”. But during London’s sustainedheatwaveit was disquieting, too, to hear the lines: “I will spend all day just lying in the sun / And I won’t burn cause I’ll be all grown up.”View image in fullscreenThe puppets pass Covent Garden tube station.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockApproaching the market, an area traditionally popular with acrobats, magicians and mimes, the puppets rested before a particularly illustrious street performer:Juliet Stevenson, who has a long history of raising climate awareness. Evoking a kind of animal whisperer, Stevenson stroked one of the creatures tenderly while giving a speech, delivered as if amid dystopia, about trees that lost their will, animals “screaming their pain” and “a desert forming inside me and outside”.We walked on and, within the crowd, a woman discussed the puppets with her child: how thirsty and dry the animals looked, with their corrugated cardboard bodies. The design, with material fraying and the inner frames exposed in places, makes them seem fragile despite their robustness. Another crowd member waved her family’s own homemade turtle, recycled from similar materials. In such close quarters, you could feel the strain on the puppeteers and their skill at bringing the creatures to life, not just through movements but vocal exhalations too. The project smartly mirrors the importance of collective action: three people control each gorilla, another trio handle each giraffe (two from beneath supporting the body and one with a pole operating the head). I’ve always loved watching the care in the eyes of performers when they are manipulating puppets – here, it was often incredibly moving to witness.View image in fullscreenThe puppets pause during a performance at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe creatures would momentarily pause, survey their surroundings, rise on their back feet and stampede. Throughout the hour, this herd grew as more passersby joined in. “We are the ones we’ve been waiting for,” actor Chipo Chung told the crowd in a speech beside the market before the journey snaked around the corner and stopped outside theRoyal Opera Housewhere tenor Ryan Vaughan Davies appeared on the balcony to sing from The Magic Flute. The giraffes leaned in to listen.This West End leg of the journey was co-curated by Amir Nizar Zuabi (artistic director of The Herds) and theatre and opera director Joe Hill-Gibbins, who staged a particularly muddy version ofA Midsummer Night’s Dreamat the Young Vic in 2017. (That venue’s former artistic director, David Lan, is one of the chief producers on The Herds.) Shakespeare’s “forgeries of jealousy” speech, increasingly used to reflect our own climate disruption, was performed by Zubin Varla as Oberon and Hattie Morahan as Titania. (A gorilla rested its paws on Varla; a monkey nuzzled Morahan.)View image in fullscreenCollective action … The Herds.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe route ended in the courtyard of Somerset House, with blistering drumming by Andy Gangadeen who was circled by the animals. The creatures were laid to rest in the scorching heat, their fragmented design now disturbingly evoking carcasses.‘Get ready to sweat!’ The animal mega-marathon stampeding from the Congo to the ArcticRead moreOutdoor art disruptions, like the journey of the puppet pachyderm and giant friend inThe Sultan’s Elephantby Royal de Luxe in London in 2006, usually leave joy in their wake. After such performances, the spaces feel charged with a sense of wonder at the memory. Leaving The Herds and retracing the animals’ route back through to Soho, I felt anguish at their absence but a galvanising urge that brought me back toMatilda’s defiant lyrics. Just because we find ourselves in this story, it doesn’t mean that everything is written for us.The Herdsis in London until 29 June, and across Greater Manchester 3-5 July, as part ofManchester international festival.

It was legal, consensual – and a messy grey areaThe author’s new book Sweet Nothings follows four women who, like her, dated their professors – and explores how even a consensual pedagogical relationship can result in ‘a unique harm’Get our weekend culture and lifestyle emailKatie CunninghamSat 28 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 22.04 EDTShareAt the tail end of 2023, the author Madison Griffiths posed a question on her Instagram: “Has anyone here ever been in a relationship with a professor or a tutor?”Hundreds of responses flooded in. There were those who revealed that their parents had met in the lecture hall. Younger women reported they’d been involved with a university superior. Their experiences were diverse but what united those who messaged her was gender: no men came forward to say they had been in relationships with a professor or tutor. In Griffiths’s inbox, at least, it was all women.For Griffiths, the question had been a personally motivated one. When she was 21, about 18 months after she’d been in his class, she asked a university tutor she had a crush on out for a drink, attracted by his intelligence and charm. They started dating and spent the next five years in an on-and-off relationship, Griffiths changing her university major to avoid winding up in his class again. They were only separated by a handful of years in age but, in the time since their breakup, Griffiths found the afterlife of that romance “convoluted and complex in a way that I hadn’t encountered in other relationships”.“From 19 years old, my dynamic with him was one where I put him on a pedestal and I wanted him to really ‘see me’… and I think that had everything to do with the implicit power imbalance that operated right from the get-go,” Griffiths says. “It wasn’t until the relationship’s fallout that I started reflecting on these things.”The conversations she had as a result of that Instagram post snowballed into something bigger. Griffiths’s experience and that of four of the women who reached out after her Instagram call-out would form the basis of a new book,Sweet Nothings, which explores the ethics and mechanics of “pedagogical relationships”: those between student and teacher, and a phenomenon Griffiths regards as highly gendered.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningGriffiths spent a year speaking to her four case studies, women now in their 30s and 40s who had “lived lives well and truly outside of these relationships” and were now able to reflect on what had been. She readily admits that she was probably subconsciously “looking for women that reminded me somewhat of myself, or could help me make sense of my own [experience]”. In her quest to understand these dynamics, Griffiths also spoke to male professors and tutors who had slept with a student – but not the ones who’d had relationships with her four subjects, to protect their anonymity. (Her subjects are also given pseudonyms and minor elements of their stories, like placenames, were fictionalised to obscure them.)Sorry, Baby review – a warm, bitingly funny refocus of the trauma plotRead moreSweet Nothings is being published into a cultural moment that feels perhaps ready to begin reckoning with professor-student relationships. It arrives just ahead of A24’s Sundance winnerSorry, Baby, about one woman’s residual trauma from such a relationship, and not long after bothNew Yorker fictionand Diana Reid’s bestselling novelLove & Virtueon the same topic. Perhaps most importantly, it comes in the long shadow of the #MeToo movement, as the conversation has expanded, sometimes uncertainly, to consensual relationships that feel not-quite-right – and what, exactly, in the arena of sex deserves our condemnation.View image in fullscreenEva Victor in a scene from Sorry, Baby, which she both directed and acted in. Victor’s character has a relationship with a teacher.Photograph: Philip Keith/APGriffiths focused specifically on relationships that happened at university, where both parties were adults, and no abuse involving minors or high school students. What makes these relationships interesting to Griffiths is the grey area they operate in. Sex between a student and a professor is not against the law and, in many cases, not even expressly against university policy – yet these relationships can leave a lifelong mark on the women who enter them.“I was particularly interested in sex that was ‘problematic’ but not necessarily ‘bad’,” Griffiths says. “Every woman I spoke to was of the age of consent – [but] well and truly nursing a unique harm. The women that I was in conversation with didn’t necessarily feel as if something completely, egregiously untoward took place within the framework of consent. It was something else entirely.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead of flat condemnations, Griffiths wanted to highlight the agency a lot of these women had in procuring these relationships and explore their own desires. But she found that some men appeared over time, as one character notes, “vile, dull and obvious” for using their sway in the classroom to get with women, sometimes many years their junior, who wouldn’t look twice at them in a pub. A complicated shame and anger often bloomed as women looked back on these relationships in the rear-view mirror, their memories of university forever soured.Two of her subjects had seen their former professor or tutor go on to date other students after their own breakup. The revelation that they may have been part of a kink, “as opposed to necessarily someone who met the love of their life in the wrong outfit, in the wrong place, in the wrong time, did quite severe harm to these individuals’ sense of self”, Griffiths says. So too did realising that a man they once idolised, who has a mastery of the field they aspire to work in, had made their relationship about sex when perhaps what they were really craving was to be told they could “be him one day”.It perhaps won’t surprise you to hear thatLisa Taddeo’s Three Women, the 2019 bestseller about the sex lives of three US women (including one who, at age 17, had a sexual relationship with her high school teacher), was an inspiration for Griffiths.Helen Garner: ‘People would give me death stares in the street’Read moreBut another book looms much larger: Helen Garner’s The First Stone, mentioned directly in Sweet Nothings as a book Griffiths finds both compelling and aggravating. Garner’s 1995 account of two University of Melbourne students who accused a residential college master of sexual assault has beencritically re-evaluatedfor its often-scathing cynicism towards its female subjects. Garner herself had an affair with an older tutor while at university, she revealed in The First Stone – but didn’t view it as an abuse of power, and regarded the young women’s decision to lodge a complaint with police over being groped as a “heartbreaking” overreaction and affront to feminist ideals.Griffiths read Garner’s book twice while writing her manuscript, determined to do her own differently. Garner didn’t interview the women involved in the case for The First Stone – they had declined her interview requests – and Griffiths found the absence of their voices distracting. She made her female subjects the centre of her story and is happy to be writing in an era when “we can speak in less sweeping terms” about gender and consent.“I think older generations have a very cartoonish view of an assailant and his prey,” she laughs.But even 30 years on from The First Stone, Griffiths found she and her subjects still brushed up against an attitude of, as she puts it, “Well, what did she get out of it?” Despite typically being in only their late teens or early 20s, Griffiths found that uni students are seen as capable and headstrong, and therefore unable to be victimised like a high school student who is just a couple years younger than them. That disregard for uni students, paired with the innate respect professors enjoy, has muddied understandings of power and allowed men at universities to do what they like.“There is certainly a class dimension to all of this,” Griffiths says. “I think professors are held to high esteem and are able to operate in [this] way throughout a cultural understanding of them as quite esoteric, niche, unconventional genius. Genius men throughout history have gotten away with a lot.”Sure enough, while two of the four women featured in Sweet Nothings filed complaints against the men they had relationships with, there have been no repercussions for any of the men. There are rules around student-teacher relationships at most Australian universities, Griffiths says, but “they are open to interpretation”. At many universities, guidelines only apply to relationships between teaching staff and their current students; for Griffiths and two of her subjects, the relationship began after they were in the same classroom. The order of events didn’t change the power dynamic.“One thing that I found was the origin story of all of these relationships, having once met in the classroom, pervaded the relationships at their core. It never went away,” Griffiths says. The women she spoke to remained eager to impress or prove themselves to their former teachers, forever affording them the upper hand.For Griffiths, now 31, that has proven true. “I guess at the core of my almost childish want with him was to be taken seriously,” she says. “I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t a shadow of that in my relationship to my work more broadly.” She hopes that if her former tutor reads her book, he will see that she is able to look at their relationship academically now – “with the fine-tooth comb that perhaps he didn’t teach me”.Sweet Nothingsis out now ($36.99)Explore more on these topicsBooksAustralian booksRelationshipsDating#MeToo movementfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are words that have no place in your apologies, according to those who have spent years analysing them: “It was not my intent”. “What I meant was”. “Sorry you misunderstood”. And any use of the word “obviously”.Marjorie Ingall and Susan McCarthy call it “bad apology bingo”. They have heard a lot of them as co-authors ofSorry, Sorry, Sorry: The Case for Good Apologiesand the blogSorrywatch, where they critique public apologies. “We’ve looked at so many studies, from so many different fields, on what makes an effective apology,” Ingall says.After 10-plus years of Sorrywatch, they have also seen apologies so bad they warrant apologies of their own. “‘Sorry if’, ‘sorry but’, ‘sorry I forgot that you don’t really have a sense of humour about that’ … The line between explanation and excuse is very porous, and very thin.”At their best, apologies can not only repair relationships but make them more resilient. The trouble is, they are hard to do – or at least to do well. One ill-considered or misplaced word can not only fail to secure forgiveness but make the situation worse.How can you say sorry, and convey that you really mean it – and why do we find it so difficult?‘An absolute art form’: the best, worst and weirdest celebrity apologiesRead more“In general, we want to feel good about ourselves, and for people to think positively of us,” says Karina Schumann, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, who has extensively studied the science of apology.By taking responsibility for hurting someone’s feelings, or messing up at work, we threaten our image of ourselves as moral or competent. “We really have a hard time associating ourselves with those wrongful actions,” Schumann says.Further complicating matters is the fact that blame is rarely clearcut, even when we accept we’re at least somewhat at fault. “It can be really difficult to say, ‘Yes, I’m responsible’ when I also see you – or the situation – as responsible.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningYou can reference those extenuating circumstances in your apology, Schumann says – it just has “to be done really carefully”.Often people who have been wronged struggle to understand why: “Why did this person do this to me? Is it because they don’t value our relationship? Were they trying to hurt me intentionally?”That ambiguity can compound hurt feelings and create bigger rifts. Giving context in an apology – about your reasoning, for example, or emotional state – can help prevent further misunderstanding, according to Schumann. “But you still need to accept the responsibility for the harm, and the consequences.”There are certain words that immediately undermine the value of an apologyKarina SchumannVarious studies have identified a certain number of steps to an effective apology, fromfive stepstoseven. Schumann’s own framework has eight, though she thinks of them more as elements you can drawn on, depending on the situation and particular misdemeanour, than steps you must follow. “I would never advise going through it like a checklist,” she says.Sometimes, acknowledging the harm you’ve caused will be the most pressing part of your apology; other times the emphasis will be on repairing the relationship. “It’s going to be really important that this person feels that you are committed to never behaving this way again, that this was a one-time mistake,” Schumann says.One essential yet often overlooked step is actually saying the words “I am sorry” or “I apologise”.“They need to hear that very clear, strong signal,” Schumann says. “If that’s missing, then you can say all the rest, and some people might not register it as an apology.”Equally, she goes on: “There are certain words that immediately undermine the value of an apology.” One is “but”. “People hear defensiveness, as opposed to accountability.”Even if you have points to get off your chest, it may be best to hold off until you are on firmer footing. “We have a tendency to want apologies to be this immediate fix,” Schumann says. “What they should be is a signal for a broader process of reparation, and commitment to restoring the relationship.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And, if you don’t think you can, don’t say those words, because it’s going to backfire.”Where saying more can help (rather than hinder) your apology is in demonstrating awareness of the impact on the other person. “You should specify what you are sorry for, and show that you understand why it was hurtful,” Ingall says.As well as demonstrating empathy and self-reflection, this gives the other person a chance to clarify. Regardless of what they have to say, it’s important to listen, Ingall says. “The thing that people want most is to be heard and understood … The apology is not about you; it’s about the recipient.”Offering reparations can help communicate your selflessness, Ingall adds – and those can take many forms, such as flowers. After she and her husband fight, he gets to work on jobs around the house or takes on more of the cooking. “He is not great with the words – but he does the acts of service,” Ingall says.Research suggests your apology may indeed be more persuasive if you’re seen to be making an effort – but that can go beyond gifts and household chores.A studyfound that people perceive apologies using longer words (but still common and easy-to-understand) as being more genuine.Shiri Lev-Ari, the paper’s author, says it is received as akin to investing time or money in making amends. “If the person inconveniences themselves in order to apologise, you can say: ‘Okay, they mean it.’”That we seem to intuitively understand this reflects our attention to navigating these nuanced social dynamics, Lev-Ari says: as much as we might agonise over apologising, much of what makes it effective (or not) is unspoken and even subconscious. “Without realising, we also choose words because of their forms, such as how long they are, not just what they mean.”Though parents might fight in front of their children, they often make up in privateThe gender split is less significant than you might think. According toSchumann’s research, women report apologising more frequently than men do but it’s not because they are more willing or able.It reflects instead a difference of perception, she says. Men just have higher thresholds than women do for what constitutes an apology-worthy offence, Schumann found. When that threshold is met, “they’re just as willing”.That is distinct from the stereotype that men are prevented by their ego from apologising, even when they know they’re wrong, Schumann points out.For one study, she asked (straight, married or cohabiting) couples to each keep a daily diary of apology-worthy offences they either committed or were committed against them. The accounts only aligned 35% of the time.“It really speaks to the need for people to communicate,” Schumann says. “The majority of the time we are hurting each other, it’s not out of malicious intent.”Sure, I’ll hear your apology. That doesn’t mean I have to accept it | Isabelle OderbergRead moreOne way to make your apology more effective is to demonstrate a genuine effort to understand the other person’s perspective. Instead of assuming you know how they feel, Schumann says, ask questions. “Open the space for learning about each other.”All the experts agree apologising can be agonising even for the most apologetic, empathetic person. It doesn’t help that we don’t often get to see it modelled well.Most public apologies tend to be about PR rather than real remorse. Leaders are actually taught to deflect responsibility. And, though parents might fight in front of their children, they often make up in private.When Ingall and McCarthy started writing Sorrywatch, in 2012, their focus was on making fun ofcelebrities’ non-apologies. The project became more civic-minded post-Trump. “We wanted to show that an apology is really an act of strength.”A good apology, after all, demands vulnerability: it is an admission that we failed to live up to our own and shared standards, Ingall says. But it’s also a tool by which we can repair bonds, strengthen them and show how much they mean to us.“Should you ever apologise if you’re not sorry? Sometimes – if you value the relationship more than being right.”Explore more on these topicsPsychologyRelationshipsFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thomas does not have US, German or Jamaican citizenship – but Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency deported him anyway to Jamaica, a country in which he had never stepped foot.Thomas had spent two-and-a-half months incarcerated while waiting for an update on his case. He was previously at the center of a case brought before the US supreme court regarding his unique legal status.The federal government argued that Thomas – who had previously received a deportation order – was not a citizen simply because he was born on a US army base, and it used prior criminal convictions to buttress the case against him. He petitioned for a review of the order, but the supreme court denied him, finding his father “did not meet the physical presence requirement of the [law] in force at the time of Thomas’s birth”.From Jamaica, Thomas told the Chronicle: “If you’re in the US army, and the army deploys you somewhere, and you’ve gotta have your child over there – and your child makes a mistake after you pass away – and you put your life on the line for this country, are you going to be OK with them just kicking your child out of the country?”He added, in reference to his father: “It was just Memorial Day [in late May]. Y’all are disrespecting his service and his legacy.”In recent months,US militaryveterans’ family members have been increasingly detained by immigration officials, as the administration continues pressing for mass deportations.A US marine veteran, during an interview on CNN, said he felt “betrayed” after immigration officialsbeat and arrested his fatherat a landscaping job. The arrested man had moved to the US from Mexico in the 1990s without documentation but was detained by Ice agents this month while doing landscaping work at a restaurant in Santa Ana, California.In another recent case, the wife of another Marine Corps veteran was detained by Ice despite still breastfeeding her three-month-old daughter. According to theAssociated Press, the veteran’s wife had been going through a process to obtain legal residency.The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to detain and deport people nationwide. During a May meeting, White House officialspressedIce to increase its daily arrests to at least 3,000 people daily. That would result in 1 million people being arrested annually by Ice.Following the tense meeting, Ice officials have increased their enforcement operations, including by detaining an increasing number of people with no criminal record. Being undocumented is a civil infraction – not a crime.According to arecent Guardian analysis, as of mid-June, Ice data shows there were more than 11,700 people in immigration detention arrested by the agency despite no record of them being charged with or convicted of a crime. That represents a staggering 1,271% increase from data released on those in Ice detention immediately preceding the start of Trump’s second term.In March, Ice officialsarrested the daughter of a US veteranwho had been fighting a legal battle regarding her status. Alma Bowman, 58, was taken into custody by Ice during a check-in at the Atlanta field office, despite her having lived in the US since she was 10 years old.Bowman was born in the Philippines during the Vietnam war, to a US navy service member from Illinois stationed there. She had lived in Georgia for almost 50 years. Her permanent residency was revoked following a minor criminal conviction from 20 years ago, leading her to continue a legal battle to obtain citizenship in the US.Previously, Bowman was detained by Ice at a troubled facility in Georgia, where non-consensual gynecological procedures were allegedly performed on detained women. In 2020, she had been a key witness for attorneys and journalists regarding the controversy. According toan interview with The Interceptfrom that year, Bowman said she had always thought she was a US citizen.In another recent case, a US army veteran and green-card holderlefton his own to South Korea. His deportation order was due to charges related to drug possession and an issue with drug addiction after being wounded in combat in the 1980s, for which he earned the prestigious Purple Heart citation.“I can’t believe this is happening in America,” Sae Joon Park, who had held legal permanent residency, told National Public Radio. “That blows me away – like, [it is] a country that I fought for.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS militaryTrump administrationJamaicaUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Scientists check and recheck their calculations but there is no mistake – civilisation is facing a cataclysmic end unless the space rock can be deflected.It may sound like science fiction, but it is a threat that is being taken seriously by scientists.Earlier this year, researchers estimated that asteroid YR4 2024 had a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, before revising that likelihood down to0.0017%. This week, new data suggested it wasmore likely to hit the moon, with a probability of 4.3%.If that happens, the 53- to 67-metre (174ft-220ft) asteroid previously called a “city killer” will launch hundreds of tonnes of debris towards our planet, posing a risk to satellites, spacecraft and astronauts.Possible impact of asteroid 2024 YR4 on the moon in December 2032.Before that, in April 2029, 99942 Apophis – an asteroid larger than the Eiffel Tower – will be visible to the naked eye when it passes within 32,000km of Earth. This attention-grabbing close encounter has prompted the UN to designate 2029 as the international year of planetary defence.When it comes to apocalyptic asteroid strikes, there is precedent, of course. Most scientists believe such an event hastened the demise of non-avian dinosaurs 66m years ago.“This is something that happens,” said Colin Snodgrass, a professor of planetary astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. “Not very often, but it is something that happens. And it’s something that we could potentially do something about.”Knowing the riskAs Chris Lintott, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford, told the UK parliament’s science, innovation and technology committee this week, the risk posed by an asteroid originating beyond our solar system is minimal. Instead, he said, the greater threat comes from those in our cosmic back yard.View image in fullscreenAn asteroid is thought to have caused the harsh conditions that led most dinosaurs to go extinct.Illustration: Dr Mark A Garlick/Reuters“Most asteroids in the solar system exist in the asteroid belt, which is between Mars and Jupiter, but they become disrupted, usually by encounters with either of those planets, and they can move into orbits that cross the Earth,” said Lintott, who presents the long-running BBC astronomy series The Sky at Night. “Then it’s just a case of whether we’re in the wrong place at the wrong time.”The chances of an enormous asteroid – the type that did for the dinosaurs – hitting Earth is admittedly low. “We think there’s one of these every 10m to 100m years, probably,” Lintott told the Guardian. “So I think you’d be right to ignore that when you decide whether to get up on a Thursday morning or not.”Snodgrass said there were “precisely four” asteroids big enough and close enough to Earth to be considered “dino-killers”, and added: “We know where they are, and they’re not coming anywhere near us.”But damage can also be done by smaller asteroids. According to Nasa, space rocks measuring about one to 20 metres across collided with Earth’s atmosphere resulting in fireballs556 times over 20 years.View image in fullscreenA dashboard camera catches a meteor exploding over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013.Photograph: APMany collisions haveoccurred over the oceans, but not all. “Chelyabinsk is the best example,” Lintott said. In 2013, ahouse-sized space rock– thought to have been about 20 metres across – exploded in the air above the Russian city with aforce of nearly 30 Hiroshima bombs, producing an airburst that caused significant damage and hundreds of injuries, mostly from broken glass.Less dramatically, in February 2021 a space rock thought to have been just tens of centimetres across broke up in Earth’s atmosphere, with fragments landing in the Cotswold town of Winchcombe in the UK. Thankfully, the damage was confined to asplat mark on a driveway.The types of asteroids we should perhaps be most concerned about are those about 140 metres across. According to Nasa, asteroids around that size are thought to hit Earth aboutonce every 20,000 yearsand have the potential to cause huge destruction and mass casualties. The space agency has a congressional mandate to detect and track near-Earth objects of this size and larger, and a suite of new technological advances are helping them do just that.Gathering dataOn Monday, thefirst images from the Vera C Rubin observatoryin Chile were released to the public. This telescope is expected to more than triple the number of known near-earth objects, from about 37,000 to 127,000, over a 10-year period. In just 10 hours of observations, it found seven previously unspotted asteroids that will pass close to the Earth – though none are expected to hit.View image in fullscreenThe Trifid and Lagoon nebulas as seen by the Vera C Rubin observatory in Chile.Photograph: RubinObs/ReutersAlso in the offing, though not planned for launch before 2027, is Nasa’s near-Earth object (Neo) surveyor. Armed with an array of infrared detectors, this is “the first space telescope specifically designed to detect asteroids and comets that may be potential hazards to Earth”, the agency says.Lintott said: “Between those two, we should find everything down to about 140 metres.” He said such observations should give scientists up to 10 years’ warning of a potential collision.The European Space Agency (Esa) is planning anear-Earth object mission in the infrared(Neomir) satellite. Slated for launch in the early 2030s, this will help detect asteroids heading towards Earth that are at least 20 metres in diameter and obscured by the sun.Assessing the emerging capabilities, Edward Baker, the planetary defence lead at the UK’s National Space Operations Centre (NSpOC) at RAF High Wycombe, said: “I think we’re in a good place. I can’t see a situation like [the film]Don’t Look Upmaterialising at all – though I wouldn’t mind being portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio.”View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio as an astronomy professor in the 2021 disaster satire Don’t Look Up.Photograph: Niko Tavernise/APAs our ability to spot near-Earth asteroids increases, Lintott said, we should get used to hearing about asteroids like YR4 2024, which initially seem more likely to hit Earth before the risk rapidly falls towards zero. He described the shifting probabilities as similar to when a footballer takes a free kick.“The moment they kick it, [it looks like] it could go anywhere,” he said. “And then as it moves, you get more information. So you’re like: ‘Oh, it might go in the goal,’ and then it inevitably becomes really clear that it’s going to miss.”Taking actionOf course, scientists aren’t just monitoring the risks to Earth. They are also making plans to protect it. In 2022, Nasa crashed a spacecraft into a small, harmless asteroid called Dimorphos that orbits a larger rock called Didymos to test whether it would be possible to shift its path. TheDart mission was a success, reducing Dimorphos’s 12-hour orbit around Didymos by 32 minutes.In 2024, Esa launched afollow-up to Nasa’s Dart mission, called Hera. This will reach Dimorphos in 2026 and carry out a close-up “crash site investigation”. It will survey the Dart impact crater, probe how effectively momentum was transferred in the collision and record a host of other measurements.Esa hopes this will provide crucial insights that can be used to make deliberate Dart-style impacts a reliable technique for safeguarding Earth.View image in fullscreenEsa’s Hera spacecraft will survey the Dimorphos and Didymos asteroids in 2026.Illustration: ESA/ScienceOffice.org“Dart was much more effective than anyone expected it to be,” Lintott said. “And presumably that’s something to do with the structure of the asteroid. I think we need to know whether Dart just got lucky with its target, or whether all near-Earth asteroids are like this.”For the most part, scientists say the threat of an asteroid strike does not keep them up at night. “We’re safer than we’ve ever been and we’re about to get a lot safer, because the more of these things we find, the more we can spot them on the way in,” Lintott said.As Esa has quipped on its merchandise: “Dinosaurs didn’t have a space agency.”Explore more on these topicsAsteroidsSpaceAstronomyNasaEuropean Space AgencyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These sequences, along with the plot as a whole, tend to include little callbacks to the past: buses, barbecues, ceiling fans and logs make cameo appearances, thrilling little reminders of the havoc they can wreak in a Final Destination.”Radheyan SimonpillaiRead the full reviewBooksIf you only read one, make it …View image in fullscreenEndling by Maria RevaReviewed by Marcel TherouxSummed up in a sentenceA black comedy about endangered snails and Ukraine’s marriage industry is disrupted, in both narrative and form, by Russia’s full-scale invasion.What our reviewer said“Rather than feeling distracting or tricksy, the author’s intervention heightens the impact of the story, giving it a discomfiting intensity and a new, more intimate register.

And so the curtain finally went up on the Charlotte Edwards-Nat Sciver-Brunt era for a Trent Bridge Saturday matinee.The audience, though, went home disappointed after witnessing an England performance akin to The Play That Goes Wrong, bowled out for 113 inside 15 overs, to hand India a 97-run win, England’s heaviest T20 defeat in terms of runs.England v India: first women’s T20 cricket – liveRead moreEdwards’s calling-card has been about transforming England into a side that plays smart cricket and find ways to win. With the honourable exception of Sciver-Brunt – whose 66 from 42 balls was the only contribution of note – this performance failed on both counts.“One person can’t win a game,” said a frustrated Sciver-Brunt. “It’s all about partnerships with the bat. We wanted to do that, but we couldn’t execute.”India’s left-arm spinner Shree Charani finished with four for 12 on her T20 debut, including removing Sciver-Brunt after a review showed the captain had nicked off behind the stumps. Charani’s maiden wicket in the ninth over encapsulated everything that was wrong with the run chase: Alice Capsey meekly wafting one into the hands of Arundhati Reddy at short third man as England sunk to 70 for five.India were without their captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, who had failed to recover in time after sustaining a head injury during Wednesday’s warm-up match. But Smriti Mandhana shrugged off her absence with the same easy nonchalance with which she hit the ball, the stand-in striking a maiden T20 international hundred as India racked up 210 for five – their second-highest total.Mandhana reached three figures in the 16th over, driving sweetly over the top – at which point she removed her helmet and pointed up at the India dressing room, grinning. She explained it was aimed at her teammate Radha Yadav. “Three days back, me and Radha were having a conversation – all these girls are really hard on me sometimes,” she said. “She was telling me: ‘It’s high time you get a century in T20s, you keep getting out in 70s, 80s, you are not doing justice to your talent.’“And I was like: ‘OK Radha, this time I will try to get it in one of the matches of the series.’ I did not think it would come in the first match. The finger was towards her: ‘I got it today.’”View image in fullscreenIndia’s Smriti Mandhana hits out during her 112 off 62 balls.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAMandhana holed out to extra cover with four balls remaining, handing Sophie Ecclestone her first international wicket since England’s humiliation at the MCG Test five months ago. Her return to the international stage was a fraught one: some nervous fumbles in the field, followed by a 19-run opening over when the left-handed Mandhana twice clattered her over the boundary rope. Her return was one for 43 off three overs: she looked every inch a cricketer who had opted out of domestic cricket for Lancashire for a wellbeing break.It was a tough day, too, for Danni Wyatt-Hodge, who shelled Harleen Deol in the deep – the worst of a series of missed chances by the hosts – before adding a third consecutive duck to this summer’s pond of them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It told, as they lost three wickets in the power play. After that, Mandhana said, the plan was simple: “Execute your best ball to Nat and give a single to her.”Sciver-Brunt said: “My personality is pretty steady, not too many ups and downs. I want to make sure the girls know that it’s not panic stations. We’ll pick ourselves back up again.”They have 72 hours to do just that before the second T20 at Bristol on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsWomen's cricketEngland women's cricket teamIndia women's cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

When something is rumbling beneath the surface, focusing on the job in hand can be almost impossible.So it was perhaps no surprise that Aryna Sabalenka chose to clear the air with Coco Gauff after the world No 1’s harsh words in the wake of herpainful loss to the Americanin the final of the French Open this month.Australian teenager Maya Joint saves four match points to win Eastbourne titleRead moreClaiming it was “the worst final that I ever played”, Sabalenka said she had lost the match rather than Gauff winning it and, most insultingly of all, that had Iga Swiatek, the four-time French Open champion, beaten her in the semi-finals at Roland Garros,she would also have beaten Gauffin the final.Sabalenkaapologised to Gauff privatelyand here this week, in true Sabalenka style, it was repeated by means of a TikTok dance, with the caption: “TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together.” But the détente was also wise for both women as they each try to win Wimbledon for the first time.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka reacts after losing to Coco Gauff in the final at Roland Garros, ‘the worst I ever played’.Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPA-EFE“I did what I did. I get what I deserve, I believe,” Sabalenka said, referring to the media fallout “I didn’t want to offend her. I was just completely upset with myself and emotions got over me. I completely lost it. Of course she’s got my respect. She knows it. I’m happy that she was, like: ‘Yeah, it’s all good, don’t worry.’”Gauff, who can become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, was happy to move on. “Obviously some people were critiquing what she said in the speech,” Gauff said. “I didn’t really care about any of that because I know how it feels. I understand what she was trying to say. It was a terrible condition day. I don’t think I was playing well either, so I understood where she was coming from with that. Some of the stuff that was said in the press, I think I was a bit more surprised about.“I’m not someone to hold a grudge. I was talking to my circle about it. I was like: ‘If she apologises I will be fine and we’ll move on.’ She did and she did again when I saw her before we practised [together, at Wimbledon]. It’s water under the bridge. I know Aryna. We got along pretty well anyways before all that happened. It wasn’t very hard to accept that apology.”View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff during a practice session on Court 18 at Wimbledon.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAs the top two seeds at Wimbledon, Sabalenka and Gauff could find themselves on either side of the net in the final. “I would love to face Coco,” Sabalenka said. “Hopefully I will win, then it doesn’t matter what I’m going to say. But I don’t want to lose to show that, guys, I learned the lesson. In this [way] maybe I don’t want to see Coco if I make it to the finals. But if she’s going to be there, I’m happy because I want to get revenge.”Alcaraz, Sinner, Sabalenka and Swiatek top Wimbledon bill but have work cut outRead moreTheirs is not the only spat that has had tongues wagging lately. More than two months after Harriet Dart asked the umpire in Rouen to tell her opponent, Lois Boisson, toput on some deodorantbecause she “smells really bad”, the Briton had to answer more questions about the incident on Saturday, admitting the adverse publicity had hurt.“I’d be lying if [I said] it didn’t affect me a little bit,” Dart said, alluding to “difficulties” off court. “We all make mistakes and I just tried to look forward. I don’t know why we’re still talking about this, it’s been months now. I feel like I answered a lot of the questions that were asked of me and that’s it. I really just want to put it behind me.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Aryna SabalenkaCoco GauffWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

However, they have had a tumultuous buildup to the tournament, where they will aim to defend their title from 2022. The retirement ofthe goalkeeper Mary Earpsandmidfielder Fran Kirby, followed bythe withdrawal of centre-back Millie Bright, for very different reasons, put them at the centre of a storm of intrigue one month out.Where does that leave the team? Despite those absences England’s squad is packed with potential. The return of Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway following knee surgeries this year is a huge boost, despite their limited match action this season. Bright’s absence means there is pressure on Greenwood to be at her best alongside Leah Williamson in central defence.Look down the squad list and the midfield looks somewhat light, with only five players named, including Stanway, who only played 60 minutes of football in 2024-25. “We have to announce it as strikers, midfielders and defenders, but you can move players around into different positions,” said the head coach, Sarina Wiegman. “So it looks like there’s not much depth on paper, but in the team we have enough depth in midfield.”Williamson can play in midfield, as can Maya Le Tissier, or Lauren James, and the former head coach Phil Neville experimented with Lucy Bronze more centrally. However, any of these players being forced to shift positions would be a big departure from a desired starting XI and a test of their adaptability.Can England defend their title? They have a shot. However, having been drawn in the trickiest of groups, with matches against France, then the Netherlands and finally Wales, they will not be afforded time to grow into the tournament. Progressing to the knockout stages having beaten some big names, on the other hand, would benefit the group’s momentum.EnglandThe coachSarina Wiegmanhas a remarkable record in major tournaments, having reached four finals in a row,winning the Euros in 2017 with the Netherlandsandfive years later with England, while getting to two World Cup finals. She heads to Switzerland with a third successive European title in her sights but also perhaps under more pressure than ever. The retirements of Earps and Kirby and subsequent withdrawal of Bright left many asking if all remains sunny in the England camp. Having previously been applauded for her straight-talking style and the clarity it provides for players, her ruthlessness is now raising some concerns. However, if that approach leads England to victory again, the narrative will shift back into it being a positive.Star playerLeah Williamsonoozes star quality and following the withdrawal of Bright, and Greenwood only recently returning from injury, there is more pressure on the Champions League winner to deliver from the back. The 28-year-old is as vital to England’s forward play as she is to their defensive structure and solidity, her incisive passes from deep and driving runs critical to the way England play.Having missed out on the 2023 World Cup following an ACL rupture, the journey back to full fitness and peak performance hasn’t been the smoothest. However,Arsenal’s Champions League triumphshowed the centre-back is back to her best and in the final there was no beating her. “No one ever knows what’s going on behind the scenes,” she said afterwards. “I was only fully fit from illness or injury in November last year. I keep my head down, keep trying my best and keep working.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The treble-winner has 15 caps for England and will start in goal for the holders as well as helping guide the uncapped Khiara Keating and Anna Moorehouse through it. Hampton was winning the battle to be England’s No 1 anyway, with the 24-year-old’s distribution a highlight, but Earp’s presence on the global stage was considerable. Hampton has shown she can perform when it matters, having been preferred to Earps several times, including againstSpain in the Arnold Clark Cupand Nations League. Euro 2025 will pose a greater challenge.Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top flightThe Women’s Super League enters its next phase after one season under WSL Football, the body which took over the running of the top two tiers from the FA in August 2024. Rebranded and with new minimum standards to be introduced, including the Championship (now WSL2) aligning with the top flight in becoming a fully professional league, expectations of next season are high. Arecord five-year broadcast rights dealwas signed with the BBC and Sky Sports in 2024 and is worth £65m plus production costs. Meanwhile growing attendances,spearheaded by Arsenal, and increasing club investments at the top end, such as Alexis Ohanian’s £20m in Chelsea, have put playing in England on the wishlist of many top international players.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandThe sky’s the limit. However, England are in a difficult group. Escaping that will be a feat in itself but, while anything other than winning the tournament will feel disappointing, a semi-final exit would not be a disaster. Things cannot progress upwards in a straight line for ever.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballEngland women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thanks to increased investment in the women’s game, there are now more than 3,000 full-time female players across the continent, and that professionalisation is why my overriding feeling about this summer’s Euros is that the quality is going to be so much higher than we have seen before. And it will be so tight.In Spain, England and Germany there are three strong favourites who are all capable of going on to win it and I would add the Netherlands to the top four. I was so impressed when we [the United States]played the Dutchin December. They will need everybody fit but, on their day, they are a top side. Beyond that, this tournament is going to show the prowess of the Nations League, which was introduced since the most recent Euros, and the impact that tournament is having on equality.We have seen the increased strength in depth of competitive teams in the Nations League, whether it be a resurgent Belgium who have got some real qualities in their side, or Italy who I think are on the rise – and it’s about time – and of course you can never rule out the French. If they manage to get things together they might win a tournament. At the moment you have to talk about France in that next bracket outside the favourites. Can they reach the levels their club teams do? I don’t know, but you cannot overlook them.View image in fullscreenSpain's Esther Gonzalez celebrates after scoring against Portugal in April.Photograph: Miguel Vidal/ReutersTo win this tournament it will take a team, first and foremost, and as a coach you have to work hard to keep everyone connected and feeling valued. I’ve learned that from failures in my career, not just the success of winning a gold medal. You want to make sure that, when you stand at the podium, the player who played no minutes feels a part of it. Do not underestimate the importance of that – the team that gets that right has a great shout of going all the way and winning the final in Basel.A lot of the buildup to this tournament has been dominated by news of the players who are not going to Switzerland, whether that beFrance leaving out Wendie Renardor Fran Kirbybringing forward her retirementfrom international duty after Sarina Wiegman spoke to her honestly about her chances of playing. All 16 head coaches have had to disappoint players. As a coach, these types of conversations are really hard, when you tell someone they are not selected. You can still be kind, but there is no easy way to do it, because you’re giving someone the news they don’t want to hear.In my experience, when you deliver that news, players just want honesty, so being straight-up and direct is the best approach. You have to be able to say: “Look, I’m just giving you a call to let you know that you didn’t make the squad,” and usually I give a rationale behind that, and then you ask if there are any questions. And if there aren’t then it’s best to end the call there and then, because they don’t want to be on the call with you, they want to process it.It’s a little bit like parenting, in many regards; if your child comes home disappointed about something, it’s best not to say, “Oh, but you’re good at maths,” if they are not. Instead I say: “Oh that’s tricky, how does that feel for you?” and you process it because the reality is we all spend our life facing lots of setbacks. So I may have changed some of my style over the years but I always believe in delivering news in a humane way. At the end of delivering news to maybe 15 or 20 players that aren’t picked, you are exhausted, as well as disappointed for them all, but it is part of the job.View image in fullscreenJule Brand is part of a Germany team full of young talents.Photograph: Marco Steinbrenner/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockWe were only allowed to pick 18-player squads for last summer’s Olympics, but that was not the only difference my staff and players faced in France; you played a match every three days. In the World Cup or Euros you are usually playing every four-to-five days and that extra day makes a huge difference in players’ recovery. For the teams in Group D this July – France, England, the Netherlands and Wales – to win the tournament, for example, they would have to play six times in 23 days, and trust me, when players are recovering, every second counts.After an evening game, think about it, these players aren’t going to sleep until 3am, so the day after a game is an absolute wipe-out. For some players it’s a combination of massage, ice-baths and mobility, and with the USA we get cryotherapy chambers and oxygen tanks. For some people it’s just about going for a walk, getting fresh air and sleep, it’s very individualised, but assume matchday+1 is just a write-off. Matchday+2 is usually when the most explosive players feel their body the most, so for a winger, a forward, those Ferrari players who burn the most petrol, phwoar, matchday+2 is tough for their bodies. Now if you add the extra day in-between, you can start your engines again in training and you’re in a much better position.Going back to the teams who might win it I have to say that, at the Olympics, I was very impressed with Germany and their young cohort that have come through. They have now been through their cyclical change and I think this is another German group that is on the rise. They have got players such as Jule Brand, Lea Schüller and Klara Bühl who can cause endless problems. The main question is if they have enough depth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The loss of Millie Bright, to any dressing room, is huge – she’s a leader who will calm a group and also keep them focused. It’s the same with Mary Earps in different capacities. Now it will be interesting to see how England cope if there are any injuries or suspensions – there’s a lack of experience on their bench, which sometimes happens when you’re evolving a team and it’s England’s time to experience that. Not with the starting XI though. In their starters they possess a depth of experience. They will need Lauren Hemp, Alessia Russo and Lauren James to be fit, of course, but it is a high-quality, experienced England team.Spain have a rising star in Clàudia Pina and, in Alexia Putellas, they’ve got a player who is back to her top, top level. Ask any player that plays against Spain and they will say it works your brain so hard. But they can be beaten. Yes, there are differences between Barcelona and Spain, but playing-style wise and methodology-wise there are a lot of similarities – you have to be so deadly in your transitions because you won’t dominate the ball, and you have to accept that and disrupt it in organised ways, which I thought Arsenal did superbly in the Champions League final. Reneé Slegers did an incredible job of setting the team up for that. It showed how it can be done.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamGermany women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

If that is largely down to the 38-year-old’s humility and intelligence, it also reflects her journey’s origins.Fishlock remembers the days when female footballers were unrecognised in public and virtually invisible to the game’s male establishment. It explains why being part of the first Wales Women side to qualify for a major tournament matters so much to a player belying advancing years in the manner of the stylistically not entirely dissimilar Luka Modric.“It’s always nice to be able to do something that’s so much bigger than yourself,” she says in a distinctive hybrid Welsh-US Pacific coast accent, redolent of the ties that have bound her to Seattle Reign for the past 13 years. “Qualifying for these Eurosenables us to cement the legacy we’ve created for future generations. I hope we’ll be able to look back on Switzerland 2025 as something special that changed our nation.”View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock chips the ball over Maria Korenciova of Slovakia to score during the playoffs.Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty ImagesTo appreciate why this milestone transcends sport, a potted history of a slow-burn cultural revolution is required. After all, it was not until 2019 that Wales Women wore shirts bearing their names, rather than just numbers, on the back. Rewind a little further and the country’s non-appearance in the 2005 Euros in England was not about inadequate results. The Football Association of Wales had declined to fund the female squad through the qualifying campaign.Fishlock made her senior debut in 2006. Coincidentally, an odyssey that would lead to her becoming Wales’s record cap holder (162 at the last count) and all-time leading scorer (47 goals) began with a 3-2 defeat in Switzerland at a tiny ground in suburban Zurich. Back then she combined playing for Cardiff with working for a telecoms company but, when her talent was subsequently spotted by the then Dutch champions, AZ Alkmaar, everything changed.At AZ she was sometimes coached by the men’s manager, Louis van Gaal. Fishlock credits him with teaching her the importance of controlling a game’s tempo and helping inspire an eclectic career in which she has won two Champions Leagues, at Frankfurt and Lyon, and collected almost every available domestic honour with Melbourne Victory and Seattle Reign.“I pick the right moments to say: ‘We’re going forward,’ or: ‘We’re going to slow it down,’” she says, in a luxury resort hotel set amid the Vale of Glamorgan’s lush undulating countryside. “My position makes those tempo-setting decisions kind of important. But it’s about the team as a collective being on the same page and recognising those moments.”Fishlock is a big believer in “living in the moment and enjoying it” but her impending presence in Lucerne and St Gallen for Euro 25 group-stage games against the Netherlands, France and England represents the fulfilment of a long cherished ambition. As her American wife, her former Reign teammate Tziarra King, says: “Jess has worked her whole life for this; Euro 2025 means everything to her.”There were moments when the dream seemed near impossible but, after she overcame a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in 2019 and the anguish of losinga World Cup qualification playoff against Switzerlandin the final seconds of extra time in 2022, a watershed arrived 15 months ago. It is no exaggeration to say the appointment of the half-Welsh former Canada defender Rhian Wilkinson as head coach has altered an entire national narrative.View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock celebrates after Wales’s playoff victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin last year.Photograph: Shauna Clinton/Sportsfile/Getty Images“Rhian’s transformed us,” says Fishlock of a coach who won the US’s National Women’s Soccer League in her previous job with Portland Thorns. “I think in the past we haven’t really had a manager that’s believed in us this much but Rhian’s unwavering. She’s raised the bar. From minute one, she introduced a set of non-negotiable standards, wielded the hammer and established whole new expectations. It’s brought the best out in us all. It’s always been an honour and a privilege to represent this country but she’s put us in a spot where we’re now able to compete against top teams.”Fishlock believes that, for too long, Wales were conditioned to accept their supposed limitations. “In the past we would just agree, I guess, that maybe we couldn’t do this or we couldn’t do that but Rhian just doesn’t accept that,” she says. “I think she really, truly, does believe in us. She communicates very clearly and she’s instilled so much confidence. We knew we were good enough but we maybe just had a block. Now you can see us improving. We’ve raised our game; it’s just so exciting.“We’ve had to meet Rhian’s standards; before we, perhaps, never had that challenge. I’m very proud that we’ve risen to it together. It hasn’t always been easy, we’ve had downs, but all of us have been pleasantly surprised by what we’ve been able to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve broken through several ceilings – now we have to burst a big one.”It helps that Wilkinson tailors differing formations and starting XIs to specific opponents. “Our flexibility could surprise people this summer,” says Fishlock. “A lot of our squad can play different positions and read the game very well. That’s crucial; I think it will be key to our success.”Like her former Reign teammate Megan Rapinoe, she has long campaigned for human rights and social justice and was awarded an MBE for services to women’s football and the LGBT community in 2018.View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock feels Wales have raised their game under Rhian Wilkinson.Photograph: AFF/AlamyFor the moment, though, the arguments she invariably calibrates as expertly as her measured through balls are on hold. “It’s really important not to be ignorant of what’s going on in the world,” says Fishlock. “But right now it’s also very important to remember we’re here to concentrate on doing our jobs in Switzerland.Additional focus is provided by the men’s team’s manager, Craig Bellamy. “Craig and I have had a number of good conversations,” she says. “He’s a big supporter of our team and he cares so much about our country. Welsh people are very passionate; we’re very different from the English, we’re not frightened to come forward and say how we feel and what we think. It’s about how small but proud we are as a nation.”The precedent set by the men’s team in reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2016 serves as a lodestar. “Our squad takes huge inspiration from that, and from every Welsh sporting achievement,” Fishlock says. “But now it’s up to us. We’ve got to get to Switzerland, get out of the group and write our own story.”Explore more on these topicsWales women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The complicated bit came first and involved being drawn in the same group as England and France: Sweden ultimately finished third despite drawing twice with the European champions. That led to the simple bit: a playoff where Serbia were taken apart 8-0 on aggregate.After that came a mixed Nations League campaign. Denmark were beaten home and away, Sweden scoring eight goals over two matches. Wales proved a harder nut to crack, with Rhian Wilkinson’s team coming away with two 1-1 draws.Given that every match was competitive the head coach, Peter Gerhardsson, could not afford to rotate his squad much. For example, going into the game against Norway on 26 June, there was only one goalkeeper available with international experience: Jennifer Falk. The two back-ups, Tove Enblom and Emma Holmgren, are yet to play at senior level.Gerhardsson, however, was unconcerned. “I don’t know if it really matters,” he said. “If one of them had played and conceded a lot of goals, that selection might have backfired – and then you’d have to take that result with you into the Euros.”In general Sweden have been fortunate with injuries but during the final camp Arsenal’s Rosa Kafaji withdrew with a foot injury and in the big win against Denmark in early June, the Barcelona star Fridolina Rolfö also suffered a foot injury. On 9 June Barça said the player had suffered ligament damage but Sweden’s medical team are confident she will be fit for the opening fixture against Denmark on 4 July.The key midfielder is Real Madrid’s Filippa Angeldahl, Gerhardsson’s trusted general on the pitch, and she contributes with her fair share of goals. Nathalie Björn and Magdalena Eriksson are reliable choices at centre-back, while on the right, Hanna Lundkvist has become first-choice but she is now facing competition from the youngster Smilla Holmberg.Up front, the attacking trio of Rolfö, Stina Blackstenius and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd will once again lead the line, having proved their consistency for some time now.The coachThis is a special tournament for the head coach,Peter Gerhardsson, his last in charge. He will be replaced by the former Australia head coach, Tony Gustavsson, after Euro 2025.Originally from Uppsala and a former top-flight player for Hammarby, Gerhardsson has been in charge since 2017. In nearly eight years he has led Sweden to two World Cup bronze medals, an Olympic silver and a European Championship semi-final. He also walked into a broom cupboard after a press conference at the 2023 World Cup, to everyone’s amusement, a moment immortalised bythe Guardian cartoonist David Squires. Gerhardsson was delighted: “For me, who liked cartoons when I grew up, that was big. It can’t be easy to feature in a Guardian cartoon. I managed that without even trying! I felt: ‘Damn, that’s fun.’ The fact that they were poking fun at me I don’t care about. I am who I am. I try to be honest to myself so here I am, that has pros and cons. You have to take that.”Star playerJohanna Rytting Kaneryd. Sweden have several high-profile players, such as Stina Blackstenius and Fridolina Rolfö, but Chelsea’s Rytting Kaneryd was trusted by her club coach Sonia Bompastor during the 2024-25 season and was named Sweden’s footballer of the year for 2024-25. She played a key role in Chelsea’s domestic treble and was one of Sweden’s most important players in both the Euro qualifiers and the Nations League. She is best known for her speed and fearless one-on-one play down the flank. As Magdalena Eriksson said: “As a former left-back I can just say that she’s a full-back’s worst nightmare.”One to watchThe 18-year-old full-backSmilla Holmbergis one of the most exciting and intriguing players in the squad. Holmberg and another youngster, her Hammarby teammate Ellen Wangerheim, both have huge potential. But while Wangerheim has been linked with several big clubs abroad it has been relatively quiet for Holmberg. That might be about to change. She made an impressive debut against Italy in the Nations League and if she continues on the same path most clubs will want her. A fearless full-back who is not afraid to attack, she is also remarkably composed in defence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It produces talented players who frequently move on to top international leagues. However in recent years the Swedish league has lost some status globally – a challenge currently being addressed in Sweden to keep pace with the rapidly growing major leagues. The league is officially classed as professional but some aspects are more semi-professional. Many players have other jobs alongside their playing careers. There is a lot of talent coming through, including Häcken’s Felicia Schröder, as well as the Hammarby duo Wangerheim and Holmberg.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandSweden are traditionally a strong tournament team. They should advance from the group, though Germany will be a tough opponent. A potential quarter-final against England or France would be a major obstacle and it’s reasonable to think that the journey will end there.The Sweden team guide was written by Ella Lindvall forFotbollskanalen.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's Euro 2025Sweden women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It leaves the Lions with only two fit scrum-halves, one of whom – Jamison Gibson-Park – has been managing a strained glute muscle.Farrell said Gibson-Park would be fit to face the Queensland Reds on Wednesday but the Lions will need some cover if Williams is ruled out even for a short period, with Alex Mitchell as the only available option in the position. White has just arrived in New Zealand, where Scotland are due to kick off their summer tour against the Maori All Blacks next Saturday, and could easily hop on a plane to Brisbane if required.For the moment, Farrell is still waiting to learn the severity of the injury to Williams, the Premiership’s player of the season with Gloucester. “There was plenty of cramp last week, let’s hope it is one of those,” said Farrell. “He was playing well and I am sure there is a bit of concern there, but you can only deal with the here and now so fingers crossed.”View image in fullscreenHenry Pollock looks on from the bench after being shown a yellow card.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesFarrell, however, is adamant that there is no danger of Gibson-Park sitting out the Reds game. “Jamison is fit and ready to go and has been training fully for the best part of a week. We are happy with that but we will only know [about Williams] in the morning.“I don’t what the timings are of that, with the flights, but you have to let these things settle down and give it a little bit of space.

His show of reinvigorated strength could not have sat in starker contrast than with the frustration and disappointment ofMax Verstappen, whose seventh place in what he called an “undriveable” car will only have fuelled speculation about the defending world champion leaving Red Bull.That was addressed by theRed Bullteam principal, Christian Horner, after qualifying. “It’s a lot of noise, I think Max gets quite annoyed by it,” he said. “We’re very clear with the contract that we have with Max until 2028. Anything is entirely speculative that is being said. We tend not to pay too much attention to it.”F1: Lando Norris on pole for Austrian GP with Max Verstappen down in seventh – as it happenedRead moreFor Norris this was the perfect comeback after his huge disappointment at having to retire when hecrashed into his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, at the last round in Canada. Moreover, he did it with no little style and conviction. His margin of 0.521sec over the second-placed Ferrari of Charles Leclerc was an absolute chasm over the short lap at the Red Bull Ring, with Piastri in third, albeit with the Australian’s final quick lap stymied by a late yellow flag.View image in fullscreenMcLaren’s Lando Norris on his way to pole position, ahead of Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc.Photograph: Dénes Erdős/APIt seems unlikely Piastri would have matched Norris even then, so in control was the 25-year-old. It was a performance he badly needed after his title hopes took a battering when he made the misjudged move against Piastri in Montreal, dropping him to 22 points behind the Australian.Norris was understandably pleased. “It was easily my best qualifying of the year from a delivery point of view, from every single lap I did,” he said. “On delivery, consistency and putting it in when it counts in Q3, was easily the best lap I’ve done for this whole season.”Norris had talked up the notion that his error had ultimately resulted in a positive outcome, that he and the team emerged stronger now the seemingly unavoidable clash with Piastri had happened. This is credible, but it is still inescapable that misjudgments like that in Canada could cost him the title. For all the psychological compartmentalising and rationalisations, it must weigh heavy.He acknowledged he could not afford to continue to make mistakes. In Austria, there were none, with a series of laps that were all but untouchable.Quick GuideAustrian F1 GP qualifyingShow1. Lando Norris (McLaren) 1min 03.971sec2.

They have been seeking to find a way to adjust the car to suit Norris and their first major upgrades of the season applied here – to the front and rear aero and, crucially for Norris, the front suspension, to improve the feel he has for the front of the car – look to have paid off.“It was the most confident and comfortable I’ve been in terms of getting lap time out of the car ,” he said. “It showed that when I have those feelings, I can have a day like today. It shows the feelings I’ve been requiring, the feelings I’ve not been getting as easily, when they are more of my way and more where I want them to be, I can put in better performances.”It remains early days and consistency is key, as Norris emphasised, but if he genuinely has the McLaren where he wants it, as appears to be the case in Spielberg, it could become an electrifying title fight.View image in fullscreenRed Bull’s Max Verstappen struggled during qualifying.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/ReutersIt is a fight Verstappen increasingly appears to be left observing from the sidelines. Unhappy and clearly frustrated, he described his car as so lacking in grip in every type of corner that it was “completely undriveable”. His dissatisfaction was increased because Red Bull had brought what is likely to be their last major upgrade of the season to the race. It was hoped a revision to the floor of the car would help address the balance problems that have plagued it all year but prompted Verstappen to say: “It’s even worse than before.”Less death, more social media: Formula One films decades apart reveal a changed world | Emma JohnRead moreHis seventh place was unlucky to an extent, as like Piastri he was forced to back off because of the late yellow flag, but he had not looked like troubling the McLarens at any stage and admitted he would still have been “miles off pole”.All of which will doubtless fuel further speculation about his future, which has already dominated this weekend. The Mercedes team principal,Toto Wolff, confirmedhe was once more interested in persuading the world champion to join his team.Verstappen refused to comment on this on Friday but with resources already almost all shifted to the new 2026 cars the pecking order and form are likely to be more or less settled from here on in and Red Bull remain off the pace being comprehensively set by McLaren.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneLando NorrisMax VerstappenMcLarenMercedes GPRed BullMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Hills took out his licence in 1969 and by the time he retired from the training ranks in 2011 had sent out more than 3,000 winners, including two victors in both the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas, a St Leger hero in Moonax and a Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe winner in Rheingold.Hills was also father to the retired Classic-winning jockeys Michael and Richard, while his son Charlie took over at the family’s Faringdon Place yard and has enjoyed a string of big-race victories. Another son, George, is involved in bloodstock insurance.His eldest son, John, was also a successful trainer before his death from cancerin June 2014, with the pair memorably battling it out in the 1994 Leger, when Moonax fended off Broadway Flyer by a length and a quarter.In a post on his X account, Charlie Hills said: “Gone but will never be forgotten #dad.”A statement from the British Horseracing Authority read: “All of us at the BHA are saddened to learn of the death of Barry Hills and send our deepest condolences to his family and friends at this sad time. Barry’s contribution to racing was immense and he will rightly be remembered as one of the great figures of our sport.”View image in fullscreenMoonax wins the 1994 St Leger from Broadway Flyer.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockRichard Hills rode as retained rider for Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum’s Shadwell operation, whose successes with father Barry included Ghanaati in the 1000 Guineas. Shadwell’s long-serving racing manager, Angus Gold, lauded Hills’ dedication to his craft following many years spent in the upper echelons of the training ranks.“For many, many years we were lucky enough to have horses with him and what a great man, you don’t need me to tell you the success he made of his life and career,” Gold said. “He was a great trainer who was totally dedicated and lived for the sport. He was an incredibly shrewd man and a great judge of a horse and their capabilities from just watching them on the gallops.“He was a fascinating man to be with and great fun. He was one of the greats in my lifetime and I learned a lot from him and even a month ago he was spotting things out on the gallops and still loved it even though he had given up the licence.”Before taking out his training licence, Hills rode nine winners as an apprentice and spent 10 years learning his trade as head lad with John Oxley before striking out on his own, saddling his first winner, La Dolce Vita at Thirsk, in April 1969.His first Group One winner followed in 1971 while Rheingold’s Arc victory in 1973 provided consolation after being beaten just a short head in the previous year’s Derby – one of four Epsom runners-up for Hills, who never managed to land the blue riband.Newmarket proved a happier hunting ground though, with Enstone Spark (1978) and Ghanaati (2009) landing the 1,000 Guineas, while Tap On Wood (1979) and Haafhd (2004) prevailed in the 2,000.While Epsom Derby glory eluded him, Sir Harry Lewis won the Irish version in 1987 and he also bagged the Irish Oaks and 1,000 Guineas twice during an illustrious career.Hills announced his retirement in August 2011 after overcoming serious illnesses, including throat cancer, but he did make a brief return to training on a temporary licence in 2014 after the death of John.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

Soon there will be curfews, banning people from turning on their taps, as happens in Italy. Standpipes will sprout on the side of parched roads where trees once stood.Rivers will run dry and rural communities will begin digging wells in response to a water apocalypse destined to arrive courtesy of the ravaging effect of climate change.The water companies argue that major investment is needed to cope with the changing weather patterns, with those funds primarily channelled into building massive new infrastructure.They are happy to carry out the work, as long as payment is charged directly to customers.It is what we might call the HS2 fallacy. Except that rather than build a high-speed line to increase the rail capacity between London and Birmingham when other much less sexy options were available at much lower cost, we find ourselves agreeing to construct reservoirs as tall as high-rise buildings.Importantly, the assets boost the balance sheets of privatised water companies, because while billpayers will have funded the projects, the shareholders will own the new infrastructure.Last week a group of experts tookThames Waterto court to try to persuade a judge that an alternative to one reservoir, near Abingdon in Oxfordshire, is not only possible but presents a much more sustainable and cheaper option for customers,and that this needs to be tested in a public inquiry.At the heart of the argument is a dispute about how to manage Britain’s water resources, with campaigners urging a move away fromgrands projetsto something more humdrum, allowing for the money to be spent instead on cleaning up rivers polluted in the first place by ThamesWateret al.However, what Thames and its consultant friends appear to want, like so many in the infrastructure game, isan edifice you can see from space.Nine new reservoirs are at the heart of this plan and some will have walls to hold in the water that are the height of the average house. The reservoir destined to replace farmers’ fields near Abingdon will have walls 25 metres high.They are destined for the south and east ofEngland, where population numbers are increasing and dry summers scorch the earth.Politicians have backed the plans, and it is easy to see why. Britain has failed to build reservoirs over the last 40 years, and who doesn’t like a nice lake to look at?Reservoirs are cheap and easy to build when they are situated in a valley and the river that runs through it is capped at one end. The ground should be impermeable, which usually means clay sits under the water.Unfortunately at Abingdon there is what can only be described as a puddle of clay, which is why the reservoir must sit on top, with skyscraper walls all around. A reservoir planned for Lincolnshire will likewise have 13-metre walls because the clay layer there is so thin.Much of the south is dominated by chalk and gravel, so is unsuitable for reservoirs. Land that has clay that has already been built on – London, for example.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The anti-reservoir campaigners say this aquifer water, and that of the slow-moving lower reaches of rivers that feed the Thames, such as the Lea, can be extracted with no environmental harm.The problem for CPRE, formerly the Council for the Protection of Rural England, and the campaign group Saferwaters, which are backing the campaign, is that Thames Water is working with the grain of people’s emotions. Reservoirs good, aquifers and river extraction bad.Climate change, though, means wetter winters and drier summers. So aquifers fill up in the winter and suffer little evaporation in the summer, while reservoirs suffer huge losses during hot days, especially when the new ones must pump water uphill from nearby rivers, are relatively shallow and with a large surface area.Thames Water relies on forecasts that show 2 million more people will live in London and the south-east by 2050, and when taking into account the depletion of other water sources from climate change, it will need to find an extra 1bn litres of water every day.The Environment Agency’s figures, though, show a steep decline in water use, much of that related to the switch from water-hungry oil, gas and coal power stations to renewables such as solar power. Again, we might have an attachment to old-fashioned ways of generating energy, but renewables have many benefits, including water use.Another arrow in the campaigners’ quiver relates to leakages. Why, they ask, is Thames being asked to cut its leakage rate by 50% to 11.4% by 2050 when water suppliers in Germany have already cut the rate to about 7%?Reservoirs let Thames off the hook. The company should be spending money plugging leaks and preventing sewage spewing into rivers. Instead, it is asked to embark on projects paid for by customers that boost its asset base. What’s not to like, from the water company’s point of view?The government should be more sceptical. There is a price to be paid and voters will not be kind when higher bills fall through their letterbox.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterEconomics viewpointWater industryWaterOxfordshireEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Do not, under any circumstances whatsoever, make fun of Vice-PresidentJD Vanceby sharing one of the millions ofunflattering memesdedicated to him. Don’t you dare chuckle at the images of him looking like the “lollipop kid” in Shrek (the resemblance is uncanny) or a chicken nugget. And, whatever you do, do not share the meme that you can findhere, where he looks like a big bald baby. You risk hurting the poor man’s feelings and, also, you might get kicked out of the country.So says a 21-year-old Norwegian called Mads Mikkelsen, anyway. Mikkelsen recently accused American border officials of denying him entry into the US because he had a meme of a bloated baby Vance saved on his phone. Mikkelsen, who had travelled to the US to visit friends, told the Norwegian paperNordlysthat immigration officers at Newark airport interrogated him, forced him to give fingerprints and blood samples, and went through his phone. After they found the Vance meme, as well as a picture of Mikkelsen holding a homemade wooden pipe, they sent him home.“Both pictures had been automatically saved to my camera roll from a chat app, but I really didn’t think that these innocent pictures would put a stop to my entry into the country,” Mikkelsen told Nordlys.Why does this billionaire have 100 kids in 12 countries? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hasrejected Mikkelsen’s claimthat he was kicked out of the country for disrespecting the vice-president. “FACT CHECK. Claims that Mads Mikkelsen was denied entry because of a meme are unequivocally FALSE,” theyposted on Facebookearlier in the week. “TRUTH: Mikkelsen was refused entry into the US for his admitted drug use.”A homeland security assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, alsocalled the story “BS”in a post on X.Mikkelsen, meanwhile, insisted to thefact-checking website Snopesthat the meme played a role in getting him denied entry. The 21-year-old claimed border officials told him he was getting sent home because of “extremist propaganda [the meme] and narcotic paraphernalia”. However, that claim hasn’t been verified.We may never know if the Vance meme really did play a role in getting Mikkelsen kicked out of the country. While I don’t normally side with border officials, one imagines the pipe picture was probably the actual culprit. Still, the story, which made headlines around the world, won’t helpAmerica’s tourism industry. International visitors are staying out of the US after a spate of stories about tourists getting sent to Ice detention centerswithout any explanation. The World Travel & Tourism Council has said the country could lose $12.5bn ininternational visitor spendingthis year.The story has also reignited interest in JD Vance memes, which have been circulating for months now, peaking at end of February after the vice-presidentscoldedVolodymyr Zelenskyy in an exchange that launcheda million memes. Indeed, the Irish lawmaker Ivana Bacik recently held up the Vance baby meme while speaking in the Irish parliament aboutthe Mikkelsen story.While claims that making fun of Mr Hillbilly Elegy may get you deported might be exaggerated, the fact that so many people immediately believed Mikkelsen’s claims is a sign of just how badly the US’s international image has been damaged and how dystopian the country has become. The US is heading veryquickly towards authoritarianism. It is cracking down ondissent and protest. Book banning has surged and theTrump administrationhas instructed the Department of Education toend their investigationsinto these bans, calling them a “hoax”. Free speech rightsare being shredded.And the people responsible for all this? They’re not evil geniuses, they’re embarrassing dweebs with massively meme-able faces. “I knew that one day we might have to watch as capitalism and greed and bigotry led to a world where powerful men, deserving or not, would burn it all down,” Rebecca Shaw said in aGuardian piece earlier this year. “What I didn’t expect, and don’t think I could have foreseen, is how incrediblycringeit would all be.”Immigrants in the US are worried about getting deported if they report domestic violence“The Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, a national network of advocates for those hurt by domestic violence, found that 75% of the 170 advocates they surveyed across the country said the immigrants they serve fear they’ll face arrest or deportation if they contact authorities,”reports USA Today. Meanwhile the Fox News host Jesse Waters seems to think all this is hilarious. “I bet a bunch of guys that are dating illegal alien Spanish girls are like Ice, here’s the address! She hasn’t been very good,”Watters recently said. In related news, a man wasrecently arrestedfor allegedly impersonating an Ice officer and sexually assaulting a woman, saying he’d deport her if she didn’t comply.Nato chief says he doesn’t actually consider Trump ‘Daddy’Mark Rutte made a weird statement in which he referred to Trump as ‘Daddy’ andthen quickly walked it back.Michigan lawmaker says he doesn’t support a woman’s autonomy over her own bodySpeaking at an office hours event, the Michigan representative Karl Bohnak (a Republican), said “I don’t” aftera constituent asked him, “So you don’t support a woman’s autonomy over her own body?”Supreme court paves way for red states to defund Planned ParenthoodThe case, Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, “is part of a longstanding effort by anti-abortion activists to ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood by cutting it out of Medicaid”,the Guardian reports. “Of the 2.4 million people treated at Planned Parenthood each year, almost half use Medicaid.”Armenia’s prime minister offers to show his penis to religious leaderThe prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan,told his Facebook followersthat he was prepared to expose himself to the head of the Armenian church, to prove they were wrong that he had been circumcised.

Generous public spacesRhiannon Lucy CosslettHaving a child makes you see cities differently. We deserve better than shuttered playgrounds and locked paddling poolsSat 28 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 12.13 EDTShareThere’s nothing like a boiling hot summer with an energetic small child to make you acutely aware of the need for outdoor space. We are lucky to have a garden, albeit an overgrown one that isn’t exactly child-friendly, so, like many parents, we mostly rely on public space in order for him to play and get the huge amount of exercise he needs. And, if you are able-bodied, there’s nothing like having a child to make youlook at public spacesdifferently.Steps instead of ramps. A lack of benches on which to feed a baby, or give a toddler their snack. No shade. No access to toilets or changing tables. Nowhere to fill up a water bottle. No fences or gates dividing pedestrianised space from a busy road, or a deep body of water, or myriad other hazards. These are just some of the things that start to matter. Before your eyes, the urban environment becomes transformed and often inhospitable. Things such as locked playgrounds (I’m looking at you, Camden council – Falkland Place playground has been closed for literally months at this point) have the potential to ruin your morning. In a heatwave, broken splash pads and locked paddling pools (most recent personal disappointments include Brighton and Leamington Spa) feel like acts of particular cruelty.It’s no wonder, then, that the privatised “public” spaces that have become common across cities, all of which share a certain slick homogeneity, start to feel appealing. Before I had a child, I disliked the new development atCoal Drops Yardin London’s King’s Cross. Walking around it when it reopened, it felt cold and dystopian. That, though, was before the people arrived. Now it feels safe, lively and vibrant, full of children shrieking with delight as they run in and out of the Granary Square fountains. It’s a child-friendly space that isn’t child-dominated: from the food market to the outdoor cinema to the students practising dances and drinking tinnies by the canal, it feels happily communal.But in the UK, actual public, child-friendly space, as opposed to “pseudo-public space” created from private investment, such as the King’s Cross redevelopment, is very much a postcode lottery. The first play fountains I ever encountered – in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester, which had been redesigned ahead of the Commonwealth Games in 2002 – used to be fantastic, but for years now this has been an areadogged by antisocial behaviour. Promises of redevelopment have stalled because ofbudgeting issues. The city deserves better.In Spain, a chat on the doorstep is a custom worth preserving in the digital age | María RamírezRead moreAs temperatures increase, we should look to the continent for inspiration. Although I hoped that the increased focus on public space during the pandemic would result in more pedestrianised areas containing outdoor seating and greater investment in outdoor spaces, that hasn’t always materialised. We may never have the weather, or national temperament, that turns us into thesort of societythat revolves around a piazza, but the Spanish and Italian models for public space and how they integrate children’s play with adult socialising, such as those lovely shaded playgrounds fringed with bar and cafe tables that have so impressed tourists they have become asocial media phenomenon, are inspiring.To an extent, they exist that way because there’s a recognition that the middle of the day is too hot for kids to play outside, and so the evenings become a time for everyone, with spaces blurred between adult drinking and dining, and children’s play and exercise. That is increasingly becoming the case here, too. It feels as though it’s becoming more common to see children in the playground until quite late in the evening, so why not start to incorporate urban design around the adults who care for them?I am not one of those people who thinks that everything is better in other countries. Just today I was reading the comments under a video about Italian children crashing out late at night in their prams while the grownups socialised. The now-adults were reflecting on how much, as children, they disliked that, how they didn’t actually want to play out in the piazza until midnight, they just wanted a nice, quiet bed to lie in. Meanwhile, I’m doing my son’s bedtime routine at 7pm when it’s still light outside. Surely there has to be a middle ground, a public space that caters to both adults and children during the light evenings that feels safe and inclusive?After all, heatwaves are only going to get more and more common.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

If any president was going to break this presidential norm,as NPR put it, it was always going to be Donald Trump.“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing,” the president told a group of reporters this week. “Do you understand that?” he asked, before storming off.It appears to be the first time a president has deliberately used the F-word live on camera to a press scrum or in a public forum, instead of being “caught” using the term accidentally on a hot mic (even that has only happened a handful of times). Cue plenty of puns from journalists about the “dropping of the F-bomb”.For the record, Trump actuallyused the F-word about Iran in 2020, but the slightly delayed radio broadcast bleeped it out. Plus, asthis 2016 video compilation shows, it’s not unusual for him to swear.But what was different about this time – coming as it did at a moment of heightened global anxiety about military escalation – is that it came across as … authentic. Many people watching will have felt, heard and even shared that frustration about Israel and Iran’s alleged breaking of the ceasefire. Trump’s swearing made the point more forcefully than any diplomatic “disappointment” could have done. It wasn’t eloquent, but I believed it.We know other presidents – such as Lyndon Johnson, and especially Richard Nixon – swore in private. They wouldn’t have dreamed of risking the reputational damage to do so in public, and would have had to apologise if they did. No British prime minister has ever said “fuck” publicly to my knowledge. Few world leaders ever have.1:02Trump swears in outburst at Israel and Iran over ceasefire violations – videoWhich is potentially part of the problem. The most common complaint about the political elite is that they’re out of touch; that we can’t trust a word that comes out of their mouths because it’s all untrustworthy scripted spin. Yet at the same time we believe they’re swearing like sailors – and saying what they really think – behind closed doors (a perception bolstered by iconic roles such asPeter Capaldi’s Malcolm Tucker, the foul-mouthed spin doctor in The Thick of It, or the blue-mouthed Roger Furlong from Veep.)Of course, swearing doesn’t equate to honesty. And, in Trump’s case, the obscenity only masked his own complicity in creating the situation that frustrated him – from pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 to his “monumental” airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. But my point is that the public clearly doesn’t trust the polished and sanitised scripts that characterise so much political speech.I’m not suggesting world leaders all suddenly disrespect the gravitas of their office. Can you imagine Keir Starmer being encouraged to swear? He’d sound like a headteacher attempting to rap. What I am saying is there’s power in judicious swearing.You want to appear more human to voters? Act more like one. YouGov polling reported in April revealed that just8% of Britons never swear. Perhaps an occasional curse or two would allow politicians to ally themselves with the 92% of us who do.Linguistic norms are always changing. For six years, I wrote aregular columnfor the Guardian’s Mind your language section. During that time, I saw changes that would incense any purist. For instance, the BBC made even less use of those with received pronunciation accents and started broadcasting more voices that really sound like people across the country. Such “real” accents are supposed to make the institution seem less remote and more trustworthy. The same is true of the institution of politics. Sounding more like real people does nobody any real harm.If the stakes are literally life and death, and people aren’t listening, a well-placed, truly meant expletive will wake everyone up. At time of writing, the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding. Maybe the F-bomb did the job after all.Gary Nunn is a freelance journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

I’ll furnish the war,” was the storied response of the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst to Frederic Remington after the illustrator was sent to Cuba to cover an insurrection and cabled back to the boss that there was little going on.Much has changed since that famous (if true) exchange of the late 19th century, in the heyday of sensationalism known as yellow journalism.But one thing that hasn’t changed is that there’s nothing like military conflict to capture the attention of the public, with plenty of help from the media. And the media – whether a tabloid newspaper or a cable news network – benefits, too.These days,Donald Trump’s recent strike on Iranhas proved the point once again, with the media’s attention intensely focused onOperation Midnight Hammer, as it was dramatically dubbed.The mainstream media has enabled Trump’s war on universities | Jason StanleyRead moreFirst the emphasis was on the threat of attacks toIran’s budding nuclear arsenal, then on the possibility of all-out global war, then on the strikes themselves and then the announcement of a supposed ceasefire.All to the greater glory of Trump, at least as he tells it.For those who are trying to bring public attention to other important matters – even matters of life and death – that’s a frustrating reality.Jennifer Mascia knows this all too well.She is a founding reporter forthe Trace,a non-profit news site dedicated to tracking the epidemic of gun violence in America and trying to do something about it, through exploring solutions.Whenelected officials in Minnesota were shotearlier this month – the former state House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and the state legislator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded – it was a huge story.Huge, but fleeting.“Pitted against a global conflict, domestic news doesn’t really stand a chance,” said Mascia, who previously contributed to the now-defunct Gun Report at the New York Times, begun by the then columnist Joe Nocera.That’s true for domestic news that, in an earlier era, would have commanded the media’s attention for many days, if not weeks. The Minnesota violence was even more newsworthy because of an early manhunt and disinformation swirling around the apparent assassin’s political leanings.Still, coverage seemed to disappear in the blink of an eye.“The Trump era has all but ensured that important news will get smacked out of the news cycle in favor of the latest development in Trumpworld,” Mascia wrote to me in an email, after we had talked by phone.Mascia is quick to clarify that she’s not suggesting that the media ignore what the chaotic president is doing.“It’s important that we cover Trump’s constitutional breaches. We shouldn’t become numb or complacent in the face of eroding democracy,” she said.But it was remarkable to see how quickly the Minnesota shootings faded from media attention. A CNN contributor herself, Mascia is often called in to provide perspective for “Day Two” of coverage after the initial reporting of gun-related news. But often these days, she notes, thereisno Day Two.By then, the media has moved on.“Maybe if the Israel-Iran war wasn’t going on, we’d still be talking about it,” she said. “Anderson Cooper would be broadcasting from Melissa Hortman’s funeral. But instead, he’s in Tel Aviv.”And, of course, this extends to all sorts of other subjects, not just gun violence.Those who try to focus attention on voting rights, the rule of law, crucial supreme court decisions, widespread citizen action such as the vast “No Kings” protests – to mention just a few – may get a modicum of attention.But nothing compares to a show of military force. And Trump, always attuned to how he’s being perceived, is well aware of that.“A spectacular military success,” he crowed after the strikes. “A historic success,” echoed his defense secretary. Pete Hegseth couldn’t countenance being asked actual questions and claimed the press was trying to distort the story “for their own political reasons to try to hurt President Trump or our country”.Was the administration’s bragging accurate? Perhaps not, said intelligence reports that indicated the strikes may have only added months to the time Iran needs to produce the material for a nuclear weapon.But no matter.The strikes – from the lead-up to the aftermath – sucked up all the oxygen in the media universe for many days.Even by Thursday early afternoon, the top four news articles (plus one photo) on the Washington Post mobile app, for example, were Iran-related.And Fox News, of course, remained largely a cheering section.Whatever the effect on world peace, military conflict sure is good for ratings, as William Randolph Hearst knew in his bones.“Historians point to the Spanish-American war as the first press-driven war,” noted a PBS article accompanying the film Crucible of Empire.It wouldn’t be the last.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS press and publishingOpinionUS politicsIranDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Never before in modern history have those with the fate of the world in their hands been so old. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are both 72. Narendra Modi is 74,Benjamin Netanyahu75, Donald Trump 79, and Ali Khamenei is 86.Thanks to advances in medical science, people are able to lead longer, more active lives – but we are now also witnessing a frightening number of political leaders tightening their grip on power as they get older, often at the expense of their younger colleagues.This week, at their annual summit, the leaders of Nato – including Emmanuel Macron and Mette Frederiksen (both 47), Giorgia Meloni (48) and Pedro Sánchez (53) –were forced to swallowTrump’s demand for increased military spending. The average age of Nato heads of state is 60. Germany’s Friedrich Merz is 69, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is 71.All bowed to a new5% defence spending target– an arbitrary figure, imposed without serious military reasoning or rational debate, let alone serious democratic debate at home. It was less policy, more deference to the whims of a grumpy patriarch. Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte – himself just 58 – went so far as tocall Trump “Daddy”. That’s not diplomacy. That’s submission.This generational clash plays out in other arenas. Ukraine’s 47-year-old president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is resisting the imperial ambitions of septuagenarian Putin. Septuagenarian Xi eyes a Taiwan led by a president seven years his junior. Netanyahu, three-quarters of a century old, is overseeing devastation in Gaza, where almosthalf the population is under 18. In Iran an 86 year old rules over a population withan average age of 32. Cameroon’s Paul Biya, 92, has been in power since 1982 in a country where themedian age is 18and life expectancyjust 62.There is no gerontocratic conspiracy at work here – no senior citizens’ club bent on global domination. But there is something disturbing about a world being dismantled by the very people whose lives were defined by its postwar architecture. Khamenei was six when the second world war ended.Trump was born in 1946, the year the United Nationsheld its first general assembly. Netanyahu was born a year after Israel was founded. Modi was born in 1950, as India became a republic. Putin entered the world in October 1952, months before Stalin died. Xi in June 1953, just after. And Erdoğan was born in 1954, two years afterTurkey joined Nato. These men are the children of the postwar world – and as they near the end of their lives, they seem determined to tear it down. It almost looks like revenge.Dylan Thomas urged usto “Rage, rage against the dying of the light”. Rarely has the line felt so literal.Yes, the rules-based international order was always messier in practice than on paper. But at least the ideal existed. There was a shared moral framework – shaky, yes, but sincere – built on the conviction that humanity must never repeat the atrocities of the first half of the 20th century and that dialogue and diplomacy were better. That conviction has now evaporated, not least in the minds of those who should cherish it most.This is an unprecedented moment. The architects of the previous global disorder – Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Mao – were all in their 30s or 40s when they rose to power. A new generation built a new world, and lived with its consequences. Today, that new world is being unmade by an old generation – one that will not live to see the wreckage it leaves behind. It’s easier to shout “drill, baby, drill” when you’re statistically unlikely to experience the worst of climate collapse. Après nous le déluge, as the French say.You might think that a generation so fortunate to benefit from longevity would leave behind a legacy of care, gratitude and global stewardship. Instead, we are witnessing the worst resurgence of repression, violence, genocide, ecocide and contempt for international law in decades – waged, more often than not, by ruthless septuagenarians and octogenarians who appear more interested in escaping prosecution than preserving peace.But it doesn’t have to be this way.After leaving office, Nelson Mandela foundedthe Elders, a network of former world leaders working to promote peace, justice and human rights. Inspired by African traditions of consensus and elder wisdom, the Elders are an example of how age can bring clarity, compassion and conscience – not just clout.The problem isn’t old age. It’s how some have chosen to wield it. The world doesn’t need more ageing strongmen clinging to power. It needs elders who are willing to let go – and guide. The kind who think about legacy not as personal glory, but as the world they leave behind. In this age of age, what we need is not domination, but wisdom. And that, in the end, is what separates a ruler from a leader.David Van Reybrouck is philosopher laureate for the Netherlands and Flanders.

The Hungarian national was marching with her daughter, Zsófi, 23, who had travelled from her home in Barcelona to join the rally.After the ruling Fidesz party, led by the rightwing populist Orbán,fast-trackeda law that made it an offence to hold or attend events that involve the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors, many Hungarians vowed to show their disapproval by attending Pride for the first time.Viki Márton was among those who had made good on the promise, turning up with her nine-year-old daughter.The pair had come equipped with hats, water spray, and a swimsuit, more worried about heat than rightwing protesters. “I want her to see the reality,” said Márton. “And I’m so excited to be here!”View image in fullscreenTens of thousands of Hungarians took to the streets on Saturday, despite Orbán’s warning on Friday that those who attend or organise the march will face ‘legal consequences’.Photograph: János Kummer/Getty ImagesEarlier this month, police announced theywould follow the government’s ordersand ban the march. The progressive mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, was swift to respond, saying that the march would instead go ahead as a separate municipal event, with Karácsony describing it as a way to circumvent the need for official authorisation.On Saturday, the mayor reiterated why the city had decided to host the event, hinting at how the march had become a symbol of discontent against a government that haslong faced criticismfor weakening democratic institutions and gradually undermining the rule of law.“The government is always fighting against an enemy against which they have to protect Hungarian people,” said Karácsony.“This time, it is sexual minorities that are the target … we believe there should be no first and second class citizens, so we decided to stand by this event.”Akos Horvath, 18, who had travelled two hours from his city in southernHungaryto take part in the march, described it as an event of “symbolic importance”.Speaking to news agency AFP, he added: “It’s not just about representing gay people, but about standing up for the rights of the Hungarian people.”The sentiment was echoed by fellow marcher Eszter Rein-Bódi. “This is about much more, not just about homosexuality,” Rein-Bódi told Reuters “This is the last moment to stand up for our rights.”View image in fullscreen‘This is about much more, not just about homosexuality,’ one participant told Reuters.Photograph: Lisa Leutner/ReutersTens of thousands of Hungarians, including senior citizens and parents with their children, plus politicians and campaigners from 30 countries, took to the streets on Saturday, despite Orbán’s warning on Friday that those who attend or organise the march will face “legal consequences”.The Hungarian prime minister sought to minimise concerns over violence, however, saying that Hungary was a “civilised country” and police would not “break it up … It cannot reach the level of physical abuse”.Still, in a video posted to social media this week, the country’s justice minister, Bence Tuzson, warned the Budapest mayor that organising a banned event or encouraging people to attend is punishable by up to a year in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Elton, 30, a Brazilian living in Hungary wore a hat and sunglasses as he took part on Saturday, explaining that he had been worried about jeopardising his job and immigration status, but that his Hungarian boyfriend had persuaded him to attend.“This is my second time at Pride, but the first time I feel insecure about it,” he said.View image in fullscreenOrbán’s government had also prompted concerns across Hungary and beyond after it said it would use facial recognition software to identify people attending any banned events.Photograph: Lisa Leutner/ReutersMici, a 21-year-old Budapest resident, said she had attended Pride marches in the past but this time had weighed whether to join in after she was spooked by reports of the facial recognition system.“At first, I was scared to come out because of the news, but I feel safe with so many people.”She hoped that the massive turnout for the march would be enough to push the Orbán government to change its stance.“I think the crowd that has come from acrossEurope, the record numbers, will make Hungarian people see that this cause is well-supported.”Explore more on these topicsHungaryLGBTQ+ rightsViktor OrbánEuropePridenewsShareReuse this content"

The inside story of Palestine Action – and the move to ban itHaroon SiddiqueLegal affairs correspondentSat 28 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 10.07 EDTShareHome Office staff are concerned about the “absurd” decision to ban Palestine Action under UK anti-terrorism laws, a senior civil servant has said.On Monday the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced plans toban the group, which would make membership of it, or inviting support for it, a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act, carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.It would be the first time a direct action protest group has been classified as a terrorist organisation, joining the likes of Islamic State, al-Qaida and National Action. The move has been condemned as draconian by many other protest groups, civil society organisations and politicians of different stripes.A senior Home Office official, who requested anonymity as they are not allowed to speak to the press, said concerns about proscribing Palestine Action extended into the home secretary’s own department.“My colleagues and I were shocked by the announcement,” they said. “All week, the office has been a very tense atmosphere, charged with concern about treating a non-violent protest group the same as actual terrorist organisations like Isis, and the dangerous precedent this sets.“From desk to desk, colleagues are exchanging concerned and bemused conversations about how absurd this is and how impossible it will be to enforce. Are they really going to prosecute as terrorists everyone who expresses support for Palestine Action’s work to disrupt the flow of arms to Israel as it commits war crimes?“It’s ridiculous and it’s being widely condemned in anxious conversations internally as a blatant misuse of anti-terror laws for political purposes to clamp down on protests which are affecting the profits of arms companies.”Ban on Palestine Action would have ‘chilling effect’ on other protest groupsRead moreIn September last year, the UK announced it wassuspending some arms export licencesto Israel because of a “clear risk” they may be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. But critics have said it does not go far enough. Acourt casein which the UK is accused of selling F-35 parts that could be used by Israel to attack Gaza is awaiting judgment.After Palestine Action claimed it hadbroken into RAF Brize Nortona week ago and sprayed paint on two military aircraft, it said Britain continued to “send military cargo, fly spy planes over Gaza and refuel US and Israeli fighter jets”. On Friday, counter-terrorism policing south-eastsaid it had arrested four peoplein connection with the protest.Cooper said the protest was part of a “long history of unacceptable criminal damage committed by Palestine Action”.Palestine Action said the arrests of three of the four on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism showed that “proscription is not about enabling prosecutions under terrorism laws – it’s about cracking down on non-violent protests which disrupt the flow of arms to Israel during its genocide in Palestine”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was reported at the time that a Chinese diplomat had run a red light while following her car – under police escort – from the airport.This week Prague intelligence officials told local media that the incident was part of a much larger and escalatory plan by Chinese diplomats and intelligence officers working out of the embassy in Prague, which included preparing to stage an apparent car collision.On Saturday, Hsiao thanked Czech authorities for ensuring her safety during the visit. “The CCP’s unlawful activities will NOT intimidate me from voicing Taiwan’s interests in the international community,” she said in a social media post.The new details of the plan against Hsiao were revealed by Czech public radio service,Irozhlas, on Thursday.Petr Bartovský, the director of the Czech military intelligence service, told Irozhlas that the driver stopped by police was only following Hsiao, but that the service had also identified plans, run out of the Chinese embassy, to “demonstratively confront Ms Hsiao”.Jan Pejšek, a spokesperson for the service, said the plan involved an “attempt by the Chinese civil secret service to create conditions to perform a demonstrative kinetic action against a protected person, which however did not go beyond the phase of preparation”.

It demanded an explanation and public apology.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, said Chinese diplomats “always observe the laws and regulations of host countries”, and that the Czech government had “grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs” by allowing Hsiao to visit, calling her a “diehard Taiwan independence separatist” – a designation for whichChina has threatened the death penalty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, questions were raised about the direction of Meta’s AI development after it delayed the scheduled rollout of Behemoth, its flagship AI model.Earlier this month, Meta paid $14bn for a stake in Scale AI and is putting its founder, 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, in charge of its “superintelligence team” – an internal lab that would focus on Meta’s efforts to develop a hypothetical AI system that is smarter than humans.Last year, Google bought out the shareholders in Character.AI, a chatbot service that allows users to have personal conversations with different AI personas, for $2.7bn.People on “the list”, as Zuckerberg’s slate is known around Silicon Valley, include recent graduates from top PhD programs at schools like the University of California at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. Many are currently employed by Meta’s AI competitors, including OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind project, and have traded notes with each other on Meta’s recruiting efforts.A recruit who has personally spoken to Zuckerberg said that his goal appears to be a “transfusion from the country’s top AI labs”. A WhatsApp group chat called “Recruiting Party” was formed for Zuckerberg and at least two other senior Meta executives to talk through potential hires. The Meta CEO has been trying to personally find candidates by looking through research papers, according to the Wall Street Journal.Zuckerberg’s hands-on recruiting efforts have drawn the ire of OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, whocalledthe rumored signing bonuses and compensation packages on offer “crazy”.“I’m really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,” Altman said during an appearanceon the Uncapped podcast, which is hosted by his brother Jack. “I think the strategy of a ton of upfront, guaranteed comp, and that being the reason you tell someone to join, like really the degree to which they’re focusing on that and not the work and not the mission, I don’t think that’s going to set up a great culture.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsMark ZuckerbergArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

The country’s trade unions are campaigning to extend the measure to other regions.In Venice – which has played host to thelavish three-day wedding celebrationsof Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez, guests, visitors and protesters are feeling the heat.“I try not to think about it, but I drink a lot of water and never stay still, because that’s when you get sunstroke,” Sriane Mina, an Italian student, told Agence France-Presse in the city.As temperatures inGreeceapproached 40C, a large wildfire broke out south of Athens on Thursday, leading authorities to issue evacuation orders and shut down parts of the coastal road linking the Greek capital to Sounion, location of the ancient Temple of Poseidon, a major tourist attraction.The heatwave follows a series of broken extreme-heat records, including Europe’s hottest March ever, according to the EU’sCopernicusclimate monitor. As a result of the planet’s warming, extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, floods and heatwaves, have become more frequent and intense, scientists warn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He started working on tipping points in the 1990s, making him one of the first scientists in the world to study this form of planetary risk. In an upcoming book,Positive Tipping Points: How to Fix the Climate Crisis, he argues the Earth has entered an “unstable period” but humanity can still prevail if we can triggerpositive social and economic tipping pointsto reverse the damage that has already been done. On 30 June, he will host aglobal conference on tipping points.View image in fullscreenHumanity has failed to treat climate change as a risk assessment, says Timothy Lenton.Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/The GuardianHow do you define a tipping point?A tipping point is where change becomes self-propelling within a system, meaning it will shift from one state to another. That can happen because the balance of feedback in the system switches from damping feedback to amplifying feedback. The result can look very rapid and irreversible.How has our understanding of these risks changed?We first published a map of climate tipping elements in 2008, Since then, we have added much more than we have subtracted from that map. And, unfortunately, in the intervening 17 years, the evidence suggests we’re much closer to some of these tipping points than we thought.Which tipping points might we have passed?Things are undoubtedly happening faster than anticipated. The tipping points of greatest concern includethe West Antarctic ice sheet, where the loss of a significant chunk of the ice sheet is self-propelling, which could raise the world’s sea levels by about 1.2 metres. There is also the Greenland ice sheet, which is losing mass at an accelerating rate. Then we have the permafrost, parts of which are already passing localised tipping points – and that’s adding methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Then there’s the unprecedentedbleaching and dieback of coral reefs, which hundreds of millions of people depend on for their livelihoods.And which are close?There’s a tipping point in the circulation of the north Atlantic Ocean, when deep water stops forming in the middle of the subpolar gyre south-west of Greenland. That system seems quite volatile, and a tipping point there is like a small version of a bigger tipping point of theAtlantic meridional overturning circulation(Amoc), which studies suggest is at much greater risk than we thought even a few years ago. That in turn could trigger monsoon tipping points in west Africa and India. I’d also note the risk of tippingAmazon rainforest diebackfrom a mixture of climate change and direct human disruption. Unfortunately, I could reel off quite a few more.View image in fullscreenPotential tipping points corresponding to the level of global heating.Photograph: climatetippingpoints.infoHow accurate are the predictions?If anything, we have underestimated the risks. When we did our first assessment in 2008, we thought Greenland was close to a big tipping point. We haven’t changed that judgment, but we thought West Antarctica would need at least 3C of warming [above pre-industrial levels]. Unfortunately, everything that’s been observed since suggests we were way too optimistic. As a rule, the more we learn, the closer we think the tipping points are – and meanwhile we’ve been warming the planet up. It’s like running faster into a sea that is rising to drown us.Why has it taken so long for the world to talk about these catastrophic threats?In the climate science community, we have tended to concentrate on assessing what’s the most likely thing to happen, but the more important question is: what’s the worst thing that could happen? That’s the difference between a scientific assessment and a risk assessment. I would argue we’ve not been treating climate change as a risk assessment.That is also because a lot of well-funded entities have been systematically undermining the knowledge consensus on climate change, which has forced the scientific community to defend what’s in effect 19th-century physics. That hasn’t put us in a great position to emphasise tipping point risks, which inherently have more uncertainty around them.View image in fullscreenThe New York City skyline seen in a smokey sunrise in June 2023 as wildfires in Canada cast a haze across North America.Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesWhy do we need to talk about them now?Because tipping point risks are real and potentially existential. If we have a tipping point in the Atlantic Ocean – the so-called Amoc – we could lose more than half the area for growing staple crops worldwide. It would cause water security crises and severely disrupt the monsoons in west Africa and India, which would affect billions of people.We have to level up to those risks, better understand them and how close they are, and what things we can do in response. Even if we can’t stop the events happening, we can do things that reduce the vulnerability of people exposed to the risks. That is why we are drawing attention to tipping points. This is not as a council of despair; on the contrary, it is more like a council of practicality. In terms of the upfront costs to decarbonise the global economy, it is a great investment for the return you get, which is lowering the risk of otherwise catastrophic outcomes.It would help if the IPCC [the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] took a more in-depth look at tipping points. A large number of countries wanted to see an IPCC special report on tipping points in this assessment cycle, but the IPCC said no. Instead there’s due to be a chapter in the next assessment report.Is there an alternative?Yes. I and more than 200 other researchers have published a global tipping points report, and we’re writing another one forCop30, [the UN climate change summit which takes place in Brazil, in November]. We felt the risk was important to communicate and this is a timely moment. So we are trying to fill in the assessment gap in an accessible way. People are crying out for that.I understandthe global tipping points conference will also look at positive tipping points in technology, economics and politics?Yes. [There are some] more optimistic scenarios; the impacts of wind power and photovoltaic innovation, or the knock-on effects of campaigning by Greta Thunberg and others. There are also policy feedbacks that could create a change in the landscape in a good way, where you start a policy path towards the renewable energy revolution that’s very hard to reverse. That is arguably what the architects of the German feed-in tariffs for renewables managed to do. They made it hard for the doubters to change course even after a change of government.View image in fullscreenThe environmental protests led by Greta Thunberg (centre) when she was a school pupil had a huge knock-on effect, says Lenton.Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty ImagesHas renewable energy reached a positive tipping point?Yes, our analysis suggests that solar photovoltaic power is now in a phase of self-propelling global uptake with exponential growth of installed generating capacity, doubling every two years or less. Factoring in the cost of battery storage, solar is already the cheapest source of new power in most of the world, and for every doubling of installed capacity its price drops by nearly a quarter. This is rapidly making solar power the cheapest source of electricity ever, which brings many benefits, including access to electricity for the roughly 700 million people who don’t currently have it.And electric vehicles?Yes, the price of batteries plummeted nearly tenfold in a decade as the range you can get from a given mass of battery increased by nearly a factor of three. This has brought China and several European markets to the tipping point where adoption of EVs is self-propelling: the more EVs that get bought, the better and the cheaper they get, encouraging further adoption. The US is lagging behind, but the global south is starting to reap the benefits of electrifying mobility, as it is much cheaper to run an electric rickshaw in India or an electric motorbike taxi in east Africa than their fossil-fuelled equivalents.Any other examples of potential positive tipping points?I’m working on regenerative nature. We already see cases where degraded ecosystems have been tipped back into a better state – for example, when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and started preying on elk, it triggered abrupt vegetation recovery, or when sea otters returned to north Pacific coastal ecosystems and started feasting on sea urchins it tipped the recovery of kelp forests. We also see social tipping points that are nature-positive, where community conservation initiatives, like locally managed marine protected areas, spread rapidly and widely among and across societies.Can you explain cascading feedbacks?In all complex systems – such as the climate and the economy – if you can tip one thing, it can have consequences for other bits of the system. If you tip one part of the system it can make tipping another part of the system more likely. For example, if you’ve suffered a medical shock it can have knock-on effects on other parts of the body. In the climate, these causal connections can be quite significant and strong. In Earth’s history, when there were tipping points in the overturning circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, that tipped major shifts in the tropical monsoons of west Africa and India.In the economy, a cascade can be more positive. For example, an investment in renewable energy can bring forward a tipping point in other sectors. It basically means renewables are making electricity cheaper than it has ever been, and that incentivises electrifying mobility, like cars and trucks and buses, or electrifying heating in homes. At the same time, batteries get cheaper because of economies of scale, which then helps to balance renewable electricity supply and demand. So feedbacks between sectors of the economy can create tipping points that reinforce each other. We’ve recently mapped out a bunch of positive tipping cascades that could help accelerate change to zero greenhouse gas emissions.What should the world doatCop30 in Belém to address tipping points?We need policymakers to implement policies that bring forward the positive tipping points we need to stop greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the bad climate tipping points. If the EU and China were to coordinate, it could be enough to shift the balance towards clean green alternatives. Even with Trump in the United States, the beauty of tipping points is you don’t need everybody, you typically only need a fifth to tip to the new alternative and then you get to a situation where everybody else is compelled to follow.Tipping points: on the edge? – a series on our futureView image in fullscreenComposite: Getty / Guardian DesignTipping points – in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects.

This is particularly important for small island developing states because many face an existential threat. But as well as the direct loss of land, rising sea levels cause flooding, threaten drinking water supplies and make farmland too salty to grow on.Having waded through international law and scholarship and analysed state views and practices, legal experts concluded that nothing prevents nations from maintaining their maritime boundaries even if the land on which they are drawn changes or disappears. These boundaries give countries navigation rights, access to resources such as fishing and minerals, and a degree of political control.There is also general agreement that affected nations should retain their statehood to avoid loss of nationality. Legal experts say these conclusions are essential for maintaining international peace and stability.Speaking at theUN Oceans conference in Nice,Penelope Ridings, an international lawyer and member of the ILC, said the commission’s work was driven by the “fundamental sense of injustice” that sea level rise would be felt worst by the most vulnerable states, which had also contributed the least to the problem.Researchhas found that a third of present-day sea level rise can be traced to emissions from the 122 largest fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers.The Pacific nation of Tuvalu has been particularly vocal in its concerns. Sea levels on its nine islands and atolls have already risen by 4.8mm and areexpected to get much higherover the coming decades.Australia was the first country to recognise the permanence of Tuvalu’s boundaries despite rising sea levels. In 2023, itsigned a legally binding treatycommitting to help Tuvalu respond to major disasters and offering special visas to citizens who want or need to move.Nearly a third of citizenshave entered a ballot for such a visa. Latvia followed with asimilar pledge of recognition.At the oceans conference, the Tuvaluan prime minister, Feleti Teo, said his citizens were determined to stay on their land for as long as possible. The government has just finished the first phase of a coastal adaptation project, building concrete barriers to reduce flooding and dredging sand to create additional land.Teo noted that the US$40m scheme was “very expensive” and it had taken years to secure moneyfrom the Green Climate Fund. He urged Tuvalu’s development partners to be “more forthcoming in terms of providing the necessary climate financing that we need to be able to adapt. And to give us more time to live in the land that we believe God has given us and we intend to remain on”.Ridings said it was now up to states to take the commission’s work forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A dance class is about to start in the village hall, a game of crown green bowls is under way and swallows are swooping around the medieval church tower as wood pigeons coo.“It’s a lovely, quiet little village,” says Nona Bourne as she watches another end of bowls in a match between Marham and nearby Massingham.Like many, Bourne is troubled by the news that this week thrust Marham to the frontline of UK’s nuclear arsenal, in the biggest expansion of the programme for a generation.Without consultation, RAF Marham isto be equipped with new F-35A jetscapable of carrying warheads with three times the explosive power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.How and why is Britain obtaining access to nuclear gravity bombs?Read moreBourne said: “When they spread it all over the news that these planes are going to come here from America with these bombs, it makes you think we’re going to be targeted. My bungalow is five minutes from the base.”The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament is planning a protest in Marham on Saturday. Bourne, whose son-in-law used to work at the base, is tempted to take part. “I might join in,” she says. “My daughter says we’ve always been a target here, but I am concerned. If I was younger I’d think about moving, but I’m 83, I’m not going anywhere.”Sisters Becky, 29, and Katherine Blakie, 31, are heading to a friend’s house for a plunge in their hot tub. “I read about the weapons on Facebook,” says Becky. “It’s strange to think they’ll be here in little old Marham.”Becky, who works in fundraising, is annoyed that the village was not consulted about the decision. She says: “Marham and the RAF base are intertwined so we should definitely have had a say.”Katherine, a medical student, says: “It makes you think, ‘Are we safe, if people know nuclear weapons are here?’”View image in fullscreenBecky and Katherine Blakie: ‘Marham and the RAF base are intertwined so we should definitely have had a say.’Photograph: John Robertson/The GuardianAt this stage it is unclear where the nuclear warheads will be housed, but new jets to be based at Marham have the capacity to drop them. Wherever they are stored, the fear Marham will be a target is widespread in the village.“Look what happened at Pearl Harbor,” says Patricia Gordon after finishing her bowls match. “We’d be obliterated here.”She adds: “And with Donald Trump’s finger on the button, does it matter that we’ve got nuclear weapons or not?”But her partner, Bruce Townsend, 77, a retired lorry driver, thinks the nuclear deterrent works. He says: “You can’t give up nuclear weapons. Iran, and those countries, know damn well that if they start anything, they’ll just get wiped out.”He adds: “I feel the same about the protest as I did about people who tried to ban the bomb. It’s stupid. They can’t change it.”View image in fullscreenBruce Townsend and Patricia Gordon at the bowls club. ‘We’d be obliterated here,’ says Gordon.Photograph: John Robertson/The GuardianIt is the men in Marham who seem more relaxed about the prospect of nuclear-armed planes on their doorstep. Chris Joice, a carer who used to work at the base, says: “We’ve had F-35s for so many years, and having the next model isn’t going to make much difference.”Joice is out walking a friend’s dog, Millie, who has an RAF roundel pendant strapped to her collar. He is concerned about the lack of consultation: “I’m just annoyed that all these decisions go ahead and the common man doesn’t have a single word in.”He adds: “No one needs that kind of firepower. I’d rather people rolled dice to settle their beefs.”View image in fullscreenChris Joice: ‘We’ve had F-35s for so many years, and having the next model isn’t going to make much difference.’Photograph: John Robertson/The GuardianOthers are more full-throated in their support. Jim Smith, 79, a retired construction worker, remembers nuclear weapons at the base in the 1950s. “They had them up there in 1958 or 59 when they had the V bombers. It stopped a world war then. And it’s no different now.”A man on a bike who would only give his name as John recently retired as a grounds maintenance worker at the base. He says: “They’re never going to attack us. It would be Armageddon if it comes to that. So it doesn’t make a shite’s worth of difference worrying about it.”He adds: “I don’t mind protest, I’m a biker so I’m all about freedom, but I’ve got better things to do. People protesting here don’t live in the real world, they should worry instead about people sleeping on the streets in King’s Lynn.”Colin Callaby, 64, is out picking cherries from a tree in the middle of the village. The cherries, which he plans to turn into wine, are the sweetest he has ever known.“We’re right in the firing line,” he says, “but if there’s going to be a nuclear bomb we’re all done for so I’d rather be right underneath it and die instantly than be 50 miles away and take weeks to die from radiation.”He adds: “It’s very sad that mankind has got to spend billions of pounds on mass destruction and we can’t do something better with that money.

But the product remains available on eBay.‘I feel like a drug dealer’: the parents using black-market melatonin to help their children sleepRead moreWestcott said she was complying with the investigation and denied knowingly selling a prescription-only substance.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was alerted to the gummies by two mothers who had bought the product online for their children.Last week the Guardian was able to buy a tub of 60 gummies for £19.49, including postage and packing, via Amazon without a prescription. They came with glowing five-star online reviews. One parent of a sleep-deprived child described the gummies as a “godsend”, another as “magic”.The mothers, one a photographer and the other working in fintech, who both want to remain anonymous, had a hunch that the gummies contained more active ingredients than were listed on the label.Their suspicions were heightened when their young children, one of whom has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the other who is suspected of having ADHD and autism, fell asleep only 30 minutes after eating the gummies.The women commissioned an independent company, Supplement Factory, to analyse the gummies. Its report, which the Guardian has seen, said they contained undeclared, but pharmacologically relevant, levels of melatonin. Each gummy contained 0.53mg of melatonin, the analysis estimated. The recommended starting dose for children is 0.5mg.Supplement Factory concluded that the inclusion of melatonin was unlawful as it breached the human medicines regulations 2012.“A single gummy may sedate a child without clinical oversight,” Supplement Factory’s report concluded.The mothers sent the report to the MHRA earlier this month. Amazon was also notified. This week the gummies were taken offline while the MHRA investigates.A spokesperson for the MHRA said: “Patient safety is our top priority. In the UK, melatonin is an authorised medicine, and any product containing it as an ingredient is likely to be classified as a medicine.“If a product falls under the definition of a medicine, it must hold a marketing authorisation (‘licence’) in order to be legally sold and supplied in the UK, unless covered by a special exemption.”It added: “We take the reports very seriously and can confirm we are investigating these products further to determine what appropriate action is required. We are unable to comment further on the details of this investigation as it is ongoing.”In a statement Westcott said: “We take any concerns regarding product safety, regulatory compliance and consumer trust extremely seriously.“We are currently reviewing the information you have provided regarding the magnesium glycinate gummies. We have initiated an investigation into the matter in order to properly understand the facts and are in the process of further independent scientific testing of our products.“Nutrition Ignition is a small business and has never knowingly sold products containing undeclared ingredients and we only work with manufacturers who meet third-party assured industry standards; specifically NSF [National Science Foundation] certification of conformity.”The photographer said: “It’s horrifying to read those reviews about children falling to sleep in minutes, when you know the reality of what’s happening. It is scandalous that you can buy prescription drugs for children over the internet in this way.“This case shines a light on how unregulated this industry is, and calls into question Amazon’s responsibility in allowing misleading and potentially dangerous products being marketed and sold to the parents of children.”Her friend said: “I feel deeply concerned about what has been uncovered. Melatonin is a prescribed medicine in the UK and parents/carers need to be made fully aware of what they are feeding their children.”She added: “My daughter is diagnosed with ADHD and has been taking medication to manage. To assist with sleep at night, her doctor prescribed melatonin, which luckily she wasn’t taking because along with the magnesium gummies, it could have been at a dangerous level in her system. The fact that the supplements market appears to be unregulated and being sold on Amazon with false claims is really worrying.”Melatonin gummies are available in China, the US and in some European countries without prescription despite doubts about their long-term safety. In the UK ahidden market has developed for melatoningummies, particularly among parents of neurodivergent children.The ready availability of melatonin online has alarmed health experts who say its long-term health effects on children are unknown.Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthSleepAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderNHSPharmaceuticals industryHealth & wellbeingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Ticketmaster have since informed customers that the event will no longer go ahead as planned and they will be refunded.An online campaign group, No Stage for Abusers, called on the Brighton Centre and Brighton and Hove city council, which owns the venue, to cancel the performance.Four women had sued Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, accusing him of rape, sexual assault and bodily harm. However, after a year-long investigation, the case against him wasdropped in January.Prosecutors in California found that the statute of limitations had been exceeded and argued they would not be able to bring charges that prove Warner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.The identities of the women were not revealed, but Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, who sued Warner in a case that has now been settled, stated that she was part of the criminal investigation.Marilyn Manson: Unmasked review – should a tour bus really need the age of consent pinned to the wall?Read moreIn 2021, Manson’s former fiancee, the Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, also named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Warner has dismissed the allegations as “falsehoods”.Last week, Green Party MPSiân Berryexpressed her concerns about Warner’s scheduled performance in her constituency in Brighton, writing anopen letterto the leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Bella Sankey.In Berry’s letter, which was co-signed by a host of groups and the University of Sussex students’ union, she made the case for cancelling the concert, saying it went against “the city’s well-renowned values”.Berry wrote: “Many survivors in Brighton and Hove, and organisations supporting them, will have serious concerns about this booking and its wider impact on other people visiting the city centre, local residents and the wider community.”She added: “The council has a responsibility to take action where there are risks of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.”Supporters of Warner point out that Warner has not been found guilty of allegations against him. Others said the decision infringes on freedom of speech.One person told The Argus: “This is cancel culture, nothing more, and it’ll backfire when artists don’t add a Brighton and Hove date to their tours and stick to London, which incidentally hasn’t bannedMarilyn Mansonfrom their city.”Explore more on these topicsMarilyn MansonBrightonSiân BerrynewsShareReuse this content"

It was done to spread awareness and ask tourists to be away from the riverbank and never step on the riverbed. At least 71 people were booked in cases in violation of the warnings.”He added: “It was a tragic and unfortunate incident and the tourists were in the riverbed.”When the flash flood occurred, the family from Punjab province were having a picnic breakfast by the river in the Swat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The family had gone into the river to rescue the children, who had been taking photos, government officials said.According to Akram, at least 17 people were swept away in the flash floods in the Swat River – bodies of nine family members had been recovered and one was missing. Four other people were rescued while three were still missing. He said the rescue efforts were continuing.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) later issued an alert saying there were high flood levels and warning people to take precautions.Pakistan, with a population of more than 240 million, is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis.Climate induced flash floodsin 2022, killed at least1,700 people and affected more than 33 millionpeople. The incident prompted discussion in Pakistanon the climate crisis, provincial governments’ role in preventing such incidents, tourists avoiding warnings and allegations of incompetence and corruption in local government.The former climate change minister Sherry Rehman said the tourists in Pakistan no longer respond to colonial-era instructions such as section 144 – which allows district administrations to place bans on activities – and they seem not to heed extreme weather warnings.Rehman criticised poor government signalling on the climate crisis and a lack of coordinated efforts, saying: “Public resources also fell egregiously short in this tragedy. The PDMA should have mobilised a helicopter to get to the marooned family in time. It’s outrageous negligence on their part not to have.”Many social media users criticised the government for failing to rescue the stranded family aswitness accountssaid they were stuck for more than an hour without any help.The PDMAs were created after the deadly 2005 earthquake in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and are responsible for responding in a timely way to natural calamities, floods and disasters. The disaster authorities in different Pakistani provinces have been accused of corruption.Explore more on these topicsPakistanClimate crisisExtreme weatherFloodingSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump called him “a 100% Communist Lunatic”,writing on social media: “We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.”But at a gathering of religious conservatives in Washington on Friday, the first attendee interviewed by the Guardian expressed admiration forwhat Mamdani had pulled offin beating establishment favorite Andrew Cuomo.Wall Street shivers over ‘hot commie summer’ after Mamdani’s successRead moreKevin Abplanalp, who has worked on political campaigns, said: “He ran a fantastic ground game. I was very impressed with his grassroots work. Cuomo was a terrible candidate so it’s a combination of a repudiation of Cuomo and excitement over a younger guy with energy and different ideas.”Abplanalp, 49, executive director of the groupCoalition for Liberty, added: “He’s a bit too socialistic for my taste but it is New York. They’ve had Marxists before. It is what it is.”Mamdani was endorsed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a leading progressive some believe could now be encouraged to mount a bid for the White House in 2028. But that prospect was met with complacency and ridicule at the Freedom & Faith Coalition’sRoad to Majority conference.Abplanalp commented: “That is hilarious. I don’t think she has the requisite experience. We’ve had other presidents who don’t have the requisite experience: Jimmy Carter for one. Do people want to have another train wreck of someone that just talks a good game? There’s nothing on her résumé that screams executive capability.”The annual gathering was addressed by senators from Pennsylvania, Ohio and Oklahoma along with Virginia’a governor, Glenn Youngkin, andTrump’s border “czar”, Tom Homan. In the eyes of many delegates, Mamdani’s surprise victory was evidence of liberal eccentricity in New York that will not fly elsewhere.Andrea Moore, 55, from Virginia, said:“I’m a little surprised but at the same time it is New York.”She told an anecdote about an Uber driver who was upset aboutNew Yorkpotentially giving people who illegally crossed the border “$2,000 a month of taxpayer money and the right to vote immediately”.As for Ocasio-Cortez running for president, she remarked: “I don’t think I’d fear it but I’d probably laugh about it.”Steven Perkins, 74, who is retired and from South Dakota, said: “It’s not just that we’re conservatives but we know our communities. You get out of the big core cities and people are pretty conservative and traditional and they aren’t ready for all of this much change to occur. There’s this big reaction. The Democrats better wake up.”Mamdani, 33, combined charisma and social media savvywith a policy agendafocused on New York’s affordability crisis. His plans include freezing rent for many residents, free bus service and universal childcare paid for by new taxes on the wealthy.Some at the Road to Majority conference found this affront to capitalism. Darin Moser, 56, from Mount Airy, North Carolina, said:“It’s very concerning. The United States was built on freedom and free markets and we need to stay on that because that’s what’s made us successful and the most successful nation in the world.”One attendee, who did not wish to be named, blamed the media for making socialism seem like the answer to their problems. He said: “If you repeat anything enough times people are going to believe it but it’s not been proven. Socialism or communism has proven to fail every time it’s been put into play. It comes around newly clothed but it’s the same worn-out policy.”The ascent of Mamdani, who would be New York’s first Muslim mayor, triggered anonslaught of Islamaphobic attacksacross social media, including from some Republican members of Congress. Centrist Democrats remained nervous about backing him, fearful that he could damage the party in swing states.But in the view of Ronald Wilcox, 63, from Fairfax county in Virginia, Democrats have already embraced extremism and lost touch with reality. “The left has no limit to what they will vote for,” he said. “I trust no Democrat because there’s no limit to how bad a person can be and they’ll still support him.”Could the US ever elect a socialist president? Wilcox, who works in direct mail, replied: “I won’t say never but the mood of America, the new generation, is embracing Trump. The young generation is moving to conservative, the Asians are moving to conservative, theLatinos are moving to conservativebecause we share their values.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansZohran MamdaniWashington DCReligionNew YorkUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The researcher at a Danish pharmaceutical company lives in the Swedish university town of Lund with her three children but has become accustomed to Danish working practices, and the idea of working in Sweden is now difficult to imagine.“Because I’m Swedish, colleagues would expect me to behave like a Swede,” she said, referring to their reputation for seeking consensus. “So I would be seen as rude – too direct to fit inSweden.”Danes, she has found, are more forthright. “I really like the Danish mentality and way of being. It suits me much better.”View image in fullscreenHelen Sjögren on her commute between the neighbouring countries.Photograph: Helen Sjögren“I really like the Danish mentality and way of being. It suits me much better.” At work, she and her colleagues speak slightly adapted versions of Swedish and Danish so that everybody can understand one another. One of her few misgivings is that her taxes go to Copenhagen rather than her own municipality, where her children have gone to school and where she uses the healthcare services.In the quarter of a century since it opened on 1 July 2000, the bridge – known as Øresundsbroen or Öresundsbron depending on whether you are on the Danish or Swedish side of the eponymous strait – has not only opened up Copenhagen’s vast job market to largely rural southern Sweden, but changed the prospects and even identities of many who use it. The 15.9km (9.9 miles) rail and road link between Copenhagen and Malmö (which includes an 8km bridge, 4km tunnel and 4km artificial island) has also transformed the world’s perception of the region.But the trajectory of the two ends of the bridge has been a story of two halves. Copenhagen has soared to international super status, becoming a must-see tourist destination, global fashion and design leader, host to the biggest airport in the Nordics, as well as being home to the maker of Ozempic, Novo Nordisk. Thanks to the weak Swedish krona, it has become a magnet for Swedish workers, bringing in 2bn DKK (£230m) a year in tax revenues. Last year 105,000 daily journeys were made by car, train or boat over the strait, but most commuter traffic is travelling towards Denmark.View image in fullscreenThe Bridge crime drama catapulted the Øresund bridge to international fame.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyMalmö has not thrived to the same extent. Despite being home to the beloved fictional detective Saga Norén of the hit Scandi crime drama The Bridge – which catapulted the bridge to international fame with its unsolved murders, crashing ships and tense dark drives across Øresund – Malmö has been an observer on the sidelines of the Danish capital’s success story. This is perhaps best captured by the decision by politicians to name the area around the bridge covering southern Sweden and eastern Denmark “Greater Copenhagen”.Of the 21,585 people who commuted regularly across the bridge to work in the final quarter of last year, 96% were people who live in Sweden, according to the Øresund Institute, an independent Swedish-Danish knowledge centre. By 2030, Greater Copenhagen, run by representatives of each of the included Swedish and Danish regions, aims to increase the total to 30,000.“The number of commuters has begun to increase again,” said Johan Wessman, Øresund Institute’s managing director and editor-in-chief. “Partly because the labour shortage is increasing in Denmark, and partly because the Swedish krona makes it profitable to work in Denmark and live and shop in Sweden.” While it was not impossible to commute before the bridge – there were boats – it was significantly more time-consuming and difficult. In 1999, the year before the bridge opened, a total of 2,788 people commuted.View image in fullscreenMany people in Malmö don’t use the bridge, either because they find it too expensive or because of train delays.Photograph: Diego Grandi/AlamyAs the train transported Sjögren towards Sweden and the water of the strait came into view, she said that without the bridge, life as she knew it would be impossible. “It would never have worked because it would have taken so much longer to commute that I wouldn’t have been able to hold my life together.”Although there are border controls in place – every train stops for six to seven minutes at Hyllie station, the first stop coming into Sweden from Denmark – she said she did not think of going to Copenhagen as going to a different country. “For us who live down here, the border is not a big thing,” she said.But Anders Linde-Laursen, a professor at Malmö University who studies identity and belonging with a focus on the Øresund region, said users of the bridge were “constantly reminded that they are crossing an international border”. This, he said, became abundantly clear when the bridge was temporarily closed in 2015 during the refugee crisis when the Swedish government said it needed“respite”from asylum seekers, leading to the introduction of travellers needing to carry ID. And in 2020, during the pandemic, when the bridge was again closed. “The border hit back at the region discourse and it was made very clear to everyone that there were Danes and Swedes, separated by the [water], and that no bridge would change that.”At the Danish energy agency’s offices in central Copenhagen, Ture Ertmann is one of the 19,500 Danish-born people who live in Skåne, Sweden’s most southerly county. After dropping his youngest off at preschool in Malmö, he gets the train over to Denmark and arrives a work at about 8.30am – a routine he has been following for 13 years. His wife and his other two children work and go to school in Malmö and, at home, Swedish is their main language. “Everything is in Malmö,” said Ertmann, who founded the Facebook commuter group BroenLive. “It is just me that is the odd one out, that works here and has a Danish passport.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because the two governments are not integrated when it comes to administration, paperwork can get tricky – particularly when it comes to property ownership and tax. Demand for the train is such that it is usually standing-room only at peak times, and services are often delayed.About 9,600 Danes now own summer houses in Sweden, compared with 4,400 in2000, and an additional11,330Swedish summer houses have German owners – many of whom use the bridge to get there. Danske Torpare, a paid membership organisation that helps Danish people to navigate the administrative difficulties of buying houses in Sweden, said the price difference – it is almost half the price to buy a summerhouse in Sweden than it is in Denmark – and the opportunity to live in isolation in nature were big draws.Sweden’s ambassador to Denmark, Hans Wallmark, said he was convinced the benefits of the bridge ran in both directions, but added: “You cannot get away from the fact that Copenhagen is a capital city, so it has that attraction.” Citing the life science cluster, known as Medicon Valley, which is mostly centred on the Danish side but is increasingly spreading to the Swedish side, he said Danish successes such as Novo Nordisk had a positive impact on Sweden, too. The establishment of the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund, a research facility still under construction with a datacentre in Copenhagen, was another example of a cross-bridge success story, Wallmark said.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Peter Brinch/ØresundsbronThe next 25 years, he predicted, would bring even greater connection and focus on the region – especially after theFehmarnbelt tunnelopened in 2029, connecting the Danish town of Rødbyhavn with Puttgarden, in Germany, under the Baltic Sea. “Then maybe we will not just be talking about Malmö, Copenhagen or Skåne, but also north Germany,” he said at his residence in Copenhagen. “Bridges, connections lead to increased integration, increased prosperity.”But there are many in Malmö who do not use the bridge – either because it is prohibitively expensive (510DKK or £58.25 for the car toll and 160 SEK or £12.31 for a single train ticket from Malmö to Copenhagen), or because of train delays.“It’s too expensive to go over,” said one man taking a rest from cycling on the quayside in Malmö. He recently waited five hours, on midsummer eve, to get a train across the bridge. “It doesn’t work. It’s so often [that the train gets delayed]. You can forget about commuting to Copenhagen – unless you have your own boat.”Explore more on these topicsSwedenDenmarkEuropeRail transportInfrastructureRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For others, it has provoked anger and frustration that they are being falsely portrayed as victims of a “white genocide”, 31 years after their community’s own oppressive minority rule ended.In February, Trumpsigned an executive orderclaiming Afrikaners, who make upabout 4%of South Africa’s population, or about 2.5 million people, were victims of “unjust racial discrimination”. The order cut aid to the country and established a refugee programme for white South Africans.

White South Africans typically have 20 times the wealth of Black people, according to anarticlein the Review of Political Economy.The spectacle of white people being flown to the US while Trump blocked refugees from war zones bemused and angered South Africans of all races. For some liberal Afrikaners, it felt personal.“In terms of being singled out, for progressives it’s extremely painful,” said Lindie Koorts, a history lecturer at the University of Pretoria.Koorts mentioned the phrase “ons is nie almal so nie” (“we are not all like that”). She said the phrase is used by progressives to reach out across South Africa’s divides without disavowing their Afrikaner or South African identities – despite it having become a cliche that conservative Afrikaners use to mock them.View image in fullscreenA celebration in 2023 by Betereinders, an Afrikaner group campaigning for better race relations in South Africa.Therightwing Solidarity Movement, which includes a trade union and the campaigning group AfriForum, has lobbied Trump since his first presidential term for support in helping Afrikaners stay in South Africa, to preserve what Solidarity Movement says is a culture under threat. The group argues, for instance, that a recently implemented education lawwill limit Afrikaans schooling, something the ruling African National Congress disputes.There is not comprehensive polling data on Afrikaners’ political views. However, the Freedom Front Plus party, which is seen as representing conservative Afrikaners, received about 456,000 votes in the2024 national elections.Emile Myburgh, a lawyer who grew up during apartheid believing that Afrikaners were God’s chosen people, said: “I remember when I was a child often hearing Afrikaners say that: ‘The one who rules the tip of Africa rules the world.’ So we’d feel very special.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, he disputed the claim that his culture was under threat, noting that he regularly attended Afrikaans book launches. “In the circles that I move in, we do celebrate Afrikaans culture,” he said.Zahria van Niekerk, a 22-year-old fashion student, who was raised bilingually to help her get into university, disagreed that the Afrikaans language, of whom the majority of speakers are now non-white, was threatened. “My whole family speaks Afrikaans … As long as I can speak it with my family, I’m not really concerned.”In May, Trumpambushed South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in the Oval Office with claims that white farmers were being murdered for their race. However, Emil van Maltitz, an economics graduate and farmer’s son, disagreed.The 21-year-old, who speaks Sesotho, Afrikaans and English, said: “Most farmers are white Afrikaners, so it can easily be interpreted as racial targeting. I just think, personally, people are very vulnerable in those areas and they don’t have a lot of help from the police.”In the last quarter of 2024, South African policerecorded12 murders on farms, including Black-owned smallholder plots, out of almost 7,000 murders across the country.Van Maltitz recalled young black farmers coming to his father to seek agricultural advice, saying it showed the value of South Africans working together. “I love diversity, I love being around different people,” he said.Schalk van Heerden is a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church, the largest Afrikaans church.

It’s just the medicineRhik SamadderSat 28 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareIlove watching real-life siblings on-screen. They bring a knotted history to every interaction, the way they look at one another, or don’t. They may love each other; they’re definitely stuck with each other. Daisy May and Charlie Cooper were the last to bottle such contradiction; I’m delighted we now haveSuch Brave Girls(BBC One, Wednesday 2 July, 11.40pm), returning for a second series, in which creator Kat Sadler stars alongside her sister Lizzie Davidson. Cattier than Longleat, it features some of the most savage writing on TV, and makes me yowl with pleasure.It’s about traumatised women making terrible choices. Bear with. The ever-excellent Louise Brealey plays Deb, whose husband abandoned his family 10 years ago after popping to the shop for teabags. In financial trouble, she spends her time trying to lock down relations with drippy, slippery widower Dev, played by Paul Bazely, explicitly for his big house. Single-mindedness has made her grim, grasping and less maternal than a stressed hamster. Bad news for daughters Josie and Billie, who give off the stench of joint captivity, and have split into twin coping strategies: one depressed and passive, the other overconfident, bullish and equally lost.There are many jokes about sex, all three women wildly pursuing or running away from ludicrous men. But its most adult theme is desperation, which every character is thinly masking. One of the funniest running jokes is the way Deb and Billie dismiss the “haunting presence” of Josie. Deb has no time for her depressed daughter’s big feelings, interest in art or grapples with lesbianism. Life is about finding a man and moving in with him. She urges her to “Remember the family crest! Ignore, repress, forget.”Scowling harder than Kanye West, Davidson gets to spit the most deliciously vicious lines. “She only shaves one leg,” she hisses of an unmarried aunt, “so when she sleeps on her side she can pretend a man is spooning her.” She’s no fan of Josie’s rare smile, either. “Your mouth’s doing the right thing, but your eyes are calling Samaritans.” Having turned her obsessive attention away from drug-dealing Nicky, she’s now chasing a much older, married man. (They meet in the mornings, as he’s too tired to get an erection at night.) “There’s nothing wrong with having an affair, right?’ she asks, a shade of self-awareness crossing her face. “I honestly think it might be the most feminist thing you can do,” responds Josie.View image in fullscreen‘Your mouth’s smiling, but your eyes are calling Samaritans’… Davidson with Louise Brealey as Deb and Kat Sadler as Josie in Such Brave Girls.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Various Artists LimitedThefirst seriesannounced Sadler as a brilliant voice. Her writing pitilessly skewers the discourse around pop-feminism, queerness, sexuality and mental health. Pitiless does not mean unempathetic – the show was born of personal experience. During lockdown, Sadler revealed to Davidson that she’d spent time on a psych ward after twice trying to kill herself, and her sister admitted she was £20,000 in debt. They found themselves laughing. If you’re in a raw place, the fun they have with self-harm, workplace shooting, dissociation and the self-delusion required to live a lie until you die, may be too much. For most of us, it’s the medicine.Directed by Simon Bird ofThe Inbetweeners, and co-produced by A24, there’s big underwriting, too. The first series saw a few mannered performances from the supporting cast, but these have settled in now. Its female trinity remain a scream, as the story tacks farcical in ways I won’t spoil here. Let’s just say they’re riding that family crest like a surfboard into disaster.Dark comedy is a phrase overused, and perhaps meaningless. Granted, you have to be the kind of person who finds a mother warning her daughter, “Try not to poison this family with your personality” funny to get Such Brave Girls. I’d argue that is the central brain-stem of the British psyche. There are strains of Peep Show, Julia Davies, Sharon Horgan and Fleabag. Like them, the show has no message other than that life is absurd, pain inevitable and people ridiculous. That makes it more clear-sighted and honest than any show telling us what to think. And you get sisters tearing strips off each other. Truly, there is eloquence in blood.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherTV comedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Arifa Akbar on a lifetime of insomnia – and a possible cureFrom Van Gogh’s starry skies to the nocturnal workings of Louise Bourgeois and Patricia Highsmith, sleepless nights have long inspired heightened creativity. Could those artistic impulses actually help us to sleep?Arifa AkbarSat 28 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareIcan’t remember when I first stopped sleeping soundly. Maybe as a child, in the bedroom I initially shared with my brother, Tariq. I would wait for his breathing to quieten, then strain to listen beyond our room in the hope of being the last one awake, and feel myself expanding into the liberating space and solitude. By my early 20s, that childhood game of holding on to wakefulness while others slept began playing out against my will. Sound seemed to be the trigger. It was as if the silence I had tuned into as a child was now a requirement for sleep. Any sound was noise: the burr of the TV from next door, the ticking of a clock in another room. When one layer of sound reduced its volume, another rose from beneath it, each intrusive and underscored by my own unending thoughts. Noise blaring from without and within, until I felt too tired to sleep.The artist Louise Bourgeois suffered a bad bout of insomnia in the 1990s, during which she created a series of drawings. Among them is an image that features musical notes in red ink, zigzagging across a sheet of paper. They look like the jagged score of an ECG graph that has recorded an alarmingly arrhythmic heartbeat. It sums up the torment of my insomnia: there is a raised heartbeat in every sound.View image in fullscreenVan Gogh’s The Starry Night, 1889.Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyI have been told that to overcome an inability to sleep you must find its root cause, but this quest for an original impetus is guesswork. Was it self-inflicted in childhood, or does it track further back than that, to infancy, to the womb, to genetics? One starting point is Professor Derk-Jan Dijk’s view of a “sleep personality”, and the idea that childhood sleep habits can be the same later in life. I was born in London, but my family moved to Lahore when I was three years old, before returning to the UK a couple of years later. In Pakistan, there was vigorous, carefree slumber, on the roof of the house on the hottest nights, with the extended family in close proximity. It was sleep as communal ritual. Then the standstill after lunch when everyone lay down again in siesta. I remember my sister, Fauzia, sleeping beside me on these afternoons. There was no hint of insomnia until the move back to Britain when we found ourselves homeless, living in a disused building in north London for a while, crammed into a single room, before moving into a council flat.In light of Dijk’s words, I see how my insomnia might be a reaction against this early chaos, along with my exacting need for order and silence in adulthood, but that is my own armchair analysis. There are so many gaps in sleep science that I wonder if sleep is by its nature too mysterious to systematise.If science can’t explain the grey areas around sleep, maybe art can shed a light. It is surprising, given the painting’s sense of joyous night-time, that Van Gogh painted his post-impressionist masterpiece The Starry Night in the midst of depression, after being admitted to an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the summer of 1889. A year before, in a letter dated 16 September 1888, Vincent tells his brother, Theo, that he is doing six to 12 hours of non-stop work, often at night, followed by 12 hours of sleep. By the following year he was in the grip of a “FEARSOME” insomnia. On 9 January 1889, weeks after slicing part of his ear off in a high state of anxiety, he writes to Theo about his torment. He is fighting sleeplessness with a “very, very strong dose of camphor” on his pillow and mattress, he says, and he hopes it will bring an end to the insomnia. “I dare to believe that it won’t recur.” I read Van Gogh’s hope as optimistic desperation. In my case, it has always returned. Yet, even in his “insensible” state, Vincent tells Theo that he is reflecting on the work of Degas, Gauguin and his own art practice; he continues to think, paint, write letters, with the insomnia existing alongside his productivity.View image in fullscreenOne of Louise Bourgeois’s Insomnia Drawings (1994-1995).Photograph: © The Easton Foundation / Licensed by DACS, LondonThe glittering night sky Van Gogh imagines beyond the confines of his asylum is an embodiment of the way we so often think of the gifted artist at night: synapses fizzing, imagination touched by divinity, a compulsively unsleeping genius channelling a heightened state of buoyant creativity. Countless artists and writers have elected to work after dark, from Toulouse-Lautrec, documenting night revelries at the Moulin Rouge, to Franz Kafka, Philip Guston and Patricia Highsmith. Musicians, too: theRolling Stones’ all-night jamin the lead-up to their appearance at Knebworth in 1976, for instance; or Prince, whose recording sessions could last across a continuous 24 hours. Certainly, if Van Gogh still suffered from insomnia when he was painting The Starry Night, it makes sleeplessness seem beatific – a curse turned gift.There is none of this buoyancy in Louise Bourgeois’s night scribblings. She suffered from sleeplessness throughout her life but faced a particularly debilitating bout of night-time anxiety between 1994 and 1995, during which time she made her Insomnia Drawings series. “It is conquerable,” she said, and for her it was conquered, by filling page after page of a drawing diary with deliriously repeated doodles and circles within circles, a mess of scribbles that look like screams on paper. They are so different from the enormous stainless steel, bronze and marble spiders and other caged sculptures for which Bourgeois is better known, but I feel a peculiar kind of excitement upon seeing these images, with their agitating boredom and alertness, side by side.The artist Lee Krasner also painted her way through chronic insomnia, around the time her mother and then her husband, the painter Jackson Pollock, died – the latter in a drink-driving car crash in 1956, with his lover Ruth Kligman, who survived, in the seat beside him. Krasner’s Night Journeys series has some similarities to Bourgeois’s drawings, featuring repeating, abstract patterns, but washed in an earthy sepia brown. The patterns are insect-like, as if ants are crawling across the retina. I am inspired by the images. Rather than seeking escape or avoidance of their sleepless state, Bourgeois and Krasner stare it in the face, and it stares back at them, an abyss of maddening monotony.There has only been one instance in my adult life when sleep became easy. Or rather, it became compulsive – as much as the insomnia was, and perhaps even more disturbing. It happened when Fauzia died in 2016,at the age of 45, of undiagnosed tuberculosis. She had been admitted to hospital with an unknown illness, and lay wired to a ventilator in intensive care. When the hospital called to say she had had a fatal brain haemorrhage one morning, the shock of it was too much to take in. So I began to sleep. No amount was enough and I felt increasingly worried by the long, blank nights, which did not bring relief but became as strangely burdensome as the insomnia had once felt.Haruki Murakami’s novel After Dark features two sisters, the younger, Mari, mourning the older sibling, Eri, who is in a coma-like state. The book takes place over a single night in Tokyo as Mari roams through the city, meeting its nocturnal characters: a trombonist, a Chinese sex worker, the manager of a love hotel. All the while Eri lies in a trapped and mysterious kind of sleep. It might be an undiagnosed illness, a psychological condition or even a radical protest at the world and her place in it – we are never sure.Mari refuses to see her sister as “dead”, even though there seems no prospect of Eri’s waking up. She looks at her sister’s face and thinks that “consciousness just happens to be missing from it at the moment: it may have gone into hiding, but it must certainly be flowing somewhere out of sight, far below the surface, like a vein of water”. This is how I saw Fauzia as she lay in hospital, after her haemorrhage. Even though we were told she’d remain on a ventilator for 24 hours as a formality before being pronounced dead, I kept watching for her to twitch awake, sure that it would happen. It seemed as if she was in a deep sleep, albeit so submerged by it that she had become unreachable.In her lifetime, Fauzia went through long bouts of oversleeping brought on by depression. There seemed to be a rebellion in it, too. From the age of 19, when she first became seriously depressed, she began holing herself up in her room, sleeping for the night and most of the following day. In the medieval era, the act of daytime sleeping, for men and for women, was seen to harm one’s reputation. Many still regard it as slovenly and it can be subversive for exactly this reason. For a woman, especially, to refuse to get up and assume her role in the world – which may be one of monotonous domesticity, of caring for others, or of participating in the tedious, lower-rung machinery of capitalist productivity – might be a defiant act of saying “no”.At night we become more anxious, which sets off a reaction in the nervous system, a surge of adrenaline and cortisolWhat might look like inertia, or passivity, can be an active summoning of inner strength, as suggested by Bruno Bettelheim in his psychoanalytic interpretations of fairytales in The Uses of Enchantment. He speaks of Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) not as an example of meek femininity but as an adolescent “gathering strength in solitude”. Her sleep is a temporary turning inward in order to foment, mobilise and psychically prepare for the battles of adulthood to come.A glassy-eyed, self-medicating woman in Ottessa Moshfegh’s novel My Year of Rest and Relaxation also “hibernates” in her New York apartment. She is a Manhattan princess, narcissistic and hard to like, who does not want to experience any of life’s sharp edges. Yet there is something I recognise in her overwhelming desire to disconnect from the terrible reality of the world. She plans to sleep for a year and wake up cured of her sadness, and she is. My sleep wasn’t a cure, but the oversleeping did eventually lift and leave me feeling less numbed to my own sadness. Now I was glad to be returned to myself, and to my insomnia – an old friend, missed.There is evidence to suggest that women sleep differently from men and feel the effects of insomnia in discrete ways. Professor Dijk cites the familiar list of causes, from lifestyle to social class, wealth and genetics, but he has also found sex-based biological factors, with differences in the brainwaves of women and men when they sleep. Women intrinsically have different circadian rhythms, which are on average six minutes shorter than men’s cycles; they experience more deep (or “slow wave”) sleep and may need to sleep for longer; while a mix of social factors, from breastfeeding to lower-paid shift work, means they face higher levels of insomnia.Sleep science makes a significant connection between hormones and sleep for women in the throes of menopause. About 50% of women who suffer with insomnia as they approach menopause are thought to sleep for less than six hours a night. The cumulative effects of this sleeplessness can be so intense that some have questioned whether they might be linked to UK female suicide rates, which are at their highest between the ages of 50 and 54.View image in fullscreenArifa Akbar.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The  GuardianThis brings another kind of insomnia for me, as I turn 50. It creeps duplicitously into my night, so I don’t recognise it; I fall asleep quickly but am awake again at 4am with alarm-clock precision. This is not the organic and woozy “biphasic” interruption believed by some to have been common in the centuries before electric light, in which communities were said to have a first and then a second sleep through the night, getting up to work or chat in between in a brief window referred to as “the watch”. My brain is pin-sharp, as if the sleep before has been entirely restorative and I am ready to start the day, except there is a move towards a certain line of thought, a search for the faultlines of the previous day, the urgent address of an old argument or decision far in the future. And it is, in its scratchy insistence, so much like Bourgeois’s scribbled red balls and Krasner’s insects, that I wonder if they were experiencing menopausal sleep disruption while creating their works.Whereas younger insomniacs struggle to fall asleep, those in midlife might doze off quickly but wake up in the middle of the night as a result of hormonal changes, and it is in these 4am “reckonings” that they encounter the night-time brain, says Dr Zoe Schaedel, who sits on the British Menopause Society’s medical advisory council. “Our frontal lobe [which regulates logical thought] doesn’t activate as well overnight, and our amygdala [the brain’s command centre for emotions, including fear, rage and anxiety] takes over.” So the very nature of thinking is different at 4am. In the daytime it is primarily logical, but at night we become more rash, anxious, catastrophic. That sets off its own physiological reaction in the nervous system, with a surge of adrenaline and cortisol, as well as rising heart and breathing rates.Between the waking, there is a welter of dreams, so many it seems like someone is changing between the channels on a TV set. Dr Schaedel says this apparent assault of dreams is an illusion. When oestrogen drops, women start sleeping more lightly and waking up in the latter part of the night, in the shallower REM, or dream, phase, which gives the impression of dreaming more because you are waking up more often in the midst of them.Still, I am wrongfooted by this second life in my head, this middle-aged night, as busy, as complicated and as exhausting as the day. When insomnia is at its most agitating, engaging the brain visually may be a way to lull ourselves back to sleep, says Dr Schaedel. This idea makes better sense of Bourgeois’s scribbling. Maybe I would find my own recurring patterns on paper if I did the same thing, I think, and so I put a notebook beside my bed. I know I have had a maelstrom of dreams but, when I try to discover them on paper, it is like a stuck sneeze. I write a few words down, but I am left straining for more. A few snatched images come back, but far more float out of view, so much unreachable. The next night I can recall even fewer details, although I know I have dreamed heavily. So my odyssey of dreams evades any attempt at codification. They are determined to remain mysterious, on the other side of daytime.This is an edited extract from Wolf Moon: A Woman’s Journey into the Night, published by Sceptre on 3 July at (£16.99).

The volume was set to near-silence – my dad, asleep in another room, had schizophrenia and frontal lobe syndrome, and I didn’t want to wake him. Then, like some divine interruption to the endless blur of news and repeats, I stumbled acrossBuffy the Vampire Slayer. The show may have been barely audible, but it hit me like a lightning bolt.Before Buffy, life was like a pressure cooker. I secretly yearned for a more alternative lifestyle, but even wearing jeans would have been a big deal in my family. I had an assisted place at a private school as my parents were quite poor. Mum would say: “If you don’t study, we’ll have to put you in the other school, and you’ll just get beaten up.” It sounds like fear-mongering, but she was right: the students in the local school were known to beat Pakistani people up every Shrove Tuesday. So I dedicated my life to working hard.After Buffy, the foundations of my world imploded. I made a secret Myspace account, and got into metal bands such as Kittie and Murderdolls. I started wearing lipstick and eyeliner, got tattoos and bought a PVC skirt on eBay. For a while I felt like two people: I was the same old Sofia in the week, but on a Saturday I’d step into my new identity and hang out on Goth Green – a patch of grass near a couple of shops selling alternative music and clothes.As a young Punjabi person with conservative Pakistani roots, my future felt predetermined and grim. But Buffy cracked open my understanding of feminism: suddenly it wasn’t just some abstract, academic concept; it was cool and empowering. For Buffy, defeating the series’ villain, the Master, seemed impossible, but she always kept going.I remembered how Buffy always got back up, no matter how broken she wasHer resilience became a lifeline, especially during one particularly dark incident. It was my cousin’s wedding, and I wore a black sari – an incredibly liberating act for me at the time. A family member came to our house afterwards: he was angry, and, as well as not approving of my clothes, claimed I’d spoken to him disrespectfully. After a heated argument, he beat me up. I remembered how Buffy always got back up, no matter how broken she was. That image of defiance really stuck with me in that moment; it gave me the strength to get back on my feet.Because my dad was ill, we had a lot of people, mostly men, visit our house and try to tell me what to do with my life. They said I should go to Pakistan and have an arranged marriage. Witnessing Buffy’s independence made me realise I didn’t have to follow a prescribed path. Instead, I took the leap and did an art foundation at Newcastle College, which was where I found a new community. Naturally, Mum found it hard to accept that her daughter was an art student – so much so she told people I was studying geography.I’m glad to say that she came around eventually. At first, she called Buffy “rubbish” in Punjabi, and said what I was going through was just a phase. Thanks to some encouragement from my cousins, she started to realise the show wasn’t too much of a leap from the south Asian dramas on Zee TV that she loved. She even got so at ease with my aesthetic that she bought me silver flame New Rock boots for my birthday from one of the Goth Green shops.Decades later, I now work as a freelance multidisciplinary artist. I’d never have guessed that a TV show would have been the catalyst that propelled me here. The most unexpected twist of all: Buffy made my mum go to Goth Green.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The surge in sales pushed UK fiction revenue above £1bn for the first time.View image in fullscreenCustomers at Saucy Books in Notting Hill, which has turned into a meeting spot for like-minded book lovers.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“The popularity of the store speaks for itself,” says Sarah Maxwell, the founder of Saucy Books. “We even had to ticket our first week and give time slots to customers.”But she believes sexism is keeping the genre from the mainstream. “There’s so much snobbery and bias,” Maxwell says. “People think it’s less than or low quality, which is not true at all. These are all very high quality authors and high quality stories.“I think there’s an inherent misogyny around it. A lot of the time, the sorts of things that women like across arts and culture tends to get discounted. These books are about the female perspective and female gaze when most media is through the male gaze.Romantasy and BookTok driving a huge rise in science fiction and fantasy salesRead more“That’s why I have a smut hut, because I feel like we need to reclaim some of these words.”The smut hut, a space dedicated to erotic titles, sits in the corner, adorned with ornaments such as whipped suncream, chapstick and a placard reading “Traders Dicks”. It’s seems less like a bookstore and more a community centre.During the Guardian’s visit on Thursday afternoon, dozens of women filter through the shop, browsing titles and starting conversations about their favourite authors. Most of them have learned about the store through TikTok.View image in fullscreenThe smut hut at Saucy Books, a space dedicated to erotic titles.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianOne customer is browsing the shelves with her mother. She says she can get through a novel in under three hours, and last year she read 300 books.Deck chairs and a tiki parasol adorn the store’s perimeter, while inside brightly painted shelves hold up titles such as Swept Away, The Unhoneymooners and The Friendship Fling.“I was really surprised that a shop like this didn’t already exist,” says Maxwell, a creative strategist and former tech executive from LA. “When I went to find books of OG romance writers, I couldn’t find any of them in-store. It made me quite angry. You have these amazing authors, who carry the publishing industry – 20% of fiction sales is romance books – and they’re getting no shelf space whatsoever. I felt like I needed to do something.”A genre of swords and soulmates: the rise and rise of ‘romantasy’ novelsRead moreMany contemporary romance books are marketed under tropes such as “enemies to lovers”, “forbidden love” and “second chance romance”. The “romantasy” genre (a blend of romance and fantasy) is a constant fixture on bestseller lists, largely due to the dedicated following it has gained on TikTok.Series such as Rebecca Yarros’s Fourth Wing and Sarah J Maas’s A Court of Thorns and Roses (known by fans as Acotar) feature female protagonists entering high-stakes relationships in magical worlds.Jessica Roberts, a shop assistant at Saucy Books, has noticed that the current craze is for a trip to the wild west. “Cowboy romances are very popular right now. Two girls came in their cowboy boots to purchase them yesterday,” she says.Among those visiting the store on Thursday are Rebecca Pollard and Haley Page from New York. “I got [Haley] all the Acotar books, I think they’re the best way to start. They’re like a gateway drug into becoming a psycho,” Pollard laughs.“I feel like a cult leader. I have a library at my house, and when my friends call me I’m like, ‘what do you need? I’ve got it’. People are like, ‘I’m so happy it’s books for you and not drugs, because you’re such a pusher’.”View image in fullscreenHaley Page, left, and Rebecca Pollard. Pollard bought Page Sarah J Maas’s Acotar series, which she says is the best way to get into the romantasy genre.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianPage says: “I’m a very hard sell, but she tells me something and I will listen. I’m so excited to read these, I’m taking them to Mykonos tonight. I’m going to be at the beach with my new book boyfriend, and I’ll be calling Rebecca every second like ‘oh my god’.”Pollard says she’s been waiting desperately for the sixth book in the Acotar series. “I would do anything to become invisible and just go and check Sarah J Maas’s laptop.”And she thumbs her nose at the mainstream responses to the genre.“I get really defensive when people use derogatory terms. Don’t call it fairy porn until you’ve read it, because you have to wait 380 pages for a kiss in the second book of Acotar. Why is it smut, because it’s centred around female pleasure?

The building will hold a rotating selection from Lacma’s permanent collection of more than 150,000 art objects from around the globe.The creation of the new gallery space has been marked by unusual drama and contention. One of Lacma’s major donorspublicly broke with the museumas a result of conflict over how the permanent collection would be displayed. The construction site, which borders the LaBrea Tar Pits, is famous for the ancient fossils preserved in bubbling tar. Building a gigantic concrete building on tar-filled land in an earthquake-prone region caused additional costs and delays: thirteen sabre tooth tiger skulls were uncovered during construction.As the estimated cost of the project rose by nearly $100m, Zumthor, the star architect,publicly distanced himselffrom the results, saying he had repeatedly been forced to “reduce” his design, and that the experience had convinced him to never again work in the US.The building, which was initially conceived as anall-black structureevoking a tar pit or an oil spill, will now remain the raw gray of unadorned concrete.On Thursday, Lacma’s CEO, Michael Govan, who has championed the divisive project fornearly two decades, gave an early tour of the new space to a group of journalists, including some who have publicly criticized the building’s design. The building, named the David Geffen Galleries after its largest donor, will officially open in 2026.View image in fullscreenMichael Govan, the CEO of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, has spent nearly two decades defending his vision for a hulking concrete gallery designed by a star architect.Photograph: Gary Leonard/Museum Associates/LACMAOutside, the structure resembles a gleaming dinosaur egg on squat concrete legs, with a long tail of a gallery that curves over Wilshire Boulevard, allowing visitors to enter on both sides of the street. Inside, the building is all hulking concrete surfaces and curving walls of windows that let in the southernCaliforniasun – a striking but controversial choice for a museum, since paintings and drawings are typically kept out of direct sunlight.Govan defended the wraparound windows as essential for giving the museum a sense of place; he wanted visitors to “know you’re in Los Angeles – these collections are in Los Angeles”.The CEO led a crowd of journalists into one of the gallery’s multiple entrances, which is at the top of a daunting flight of concrete steps. The museum CEO loves stairs, he explained: the only exercise he gets is climbing Lacma building stairs and pacing while talking on the phone.As Govan walked the journalists through the sinuous galleries, he was energetic, full of quotations and anecdotes about Zumthor, his star architect. Zumthor was not there.Govan noted that the sleek leather benches in the sunlit galleries were only there as temporary place-holders: Zumthor had requested red-brown leather benches stuffed with duck feathers, which had yet to be installed.When asked to respond to the many criticisms of the project, the CEO was defensive. The “whole idea” of the space “was a new idea, right, so you can’t – no one’s ever experienced this before”, he said. “That is the spirit of experimentation. That proof will be in the final results – of whether it works, and how the public responds to it.”View image in fullscreenThe building was designed by the prizewinning Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and has sparked controversy in the art world.Photograph: Iwan BaanOpposition to Zumthor’s evolving design had been fierce. Some of the most dedicated critics of “the blob” hated it so much they held analternative design competitionand boughtfull-page newspaper adsin protest.But to Govan, his building is not just a new gallery: it’s a fundamentally new way of experiencing art, an attempt “to reinvent art history for the 21st century”.The space was designed to be “non-hierarchical”, Govan said. He did not want to organize the museum’s permanent collection by time period or geography or type of art: he recalled telling Zumthor that “I don’t want anyone in the front.”In practice, this means that all of the gallery space is on a single floor, and the layout of the rooms is unpredictable and confusing to navigate.“The building itself really avoids linear histories or linear paths,” Govan said. “The remit was to make something that was more like wandering in a park, where you curate your own journey.” When the gallery opens in 2026, Govan said, the first show will be organized around the “muse” of four different oceans, includinga mix of Mediterranean art, and a Pacific collection that brings together California artists with those from Japan.Zumthor and Govan’s vision has its prominent defenders. Brad Pitt showed up to a public meeting in 2019 to praise Zumthor’s “mastery of light and shadow”, and spoke in favor of the new Lacma building for so long that an elected official told him to “wrap it up”. Architectural Digest, in a preview piece in June,hailed the new building’s“curatorial provocations and challenges to the shibboleths of the art world”.View image in fullscreenThe wraparound windows are essential for giving the museum a sense of place, says the head of Lacma.Photograph: Iwan BaanBut while the journalists on Friday’s preview tour were polite, their questions made clear that the criticisms of Lacma’s new building were not going away.The practicality of the concrete walls has remained front and center in the debates, including in aseries of eviscerating columnsby Los Angeles Times’ art critic Christopher Knight, who won a 2020 Pulitzer prize for his critiques of a building plan funded in part by$125m in taxpayer dollars.“How do you hang paintings on concrete walls?” Knightasked in 2019, calling the idea “nutty”. He nicknamed Zumthor’s building “the Incredible Shrinking Museum”, noting that the amount of planned gallery space in the new structure had shrunk throughout the planning process, resulting in asmaller amount of total display spacethan in the razed buildings it replaced.Asked again on Friday about how curators would hang art on the minimalist concrete, Govan was breezy: “You can just drill right into the walls,” he said. “It’s very sturdy–you can hang Assyrian relief.”When they needed to change the exhibit, Govan said, they would simply fill up those holes and drill new ones. He noted that there were several patches on the walls already.Someone asked if constantly drilling and patching the walls would destroy the beautiful minimalist surface of the concrete.“It’s supposed to be like a good pair of old blue jeans that gets better with time,” the CEO said. And he believed in the new gallery’s longevity. Earlier, he had said, buoyantly, “This building could last 500 years.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As it turns out, so was my future spouse. I was emboldened by the emotion of a recent breakup, the energy of a girls night and, perhaps, liquid courage.Maybe it was also the magic of the bar, because when I spotted him across the room, I flicked a peanut at him. Within a matter of hours, we were parting, and he was saying “I love you.”These days instead of a group of friends, I come with a lot of media equipment – straps, cords, cameras, laptop, and a black paper journal and pen – as I set out to explore dive bar culture in Montana.I begin my reporting at the Filling Station, located on the outskirts of now trendy Bozeman, a few miles from my home. Inside, the walls are covered with vintage license plates, street signs, a large red flying horse at ceiling height, a buffalo mount with a Hawaiian lei and a stuffed deer head ridden by a skeleton.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA colorful wall in the men’s room at the Haufbrau in Bozeman, Montana.Photograph: Janie Osborne“That stuff just accumulates,” says Bill Frye, who owns the bar with his mother, Cin, and brother Don. “I think the skeleton was a Halloween prop that ended up on the deer that was already mounted.”“The deer is new,” he adds. And by “new” he means within the last 20 years. “A regular who is a taxidermist brought that down.”In addition to the deer, many other things on the Filler’s walls have been donated by customers, some en route to the city dump down the road. Others were collected by Bill’s parents more than 20 years ago.“The bison head is off the record,” Bill says. But then as the conversation unfolds, he reveals a few scant details: third floor, a lodge near Glacier national park, a rope, taxidermy and a bunch of guys who brought it down here. But, he concludes, thinking out loud, they are all dead now, so it’s OK to write about it.The variety of people who come to the Filler (and the Hauf) are as colorful as the decor. You see everything from pressed Oxford shirts to cowboy boots to camouflage pants to 1980s attire to bare feet in Birkenstocks (in cold weather).View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIntimate moments at the Filling Station, also known as the Filler.Photograph: Janie OsborneThese days, Bozeman is home to all kinds of fancy bars, from social club to wine to rooftop, yet “there are no more [dive bars] coming in,” says Bill. Because of the high cost of commercial properties and alcohol licenses, “[it takes] a minimum of several million to open a new bar in Bozeman. When we purchased the Hauf in 1969 the whole thing was under $100,000. It was a lot at the time. But we couldn’t afford to sell it now with the high property-gains tax. We are caught in a trap.”Given all the new high-end choices, it’s a bit of curiosity that people continue to show up in cultlike fashion at both the Filler and the Hauf. “People like the fact that they feel at home,” Cin says. “We [the owners] can drive by one of the bars and know who’s in there by the cars outside.”It’s a community center where you feel relaxed, Bill and Cin agree. “Several customers tell us if we weren’t here they would be gone too,” says Bill.When I enter Dusty’s Bar in the dry land farming community of Brady, Montana, my first reaction is: “This is a dive bar? It’s so clean.”The polished wooden bar and shiny floors are the result of a renovation during the pandemic in 2020, says owner Kourtney Combs, who purchased Dusty’s in 2019. The spotlessness is a good thing, because many people come here to eat.Every Friday, Kourtney’s partner, Travis Looney, starts smoking meat – barbecue pork, tri-tip, briquet, sausage, ribs, turkey – at around 3am so it’s ready to go by 5pm. By 7pm, it’s sold out. In addition to having great food, Dusty’s is also a place where customers chip in.“If I get too busy, people will just get up and start helping,” says Combs. “They’ll take their dishes back. They’ll stock the cooler. They’ll clear other people’s plates. If I have to leave the bar for 20 minutes, it will take care of itself. Customers will get their own drinks. Honor system. We trust them.”When I sit at the bar with locals Gus Winterrowd, a retired farmer; Jeff Farkell, a crop consultant; and Dan Rouns, a retired farmer and previous Dusty’s owner, the conversation spans topics as far-ranging as life before technology to soil samples to memories of spinning records in the disco bar upstairs. This is how we landed on the topic of the “cancer belt”.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: At Dusty’s Bar, green chips are given to customers who are treated to drinks by other customers. The chips can be held on to and redeemed at any time.Bottom: Gus Winterrowd, a local, enjoys a laugh at Dusty’s in Brady, Montana.Photograph: Janie OsborneWinterrowd tells the group he heard the term from his wife’s doctor in Seattle when he asked: “What’s the deal with all the cancer in our area?” And the doctor responded: “It’s the cancer belt,” referring to the rate of illness in women in communities across the midwest to northern plains.“She put up one hell of a fight,” says Rouns about Winterrowd’s wife. “She did anything any person could do.”At this point in the conversation, I realize that a big part of the beauty of the dive bar is that it’s a place of connection, a place where real people come to know each othe in real time.Of course, such moments of gravity are balanced with humor: “We give each other shit. Ninety-ninety percent of the time we all get along. And we don’t talk politics unless we’re really drunk,” says Farkell.Forty-six miles down the road from Brady on the Missouri River, in the small city of Great Falls, I’m crouched with my camera near a mannequin wearing a repurposed prom dress in a room overflowing with fabrics, threads and sequins.At center is a Singer sewing machine and at the helm, Sandra Thares, seamstress of mermaid costumes and owner of the Sip ’n Dip Lounge, a tiki retro cocktail bar. Yes, mermaid costumes. Sip ’n Dip features windows with underwater views of swimming mermaids. (Currently, there are no mermen.)View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Mermaid Bingo Night at the Sip ‘n Dip Lounge in Great Falls, Montana.Bottom: A Sip ‘n Dip bartender shows off his tattoo.Photograph: Janie OsborneAs part of their employment, each mermaid receives two tails and two tops per tail – all handmade by Thares. In 1996, the first swimming mermaid was a housekeeper dressed in a green plastic tablecloth on New Year’s Eve.Over time, the concept became popular and grew into a regular weekend event. It’s now a defining aspect of the bar, with mermaids putting on a show six or seven times a week. Mermaid Bingo Night was added in 2024. The evening entails three rounds of bingo in which the mermaids hold up the number cards. It is, as Thares puts it, “something to do on a cold Montana winter Monday”.Usually, everyone gets a Hawaiian lei. The prizes are not monetary but instead they are “fabulous” rewards.No matter what is happening on any given evening, Thares says, “I always tell people that the thing about the Sip ’n Dip is that it doesn’t matter who you are, where you are from, what your background is, what your political beliefs are, none of that matters [at] the Sip’ n Dip; there’s always something to talk about. And no matter who you are, you make new friends.”At each dive bar that I visit, people share the details of other dive bars that I should go to. More than once, people point me in the direction of Sun River and the “bra bar”, more formally known as the Rambling Inn – a place where customers leave their bras behind to hang on the walls in exchange for free drinks. Alas, the bra theme is great fodder for good-natured double entendres regarding “cups” and a fun starting point for lighthearted conversation.Throughout my dive bar tour, the Helsinki Bar – the last remaining building in Finn Town in the small mining community of Butte – kept calling me back.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Janie OsborneView image in fullscreenTop: People celebrate St Urho’s Day, a Finnish holiday that honors the fictional St Urho, at Helsinki Bar in Butte, Montana.Bottom: Fiina Heinze is crowned 2025 Queen of St Urho’s Day at Helsinki Bar.Photograph: Janie OsborneI was previously there on St Urho’s Day, a Finnish holiday celebrating the fictional St Urho, when I met Fiina Heinze. Heinze is of Finnish descent, and I witnessed her crowning as the 2025 Queen of St Urho’s Day amid a packed bar, jello shots and premade plastic bags filled with a mysterious mixed drink.According to Heinze, St Urho is celebrated for driving away the grasshoppers that were destroying the grape crops in Finland. The holiday is something of a whimsical Finnish rivalry to St Patrick’s Day: “It’s just a day that the Finns decided to have [on] the day before St Patrick’s Day. It’s not a national holiday.”I think that’s the thing about dive bars: in large part, they are about stories. The stories that we listen to and that we share. The stories we experience while we are there.And if you’re lucky, it can mark the beginning of a new story with a lifelong partner.All this, I think, is like the dive bar itself: an expression of that imperfect, enduring and sometimes sticky thing called love."

He says people are looking for something that brings “big flavour” to their plate.Today the horizons of ketchup lovers are no longer limited to tomatoes. There are beetroot, tamarind and even beer flavour ketchups after Brewdog’s recent launch of a variety inspired by its Hazy Jane IPA.View image in fullscreenForaging Fox’s beetroot ketchup.Photograph: PRIf it’s mayo you love the choice is equally mind-boggling, as traditional Hellmann’s competes with everything from wasabi and yuzu flavours to smoked jalapenoand gochujang– Korean fermented red chilli paste. And that’s before you even contemplate the options for barbecue or chilli sauce.With Britons spending close to £1bn a year on sauces and condiments, companies are shaking things up to win sales as shoppers either trade down from household names into cheaper supermarket own-label sauces, or up – treating themselves to a dollop of something posh and artisanal on their plate.Indeed almost half (49%) of consumers polled by the online grocer Ocado said they were “more adventurous with sauces than they used to be”. Among 25- to 34-year-olds this figure rose to 72%.“Legacy sauces like brown sauce and traditional ketchup are losing relevance with younger consumers,” Rumble Romagnoli, the founder of the hot sauce startup Chilli No 5, recently told the industry magazine the Grocer: “These categories are crying out for a refresh.”Hot sauces exploded in popularity during lockdown when people had time on their hands and started experimenting more in the kitchen. Since then the flavour wagon has moved on to “swicy” – sweet and spicy – flavours, such as hot honey and even “swalcy” – a combination of sweet, salty and spicy.“We’re seeing so many new products because food has become one of the quickest ways to connect with culture,” says Guy White, the chief executive of the consultancy Catalyx. “Social media, travel, and global communities mean once-local flavours go global almost overnight.“Flavours don’t stand still. What was once considered niche, for example piri piri or sriracha, is now an everyday staple for many families.” The next wave of sauces will be rooted in regional pride, he predicts, reeling off a list that includes gochujang’s fermented depth, chimichurri’s herbal kick, West African spice mixes, miso-based umami and chipotle layered with honey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This sumptuous coffee and walnut cake, which you, too, can whip up in less than an hourFelicity CloakeSat 28 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTShareToday is my birthday, so I’m celebrating with a classic that, for all the stickytres lechesand sophisticatedsachertortesI’ve enjoyed in recent years, remains my absolute favourite, my desert island cake: that darling of the WI tea tent, the coffee and walnut sandwich. The greatNigel Slater once named ithis last meal on Earth, and I’m hoping to have it for tea.Prep30 minCook25 minServes8225g room-temperature butter4 tbsp instant coffee(see step 1)100g walnut halves4 eggs225g soft light brown sugar225g plain flour3 tsp baking powder¼ tsp fine saltMilk(optional)For the icing165g room-temperature butter425g icing sugar¼ tsp salt4 tbsp double cream(optional)1 Soften the butter and brew the coffeeView image in fullscreenIf you’ve forgotten to get your butter out of the fridge, begin by dicing and spacing it out on the paper to soften (remember, you’ll need some for the icing, too).Mix the coffee with two tablespoons of boiling water and leave to cool – I like the nostalgic flavour of instant coffee here, but you can substitute three tablespoons of espresso or other strong coffee, if you prefer.2 Toast the nutsView image in fullscreenToast the walnut halves in a dry pan until they smell nutty, then set aside a quarter of the most handsome-looking ones to use as decoration later. Roughly chop the rest. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and base line two 20cm sandwich tins. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat.3 Cream the butter and sugarView image in fullscreenPut the butter in a food mixer or a large bowl anchored with a damp cloth to steady it, then beat it briefly to soften. Crumble in the sugar to break up any lumps, then carry on beating for several minutes, until the butter is really light and fluffy; scrape down the bowl as required.4 Add the eggs and flourView image in fullscreenWith the mixer (or your wooden spoon) still going, gradually pour in the eggs and beat to incorporate, again scraping the sides as necessary.View image in fullscreenTip the flour and baking powder into a bowl, whisk to knock out any lumps, then add to the batter. Using a large metal spoon, gently fold the bottom of the mixture over the top, but do so only once.5 Add the coffee and chopped nutsView image in fullscreenAdd the salt, half the coffee (keep the rest for the icing) and the chopped walnuts, then slowly fold in, just until the flour and coffee are completely incorporated – bear in mind that the more more vigorously you fold, the more air you will knock out of the batter, so it’s important not to overdo it.View image in fullscreen6 Finish the batter, then bakeThe batter should by now fall from the spoon, slightly reluctantly but without the need for violent agitation; if it doesn’t, loosen with a little milk. Divide evenly between the two tins (weigh them for perfection).View image in fullscreenPut in the oven, on the middle shelf if using a conventional setting, and bake for about 25 minutes (check after 20, though!), until well risen but not too dark. Remove the tins from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then take out of the tins and put on a rack to cool completely.7 Start the icingView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, make the icing. Beat the butter until soft; my mixer is not good with smaller amounts so I tend to use a mixing bowl, again anchored to the work surface with a damp cloth, and electric beaters or a wooden spoon. Sift in the icing sugar to get rid of any lumps, then add the salt.8 Finish the icingView image in fullscreenBeat to combine, then add the reserved cooled coffee and the cream – though optional, the latter does make the icing easier to spread; for a less rich result; use a splash of milk instead. Put the less perfect looking of the two cakes (there’s always one) on a platter.9 Decorate, then serveView image in fullscreenTop the cake on the platter with a little less than half the icing, leaving it thicker around the edges where it will be seen, then pop the second cake on top. Spoon the remaining icing over the second cake, spreading it out neatly and adding a few swirls for interest, then arrange the reserved toasted walnuts pleasingly all over the top. Avoid chilling before slicing and serving, unless it’s really necessary.Felicity Cloake’s new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisine, is published by Mudlark at £16.99.

But lately a new culinary export from Japan is catching up with fish and rice in the hearts and tastebuds of British foodies.Soft, sweet and full of character, Japanese-style desserts – from mochi ice cream to matcha cookies – have been steadily gaining ground on UK shelves.Such is their popularity, M&S has launched its own take on the strawberry sando, a Japanese convenience store favourite, a sandwich made with soft milk bread, whipped cream and neatly layered fruit.According to some industry commentators, British retailers are taking note of consumers’ growing appetite for “joyful” sweet treats as a simple pleasure to brighten their days.“We’re seeing people turn to food as an antidote to life’s uncertainties – they’re looking for small, joyful indulgences that feel novel, premium and culturally rich,” said Charles Banks, a co-founder of TheFoodPeople, a UK-based food trends consultancy.“Japanese sweets … bring playful formats, surprising textures and beautifully balanced flavours that tap into this mood perfectly. Add in TikTok’s power to visually amplify the unfamiliar and suddenly these once niche delights are must-haves.”View image in fullscreenWagashi, traditional Japanese confections.Photograph: Richard Bord/Getty ImagesAt Ocado, searches for mochi are up 96.2% year on year, while searches for “Japanese” have risen by more than a third over the same period.Yuki Gomi, a Japanese chef and food writer, said it was wonderful to see the trend, even if it reflected only a slice of Japan’s “rich sweets culture”, where desserts are “cute, comforting and often tied to the seasons”.She said the appeal of these sweets lay not just in their flavour but in their texture and “in mouth-feel”. “Japanese sweets are often lighter and less sugary than their western equivalents, and there’s real joy in the textures – soft and creamy mochi ice cream, airy sponge, the crisp snap of Pocky.”It’s that sensory experience – along with the playful fusion of Japanese flavours and sweet treats already familiar to UK shoppers – that helps explain why more of these snacks are now landing on British supermarket shelves. “Quite often, the sweets are given a Japanese twist – maybe a hint of matcha, yuzu or kinako. A familiar treat, with a fresh Japanese flavour,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

We’re particularly seeing the rise of global flavours, third-culture cuisine, and consumers adopting a ‘try anything’ attitude.”These foreign food trends and adoptions of cuisines should be seen as a natural expression of a truly globalised world, said the gourmet tour operator and cookbook authorRoberta Muir.She said we should expect more fusions, fun interpretations and internationally inspired snacks to continue cropping up on supermarket shelves. “As the world becomes smaller and people increasingly travel from one corner of it to another, it’s natural they bring home a taste for the new flavours they’ve discovered.”Explore more on these topicsJapanese food and drinkFoodMarks & SpencerRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Is anyone still makingthe baked feta pasta from 2021? Has the“marry me chicken”resulted in an uptick in matrimonies? But the tossed noodles (guay tiew klook) currentlydoing the roundson Thai social media platforms really whet my appetite. In short, they’re noodles tossed with mince, garlic oil and a dark, sweet, salty and tangy hot sauce, and they just make so much sense that they really couldn’tnotbe great. I love them, so I’m passing on the baton to you using a combination of crumbly tempeh and walnuts instead of the mince.Thai-style tossed walnut and tempeh noodlesBlack vinegar (Chinkiang vinegar) andLaoganma crispy chilli in oilcan be found in south-east Asian supermarkets or online, while Thai Taste makes a great and widely available vegan fish sauce. You’ll need a food processor to blitz the tempeh and nuts.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4200g tempeh, cut into chunks75g shelled walnuts200g folded rice noodles7 tbsp rapeseed oil150g beansprouts, rinsed and drained6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced3 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp black vinegar1½ tbsp vegan fish sauce1½ tbsp brown sugar1½ tbsp lime juice(from 1 lime)8 spring onions(100g), trimmed, whites and greens finely sliced1½ tbsp Laoganma crispy chilli in oil sediment20g fresh coriander, choppedIn the small bowl of a food processor, blitz the tempeh and walnuts to a coarse rubble the size of peas or smaller. Cook the rice noodles according to the packet instructions, then lift out, drain, rinse under the cold tap. Coat with a tablespoon of the oil and put to one side.Put a wide frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the beansprouts and a splash of water. Stir-fry for two minutes, then tip into a colander.Put three tablespoons of rapeseed oil in the same wide frying pan and set it on a medium heat. Once hot, add the garlic, fry for about two minutes, until crisp, then tip into a small heatproof bowl. Stir the soy sauce, black vinegar, fish sauce, brown sugar and lime juice into the garlic bowl.Put the remaining three tablespoons of oil in the same frying pan, keep the heat on medium and, when the oil is very hot, add three-quarters of the spring onions and cook, stirring, for two minutes. Add the tempeh and walnut mixture and fry, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until it turns crumbly and golden.Put the noodles in a large bowl, and top with the tempeh and walnut mixture, the beansprouts, the remaining raw spring onions, the chilli oil sediment and the coriander. Pour on the dressing, toss well and serve.Explore more on these topicsNoodlesThe new veganVegetablesFoodVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkMain courseNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

I was living alone in a flat in Sydney and getting ready for a friend-of-a-friend’s 30th that night. I wanted to look vengefully hot for the occasion – someone who had recently dumped me was going to be there. But later that night I forgot all about my ex.As I was sitting in the back garden at the party, making balloon animals, I looked up and saw a man wearing a bright blue floral 80s outfit – a dress and matching jacket – with fishnet stockings and a floppy hat. It was a circus freaks-themed party and he was one of only a handful of other guests who had dressed up, the only Bearded Lady among us. His humour and confidence glowed as brightly as his pearl choker and matching clip-on earrings. I instantly sensed a very strong connection.The moment I knew: he lost an election, but he was still smilingRead moreDrew and I followed each other around all evening, trying not to let the other realise it. A few days later I sent him some pictures from the party and we wasted an entire week of our respective employers’ time emailing all day every day, each trying to flirtatiously out-funny the other. Finally, I asked him out for a drink.We started dating and suddenly we’d been together for eight months. Before our first Christmas as a couple, I got wind that he was planning to buy me a kitten. Feeling headstrong about my independence, I gazumped him by buying a kitten for myself. I wasn’t ready to share a pet.View image in fullscreenJessica and Drew with her new kitten on Christmas Day in 2005We slotted easily into each other’s lives, sharing eclectic circles of friends, love for our close families and travel. After a year, he moved from the Central Coast to be closer to me in Sydney; after two, he moved into the flat with me and my cat.Three years later, alone on a beach in Borneo except for the three men fixing a generator just behind us, Drew proposed to me. I was taken aback. I didn’t feel ready to settle down and I said no immediately. “I’m not ready,” I uttered. Drew simply kissed me and said: “I’ll wait until you are”.When he said that, something clicked. I realised that whether I was ready was immaterial. I’d never felt ready for anything I’ve done that was exciting and wonderful and worthwhile. I was ready to not let that stop me.After a few moments I said “yes”. It was the best decision I’ve ever made.View image in fullscreenJessica Dettmann and Drew Truslove in Borneo in 2008.We got married in 2009. We’ve faced many challenges since – the terminal illness and death of Drew’s father, fertility hurdles, the births of two babies who could stay awake for Australia, postpartum depression, and much more – and Drew has been exactly the right balance of strong, brave, funny, sad, vulnerable, supportive, clever, kind and loving.View image in fullscreenWith Drew as my champion, I said yes to a whole lot more in life too, including writing my first book. In return, it has been the best thing ever to watch as he has thrived in his own life, as an artist. Seeing Drew’s work on gallery walls and in people’s homes thrills me every time, and there’s no one who deserves it more.As for my kitten, Gusto, she’s about to turn 20.

All in a day’s work on the internet. Offline, though, they have found themselves less equipped for the consequences of affluence. A string of kidnappings has plagued the industry over the past year and left traders across the globe paranoid, fearful and keen to invest in physical security measures.Arsalan grew up working class in Karachi, Pakistan. He hustles in any setting. At 14, he started a business exporting T-shirts overseas. By 17, the pandemic swept it all away. Inside, online and penniless, the booming world of Bitcoin beckoned him.To learn how to trade digital coins, he would record himself explaining how the markets worked. His phone didn’t have enough storage to keep the videos, so he’d upload them onto Facebook groups. To his surprise, people were watching.Israel-linked group hacks Iranian cryptocurrency exchange in $90m heistRead moreArsalan says he went from $24 to $340,000 in five years. Along the way, the 23-year-old amassed more than 160,000 followers across various social media channels.“Crypto is my bloodline,” he says. “It’s the only business that accepted me when I was poor.”But a knock at the door on Christmas Day, 2024, would reveal the price of his audience. A group of men bundled him into the back of a flashing police car. They darted through checkpoints with ease, driving further away from Karachi and into the night. After an hour, they stopped. With a gun to his temple, Arsalan was ordered to take out his phone, reset its passwords, and hand it over. Holding the keys to his kingdom, the car sped away.Once home, Arsalan ran to the computer and opened his Binance wallet. It was empty. As he stared at the zeroes on the screen, five years of sacrifice washed over him. 16-hour days alone in his office. Parties unattended. Purchases never made. Life as Pakistan’s cryptocurrency posterboy was over.“I made this money from very, very hard work,” he says. “After this case, I will not trust anyone.”Increase in kidnappingsArsalan’s abduction is not an isolated event; kidnappings of cryptocurrency industry figures have surged in the past 18 months. There have been at least 231 physical attacks against digital asset holders to date, according tonews reports. Almost a third of these have taken place since the start of 2024.This year, a single French gang cut off the finger of an entrepreneur, doused an influencer’s father in gasoline and tried to snatch a CEO’s daughter from the streets of Paris, according to French police. An Italian investor was tortured with a chainsaw and taser for weeks in a New York City townhouse, local police said. A British trader was allegedly held captive in a Spanish hotel room. A popular influencer in Houston, Texas, was held at gunpoint and pistol-whipped in her own home while her three assailants demanded millions in cryptocurrency, according tolocal news reports. The list goes on.As the industry matures, so does the cybersecurity guarding exchanges and wallets. The value stored within these digital vaults is soaring. The result: hacks are becoming heists. Cryptocurrency has long suffered from sophisticated and devastating digital attacks. Now, however, thefts are manifesting in the offline world, too. For the industry’s high-rollers, the targets on their backs have never felt heavier.View image in fullscreenPolice officers stand alert on a street in Mereau, near Vierzon, central France, as they secure the area following the kidnapping of David Balland, co-founder of crypto company Ledger.Photograph: Tom Masson/AFP/Getty Images“Everybody’s a bit on edge,” says Louis d’Origny, the founder of FTXCreditor, a platform that buys bankruptcy claims. “In five minutes, you can find someone’s address. You can see our wallets online. You can see millions of dollars a day transacting out of these wallets. You’d be very tempted to show up at a house with a machete.”Recent attacks have even led his co-founder to move house, after realizing his home address was available online.Navigating an increasingly dangerous offline world, the industry is on edge, feeling as though securing their empires now falls to them as law enforcement struggles to keep up.Cost of blockchain fortunesBuilding one’s fortunes on blockchains entails novel risks.Firstly, blockchains, the technology on which cryptocurrency is based, create public ledgers, so balances and transactions are visible. Every online wallet corresponds with an address in the form of a randomly generated series of characters. To avoid hacking, bigger sums are typically stored offline, on a small piece of hardware called a “cold wallet”, which also corresponds to a public address. Assailants invade homes to steal devices or force hostages to unlock their online wallet at gunpoint.Criminals have started to find who owns which wallet, by using illicit software to analyze blockchain data. Other times, they will hack exchanges to access personal data, as was the case last month, when Coinbase support agents in India were bribed to leak the data of 70,000 users.“A lot of these [crypto] guys thought they were moving around in silence. But, people are now able to find out that they are actually some of the richest guys in their cities,” says says a US-based founder and trader, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Secondly, transactions are instant and permission-less – kidnappers don’t need a bank to approve their withdrawal. This can also make looted funds easier to hide. Assets are swiftly sent to various decentralized exchanges, which do not require know-your-customer information. Once there, funds can’t be frozen by centralized entities like Binance or Coinbase.Everybody’s a bit on edge. You can see our wallets online. You can see millions of dollars a day transacting out of these walletsLouis d’OrignyNew bodyguards and new gunsIn Karachi, Arsalan’s kidnappers were found within 48 hours. The two policemen among them had been bribed to help orchestrate the plan. Following the attack, Arsalan was offered protection from three other officers and a police car. But, fearing this could actually endanger him further, he declined.For many of crypto’s kings and queens, unfettered access to one’s money via blockchains can feel buffered from institutional corruption. “There is no justice in Pakistan if you’re poor,” says Arsalan. “But decentralization means there are no institutions, no people, no banks … I own this money.”But self-custody comes with a downside: there are fewer middlemen deterring a thief. This means taking matters into their own hands – or a pair they’ve hired.“I used to like my space away from my [bodyguards], but now I want them closer,” says the anonymous US-based founder and trader, who doesn’t reveal his security arrangements to anyone, even his close circle. “In crypto, no one trusts anybody. Half of these guys are scammers,” he says. Over the past month or so, his two guards have not left his sight – even for walks around the block. “Everyone’s being a lot more cautious.”Over the past six months, Jethro Pijlman’s global security services firm, Infinite Risks International, has seen a rise in cryptocurrency investors from western cities wanting protection. Requests range from safeguarding team meetings to guarding entire families around the clock.Paris leads when it comes to new requests, says Pijlman, as France emerges as a hotspot for attacks, particularly after the high-profile kidnapping in January of David Balland, the entrepreneur whose finger was severed. In mid-June, an investor was abducted from a Paris suburb, while his partner was ordered to deposit the key to his cryptocurrency account.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will feature the “most comprehensive security effort in the event’s history”, conference organizers said in a statement. For the first time, local police, special forces and the coast guard are being deployed to the site. Prepping security began almost a year ago, taking three times longer than usual, according to Bettina Boon Falleur, head of EthCC.Companies are also taking measures to protect their staff.Kraken, the second-largest exchange in the US, has deployed armed guards to accompany its top executives at all times, including outside their homes, according to a source familiar with the matter.Matthew Liu, co-founder of the cryptocurrency Origin Protocol, was among the attendees of Donald Trump’s private gala for the top owners of his token last month, a guest list which was leaked to theNew York Times. Liu says his company is evaluating hiring a team of bodyguards for trips.“It’s a cost, but the cost of getting kidnapped or dealing with violence? It’s very, very scary,” says Liu. He’s also begun learning how to shoot a firearm and using a multi-signature wallet, whereby multiple people across the world need to sign-off on a payment.His company has also introduced a new rule when the team goes to conferences: no posting until after the event.Many crypto investors are increasingly conscious of their exposure, after publicly sharing ... details of their success ... onlineJethro Pijlman“Many crypto investors are increasingly conscious of their exposure, especially after publicly sharing – or oversharing – details of their success and affluent lifestyles online,” says Pijlman in regards to his clients. Indeed, for an industry that’s chronically online, its titans have often built large social media followings, while their wealth stays encrypted in anonymous blockchains. “This illusion of invisibility may have led to a false sense of security.”Wiped out life savingsFor Arsalan, he watched his savings be chopped up and sprinkled across the cryptographic abyss. Over the next four months, he fell into a deep depression. He went offline and relied on whatever handouts his father could afford to give him. He considered ending his life, he says.As Arsalan’s case demonstrates, kidnappers haven’t exclusively targeted only multimillionaires or only westerners.Between 2020 and 2023, a Florida-based gang accessed the personal data of everyday cryptocurrency investors, and were able to steal from their wallets remotely.The gang then carried out four home invasions against the same victims, spanning North Carolina, Texas and Florida,accordingto the US Department of Justice. Account holders were forced to unlock their wallets at gunpoint, while their families were tied up. One man’s mother was tortured. Another man was abducted and found 120 miles from his home.View image in fullscreenA Kraken ad in New York last year.Photograph: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesTwo of the attacks targeted seniors, court documents show.“I always dreamed of having a good retirement. I worked for it. I feel like I deserved it,” one victim, 70, told the court during the sentencing. Her husband has Parkinson’s. They’d hoped to take one last trip together – “to have at least some good years, good times”, she said. The couple lost $3m in cryptocurrency at 2022 prices via wire fraud. Wanting more, the gang invaded their home and held them at gunpoint to claim whatever was left. Their portfolio would be worth nearly $10.7m today.“One whole life of savings and you just took it all,” she said.Insuring assetsIn the case of the retirees, the judge ordered the defendants to pay restitution to the victims. Receiving it looks unlikely.Despite the burgeoning risks, only 10% of cryptocurrency holders across the world have coverage on their digital assets, according to areportby insurance firm GlobalData. Only two insurers offer kidnapping and ransom (K&R) coverage for crypto companies: Aon and Canopius. Glenn Morgan, SVP, head of digital assets at Aon, says he’s seen an increase in clients asking about coverage in recent months. Amid the surge, insurers may be on the eve of a windfall: last month NBC Newsreportedthat three crypto-specific insurance companies are working on K&R policies.From the moment Arsalan checked his balance, he knew any chance of recovery would fall to him. Without the help of law enforcement, he’s been able to trace and recover about $160,000 of cryptocurrency, while the police have seized $60,000 in cash and a luxury car. It’s all now held by local police as case property. He thinks it’ll be at least six years before it’s returned to him, given the pace of Pakistan’s courts.He says seven people have reached out to him with similar ordeals they didn’t report. Trading digital assets in Pakistan is a legal gray area, as banks are forbidden from facilitating transactions. When asked why they targeted crypto traders, the kidnappers said they thought victims wouldn’t have legal recourse, according to Arsalan.In the meantime, Arsalan trades on. He wants to rebuild within a year: “They grabbed my money but they did not grab my brain.”He’s also returned to social media, posting his first video in May. No amount of threats will make him give up crypto, he says. Despite all of its risks, public ledgers still feel safer to him than institutions.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesCybercrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how some people juggle spending and expectationsRose plants to records: wedding gift ideas that won’t break the bankMabel Banfield-NwachiSat 28 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 08.48 EDTShareBy the time Layla had paid for flights, booked a hotel, bought a dress and contributed to the honeymoon fund, her friend’s wedding had cost her more than £1,600 – and it is just one of three she is attending this summer.With more couples planning bigger celebrations – often with multiple events, and with some away from home, guests are left footing ever bigger bills.Travel, accommodation, outfits, pre-wedding events, gifts and childcare can add up and push the costs of being a guest into the hundreds, and even thousands, of pounds.So how are people managing? And what does it tell us about the expectations that come with being part of someone’s big day?‘I have been saving since the announcement’Guests are spending more than £2,000 a year, on average, to attend weddings and civil partnerships, according to research from the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS).The biggest costs, MaPS found, were travel and accommodation, followed by new outfits and gifts.Those aged 25 to 34 – the cohort who are most likely to be invited to several weddings in a year– spend about £740 a time on average, adding up to nearly £4,500 a year.One 33-year-old, who lives in south-east London, went to 11 weddings last year – and his weekends for much of this summer involve hopping between celebrations.“I love going, but I’m at an age when everyone seems to be doing it,” he says. “I have four weddings in four weekends over July, and the total for the year is eight.”Three of the weddings, plus a stag do, involve long or overseas journeys. He estimates the total cost of being a guest this year will come to almost £3,000.“The cost doesn’t tarnish the experience for me, but when there are at least a couple of foreign weddings each year then it starts to add up, and to eat into your holiday allowance,” he says.View image in fullscreenIncreasingly, couples are also opting for multi-wedding formats, which can hike up costs.Photograph: MBI/AlamyOne woman in her 40s, who also preferred to remain anonymous, estimates she has spent £1,750 so far on her sibling’s wedding, which will take place in a small city in England next year. The total covers the cost of accommodation for three nights for her and her family, suit hire for her teenage sons, a dress, hair and make up.As a close family member, she says, she “would like to look half decent” for the photographs, and then there is the price of travel to and from the venue.“They got engaged in February 2023, then announced the date in June – they have given us two years, for which I am very grateful. I have been saving since the announcement,” she says.“Life is expensive these days – we live in different cities, and it is their wedding, so their home town makes sense. At least it is not abroad.”Increasingly, couples are opting for multi-wedding formats, which can hike up costs, says Zoe Burke, a wedding expert and the editor of the website Hitched.“With more and more couples choosing celebrant-led weddings over traditional religious ones, it means the legal bit needs to be done ahead of time [because celebrant weddings are not yet legal in England and Wales],” she says.“This is where we are seeing couples opting for ‘micro weddings’ for immediate friends and family – at a register office to do the legal bit, followed by what a ‘typical’ wedding looks and feels like.”The “double-do” has left some guests relying on credit to get them through the wedding season.Research by the credit reference agency Experian found that14% of wedding guests had acquired, or worsened their debt,through attending someone else’s celebration.Almost half (46%) said they met the costs of attending weddings, and stag and hen dos, using money they had in a current account. About a quarter said they saved up specifically for the event, and 17% dipped into savings already earmarked for something else.John Webb, a consumer expert at Experian, recommends thinking twice before accepting invitations if it is really going to stretch your budget.“If you’re borrowing money to cover the cost of attending a wedding, make sure you’ve got a plan to repay it,” he says.“You should always try to avoid taking credit you can’t afford to repay, or putting yourself under extreme financial pressure just to attend.”‘With Mexico, we will just make it a holiday’View image in fullscreenMexico is a great venue, but wedding guests may think twice about whether they have the time or the money to join you there.Photograph: FG Trade Latin/Getty ImagesWhen couples tie the knot overseas, guests are often left with a much bigger bill.Research from the credit card provider Amex suggests 40% of UK wedding guests will attend a “destination wedding” abroad this year, with the average cost now £1,956, according to Experian. That is enough to make some guests think twice before ticking “yes” on the RSVP.About 29% of people in the UK have declined an invitation to a wedding outside the country in the past year because they could not take the time off work, felt the destination was too far away or were unable to afford the transport or accommodation, Experian’s research shows.For Ellena, who is 27 and based in Amsterdam, making it to her friend’s wedding in London involved careful planning and compromise.“A destination wedding can have quite the [carbon] footprint, right? So my partner and I were thinking about that. We wanted to get the Eurostar, but it was way too expensive.“We opted to fly because it was going to save us so much time and so much money,” she says.But there were limits to how cheaply they could travel: “If you’re bringing a suit, and a dress, the carry-on won’t do,” she says.Next year, she has been invited to another wedding, this time in Mexico.“With the engagement, you immediately have all this excitement, and then the day comes around, where you have to start thinking: ‘How do I get there? What gift do I get? What do I wear?’”She has not looked into the costs yet, but says: “We will just make it a holiday, I guess, but we wouldn’t have originally gone to Mexico next on a trip.”‘Honesty means nobody gets hurt’View image in fullscreenWedding experts advise that guests should focuse on the main day and not feel obliged to attend everything.Photograph: Jack Young/People/AlamyAssessing your budget and the costs involved early on – to see whether the wedding is feasible – is key, Webb says, and that avoids those awkward last-minute dropouts, or unnecessary debts.He recommends you speak to the couple sooner rather than later.As he says: “Money conversations can feel awkward, but it’s important to be honest about your situation. Most people would rather you be upfront than silently struggle.“You could suggest joining part of the celebration, such as a local reception, instead of the full trip, or sending a heartfelt message, or gift, if you can’t make it,” he says.Burke advises focusing on the main day and not feeling obliged to attend everything.This way, you don’t end up resentful or let “other people spend your money for you”, she says.“This is especially relevant for destination weddings. And you don’t have to attend every single hen or stag do, bridal brunch or engagement dinner that you’re invited to,” she continues.“If you can only afford to attend the wedding, then just attend the wedding.“Honesty means nobody gets hurt. ‘I’m not able to afford both your destination wedding and the hen do, so please let me know which one you’d most want me to be at so I can plan for that’ is clear and polite, and it perfectly explains your situation.”The same goes for multiple pre-wedding celebrations, Burke says.“Saying: ‘I’m really sorry that I can’t afford to attend all three of the events, but I really want to celebrate with you, so please let me know which one is most important so I can prioritise’ simply lets them know your situation without going into too TMI [too much information] territory, or making them feel like you resent them for having multiple events.”If an invitation says “no children”, and your childcare costs would be too high, you should let the couple know.She says in this case, she would say something like: “Thank you so much for inviting me, however, I’m sadly unable to arrange childcare. I hope you both have the best day ever, and I’ll be raising a glass to you at home.“Can’t wait to see the pictures!”Explore more on these topicsWeddingsConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You have to open it in the Zopa app, which takes minutes, says the company.The account has no monthly fee and comes with a contactless Visa debit card. Zopa points out that, unlike many other fintech companies, it holds a full UK banking licence, with deposits protected up to £85,000 by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.While Biscuit may not be right for everyone, it has some decent features including no overseas card spending fees, and 2% AER (1.98% gross) interest on current account balances, with no limit on what you can earn. The rate is fixed for 12 months and variable after that.It will pay 2% cashback a month on any direct debits paid from the account, up to a maximum direct debit value of £1,500 a year, with this rate guaranteed for 12 months.The digital bank also offers access to a regular saver account, paying 7.1% AER (6.87% gross), into which you can pay in up to £300 a month. Assuming this rate stays the same for the next 12 months, you could earn up to £137 a year.You can get in touch with the bank via in-app chat or over the phone, and it says customers can link external accounts to manage their money and make payments from one place.There are downsides, though. Zopa is for people who are happy to use an app-based account. If you need branch access, look elsewhere. Also, you cannot pay cash or cheques into the account.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not this year: 10 European alternatives to classic American holiday destinationsWith many tourists boycotting the US, we’ve come up with European destinations that give you the same bang for your buck – from the Italian Everglades to Montenegro’s Grand CanyonSat 28 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareSwap surfing in California for Santa Cruz in PortugalSprawled on a towel, observing silhouetted surfers chasing the ocean-plunging carmine sun, I don’t need to squint to imagine I’m in the Golden State. But my sandy toes and salty hair are products of the Atlantic, not the Pacific. AndthisSanta Cruz belongs to Portugal’s Costa de Prata, not California.Mutual monikers are not the only parallels: this coast has 300 sunny days a year, top-notch surf (after Malibu, nearby Ericeira was the second place to be designated a World Surfing Reserve), and blond sands stretching towards wave-carved coastal bluffs and ocean arches.In this former fishing village, just an hour’s drive north-west of Lisbon, tranquillity flows like the tides. A soul-healing clutch of low-slung, whitewashed streets waymarked by an out-of-place beachside crenellated turret – the sole remnant of a palace plan thwarted by the 1929 Wall Street crash – it’s the kind of delightfully textbook Portuguese place you stumble upon serendipitously. And once you do, you won’t want to leave. Japanese poet Kazuo Dan visited in 1971 to have a “conversation between Heaven and Earth” – a chat he continued for 16 months.California cravings? Noah’s grilled cheese and portobello burgers hit the spotIf you’re a surfer, you’ll instantly agree. If not, lessons will leave you convinced. Check-in at chicNoah Surf House(room sleeping four from €320 B&B), complete with an ocean-view infinity pool and skate park, and arranging all-age surf classes is effortless. Flawlessly renovated Villa Galega (doubles from €115 B&B) affords a more homely escape.Santa Cruz and surrounding Torres Vedras boasts11 beaches certified as pollution-free– more than any other Portuguese municipality. Tread the dune-crossing boardwalk to river-wrapped Praia Azul to flop on the finest sweep.Back in town, beachside feasts don’t come better than breezyBronzear. Split a steaming pot ofarroz de peixe, a seafood-stacked rice stew, or take plump, signature crabs as your table’s centrepiece during September’s Festival da Sapateira. California cravings? Noah’s grilled cheese and portobello burgers hit the spot. Pair with a local Touriga Nacional red wine – a robust stand-in for a Cali Cab Sav – or slip away to the family-run wineryQuinta da Almiarafor a vine-hemmed, in situ tasting.Evenings usually end ringing the doorbell ofManel, the town’s oldest bar, for jazz-accompanied candlelit cocktails and Lisbon-brewed IPAs. Out front, an engraved stone shares Kazuo’s words contemplating chasing the setting sun to the end of the sea – the haiku that Santa Cruz’s surfers now scrupulously honour.Daniel James ClarkeSwap a cabin inNew Englandfor amökkiin FinlandView image in fullscreenTraditional mökki cottages in rural Finland.Photograph: Wmaster 890/Getty ImagesAlmost two centuries after it was written, Walden; or, Life in the Woods, Henry David Thoreau’s book about the two years he spent living in a self-built cabin on a lake in Massachusetts, still inspires generations of Americans to go in search of what he called the “tonic of wildness”. It’s an American dream of simplicity and self-sufficiency that was also beautifully captured in the 1981 film On Golden Pond, in which Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn fish, paddle and ponder life for one last summer in Maine (though it was filmed in New Hampshire).But North America doesn’t have a monopoly on this kind of bucolic escape. The Nordic countries know all about the appeal of cabin life – and Finland, with 19 hours of sunlight in midsummer and sublime wild landscapes, is an idyllic alternative.Mökki, or Finnish summer cottages, sit on lake shores or on rocks by the seashore and are often passed down through families. With about 20% of Finns living within the Helsinki metropolitan area, these cabins are a sanctuary for spending time in nature: fishing and messing about on the water in summer; skiing, ice-swimming and snowshoeing in winter. Many are off-grid, so part of the ritual includes splitting wood, gathering water, warming up in the wood-fired sauna … and letting your phone battery die. You’re free to roam the coast or forage in the surrounding forest too – theJokaisenoikeudetor “everyman’s rights” law gives everyone the freedom to wander and collect wild food.You don’t need to have friends or family with a mökki to stay in one–there are an estimated 500,000 of them and only a fifth of Finns own one outright, so many are available for those new tomökkielämä(Finnish cottage life).LomarengasandFinland Cottage Rentalsallow you to rent directly from owners, while onSviskärin the southern Åland archipelago you get a 28-hectare (69-acre) island all to yourself – perfect for foraging, sea dipping and the “tonic of wildness”.Sian LewisSwap the Appalachian Trail for Europe’s even longer E1 pathView image in fullscreenThe E1 trail starts at Norway’s North Cape.Photograph: Achim Thomae/Getty ImagesIn 1948, Earl Shaffer, a US second world war veteran, set off on a long walk. He had his ex-army rucksack and some old boots, but no tent or cooker. His goal was to be the first person to complete the 2,200 miles of the Appalachian Trail in one continuous yomp, a thru-hike as it came to be known. When 67-year-old grandmother Emma Gatewood repeated the feat in 1955 (with even simpler kit), the Appalachian Trail was on its way to becoming the world’s first long-distance celebrity footpath.These days about 3,000 people attempt a thru-hike every year (about aquarter of those succeed) but the experience is now very different, with huts every six to eight miles, water stashes left by “trail angels”, and well-established support logistics.In Europe it can be harder to find sustained remoteness, but the 2,050-mile Scandinavian section of theE1 long-distance footpathis about as close as you get.This full 4,420-mile route had its origins in post-second-world-war rapprochement ideals and was devised by a team from the then European Ramblers Association led by the British walker Arthur Howcroft (who died in 2023 aged 96). The path starts at Norway’s North Cape and officially finishes in Palermo, but it is in Scandinavia that it crosses the greatest amount of wilderness.Once you reach Halmstad on the Swedish coast, you have almost one Appalachian Trail’s worth of walking under your beltThe early stages are well inside the Arctic Circle and not to be underestimated, with navigation, river crossings and snowfields constant challenges. Long stretches are unmarked. There are some concessions to practicalities: bothNorwayandSwedenhave excellent systems of mountain huts.Once you reach Halmstad on the Swedish coast, you have almost one Appalachian Trail’s worth of walking under your belt, but there is no need to stop: in E1 terms you are not even halfway. A ferry crosses to the Danish port of Grenaa, and the path begins again, continuing across Germany and the Alps with several long, tough days. Some great stages then cross Tuscany and Umbria, but once in southern Italy the path, by all accounts, can be a bit sketchy and seems to fade away in Campania, though route-marking is improving.After his failed attempt to complete the Appalachian Trail, authorBill Brysondescribed the benefits of long-distance trails succinctly: “For a brief, proud period I was slender and fit. I gained a profound respect for wilderness and nature and the benign dark power of woods. I understand now, in a way I never did before, the colossal scale of the world.”Kevin RushbySwap New York for BerlinView image in fullscreenBerlin, the other city that never sleeps.Photograph: hHanohikirf/AlamyBuzzy and culturally rich, with extensive museums and galleries, oodles of nightlife and concerts – from classical venues to techno clubs – lush green spaces, family-friendly activities and striking architecture, New York and Berlin have plenty in common. But as someone who knows both cities well, Berlin gets my vote.While NYC’s nightlife is diverse – and has bounced back since Rudy Giuliani’s ugly, destructive campaign against it in the 1990s – it’s way more commercial thanBerlin, whose underground electronic scene, especially techno, is edgier and more experimental. FromBerghaintoSisyphos, Berlin’s clubs also stay open longer (sometimes for days; it truly is the city that never sleeps, at least on weekends). They also don’t tend to have dress codes – unless you count skimpy lingerie and kinky harnesses. VIP areas and even mobile phone photography are strictlyverboten. Berliners can quaff beers openly on the streets, and indulge in a bit of public nookie at nightclubs – as distinct from official swinger or sex spots such asKitKat.Berlin gives great gastro, too, excelling at affordable, mid-range restaurants that tick all the trend boxes – small plates, natural wines, plant-based menus found at buzzy neighbourhood spots such as Kreuzberg’s vegan havenHappa, Neukölln’sLa CôteandSorrel, and Prenzlauer Berg’sEstelle. And while it doesn’t have a Chinatown or a Little Italy, you can find every national cuisine on the planet (albeit with less spice, to appease the sensitive German palate).NYC certainly has fantastic cultural big-hitters, from the Guggenheim and the Met to Moma and the American Museum of Natural History, but Berlin has the Unesco-heritage Museum Island, Mies van der Rohe’s slickly modernistNeue Nationalgalerieand its own natural history and German history museums. It also excels in unusual venues that New York doesn’t have, such as theHamburger Bahnhof, in a former railway station,the Boros Collectioninside a second world war bunker, andSilent Green, an art and concert space in a former crematorium.As for green space, New York’s Central Park may be one-and-a-half times the size of the Tiergarten, but Berlin has vastly more green recreational spaces overall, with about 2,500 inner-city parks and unique areas such as the sprawlingTempelhofer Feld, a former airport, and the massive Grunewald forest.One last thing: with much lower population density and fewer tourists (12.7 million people visited Berlin in 2024 versus the 64 million who went to New York), there’s more room on the streets and fewer queues for the major sights.Bis bald(see you soon) … y’all.Paul SullivanSwap the Grand Canyon for Montenegro’s Tara River CanyonView image in fullscreenWhite-water rafting on the Tara River Canyon, Montenegro.Photograph: Marketa Novakova/AlamyLet’s get one thing straight: size wise, the Grand Canyon sprawls for 278 miles along the Colorado River, whereas the Tara River Canyon covers a mere 51. But what the Montenegrin canyon lacks in size it makes up for in depth: as Europe’s deepest gorge, it plunges 1,300 metres (4,300ft), only 300 metres less than the average depth of the Grand Canyon (and just over 500 metres less than its deepest point).As this Unesco world heritage site slices through northern Montenegro’s Durmitor national park and eventually slides across the border into Bosnia, it adds even more drama to this section of the Dinaric Alps’ forbidding mountains and glacial  lakes.For adventurers who like a challenge, Tara means one thing: white-water raftingFor adventurers who like a challenge, Tara means one thing: white-water rafting. The choice of excursions all around the region is enormous, but you can get a taste of it in a few hours by joining one of the trips from the town of Žabljak, which in winter is one of Montenegro’s ski centres. Eventually, you’ll be rafting under the soaring concrete arches of the awe-inspiring Đurđevića Tara Bridge, whose beauty is best admired from below.There’s a whole mini industry set up around the bridge, including ziplining and stalls selling souvenirs. As someone at the opposite end of the daredevilry scale – and thanks to speeding cars and a concrete path that’s barely a foot wide – I found it scary enough just walking on the bridge to take in the admittedly extraordinary view.But there are other ways of enjoying the beauty of Tara without worrying about Montenegrin motorists. Not far from Žabljak is the car park for the Ćurevac mountain peak and viewpoint, which is reached after a 40-minute hike and offers sweeping views of those magnificent gorges. It’s only one of scores of hiking routes that wind above and alongside the river, some of which are part of the 1,200-mile Via Dinarica trail that goes from Slovenia all the way to Albania.Right by the border with Bosnia and the confluence of the Tara and Piva rivers is another collection of rafting centres as well as campsites offering mellower ways of exploring Tara. Boat trips along gentler stretches  of water give you the chance to swim in absurdly clear waters, lunch on organic food and drink cold beer brewed with spring water. And in this land of €3 pints, you’ll find your euro going way further than your dollar ever would.Stay atGreen Topnear Žabljak, which has well-equipped one-bedroom self-catering wooden chalets with gardens, barbecues and mountain views from £95 a night.Mary NovakovichSwap the Mojavedesert for Tabernas in SpainView image in fullscreenThe Tabernas desert in Spain.Photograph: Nachteule/Getty ImagesWhen the Italian film director Sergio Leone chose to shoot his westerns in Europe, there was only one place that could convincingly double for the American west – the Tabernas desert in south-east Spain. With its dry riverbeds snaking through arid mountains and sandstone canyons, it’s easy to imagine yourself in California’s Mojave desert.Tabernas might not have the Mojave’s famous Joshua trees, but it is home to flora, fauna and a landscape reminiscent of the US desert. Prickly pears, giant aloe and palm trees line the trails, while lizards scuttle among otherworldly rock formations and eagles soar in the vast sky.Tourism is still low-key here. For decades this barren part of Andalucía was not on the radar of the Spanish tourist board, and large areas are monopolised by swathes of plastic greenhouses. But with a growing appreciation for Tabernas’ unique status as Europe’s only desert, as well as the renaissance of Leone’s movies, its charms are being re-evaluated. You can take a guided horseback ride through the desert with theMalcaminos ranchand pitch your tent atCamping Fort Bravo(€45 a night), one of the original movie sets still in use today. For a little more comfort –and to live out your California homesteading fantasy – you can book into one of their western-styled log cabins (from €80).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bewitched by cowboy lore as a teenager, I rode across the American deserts in search of the mythical west (admittedly on a motorcycle rather than horseback), seduced by the romance of life on the trail – billy cans boiling over campfires and a wide-open wilderness that promised a freedom unimaginable in fenced-off, old-world Europe.Joshua Tree national park in the Mojave desert became my go-to destination each time I found myself in California. But in recent years, I’ve been exploring Spain, scouting routes for the forthcomingSpaghetti Western Trail, and finding the same magic in the Desierto de Tabernas. The scale is of course smaller than the Mojave, but the silence, the stillness, the hint of sage on the warm air and the sense of exploration are as thrilling as my early US road trips.Leone was enthralled by American style and myth but always from a distance. “I can’t see the US any other way than with a European’s eyes,” he said. “It’s a country that fascinates me and terrifies me at the same time.”If you feel the same way right now, but still yearn for a cowboy adventure, you could do worse than follow in his footsteps and head for Tabernas.Lois PryceSwap Yellowstone for Carpathia in RomaniaView image in fullscreenA bear in the wilds of Carpathia.Photograph: Istvan Kadar/Getty ImagesThe jaw-dropping landscapes of the US’s 63 national parks lure millions of visitors to the great outdoors each year. Yellowstone, established in 1872, is the oldest of them all – a sprawling 3,472 square miles of dazzling scenery including canyons and active geysers. Mostly in Wyoming but stretching into Montana and Idaho, it’s home to wildlife from grizzly bears and wolves to bison and antelope, and is crisscrossed by thousands of miles of trails.Although it can’t compete in size, the rugged, forested Făgăraș mountains in Romania offer a thrilling taste of the wild and exciting wildlife-spotting opportunities closer to home. This area of Transylvania, on the southern edge of the Carpathians, is among the wildest places in Europe, where brown bear, wolves, lynx and – recently reintroduced – bison roam.‘A Yellowstone for Europe’: Romania’s ambition for a vast new wilderness reserveRead moreIt’s where theFoundation Conservation Carpathiais working to create the continent’s largest forest national park, buying land for conservation and reforesting clear-cut areas on its mission to establish a 200,000-hectare wilderness reserve, which has been dubbed a “Yellowstone for Europe”.Unlike the vast lodges in Yellowstone, staying in these tiny cabins means you’re close to the action, engulfed by the landscapeAs I hike through forests on steep zigzagging paths with my guide Răzvan, the thrill of the wild is real – we see a viper and pass fresh bear prints. Gouge marks on a tree and overturned stones reveal the bear’s hunt for food. I watch with bated breath as a group of bison wander on a hillside close by – thankfully upwind of our scent.We stay atBuneahide, a wooden shelter overlooking a lake, with bunks, a double bedroom, a kitchen and huge soundproofed windows that make the most of the views. As night falls, I stare into the dark as if glued to a movie. Something moves in the half-light – and slowly a young female brown bear wanders into view, sniffing the air, rubbing against a tree. It’s not long before a large male appears, just metres away from the hide. I’m mesmerised as I watch him pawing the ground for food before sloping off into the woods.Unlike the vast lodges in Yellowstone, staying in these tiny cabins mean you’re close to the action, engulfed by the landscape. We hike higher to Comisu hide, at 1,600 metres, with sweeping views over the mountains as a storm rolls in. Owls call out in the moonlit night as I drift off to sleep, dreaming about this vibrant wild world.Jane DunfordVisitFoundation Conservation Carpathiafor more informationSwap seafood in New England for Normandy and BrittanyView image in fullscreenFreshly shucked oysters for sale in Cancale, Brittany.Photograph: Alan Morris/AlamyFor all our sniffiness about American cuisine, few people dispute the quality of the country’s seafood. Although you can no longer get a lobster roll at McDonald’s in New England, the fast-food joint is one of the few places in the region where they’re not on the menu. Cycling down the Atlantic coast last summer as part of research for a US travelogue, I rejoiced in the casual abundance on offer at the roadside – baskets of fried clams in Connecticut, oysters in Maine, crab benedict in Massachusetts … 3,000 miles and a world away from the grand silverfruits de merplatters of Europe.You don’t have to fly across an ocean to get your shellfish fix, however. While you’re unlikely to find yourself tempted by a lobster surf and turf burger in France, seafood can be surprisingly accessible if you swerve Parisian bistros and go straight to the source.La Cale, in Blainville-sur-Mer on Normandy’s Cotentin peninsula, an easy drive (or a day’s cycle) from Cherbourg, istypiquement françaisfor its pride in local produce (oysters, whelks, clams etc, as well as galettes and spit-roast meat), but rather less so in its casual feet-in-the-sand ethos and informal service. Remi, the proprietor, is described online as “eccentric” – his van is graffitied with the words “Rosbeefs welcome … frogs too”. Do not pass up themoulesfrites, or theteurgoule, a traditional Normande spiced rice pudding.Further down the coast, in Brittany, I’ve earmarked Cancale, in the Bay of Mont Saint Michel, for a return visit, because if you ever wanted proof that the French can let their hair down, look no further than the people sitting on the sea wall with paper platters of oysters and plastic cups of cold sancerre. The oysters come from the seafrontmarché aux huîtres, which offers a bamboozling selection, all shucked to order, and the wine from an enterprising booze van parked nearby. The shells, once you’ve finished, are thrown on to the beach.One step up, in that there’s table service, but with no more steps between sea and plate, isMaison Quintin, on the Atlantic coast near Saint-Philibert, where you can feast on the family’s own oysters under the pines as the sun sets over the estuary, supplemented with skewers of plump prawns and langoustines, crab, grilled lobster, and their homemade seafood rillettes on toast. Reservations essential – laid-back vibes guaranteed.Felicity CloakePeach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisineby Felicity Cloake ispublished by Mudlark (£16.99)Swap the Florida Everglades for Italy’sMarano LagoonView image in fullscreenErnest Hemingway called Marano Lagoon ‘piccola Florida’ because it reminded him of the Everglades.Photograph: Nicola Simeoni/AlamyIt was on a slow journey through the extensive wetlands that border Italy’s Adriatic that I first came upon the little-known Laguna di Marano, a carefully preserved eco-paradise, barely touched by tourism. This gossamer web of interlocking lagoons, canals and river deltas stretches from Venice all the way up to Trieste. Local legend has it that Ernest Hemingway called these wetlands and the adjoining sandy beach resort of Lignano “piccola Florida”, because it reminded him of the Everglades and the Florida Keys.The US author first came to this part of Italy as a volunteer at the end of the first world war. He returned in the 1950s to find inspiration for his book Across the River and Into the Trees while duck hunting and fishing on the Marano Lagoon – though for sea bream and mullet rather than marlin, his favourite quarry in the waters around Florida.At the bar of the rusticTrattoria Barcanetain the bustling medieval port of Marano Lagunare, I order a glass ofrefosco dalpeduncolorosso, a rustic local red wine favoured by the writer. It may not be as glamorous as sipping a Hemingway martini in a Key West cocktail bar, but it was the perfect aperitivo before tasting chef Claudio Moretti’s exquisite cuisine, a delicate carpaccio of sea bass and grilled eel from the nearby Stella River delta, both freshly caught by the port’s many fishers.This gossamer web of interlocking lagoons, canals and river deltas, stretches from Venice all the way up to TriesteMarano Lagunare is the perfect base for exploring the surrounding wetlands. Thetourism officecan arrange activities from canoeing and kayaking to walking and horse riding. Renting a small boat with a guide is my choice, a retiredpescatore(fisher) for the perfect insight into local life on the water. While the vast, open expanse of the lagoon is breathtaking, dotted along the edge of the water is something you will never see in Florida – traditionalcasonithatched huts still used today by fishers.The landscape changes dramatically as we enter the protected reserve of the Stella delta. Here, the freshwater channels become narrower, bordered on both sides by tall golden reeds – definitely a feel of the Everglades – as we catch glimpses of pink flamingos, purple herons, egrets, cormorants swooping down and a neat squadron of geese flying past. It may be smaller than the Everglades (62 square miles as opposed to 2,357), but the one thing truly different from a Florida nature excursion is that there is no need to look out for alligators.John BruntonSwap California’s Highway 1 for Ireland’s Wild Atlantic WayView image in fullscreenThe Dingle peninsula section of the Wild Atlantic Way.Photograph: Marco Bottigelli/Getty ImagesMy left foot shook on the clutch – not from tiredness, but from something resembling fear. Conor Pass had seemed like a good idea at breakfast. One of Ireland’s highest and narrowest mountain roads? Why not? The car seemed to float as the road narrowed to a one-lane ledge between cliff and sky. No turning back now – just a slow crawl upwards with mist curling over the bonnet from the valley below.Still, this is the scenery the Wild Atlantic Way promises – and delivers. It’s a 1,600-mile coastal drive from Malin Head, the country’s most northerly point, in County Donegal, to Kinsale in County Cork in the south-west – and Ireland’s answer to California’s Highway 1, the 656-mile Pacific Coast route that skirts sea bluffs, redwood groves and epic coastal views.Big Sur’s iconic Bixby Bridge resembles theMizen Headfootbridge in West Cork. Highway 1’s “million dollar view” is eclipsed by the Atlantic sweep from Slieve League, or the cliffs that tower above powder-white Keem beach on Achill Island. Connemara’sSky Roadand the Burren’sAtlantic Driveecho Big Sur’s drama, winding between limestone and ocean. However, my favourite stretch – theDingle peninsula– is hard to match. Its mountain-to-ocean setting is visual theatre dialled to max.Inch beach, a long curve of sand stretching three miles into Dingle Bay, is a gentle introduction before I turned north to hair-raising Conor Pass (optional and clearly marked) and descended into Dingle town.I stepped out on the headland and watched the surf pound the shore ferociously as if it was punishing it for some ancient grievanceThe road then turns otherworldly along theSlea Head Drivewith Ventry beach’s three miles of bone-white sand perfect for barefoot walking – somewhat like Highway 1’s famous Moonstone beach.As I drove on I stopped at every layby I could, because there’s always something around the corner; a hidden cove or early Christian monument. AtCoumeenoole beach, I stepped out on the headland and watched the surf pound the shore ferociously as if it was punishing it for some ancient grievance.And then cameDunquin Pier– the lane zigzags down a steep slope like a spiral staircase that plunges into the ocean, which was enough of a reason to ditch the car on the roadside and walk down. This is where the boats leave for the Blaskets, and it feels like the edge of the world.Offshore, the Three Sisters – three jagged peaks rising from the ocean floor – remain in focus, their silhouettes a reminder of the sea stacks off Big Sur. About halfway along the Slea Head Drive, the magnificentBlasket Centredelivers staggering island views.Vic O’SullivanExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysUnited States holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My wife is driving; I am looking at my phone. It is my plan to look at my phone for at least the first hour, even though it is unlikely my wife will allow this.“Bit hazy,” she says.“Hmm,” I say, looking at my phone.“But I think it might burn off later,” she says.“What?” I say, forcing my eyes up to the horizon.“Never mind,” my wife says, turning on the radio. I return to my phone.“Sorry, will you clean these please?” my wife says, handing me her glasses.“What?” I say. Instead of answering, she drops her glasses into my lap. Reluctantly I put down my phone, pull out the hem of my shirt, and fog the lenses with my breath.“By the way, I don’t approve of this,” I say, overtaken by irritation.“Of what?” she says.“I mean, first, I can’t believe how filthy these glasses are,” I say.“I know,” she says. “That’s why I asked you to …”“And second,” I say. “I can’t believe you didn’t notice until we’d done eight miles on the motorway.”“I just realised the haze I was seeing was on my glasses,” she says.“That’s the best I can do,” I say, handing her glasses back.“Much better, thank you,” she says.“It’s not safe,” I say.After a few minutes spent looking at my phone, my irritation subsides. I remind myself that my wife doesn’t need her glasses the way I need my glasses: she will sometimes lose them for an entire weekend without suffering any particular inconvenience. I couldn’t take off my glasses while driving without quickly crashing into a bridge support.Something I’ve seen on my phone catches my attention.“Interesting,” I say. “Guess how many …”“No,” my wife says.“Wait, just guess how many countries have a …”“You didn’t want to chat,” she says. “Don’t try to start a conversation now, using facts you found on your phone.”“Fine,” I say. I take off my glasses to clean them, and the world ahead becomes a blur.Two days later, it is time to set off for home, but my wife can’t find her phone.“I swear I just had it,” she says, coming back from the car. “Will you ring it?”“Straight to voicemail,” I say, holding my own phone to my ear.“Why is it doing that?” she says. “It’s fully charged.”I am longing, for reasons which are both admirable and shameful, to be the person who finds my wife’s phone“Probably because there’s no signal wherever you left it,” I say. In practical terms, this means outside, and it’s raining outside.We try to approach the problem logically. My wife’s laptop indicates the last picture she took on her phone was of a nearby pond, only 35 minutes previously.“And then what?” I say. “Did you fling it into the pond?”“I went across that meadow, through the gate, and then to the car,” she says. “But I really don’t think I would have left my phone outside.”“I once found your phone in the crook of the tree,” I say.“That was different,” she says. “I was listening to the Archers omnibus while I was weeding.”My wife returns to the pond, while I walk the meadow twice over, getting soaked. I am longing, for reasons both admirable and shameful, to be the person who finds the phone. But I don’t see how anyone could find anything in this expanse of long grass.As I approach the car, the rain turning heavy, I see my wife coming. When she sees me she holds her phone above her head.“Where was it?” I say.“It was lying on a stone wall, getting rained on,” she says. “I think I was taking a picture, and then my shoe was untied, and then … never mind.”“Let’s go,” I say.As we drive the sky begins to clear toward the east. The recent rain and the warm weather have caused the hedgerows to explode with growth.“I’m glad we found it,” my wife says. “It felt very uncomfortable not having my phone.”I do not say what I am thinking, which is: people who are truly uncomfortable without their phones don’t leave them on stone walls in the rain. I need to be an exemplar of patience, if only because I so often try the patience of others.As we approach an intersection made blind by fresh greenery, my wife hands me her glasses.“Will you clean these?” she says.“Of course,” I say.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Duke of Edinburgh’s award (DofE) prides itself on offering teenagers experiences that a classroom cannot replicate – and the charity has recently said more people are signing up than ever before.More than 342,000 young people took on tasks to achieve their bronze, silver or gold award last year, according to the DofE. For people who shared their abiding memories of the scheme with the Guardian, many involved getting very wet somewhere deep in the UK countryside.James, 29, from Manchester, completed his gold award in 2013. He recalls: “Of the many candidates for worst experience, mine would be a sub-zero night in the Peak District field containing a frozen dead sheep.“During the night, my water leaked over my tent mate’s sleeping bag. He woke up and, in a delirious state, put it over the top of our tent to dry. He told me the following morning that he’d been lying next to me on his sleeping mat, watching me shiver in my sleep for the rest of the night. By the morning, his sleeping bag was frozen solid.”For 32-year-old Freya from London, “biblical rain” cut her silver award expedition short in the 2000s. “The plan was to do a day of walking just outside Ripon and a day in a canoe, but on our first day there was substantial rainfall which meant we arrived at the campsite absolutely sodden,” she says.Feeling deflated, the group of 15 set up camp in silence. “Our spirits were so low we couldn’t even be bothered to get the cooker going so just had a Mars bar for dinner, crawled into the foetal position and slept,” she adds.“The next day we were meant to get in a canoe but when we woke up it had rained heavily throughout the night. We were up for continuing but we had to cancel the rest of the expedition because the river was so high we couldn’t get our boats under the bridge.“We eventually completed the expedition and really enjoyed it. Looking back I have fond memories as it was a fun experience and it was nice to spend a weekend detached from my phone.”Getting lost was a strong theme among respondents. For *Zara, 41, from Scotland,who went on her bronze expedition in the late 90s in the Cairngorms, a diversion turned out to be a highlight. “We waved down a tractor, and a farmer very kindly took us for a few kilometres. We felt like we’d got one over on the teachers.”On their journey, Zara’s group stumbled across a wild stag. “It caught our eye, then wandered off. It felt so spectacular,” she says.Although the rise in DofE participation may be partly explained by an increase in the number of teenagers in the UK, experts said it was also the result of character education becoming a growing focus for state schools.Prof Tom Harrison, the deputy pro vice-chancellor for education innovation at the University of Birmingham, says there is a “growing realisation [in education] that getting a good grade is not a direct route to success in getting a job but indeed in life more broadly”.Harrison says that in the past, character education was considered the preserve of private and selective schools, but it has increasingly become an area of focus for state schools, which benefited from a £3.4m government funding boost to expand the scheme in 2021. His research has found that in 2024, 22% of outstanding Ofsted reportsmentioned character education, compared with 1% in 2014.Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says the awards are an “excellent scheme offering young people a valuable chance to learn skills and enjoy new experiences”, with particular benefit considering concerns about the amount of time that children spend on electronic devices and screens.Mike Hall, 54, blames a heavy backpack for his failed silver award expedition on the Offa’s Dyke path in Shropshire in 1986. “I came over a stile, and the drop on the other side was greater than I thought. My backpack wasn’t balanced properly, so I went over at an angle and I landed in the field with an enormous ‘crack’!“I broke my ankle and couldn’t take my boot off. It swelled up enormously. We didn’t have mobile phones, so my mates hiked the last five miles to the end of the trail to fetch the teachers. Two hours later, they helped me into the back of a minibus, and I was dropped off at home in Surrey to go straight to A&E.“I was on crutches and a plastic cast for weeks. And that was the story of my life for about another seven years or so until I ended up having reconstructive surgery and getting my ankle sorted out properly in my 20s.”Hall did not receive his silver award until he completed the same hike the following year.*Name has been changed.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleRural affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It actually gave us more time to create together.”Fatimazahra was 18 at the time, and Zaidy notes how “her thoughtful personality is reflected in the mood of the image. In the end, I selected one with her eyes closed because it felt calm and quiet.”When Zaidy first shared this photo during the pandemic, he got a flood of positive feedback. “People told me it gave them a sense of peace and hope.

Some held signs accusing her of betraying the nation – calling her “traitor PM” and “sell out PM”.Police estimated 6,000 people had turned out by the afternoon, but anticipated the crowd would surpass 10,000 by Saturday evening, the Bangkok Post reported, making it the largest such rally since the ruling Pheu Thai party came to power in 2023.“We are not gathering here to cause trouble,” said Jade Donavanik, a legal scholar who addressed crowds.“We are united here by the force of nature to safeguard our national and territorial integrity, to protect our sovereignty and to set the country right. We shall do everything within our capabilities to protect this country and to bring peace and prosperity to the kingdom ofThailand.”Many of those who gathered at the protest are associated with movements that previously rallied against Paetongtarn’s father, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup, and her aunt Yingluck, who was removed from power by a court ruling followed by a coup in 2014.The organiser of Saturday’s protest, United Force of the Land, which is made up of nationalist activists, have called for all parties to withdraw from Paetongtarn’s coalition. A coalition partner quit earlier this month, citing the leaked phone call, leaving her with only a slim majority.Paetongtarn is also facing judicial threats, after petitions were filed accusing her of ethical violations and breaching the constitution in relation to the leaked call.The constitutional court will meet on Tuesday to decide whether to accept a case calling for her to be sacked, and could suspend her from office while it considers the matter. A final judgment would probably take months.Paetongtarn has apologised for the phone call, though this has done little to halt criticism.The territorial dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century to when France, which occupied Cambodia until 1953, first mapped the land border. The incident has led to a surge in nationalist sentiment andtit-for-tat actions by both governments.Hun Sen said on Saturday the border action by the Thai army was a serious violation of Cambodia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.“This poor Cambodia has suffered from foreign invasion, war and genocide, been surrounded and isolated and insulted in the past, but now Cambodia has risen on an equal face with other countries,” Hun Sen told an audience of thousands at the 74th anniversary celebration of the founding of his ruling Cambodian People’s Party in the capital, Phnom Penh.Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades, handed power to his son in 2023 but remains powerful in the country.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificCambodianewsShareReuse this content"

It was reported at the time that a Chinese diplomat had run a red light while following her car – under police escort – from the airport.This week Prague intelligence officials told local media that the incident was part of a much larger and escalatory plan by Chinese diplomats and intelligence officers working out of the embassy in Prague, which included preparing to stage an apparent car collision.On Saturday, Hsiao thanked Czech authorities for ensuring her safety during the visit. “The CCP’s unlawful activities will NOT intimidate me from voicing Taiwan’s interests in the international community,” she said in a social media post.The new details of the plan against Hsiao were revealed by Czech public radio service,Irozhlas, on Thursday.Petr Bartovský, the director of the Czech military intelligence service, told Irozhlas that the driver stopped by police was only following Hsiao, but that the service had also identified plans, run out of the Chinese embassy, to “demonstratively confront Ms Hsiao”.Jan Pejšek, a spokesperson for the service, said the plan involved an “attempt by the Chinese civil secret service to create conditions to perform a demonstrative kinetic action against a protected person, which however did not go beyond the phase of preparation”. The Czech reporting team said this was understood to be a collision with Hsiao’s car.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It demanded an explanation and public apology.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, said Chinese diplomats “always observe the laws and regulations of host countries”, and that the Czech government had “grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs” by allowing Hsiao to visit, calling her a “diehard Taiwan independence separatist” – a designation for whichChina has threatened the death penalty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theprotest was outside a business in Belmoreaccused of “supplying electroplating and surface coating services for a variety of applications including aerospace and defence technology” to Israel.In a letter sent to the state’s police watchdog, police commissioner and police minister on Saturday, Higginson labelled the policing of the protest “excessive, unnecessary, and potentially constitute an unlawful exercise of authority to intimidate”.Former Greens candidate may lose sight after being arrested in Sydney protest at alleged Israel technology supplierRead more“Having witnessed the grievous injuries caused by the police to Hannah Thomas, spoken to on ground witnesses who witnessed what occurred, and with the knowledge that Hannah has experienced serious injuries and hospitalisation, I am calling for a critical incident to be declared urgently,” Higginson said in the letter, seen by Guardian Australia.The acting police minister, Tara Moriarty, told Guardian Australia late on Saturday that such a declaration was “an operational matter” for NSW police.“A critical incident is specifically defined and the declaration is based on medical advice,” Moriarty said.“I am advised that based on the medical advice the NSW Police has received, this matter does not currently meet the threshold.“This decision can be reviewed by the Region Commander based on further medical advice that may be provided.”NSW police said in a statement late on Saturday: “The matter remains under review and police are seeking further information. If and when a critical incident is declared, that will be a decision of the Region Commander.”Higginson called for an investigation “to avoid further horrific instances of innocent people being seriously injured”.View image in fullscreenHannah Thomas ran against Anthony Albanese in the Sydney electorate of Grayndler.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPPolice on Fridaysaid Thomas, 35, sustained facial injuries during the arrest and was taken to Bankstown hospital for treatment.A photo of Thomas online showed her eye swollen shut and with blood on her face before she was taken for surgery. Video of the incident, which Higginson sharedon social media, showed multiple police dragging one of the protesters, as onlookers repeatedly shouted “get off her” and “let go of her”.In a statement on Friday, police said: “As police attempted to arrest the protesters who were not complying with the directions, a scuffle ensued between police and protesters, during which a police body worn camera was taken by an unknown protester.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailHigginson had on Friday said the protest was peaceful and claimed Thomas was the “victim of brutal excessive force by the police”.“The prognosis provided to family earlier was that they could not tell the extent of her injuries until there was a full examination because the swelling was too severe and that it was possible she may lose vision in that eye.“That she may have sustained injuries to the bones of her face, but nothing has been confirmed at this point.”According to NSW police, officers issued a move-on direction to the protesters at 5.30am on Friday. The force alleged the protest, which attracted between 50 and 60 people, was “unauthorised”, as those involved had not given advanced notice nor submitted a form that protected them from being charged under anti-protest laws.Thomas allegedly declined to comply with the order and was forcibly removed and arrested.In NSW, people who wish to stage a protest are encouraged to lodge a “notice of intention to hold a public assembly” with the police commissioner in advance of the demonstration.The state’s permit system haspreviously come under fire for being “undemocratic”, with the Minns Labor government urged to scrap it for a human rights charter like those that exist in Victoria and Queensland.Higginson’s Saturday letter suggested the incident occurred “due to the political decisions taken by the Minns Government, in continuing to pass unnecessary laws that target and vilify peaceful protest and non-violent civil disobedience”.“This has caused officers of the NSW police to feel empowered and protected to go beyond the powers that the law bestows on them,” she wrote.All five people arrested on Friday were granted conditional bail to appear before Bankstown local court on 15 July.Torrential rain expected to hit Sydney next week as wild weather system brews off Australia’s east coastRead moreThe NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (Lecc) was contacted for comment.Earlier this year an international campaign urgednations that produce F-35 fighter jets to stop supplying Israel.SEC Plating told Guardian Australia on Friday that: “We have no involvement in providing plating services for various parts used in the F-35 Jet program.”“We do not have any business servicing F-35 components,” the business added. “We do have business servicing some Australian defence manufactures however F-35 components are not part of this.”Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesAustralian police and policingSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

That rain then gets driven on to the coast at a greater rate of knots.”As of Saturday morning, the system was forecast to start drifting east by Thursday.Elsewhere, cooler than average morning temperatures that affected much of the country in recent days are expected to continue until early next week.A band of cloud is forecast to bring rainfall from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Queensland’s south-east this weekend, with falls reaching the Brisbane and Gold Coast areas by late Sunday.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

He was sporting a black shirt and suit, while she wore a soft-pink off-the-shoulder dress. They kissed on the boat while greeting those around them.At the ceremony the bride wore a high-necked silhouette dress and a tulle and lace veil by Dolce & Gabbana, which she told Vogue magazine was based on Sophia Loren’s dress to marry Cary Grant in the 1958 film, Houseboat.Jeff in Venice: seven takeaways from the Bezos-Sánchez weddingRead moreSánchez was also wearing a pair of diamond earrings by Dolce & Gabbana, which, according to Vogue, was lent to her in keeping with the tradition that it brings good luck for a bride to wear something borrowed.Bezos, who is No 4 on Forbes’ global billionaires list, donned a black tuxedo and bow tie over a white shirt.Friday’s ceremony had no legal status under Italian law, a senior city hall official told Reuters, suggesting the couple may have previously wed legally in the United States to avoid the bureaucracy associated with an Italian marriage.While some residents and activists raged against Bezos as a symbol of inequality and arrogance, Venetian businesses and political leaders welcomed the luxury nuptials, hailing them as a major boost for the local economy.“Those who protest are in contradiction with the history of Venice, which is a history of relations, contacts and business,” mayor Luigi Brugnaro told Reuters.“Bezos embodies the Venetian mentality. He is more Venetian than the protesters,” said the centre-right mayor, adding that he hoped Bezos, who donated €3m (£2.5m) to local institutions, would return to the city to do business.Brugnaro said Bezos had attached no conditions to holding his wedding celebrations in Venice, and city hall had only learned about his donations after they had been made.Bezos, Amazon’s executive chair, got engaged to Sánchez in 2023, four years after the collapse of his 25-year marriage to novelist and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott.Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosVeniceItalyWeddingsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Hungarians will join forces with campaigners and politicians from acrossEuropein the march that has become a potent symbol of pushback against the Hungarian government’s steady rollback of rights.“This weekend, all eyes are on Budapest,” Hadja Lahbib, the European commissioner for equality, told reporters in the Hungarian capital on Friday.“This is bigger than onePridecelebration, one Pride march. It is about the right to be who you are, to love who you want, whether it is in Budapest, in Brussels or anywhere else.”The country’s main Pride march wascast into doubtearlier this year after the country’s ruling Fidesz party – led by the rightwing populist Viktor Orbán – backed legislation that createda legal basisfor Pride to be banned, citing a widely criticised need to protect children.The government alsosaid it would usefacial recognition software to identify people attending any banned events, potentially fining them up to €500 (£425).The move caused outrage from withinHungaryand beyond, turning Budapest Pride into a rallying cry against a government that has long faced criticism for weakening democratic institutions and gradually undermining the rule of law.Read the full story here:Budapest Pride expected to be a rallying cry against Orbán’s rollback of rightsRead moreIn other developments:Severe weather warningshave been issuedacross southern Europe,including inItaly,SpainandPortugal, with temperatures expected to get close to or locally even above 40C this weekend,prompting concerns about health hazards and wildfires(14:32).Expected temperatures on early Saturday afternoon:Madrid38C,Thessaloníki38C,Florence38C,Rome37C,Lisbon36C,Tirana36C,Athens35C.It will be hot inParis(32C) and still warm inLondonandBerlin28C, and inBrussels27C.European leadersfailed to agree on the latest, 18th, package of sanctionsat last night’sEuropean Councilmeeting inBrussels, withHungaryandSlovakiaholding firm in their opposition to the proposed measures.But it’s worth noting thatthe EUhasagreed on rolling over the already existing sanctions againstRussia,which were due to expire.InGermany, lawmakersagreed to suspend family reunification rights for refugees without asylum statusas conservative chancellorFriedrich Merz’sgovernment pursuesa crackdown on immigration.Kremlin spokespersonDmitry Peskovsaid thatEstonia’s stated intention to let Nato allies’ nuclear-capable aircraft use its territory was a direct threat to Moscow.Share"

The Hungarian national was marching with her daughter, Zsófi, 23, who had travelled from her home in Barcelona to join the rally.After the ruling Fidesz party, led by the rightwing populist Orbán,fast-trackeda law that made it an offence to hold or attend events that involve the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors, many Hungarians vowed to show their disapproval by attending Pride for the first time.Viki Márton was among those who had made good on the promise, turning up with her nine-year-old daughter.The pair had come equipped with hats, water spray, and a swimsuit, more worried about heat than rightwing protesters. “I want her to see the reality,” said Márton. “And I’m so excited to be here!”View image in fullscreenTens of thousands of Hungarians took to the streets on Saturday, despite Orbán’s warning on Friday that those who attend or organise the march will face ‘legal consequences’.Photograph: János Kummer/Getty ImagesEarlier this month, police announced theywould follow the government’s ordersand ban the march. The progressive mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, was swift to respond, saying that the march would instead go ahead as a separate municipal event, with Karácsony describing it as a way to circumvent the need for official authorisation.On Saturday, the mayor reiterated why the city had decided to host the event, hinting at how the march had become a symbol of discontent against a government that haslong faced criticismfor weakening democratic institutions and gradually undermining the rule of law.“The government is always fighting against an enemy against which they have to protect Hungarian people,” said Karácsony.“This time, it is sexual minorities that are the target … we believe there should be no first and second class citizens, so we decided to stand by this event.”Akos Horvath, 18, who had travelled two hours from his city in southernHungaryto take part in the march, described it as an event of “symbolic importance”.Speaking to news agency AFP, he added: “It’s not just about representing gay people, but about standing up for the rights of the Hungarian people.”The sentiment was echoed by fellow marcher Eszter Rein-Bódi. “This is about much more, not just about homosexuality,” Rein-Bódi told Reuters “This is the last moment to stand up for our rights.”View image in fullscreen‘This is about much more, not just about homosexuality,’ one participant told Reuters.Photograph: Lisa Leutner/ReutersTens of thousands of Hungarians, including senior citizens and parents with their children, plus politicians and campaigners from 30 countries, took to the streets on Saturday, despite Orbán’s warning on Friday that those who attend or organise the march will face “legal consequences”.The Hungarian prime minister sought to minimise concerns over violence, however, saying that Hungary was a “civilised country” and police would not “break it up … It cannot reach the level of physical abuse”.Still, in a video posted to social media this week, the country’s justice minister, Bence Tuzson, warned the Budapest mayor that organising a banned event or encouraging people to attend is punishable by up to a year in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Elton, 30, a Brazilian living in Hungary wore a hat and sunglasses as he took part on Saturday, explaining that he had been worried about jeopardising his job and immigration status, but that his Hungarian boyfriend had persuaded him to attend.“This is my second time at Pride, but the first time I feel insecure about it,” he said.View image in fullscreenOrbán’s government had also prompted concerns across Hungary and beyond after it said it would use facial recognition software to identify people attending any banned events.Photograph: Lisa Leutner/ReutersMici, a 21-year-old Budapest resident, said she had attended Pride marches in the past but this time had weighed whether to join in after she was spooked by reports of the facial recognition system.“At first, I was scared to come out because of the news, but I feel safe with so many people.”She hoped that the massive turnout for the march would be enough to push the Orbán government to change its stance.“I think the crowd that has come from acrossEurope, the record numbers, will make Hungarian people see that this cause is well-supported.”Explore more on these topicsHungaryLGBTQ+ rightsViktor OrbánEuropePridenewsShareReuse this content"

One of the boat’s reception areas is mud-soaked, cluttered and ruined, its upholstered sofas and chairs torn and stained.View image in fullscreenBayesian exterior.Photograph: TG/RAINEWSAnother shows an open hatchway leading down from the deck, while a side view of the hull and one of the vessel’s propellers reveals some of the mud that accumulated during its 10-month spell beneath the waves.The Bayesian was anchored near the port of Porticello when it sank during a violent storm shortly before dawn on 19 August 2024. Lynch had been enjoying a voyage around Sicily with his family and some friends celebrating his acquittal in a long-running fraud case regarding the sale of the technology company he founded, Autonomy, to Hewlett-Packard in 2011.Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, died, as did a lawyer, Chris Morvillo, and his wife, Neda; Jonathan Bloomer, a banker, and his wife, Judy; and the yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas. Nine other crew members and six guests were rescued.View image in fullscreenA hatchway leading down from the deck of the Bayesian.Photograph: TG/RAINEWSInvestigators hope the yacht will yield clues to the causes of the sinking. A forensic examination will seek to determine whether one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised.According to a preliminary safety report released last month by the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds when running on its engine. These “vulnerabilities” were “unknown to either the owner or the crew” as they were not included in the stability information book onboard.The MAIB said a possible “tornadic waterspout” headed towards the boats in the harbour. The docks seemed to divert the whirlwind, which went straight towards the Bayesian, and the vessel sank within a few seconds.Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into suspected manslaughter. The boat’s captain, James Cutfield, from New Zealand, and two British crew members,Tim Parker Eaton and Matthew Griffiths, have been placed under investigation. In Italy, this does not imply guilt or mean that formal charges will necessarily follow.The family of Thomas, a Canadian-Antiguan national, have said they were waiting to see what the MAIB experts found.View image in fullscreenDamaged equipment inside the Bayesian.Photograph: TG/RAINEWS“Lessons need to be learned from this tragedy, as well as establishing the truth of what happened and bringing those responsible to justice,” said James Healy-Pratt, a partner at Keystone Law, which is representing the Thomas family.Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mike and Hannah Lynch as well as those of Jonathan and Judy Bloomer.The complex operation to salvage the Bayesian was temporarily suspended in mid-May afterRob Cornelis Maria Huijben, a 39-year-old Dutch diver, died during underwater work.Additional reportingLorenzo TondoExplore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A strike at midday on Saturday killed at least 11 people.A displaced family in a tent was killed in an Israeli strike in al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, while they were sleeping.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 56,000 people, half of whom are women and children, local health authorities say.Famine-like conditions reign in Gaza after a two-and-a-half month blockade imposed by Israel on all food until late May, since when Israel has allowed only a dribble of humanitarian aid into the strip.Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage.The latest killings come as a ceasefire in Gaza seems within reach, with Donald Trump saying on Friday that an agreement could come within a week. “I think it’s close,” the US president said. “I just spoke to some of the people involved. We think within the next week we’re going to get a ceasefire.”Reports say Israel’s minister for strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, will visit Washington next week to discuss the ceasefire, among other topics.The recent ceasefire with Iran, which ended a 12-day conflict that Israel perceived to be a great success, might provide breathing room for long-stalled peace talks. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said on Thursday: “Along with releasing our hostages and defeating Hamas, there is an opportunity, a window of opportunity has opened and it can’t be missed. Not even a single day can be wasted.”Fighting started anew in Gaza in March, when Israel restarted its war after refusing to move to a second phase of a January ceasefire that could have led to a more permanent truce. Negotiations since then have so far been fruitless, with Hamas insisting on a total end to the war in Gaza – a demand Israel has rejected.Since the breakdown of the March ceasefire, more than 6,000 people have been killed in Gaza. Israel, for its part, says its aim for continuing the war is to return about 50 hostages who remain in Gaza, 30 of whom are presumed to be dead. Hamas has said it is willing to free all the hostages if there is a permanent truce, but Netanyahu wants the militant group to be completely dismantled in Gaza.The most recent US proposal for a ceasefire involved a 60-day pause in fighting and renewed talks to achieve long-term peace, in addition to the release of half of all living hostages and half of the deceased. Hamas previously requested amendments to the proposal to release fewer hostages and for a permanent truce, which was rejected by the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, at the end of May.As ceasefire talks have languished, humanitarian conditions in Gaza have sharply deteriorated. Unicef said last week that 60% of water production facilities in Gaza were out of order and that there was a 50% increase in acute child malnutrition from April to May.Scenes of chaos unfold every day as crowds of hungry Palestinians have had to walk miles and contend with confusing sets of rules to access food, now distributed from set points run by the private American initiative the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).More than 500 people have been shot dead by Israeli forces as they have attempted to get aid from GHF distribution points, with witnesses accusing Israeli soldiers of shooting directly at crowds. The Israeli military said it was investigating such incidents.Fifteen international human rights organisations have called on the GHF to halt its operations in Gaza, saying it risks being complicit in war crimes. The organisations also accused the GHF of violating the principles of neutrality and independence, cornerstones of humanitarian work.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We are working on this with enthusiasm,” Israel’s longest-serving prime ministersaid on Thursday in a pre-recorded statement.Critics of the 75-year-old leader saw something else.“Whatever he does, he tries to turn everything to his advantage … This is a guy who never takes responsibility but only credit … Everything is opportunistic and everything is transactional,” said Prof Yossi Mekelberg at Chatham House in London.Quite how long Netanyahu will stay in power is now a burning question inIsrael, as the country recovers from the rollercoaster of fear and elation of the last weeks.With the Iran war apparently over, the conflict in Gaza has returned to the headlines. On the day after the US declared a ceasefire,seven Israeli soldiers diedin an attack on an outdated armoured vehicle in the south of the devastated territory, prompting further urgent calls within Israel for the hostilities there to be brought to a close.Back in the headlines, too, are the deep divisions in Israeli society and within the coalition Netanyahu put together after elections in November 2022. This is themost rightwing governmentever seen in Israel, and has survived multiple challenges since the 7 October 2023 Hamas raid into Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostage.For Prof Tamar Hermann, a specialist in public opinion at theIsrael Democracy Institute, the war has changed little in terms of Israel’s polarised domestic politics.“Netanyahu’s supporters support him even more and opponents oppose him like before. They see the [war against Iran] as very successful but don’t credit Netanyahu. He gets some points … but not so many,” Hermann said.Netanyahu loyalists hope for a major boost in the polls.Udi Tenne, a strategic adviser and campaign manager for ministers in the current government, said: “The operation [against Iran] led by Prime Minister Netanyahu was unquestionably justified, but it also, undeniably, benefited him politically. To put it metaphorically, the missiles launched at Iran also landed on the Israeli opposition.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrations in support of the hostages in Gaza – and against the Israeli government – have continued (Tel Aviv, 7 June 2025, pictured). People ‘haven’t forgotten’ the 7 October Hamas attack, said one political correspondent.Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/ReutersA key question is whether the perceived victory over Iran will convince enough voters to forget thatthe 2023 attack– Israel’s worst ever security failure – not only occurred on Netanyahu’s watch but can be attributed in part to policies he had pursued over a decade or more.“Since that horrific day, Israel’s security situation has dramatically improved: the Iranian threat has been neutralised, Syria has collapsed, [the Lebanese militant group] Hezbollah has been severely damaged, and Gaza lies dismantled. We are living through a profound security transformation – and for that, great credit is due to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and to the government,” said Tenne.Others are less convinced, andrecent pollsare inconclusive. The relatively minor gains made by Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party have largely been at the expense of other coalition parties, notably the far right, and would not necessarily guarantee a win at any election.And a requirement for a 90-day gap between a dissolution of parliament and new elections means a snap poll would be a big risk for Netanyahu, even if his personal ratings have risen.“People are going to give Netanyahu a lot of credit for the operation against Iran and polls show this. But they haven’t forgotten [the 7 October attack] and politics have not become less divisive,” said Lahav Harkov, a senior political correspondent at the US-based Jewish Insider.Netanyahu’s tactical instincts have never been in doubt throughout his long and controversial career. They are still admired by his supporters and bitterly regretted by detractors. “One of his greatest political talents is he knows how to delay and come up with temporary workarounds so he can live another day,” said Harkov.Advisers to leaders of Israel’s opposition parties said last week they were encouraged by recent polls and believed that the many other issues that have riled voters – persistent corruption allegations, Netanyahu’s ongoing graft trial, a bitter row over whether Orthodox Jews should be exemption from conscription and the rising cost of living – will come to the fore as new elections loom.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protested in December outside the court in Tel Aviv, where Netanyahufaced ongoing corruption charges.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APOthers point out that Netanyahu’s political base is far from monolithic, and that his comments about thecost to his familyof the recent conflict have provoked much anger.Netanyahu’s political demise has been often predicted, most recently in October 2023. However, he has not only retained power but consistently outmanoeuvred rivals and opponents. A bid to bring down his government was only narrowly defeated a day before he launched Israel’s warplanes against Iran.“He desperately needed some success. I don’t think it was a coincidence that it happened as he was being cross-examined in his corruption trial,” said Mekelberg.Loyalists have no doubt who will be in charge in the coming years. “He has returned to power with a firm grip,” said Tenne. “If David Ben-Gurion declared Israel’s independence, then it is Benjamin Netanyahu who is now securing its future.”Netanyahu appears convinced, too. With only weeks of the parliamentary term to go before a three-month summer recess, he has at least bought himself time until the late autumn.“I have many more objectives, and as long as I believe I can fulfil them, I will,”he saidlast week.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was done to spread awareness and ask tourists to be away from the riverbank and never step on the riverbed. At least 71 people were booked in cases in violation of the warnings.”He added: “It was a tragic and unfortunate incident and the tourists were in the riverbed.”When the flash flood occurred, the family from Punjab province were having a picnic breakfast by the river in the Swat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The family had gone into the river to rescue the children, who had been taking photos, government officials said.According to Akram, at least 17 people were swept away in the flash floods in the Swat River – bodies of nine family members had been recovered and one was missing. Four other people were rescued while three were still missing. He said the rescue efforts were continuing.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) later issued an alert saying there were high flood levels and warning people to take precautions.Pakistan, with a population of more than 240 million, is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis.Climate induced flash floodsin 2022, killed at least1,700 people and affected more than 33 millionpeople. The incident prompted discussion in Pakistanon the climate crisis, provincial governments’ role in preventing such incidents, tourists avoiding warnings and allegations of incompetence and corruption in local government.The former climate change minister Sherry Rehman said the tourists in Pakistan no longer respond to colonial-era instructions such as section 144 – which allows district administrations to place bans on activities – and they seem not to heed extreme weather warnings.Rehman criticised poor government signalling on the climate crisis and a lack of coordinated efforts, saying: “Public resources also fell egregiously short in this tragedy. The PDMA should have mobilised a helicopter to get to the marooned family in time. It’s outrageous negligence on their part not to have.”Many social media users criticised the government for failing to rescue the stranded family aswitness accountssaid they were stuck for more than an hour without any help.The PDMAs were created after the deadly 2005 earthquake in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and are responsible for responding in a timely way to natural calamities, floods and disasters. The disaster authorities in different Pakistani provinces have been accused of corruption.Explore more on these topicsPakistanClimate crisisExtreme weatherFloodingSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Police said the seven-year-old girl died in hospital.Three other children suffered minor injuries following the incident in Southend-on-Sea.Essex police said they were called to Chalkwell park shortly before 3pm, where they found “a number of casualties”.Ch supt Leighton Hammett said: “Families are facing unimaginable hardship this evening and all of our thoughts are with them at this time.“I cannot begin to put into words how difficult today’s events have been, and continue to be, for them.“It’s also not lost on me how traumatic it must have been for the members of the public who witnessed this awful incident.”An East of England ambulance service spokesperson had earlier said: “Two children were transported by road to Southend university hospital.“A further three children were later transported by road to the same hospital with minor injuries.”Police advised the public to avoid the area.Ishan Madan, 39, from Westcliff-on-Sea, was playing in a cricket match nearby when he heard a “horrendous, screeching scream”.Madan, an accountant, said: “Everyone ran towards the clubhouse, where the tree is.“The tree had snapped and I think there were four children, the fifth one was slightly further away, I think she’d been hit by a branch.“Two of them were under a smaller branch, they were rescued easily, and unfortunately, the other two girls, they were stuck under this massive tree.“So we got bystanders to help, it must have been 40 to 50 people who then tried to lift the fallen tree up and to our horror, these two little girls, poor girls, were stuck underneath it.“Their mother was on the corner. It was horrendous.”Adam Hutchins, 47, told the EssexLive website: “I heard there were kids playing on the tree. They heard a big crack.“It must have [been] pretty loud. They went running over and there were kids underneath the tree.“All the cricket guys ran over and tried to loft the tree up. I think it’s one of the oldest trees. It had metal stands propping it up.”David Burton-Sampson, Labour MP for Southend West and Leigh, said: “The news of the sad death of one of the children involved in the incident at Chalkwell park today is truly devastating.“I am sure I reflect the thoughts of all our residents here in Southend in sending my deepest condolences to the child’s family and friends.“My thoughts are also with the other children injured and I wish them a full and speedy recovery.“At the time of the incident, the park was very busy and a number of people witnessed what happened.”Daniel Cowan, the leader of Southend’s city council, said on Saturday: “I’m aware of this very serious incident. We’re working with Essex police, the ambulance service and fire service, who are still at the scene.“I do understand that a tree has fallen, there’s a number of casualties and we’re just asking the public to avoid the area while those services carry out their work, and my thoughts are with those affected.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier the broadcaster confirmed itwould not be able to support a live streamof the performance.The broadcaster has not yet confirmed when the footage will be available on iPlayer.Users of the Glastonbury app received a push notification almost an hour before the band were due to perform saying the West Holts stage was closed. However, spectators were still getting in 20 minutes before the start of the set.The show opened with clips of news and various TV discussion shows, with politicians and commentators saying the group should be banned and had been “avoiding justice for far too long”.‘We just want to stop people being murdered’: Kneecap on Palestine, protest and provocationRead moreThere was booing from the crowd for Sharon Osborne calling them a “pathetic band”.“Glastonbury I’m a free man!” shouted Ó hAnnaidh, to wild cheers from the crowd.“If anybody falls down, you’ve got to pick them up. We’ve got to keep each other safe,” he added.The group, who rap in English and Irish, performed an energetic set including Your Sniffer Dogs Are Shite, Get Your Brits Out and Fine Art in front of a backdrop which said “Free Palestine”, occasionally varying with other phrases including “Fuck Badenoch”, referring to the leader of the Tory party.The crowds chanted: “Free Mo Chara, free free Mo Chara!”“Mo Chara’s back in court for a trumped up terrorism charge,” said Móglaí Bap, also known as Naoise Ó Cairealláin.“It’s not the first time there’s a miscarriage of justice for an Irish person in the British criminal justice system,” he said.Ó hAnnaidh cut a defiant figure, saying his plight in the courts was nothing compared to the suffering of the Palestinian people. The band urged people to come out to support Ó hAnnaidh at his next court date at Westminster magistrates court.“I want to say a big thank you to the Eavis family [organisers of Glastonbury],” Ó hAnnaidh added, for “holding strong” in the face of criticism.Asked on Wednesday about the controversy, organiser Emily Eavis said: “There have been a lot of really heated topics this year, but we remain a platform for many, many artists from all over the world and, you know, everyone is welcome here.”On numerous occasions, the trio chanted “Fuck Keir Starmer!”, with the crowd passionately shouting back. They also had the crowds chanting the Irish republican slogan, “tiocfaidh ár lá”, which translates as “our day will come”.The band laughed with the crowd asking: “Is anyone going to see Rod Stewart tomorrow?”The 80-year-old rocker was criticised ahead of his Pyramid stage performance after saying he thought the public should give Nigel Farage “a chance”.Describing him as Rod the Prod, Ó hAnnaidh said: “I mean, the man’s older than Israel.”Paloma Faith, the musician and public speaker, was in the crowd for Kneecap’s performance.She told the Guardian: “A lot of people are now being demonised because there’s such a fear of terrorism. And I understand that fear but I don’t think that Kneecap have anything to do with that. They’re all about the soul and the heart of freedom of people.“I don’t know anyone who likes to see children being killed on such a huge scale for any reason and I think [Kneecap] stand by that. Obviously they come from the perspective of a marginalised community at the hands of British colonialism.”She said artists who speak out on human rights issues were worried about being misquoted by the press or having their words taken out of context at a time when peaceful activists are coming under increasing attack from governments.She added: “Everyone’s a bit scared now. People are going to jail for stuff that isn’t what we perceive as violent. It’s scary times.”It comes after the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said on Monday that the pro-Palestinian campaign group Palestine Actionwould be proscribed under anti-terror laws.If approved in parliament in a vote next week, this would make membership and support of the group illegal and punishable with a prison sentence under anti-terror laws.On stage, Kneecap reiterated their support for the group and band member JJ Ó Dochartaigh, known as DJ Próvaí, wore a Palestine Action T-shirt, underneath a red boiler suit associated with the group as he surfed the crowd.Explore more on these topicsKneecapGlastonbury 2025newsShareReuse this content"

Ticketmaster have since informed customers that the event will no longer go ahead as planned and they will be refunded.An online campaign group, No Stage for Abusers, called on the Brighton Centre and Brighton and Hove city council, which owns the venue, to cancel the performance.Four women had sued Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, accusing him of rape, sexual assault and bodily harm. However, after a year-long investigation, the case against him wasdropped in January.Prosecutors in California found that the statute of limitations had been exceeded and argued they would not be able to bring charges that prove Warner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.The identities of the women were not revealed, but Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, who sued Warner in a case that has now been settled, stated that she was part of the criminal investigation.Marilyn Manson: Unmasked review – should a tour bus really need the age of consent pinned to the wall?Read moreIn 2021, Manson’s former fiancee, the Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, also named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Warner has dismissed the allegations as “falsehoods”.Last week, Green Party MPSiân Berryexpressed her concerns about Warner’s scheduled performance in her constituency in Brighton, writing anopen letterto the leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Bella Sankey.In Berry’s letter, which was co-signed by a host of groups and the University of Sussex students’ union, she made the case for cancelling the concert, saying it went against “the city’s well-renowned values”.Berry wrote: “Many survivors in Brighton and Hove, and organisations supporting them, will have serious concerns about this booking and its wider impact on other people visiting the city centre, local residents and the wider community.”She added: “The council has a responsibility to take action where there are risks of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.”Supporters of Warner point out that Warner has not been found guilty of allegations against him. Others said the decision infringes on freedom of speech.One person told The Argus: “This is cancel culture, nothing more, and it’ll backfire when artists don’t add a Brighton and Hove date to their tours and stick to London, which incidentally hasn’t bannedMarilyn Mansonfrom their city.”Explore more on these topicsMarilyn MansonBrightonSiân BerrynewsShareReuse this content"

Not all Republican senators are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8tn in Trump tax breaks.Before the vote to advance the measure opened, the White House released a statement saying it “strongly supports passage” of the bill that “implements critical aspects” of the president’s agenda. Trump himself was at his golf course in Virginia on Saturday with Republican senators, including one of the holdouts, Rand Paul of Kentucky. Paul later voted against advancing the legislation.“It’s time to get this legislation across the finish line,” the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said.The940-page billwas released shortly before midnight Friday, and senators are expected to grind through the days ahead with hours of potentially all-night debate and countless amendments. Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.With the narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, leaders need almost every lawmaker on board in the face of essentially unified opposition from Democrats.Elon Musk, the billionaire Trump donor who came out in strong opposition to the House version of the bill, denounced the Senate draft on his social media platform, X, on Saturday. “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!”Musk wroteabove a comment from a green energy expert who pointed out that the bill raises taxes on new wind and solar projects.“Utterly insane and destructive,” Musk added. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”Bernie Moreno, the Republican senator from Ohio, opened the day’s session with an impassioned defense of the package that he said had been misrepresented by its critics. “Read it for yourself,” he said.Senate Democrats intend to do just that, with the minority leader, Chuck Schumer,announcingon social media Saturday afternoon that his party will force the entire bill to be read aloud before a final vote on passage can take place.Speaking on the Senate floor, SchumersaidRepublicans had released the bill “in the dead of night” and were rushing to pass it before the public fully knows what’s in it.The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump’s party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic-policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up, even as he sometimes gives mixed signals, allowing for more time.At recent events at the White House, including on Friday, Trump has admonished the “grandstanders” among GOP holdouts to fall in line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump’s first term that would otherwise expire by year’s end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350bn to national security, including for Trump’s mass deportation agenda.But the spending cuts that Republicans are relying on to offset the lost tax revenues are causing dissent within the GOP ranks. Some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving healthcare through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives worried about the nation’s debt are pushing for steeper cuts.Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he remains concerned about the fundamentals of the package and will not support the procedural motion to begin debate. Rand Paul has opposed the measure on the grounds that it will raise the nation’s debt limit by $5tn. And Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican pushing for deeper cuts, said he needed to see the final legislative text.The release of that draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the bill to ensure it complied with the chamber’s strict “Byrd rule”, which bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 Republican edge, and Democrats unified against Trump’s bill.Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals were determined to be out of compliance by the chief arbiter of the Senate’s rules. One plan would have shifted some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states; a second would have gutted the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.The final text includes a proposal for cuts to a Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary objections and opposition from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25bn fund to aid rural hospitals and providers.Most states impose the provider tax as a way to boost federal Medicaid reimbursements. Some Republicans argue that is a scam and should be abolished.Thenonpartisan congressional budget officehas said that under the House-passed version of the bill,some 10.9 million more peoplewould go without healthcare and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The CBO has not yet publicly assessed the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions. Top income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the package would cost the poorest Americans $1,600,the CBO said.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateUS politicsUS domestic policyDonald TrumpDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Federal judge Orlando Garcia sentenced Torres to life in prison and Ortega to 83 years of incarceration, essentially a life sentence.The judge also imposed a $250,000 fine on each of the defendants.Five other men have also pleaded guilty for their role in the smuggling operation and are scheduled to be sentenced later.The truck washolding64 migrants from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The vehiclehada broken air conditioner and no water, which amounted to suffocating conditions in the Texas summer.Only 11 of those who were in the tractor-truck survived an ordeal that grimlyillustratedthe risks migrants are willing to take to cross the US border in order to escape violence or financial turmoil in their countries.The migrants had paid the smugglers between $12,000 to $15,000 each to be taken across the US border, according to thecase’s indictment. They were placed in the vehicle in Laredo, a town at the border, and then headed to San Antonio, which is a three-hour drive away.As temperatures rose inside the truck, the people inside screamed and banged on the walls. Many eventually passed out. When the truck was found on 27 June 2022, more than a dozen of them were taken to the hospital, where five more died.The men had known the air conditioning in the truck was broken, according to prosecutors. And they had discovered dozens of the people inside had died when they opened the back of the truck at the end of the three-hour trip.“Three years to the day after these two smugglers and their co-conspirators left dozens of men, women and children locked in a sweltering tractor-trailer to die in the Texas summer heat, they learned that they will spend the rest of their lives locked away in a federal prison,” said a statement from the US attorney for the western district of Texas, Justin Simmons.Prosecutors said that Orduna-Torres was the leader of a group of men who smuggled people from Mexico and South America between December 2021 and June 2022. He and Gonzales-Garcia shared routes, vehicles, stash houses and transporters to “consolidate costs, minimize risks and maximize profit”, according to a statement from the justice department.Migrant smuggling has become a multibillion-dollar industry that is often run in coordination with some of Mexico’s most violent cartels. While the number of migrants apprehended at the border has dropped since Donald Trump’s second presidency began in January,reportshave said people are still being smuggled into the US through methods and routes that are even more dangerous.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS immigrationUS crimeUS justice systemnewsShareReuse this content"

Minnesota’s chief federal prosecutor has called the killing an assassination. The shootings also left her husband, Mark, dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded.Suspect in Minnesota killings accused of being ‘prepper’ preparing ‘for war’Read more“Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history. I get to remember her as a close friend, a mentor and the most talented legislator I have ever known,” Minnesota’s governor,Tim Walz, said in his eulogy.Walz, who was Harris’s running mate in the 2024 White House election won by Donald Trump, added: “For seven years, I have had the privilege of signing her agenda into law. I know millions of Minnesotans get to live their lives better because she and Mark chose public service and politics.”Neither Biden nor Harris spoke, but they sat in the front row with Walz. Biden was also one of more than 7,500 people who paid their respects on Friday as Hortman, her husband and their golden retriever, Gilbert,lay in statein the Minnesota capitol rotunda in St Paul. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. Biden also visited the wounded senator in a hospital.Dozens of current and former state legislators from both parties and other elected officials who worked with Hortman also attended.As House speaker, Hortman helped pass an expansive agenda of liberal initiatives such as free lunches for public school students along with strengthened protections for abortion and trans rights during a momentous 2023 legislative session. With the House split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans this year, she yielded the gavel to a Republican under a power-sharing deal, took the title speaker emerita and helped break a budget impasse that threatened to shut down state government.Walz said Hortman – who was first elected in 2004 – saw her mission as “to get as much good done for as many people as possible”. And he said her focus on people was what made her so effective.“She certainly knew how to get her way – no doubt about that,” Walz said. “But she never made anyone feel that they’d gotten rolled at a negotiating table. That wasn’t part of it for her, or a part of who she was. She didn’t need somebody else to lose to win for her.”The governor said the best way to honor the Hortmans would be by following their example.“Maybe it is this moment where each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for things we care about,” Walz said. “A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did – fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity.”A private burial for the Hortmans will be held at a later date.The Hortmans were proud of their adult children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, and the lawmaker often spoke of them.In a voice choked with emotion, Colin said his parents embodied the “Golden Rule”, and he read the prayer of St Francis, which his mother always kept in her wallet. He said it captures her essence. It starts: “Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.”After the service, Walz presented the children with US and Minnesota flags that flew over the state capitol on the day their parents were killed.The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park on 14 June, and wounding Democratic state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, surrendered near his home the night of 15 June.Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, remains jailed and has not entered a plea to charges that could carry the federal death penalty.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaUS crimeJoe BidenKamala HarrisTim WalzUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening, according to a release from state parks officials.The woman did not see what bit her, and a subsequent drone search for dangerous marine life was not successful. But experts analyzing photos of the injuries and other factors believe the bites “most likely” came from a juvenile sand tiger shark, state officials said.Swimming was immediately suspended after the incident and resumed on Thursday morning after a check of the water by drones and lifeguards. Patrols aimed at protecting swimmers will reportedly remain in place through the summer.Though they get a disproportionate amount of public attention,casesof sharks biting humans are rare.There had been 47 confirmed unprovoked shark bites worldwide last year after an average of 64 annually between 2019 and 2023, saidthe International Shark Attack File, a renowned resource. Seven of those attacks last year were fatal.Twenty-eight of 2024’s unprovoked shark attacks were in the US – and half were registered in Florida. None were inNew York– though in 2022, a cluster of five attacks over two weeks in the same Long Island area captured international headlines.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkSharksMarine lifeWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Last month, questions were raised about the direction of Meta’s AI development after it delayed the scheduled rollout of Behemoth, its flagship AI model.Earlier this month, Meta paid $14bn for a stake in Scale AI and is putting its founder, 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, in charge of its “superintelligence team” – an internal lab that would focus on Meta’s efforts to develop a hypothetical AI system that is smarter than humans.Last year, Google bought out the shareholders in Character.AI, a chatbot service that allows users to have personal conversations with different AI personas, for $2.7bn.People on “the list”, as Zuckerberg’s slate is known around Silicon Valley, include recent graduates from top PhD programs at schools like the University of California at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. Many are currently employed by Meta’s AI competitors, including OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind project, and have traded notes with each other on Meta’s recruiting efforts.A recruit who has personally spoken to Zuckerberg said that his goal appears to be a “transfusion from the country’s top AI labs”. A WhatsApp group chat called “Recruiting Party” was formed for Zuckerberg and at least two other senior Meta executives to talk through potential hires. The Meta CEO has been trying to personally find candidates by looking through research papers, according to the Wall Street Journal.Zuckerberg’s hands-on recruiting efforts have drawn the ire of OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, whocalledthe rumored signing bonuses and compensation packages on offer “crazy”.“I’m really happy that, at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,” Altman said during an appearanceon the Uncapped podcast, which is hosted by his brother Jack. “I think the strategy of a ton of upfront, guaranteed comp, and that being the reason you tell someone to join, like really the degree to which they’re focusing on that and not the work and not the mission, I don’t think that’s going to set up a great culture.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsMark ZuckerbergArtificial intelligence (AI)MetaOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

John Catsimatidis, billionaire CEO of grocery chain Gristedes and friend of Donald Trump, warned on Fox Business: “If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell, or move.”CNBC financial news channel anchor Joe Kernen compared New York to Batman’scrime-riddled Gotham. “ They’re taking Wall Streeters and making them walk out onto the ice in the East River, And, and then they fall through. I mean there is a class warfare that’s going on.”‘New Yorkers have been betrayed’: can Zohran Mamdani become the most progressive mayor in the city’s history?Read moreWith five months until the mayoral election proper, the 1% are revolting, led by loquacious billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman, who said he and others in the finance industry are ready to commit “hundreds of millions of dollars” into an opposing campaign. “The risk/reward of running for mayor over the next 132 days is extremely compelling as the cost in time and energy is small and the upside is enormous.”Ackman said he was “gravely concerned” because he believed the leftwing candidate’s policies would trigger an exodus of the wealth that would destroy the tax base and undermine New York’s public services. The city under Mamdani, hepostedon Wedneday, “is about to become much more dangerous and economically unviable.”In 2021, the top 1% of New York City taxpayers paid 48% of taxes – up from 40% in 2019, according to a report from the city’s finance department. But at the same time, New York has become an increasingly unaffordable city for those outside the 1% –especiallyfor people of color.In a post a day later, Ackman said: “The ability forNew YorkCity to offer services for the poor and needy, let alone the average New Yorker, is entirely dependent on New York City being a business-friendly environment and a place where wealthy residents are willing to spend 183 days and assume the associated tax burden. Unfortunately, both have already started making arrangements for the exits.”“Terror is the feeling,” Kathryn Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, which represents top business leaders, told CNBC on Tuesday.Gerard Filitti, senior legal counsel at the Lawfare Project, a pro-Israel thinktank, non-profit and litigation fund, and a New Yorker with strong ties to the finance industry, said Mamdani’s nomination “marked a dangerous turning point for the city”.“There’s big concern that businesses and the economy will be hurt. There’s already a move by business leaders and entrepreneurs to consider a move outside of the city, taking jobs and tax dollars with them, at time when the front-running candidate promises to make even more change that could destroy the economy,” Filitti said.The anger was not necessarily purely economic. Wall Street’s decision makers have been shaken after seeing their preferred candidate, Andrew Cuomo, pushed aside despite the millions they poured into his campaign.Fix the City, Cuomo’s political action committee (Pac), raised a record $25m to help see off Mamdani. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg alone gave $8.3m to the Pac.“These are billionaires who are giving hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars to Andrew Cuomo precisely because they know we are going to tax them to make life a little bit more affordable here, in the most expensive city in the United States,” Mamdani told theNew York Timesbefore the election. “They know they can count on Cuomo because Cuomo has a track record of rewarding the political donors.”View image in fullscreenA Mamdani supporter wears a sticker that says ‘I didn’t rank Cuomo.’Photograph: Heather Khalifa/APNew York’s moneyed class argues it’s not about them but the future of the city. “When you look at what New York City is and has been historically – a bastion of trading and the center of world capitalism, the engine of economic growth and prosperity, the stock market, an the inspiration for other world economies to develop their markets and economies in line with New York – and now what were seeing is an economy and quality of life that is slowly deteriorating,” said Filitti.“Now we have a front-running Democrat candidate who is promising even more radical change and that change is a threat to the structure of New York and the way people identify with New York City,” Filitti added.It’s an argument the rich have made many times before. Many of the 1% threatened to leave after former mayor Bill de Blasio called for raising their taxes to pay for the losses the city experienced after the Covid pandemic. Wall Streetpoured millionsinto mayor Eric Adam’s 2021 campaign for office to see off more progressive candidates. They won those fights; this time, they lost.A former Wall Street CEO told Politico: “These titans of Wall Street and titans of finance are used to getting their way. They didn’t get their way. They got the opposite of their way. They got a guy who couldn’t be more disliked by them – and vice versa.”Wall Street’s vision for the city is probably far from that shared by many other residents of a sprawling metropolis that traditionally has played host to vibrant immigrant communities from all over the world, many of them poor. It is of course, host to the Statue of Liberty on whose base is written the famous lines: “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”Manhattan was also the birthplace of the Occupy Wall Street protests in the US back in 2011, which occupied the downtown Zucotti Square – blocks from Wall Street – and eventually saw protests spread across the rest of the country and the world.Democratic progressives were quick to celebrate Mamdani’s victory. “Your dedication to an affordable, welcoming, and safe New York City where working families can have a shot has inspired people across the city. Billionaires and lobbyists poured millions against you and our public finance system. And you won,”wroterepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another progressive who won out against a more establishment candidate.Another longtime critic of Wall Street and the billionaire class also saw a change in politics as usual. “The American people are beginning to stand up and fight back. We have seen that in the manyFighting Oligarchyevents that we’ve done around the country that have drawn huge turnouts. We have seen that in the millions of people who came out for theNo Kings ralliesthat took place this month in almost every state. And yesterday, we saw that in the Democratic primary in New York City,” senatorBernie Sanderswrote in The Guardian.Millions will now be spent attacking Mamdani. But he has seen off one well-funded attempt to derail his campaign. Whether or not his campaign has the momentum to last until November, remains to be seen. But Wall Streeters have been put on notice that New York, and the changing nature of the Democratic party, may no longer be as amenable to their interests, or their vision for New York.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkZohran MamdaniUS income inequalityUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After defeating Alcaraz, the world No 2, en route to the Australian Open semi-finals in January, Djokovic reached the French Open semi-finals with a stellar win over the world No 3, Alexander Zverev, before losing in three tight sets to Sinner. The Serb departed Paris as the third best performer at the grand slam tournaments so far this year and he continues to compete at an extremely high level.At 38, long past his physical peak, the faster, less attritional grass courts are more conducive to his game. “This year I played two semi-finals. Unfortunately in Australia I had to retire. In Roland Garros I was outplayed by Sinner. I think I still played a decent level of tennis that showed me that I can still play on a very high level at the later stages. That’s what is also giving me an extra, I guess motivation to keep going. Obviously clay court, yeah, probably slightly less chances to win compared to grass.”Djokovic, the sixth seed this year, is attempting to break his tie with Pete Sampras and become the joint record holder at the All England Club alongside his great rival Roger Federer with eight titles. A victory would also mark him as the oldest grand slam champion in history. As was the case at the French Open, he is unsure of whether this will be his final appearance at Wimbledon. At such an advanced age in the sport, he has resolved to take things one tournament at a time.View image in fullscreenJack Draper could meet Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianShould both players live up to their rankings, Djokovic would face Jack Draper, the British No 1, in the quarter-finals. The fourth seed continued his preparations for Wimbledon on Saturday by working through a friendly practice match with Jacob Fearnley, the British No 2.After suffering with tonsillitis during his semi-final run at Queen’s last week, Draper again stressed that he is feeling much better. He rested for two days after Queen’s but he has trained consistently since Tuesday. In addition to the challenge oftackling Wimbledon as a top contenderfor the first time, Draper has been handed an extremely difficult draw with a potential third-round match against Alexander Bublik, the Halle champion and his conqueror at the French Open.The making of Jack Draper: from teen ‘maniac’ to Wimbledon title contenderRead moreUnsurprisingly, Draper has had to field countless questions in interviews on his ability to handle the pressure that comes with his new status. “Obviously you guys have asked me a lot about the pressure and all that sort of stuff. I’m not thinking about that at all,” he said. “I’m thinking about how I can play my tennis out there. I’m aware that the crowd is going to really be behind me and support me and want me to drive forward in the tournament. That gives me a huge source of motivation to want to keep on trying to find my level and to try to beat these guys. So I feel good. That’s the only thing I can say.”Meanwhile, Sinner, the top seed, declined to elaborate on his surprise decision to part ways with the fitness trainer Marco Panichi and the physiotherapist Ulises Badio after his second-round defeat at Halle last week.“Nothing major happened,” said Sinner. “Nothing big happened. I parted ways not long ago, but it’s not affecting me. I feel ready to compete. I feel free. I feel me and my team, we are ready to do the best we can. I’m here to play good tennis. I think that’s my main goal, the main reason why I’m here.“We’ve reached incredible results in the past with them, so obviously huge thanks to them. We made some great job, but I decided to do something different.”Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The 6ft 2in blueliner from Hamilton, Ontario, with exceptional puck-moving ability and strong defensive skills spent the past two seasons with the Ontario Hockey League’s Erie Otters.Schaefer persevered through tragedy to reach this moment. When he pulled on his Islanders sweater for the first time on the stage, he kissed a pink ribbon patch on the chest representing breast cancer awareness before breaking into tears and pointing to the sky.Schaefer’s mother, Jennifer, died of cancer 16 months ago. He also endured the recent deaths of the Otters’ owner, Jim Waters, and the mother of his billet family.“I appreciate you taking a chance on me,” Schaefer said in a video conference call with the Islanders’ front office. “I promise I won’t disappoint, but especially I just want to say to my mom and all my family and friends, thanks for everything.”The Islanders added the patch specifically for Schaefer, along with his mother’s initials on the sweater collar.“Seeing the ribbon on my jersey, and I saw a picture, it has JS on my back here,” Schaefer said. “You can see just how high-class the organization is. It really means a lot. I wish my mom could be here today. Obviously, she’s with me here in spirit ... Cancer sucks, and it’s not fun. She didn’t feel the best, but she was always the happiest in the family. She would do anything for us.”Schaefer scored 22 points while playing in only 17 games last season before breaking his collarbone in December. His acumen on both ends of the ice still propelled him to the top of nearly all draft boards.Schaefer is just the fifth defenseman picked No 1 overall since 2000, and the first since Owen Power went to Buffalo in 2021. Schaefer also is the second Erie product to go No 1, joining Connor McDavid in 2015.“First and foremost, we drafted him because he’s an unbelievable hockey player,” Isles general manager Mathieu Darche said. “Obviously, the human being is exceptional. [For] a 17-year-old to have that resilience, maturity with everything that he’s gone through is beyond impressive, honestly. I haven’t met many 17-year-old kids that act like him. But at the end of the day, we’re drafting him because he’s a hell of a hockey player.”Schaefer got two new teammates when the Islanders used the 16th pick on Swedish forward Victor Eklund and nabbed defenseman Kashawn Aitcheson with the 17th selection.Both Pennsylvania teams were busy in Los Angeles. The Philadelphia Flyers grabbed forward Porter Martone sixth overall before trading up for the 12th selection to get forward Jack Nesbitt, while the Pittsburgh Penguins maneuvered up and down the draft to control three picks in the top 24, swinging two trades while drafting forwards Benjamin Kindel, Bill Zonnon and William Horcoff.Florida is now the Stanley Cup’s semi-permanent home.

While wearing a teal jersey for the first time, he repeated his desire to play in theNHLnext season if he can crack the roster of a struggling Sharks organization that chose Will Smith fourth overall in 2023 and got center Macklin Celebrini with the first overall pick a year ago.“He’s an ultra-competitive kid who’s been playing up a level, up a birth year his whole life,” Sharks general manager Mike Grier said about Misa. “He wants to be the best. He wants to play against the best, so I’m sure this is what he wants to do, but you know we’re not going to hand him anything. He’s got to come into training camp and try and take a job.”Frondell excelled as a 17-year-old forward last season with Djurgården in Sweden’s second division, showing off a two-way game that allowed him to push Misa on some draft boards. At 6ft 2in, he could provide a large complement to Connor Bedard.Frondell is the eighth Swedish player to be a top-three selection, joining elite company including Victor Hedman, Mats Sundin and the Sedin twins.Center Caleb Desnoyers went fourth to the Utah Mammoth, who moved up 10 spots in the draft lottery.The Nashville Predators chose physical forward Brady Martin with the fifth pick before trading up for the 21st selection to get Kitchener defenseman Cameron Reid. Martin skipped the draft, staying home on his family farm in Ontario.Fans of the host Los Angeles Kings inside the theater got fired up for their club to make the 24th selection – which the Kings promptly traded to Pittsburgh for the 31st and 59th selections, prompting groans from the crowd. Los Angeles eventually chose defenseman Henry Brzustewicz from the Memorial Cup champion London Knights in general manager Ken Holland’s first selection for his new team.The Penguins created the majority of the surprises in the first round, first by choosing Calgary Hitmen center Kindel with the 11th pick – much higher than many prognosticators expected.Pittsburgh then traded the 12th pick, which originally belonged to the New York Rangers, to Philadelphia for the 22nd and 31st picks. The Flyers wanted the 6ft 4in Nesbitt, a fast-rising center from the OHL’s Windsor Spitfires last season.The Penguins also gave a second-round pick to the Kings and swapped first-rounders so they could move up for Horcoff – the son of NHL veteran Shawn Horcoff – with the 24th pick.The Anaheim Ducks took a chance on forward Roger McQueen with the 10th selection. The 6ft 5in McQueen is widely thought to have enough talent to become an elite center, but the Saskatchewan native has been slowed by a back injury that scared off some teams.Two goalies were chosen in the first round for the first time since 2021 and only the third time in 13 years. Columbus grabbed Russia’s Pyotr Andreyanov with the 20th pick, making him the highest-picked European goalie in fourth years, while San Jose added goalie Joshua Ravensbergen with the 30th selection.The Boston Bruins used the seventh overall pick on Boston College center James Hagens, the consensus top prospect for this draft a year ago. Hagens, a Long Island native coveted by many Islanders fans, slid down the board just enough to reach the Bruins, whose pick was announced by a video of Adam Sandler in character as Happy Gilmore, complete with his signature Bruins jersey.“I’m so excited to be back in Boston, and to have Adam Sandler make the pick, that was special,” said Hagens, who cites Happy Gilmore as his favorite movie. “I love to win, and I’m really glad that I’m in Boston.”The Islanders won the lottery to pick first in a draft that is packed with talent – while missing a few staples of recent drafts.There was no prohibitive lock at No 1, unlike the past two drafts. The draft also lacked the centralized structure that has long been a staple of this annual exercise. The 32 teams’ executives are mostly at home, not strewn across the draft floor. The majority of the picks were taken to a video room just behind the stage to exchange televised pleasantries with their new front offices through video conferencing.While reviews of the new format seemed largely negative from television viewers and fans, many hockey executives praised the format afterward.Explore more on these topicsNHLNew York IslandersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, Klopp said the tournament would put more strain on an already packed calendar for the players. The expanded format features a 32-team event held every four years in the summers between major international tournaments.“It’s a pointless competition,” he said. “Whoever wins it will be the worst winner of all time because they’ll have played all summer and then gone straight back into the league. There are people who have never been involved in the day-to-day business of football and are now coming up with ideas.“Palmeiras v Botafogo: Club World Cup, last 16 – liveRead moreKlopp pointed out that today’s players are getting less and less time to rest, warning that adding another tournament was potentially dangerous for their health. “It’s too many games. I fear next season we will see injuries like never before,” he said. “If not then, they’ll come during or after the Club World Cup. There’s no real recovery for those involved, neither physically nor mentally.“Klopp, who ended his highly successful nine-year stint with Liverpool in 2024, is now head of global football for Red Bull, the owners of several clubs including RB Leipzig and New York Red Bulls. Red Bull Salzburgexited at the group stageof the Club World Cup on Thursday.Klopp was also asked if he would like to coach again. “I don’t want that any more. I have a job now that fulfils me and is also intense. I don’t sleep in the morning and I don’t go to bed later at night, but I can organise my work much better,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJürgen KloppClub World Cup 2025Club World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he boldly gambled by taking off Elliott and the captain, James McAtee, and was rewarded by the substitute Jonathan Rowe scoring with almost his first touch. It means the Young Lions have followed in the footsteps of Dave Sexton’s sides more than 40 years ago by winning successive European titles and their fourth in total. On this evidence, the future looks very bright indeed.Carsley could barely contain his emotions as he pumped his fist in delight at the final whistle while England’s players celebrated wildly, with some of their family members in the stands bursting into tears. It has been a whirlwind six months for the former Everton midfielder, who was criticised for saying during his spellas interim England managerthat he was hoping to return to the under-21s.Quick GuideEngland U21 v Germany U21: teams and scorersShowEngland (4-2-3-1)Beadle; Livramento, Quansah, Cresswell, Hinshelwood; Anderson (Egan-Riley 99), Scott (Morton 44); Elliott (Rowe 90), McAtee (Nwaneri 90), Hutchinson (Iling-Junior 98); Stansfield (Norton-Cuffy 62).Subs not usedEdwards, Fellows, Gray, Hackney, Sharman-Lowe, Simkin.GoalsElliott 5, Hutchinson 24, Rowe 92Germany (4-3-3)Atubolu; Collins, Arrey-Mbi, Oermann (Wanner 105), Brown (Ullrich 86); Nebel, Martel (Tresoldi 98), Reitz; Weiper (Röhl 80), Woltemade, Gruda (Knauff 73)Subs not usedBaum, Ernst, Jander, Noll, Rosenfelder, Siebert, Thielmann.GoalsWeiper 45+1, Nebel 61Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Yet with several players missing due to the Club World Cup and senior call-ups, Carsley has once again showed how effective he is coaching England’s next crop of promising talent after arriving in Slovakia with an inexperienced squad that was not among the favourites to triumph. With Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson excelling in midfield, it is a testament to their team spirit that heads never dropped even after conceding the equaliser.View image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott celebrates scoring an early opener for England.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersCarsley had been calmness personified before kick-off as he cracked jokes with his assistant Ashley Cole and he had the luxury of being able to name an unchanged side from the semi-final victoryagainst the Netherlands. Such was the interest in this game Tuchel had flown more than 5,000 miles from the Club World Cup in the US to be in attendance, while the Germany manager, Julian Nagelsmann, cut short his holiday in Mallorca.Both could not have failed to have been impressed with the way England started as Elliott, who was later presented with the player of the tournament award for his five goals butfaces an uncertain future with Liverpool, gave them an early lead after Nnamdi Collins made a hash of a clearance.Charlie Cresswell – who is the other remaining member of the winning squad from 2023 – was inches away from doubling the lead when McAtee fired across the face of goal. Germany were caught out again on the break soon after and, having been set up by McAtee, Hutchinson finished with aplomb and he celebrated with an acrobatic flip. The usually understated Carsley could barely contain his delight on the touchline.View image in fullscreenOmari Hutchinson delivers an acrobatic flip after scoring England’s second goal.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APWith Germany’s main threat Nick Woltemade having to drop increasingly deeper, the manager, Antonio Di Salvo, seemed to have no answer. But the loss of the limping Alex Scott, replaced by Liverpool’s Tyler Morton just before half-time, was a blow and that was compounded when Nelson Weiper pulled one back by heading home Paul Nebel’s cross in first-half injury time.McAtee was unlucky to see his effort drift just wide after a magnificent dummy left his marker for dead at the start of the second half. But Germany looked so much more threatening when they made it into the final third and the England goalkeeper James Beadle did well not to parry Nebel’s cross into the path of the waiting Woltemade, who is set to join Bayern Munich from VfB Stuttgart after this tournament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suddenly the game was on a knife edge as Norton-Cuffy could only direct his shot straight at Noah Atubolu after being set up by Hutchinson. There were hearts in mouths on the England bench when a deflected Germany effort struck the crossbar in stoppages but they made it to extra time.Carsley rolled the dice by taking off the exhausted McAtee and Elliott, and it immediately paid dividends as Rowe’s deft header from Morton’s cross restored England’s lead. “We have to dig in,” said Carsley as he gathered his players together in a huddle at the change of ends. “This is our time now.”Germany hit the bar again in injury time but Carsley and England would not be denied their place in the history books.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21sLee CarsleynewsShareReuse this content"

Mykhailo Mudryk is also unavailable after beingcharged by the Football Associationwith doping offences.Chelsea identified Gittens as a key target in January and have been negotiating with Dortmund over the 20-year-old this summer. A fee has been agreed and the England Under-21 international, who also had interest from Bayern Munich, has already said yes to a seven-year contract.Gittens, who is due to undergo a medical, will be unable to feature for Chelsea at the Club World Cup as he has already played for Dortmund in the United States.Chelsea are also looking to sign a versatile forward and have muscled in on Newcastle’s attempt to sign the Brighton forward João Pedro. The Brazil international is a key target for Newcastle, who have already had a £50m bid for him rejected.However, Chelsea are also interested in the former Watford attacker and believe they can convince him to join them after opening talks with Brighton over a deal. Sam Jewell, who brought João Pedro to Brighton and has since joined Chelsea’s recruitment team, has been influential in the push for him.Brighton are holding out for £60m for João Pedro, who has scored 30 goals in 70 appearances for the club. There is hope from Chelsea and Newcastle that a lower fee can be agreed. Chelsea have had an initial approach knocked back but negotiations are ongoing and there is a feeling that the 23-year-old will favour a move to Stamford Bridge over Newcastle.João Pedro’s appeal to Chelsea is partly down to his versatility and Premier League experience. Chelsea want an attacker to provide variety and depth in creative positions. They have also considered West Ham’s Mohammed Kudus. It is expected that space will be found for João Pedro in Maresca’s squad by selling João Félix and Christopher Nkunku.Elsewhere,Sunderlandare set to beat Leeds and a host of European clubs to the signing of Habib Diarra from Strasbourg for a club-record £30m as they prepare to return to the Premier League.View image in fullscreenSunderland target Habib Diarra scores for Senegal against England.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThe Senegal midfielder, who scored in the3-1 defeat of Englandat the City Ground this month, is expected on Wearside to complete his medical after Sunderland had an offer worth an initial €31.5m (£27m) plus €4m in add-ons accepted.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreLeeds had also been hoping to sign Diarra and saw a £24m bid rejected last week, while Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt were among the 21-year-old’s other suitors.But with Sunderland having identified Diarra as their preferred option to replace Jobe Bellingham, who joined Borussia Dortmund foran initial £27.8m, their improved bid was enough to convince Strasbourg to accept their offer.It represents something of a coup for the Championship playoff winners as they prepare to return to the Premier League after an eight-year absence, having already signed Enzo Le Fée from Roma after he spent the second half of last season on loan in the north-east. Their Wembley hero Tom Watson has already departed to Brighton for £10m, while they have also explored re-signing Jordan Henderson from Ajax.The fee for Diarra, who represented France at under-21 level before making his senior debut Senegal last year, surpasses the £20m they paid for Le Fée. Sunderland are also thought to be interested in the Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka, who had stints at Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as Sassuolo’s French winger Armand Laurienté.Paul Pogba has joined Monaco on a free transfer after signing a two-year contract, the Ligue 1 club said on Saturday, as the 32-year-old French midfielder looks to revive his careerfollowing a doping ban.Explore more on these topicsChelseaTransfer windowSunderlandBorussia DortmundBrighton & Hove AlbionnewsShareReuse this content"

If that is largely down to the 38-year-old’s humility and intelligence, it also reflects her journey’s origins.Fishlock remembers the days when female footballers were unrecognised in public and virtually invisible to the game’s male establishment. It explains why being part of the first Wales Women side to qualify for a major tournament matters so much to a player belying advancing years in the manner of the stylistically not entirely dissimilar Luka Modric.“It’s always nice to be able to do something that’s so much bigger than yourself,” she says in a distinctive hybrid Welsh-US Pacific coast accent, redolent of the ties that have bound her to Seattle Reign for the past 13 years. “Qualifying for these Eurosenables us to cement the legacy we’ve created for future generations. I hope we’ll be able to look back on Switzerland 2025 as something special that changed our nation.”View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock chips the ball over Maria Korenciova of Slovakia to score during the playoffs.Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty ImagesTo appreciate why this milestone transcends sport, a potted history of a slow-burn cultural revolution is required. After all, it was not until 2019 that Wales Women wore shirts bearing their names, rather than just numbers, on the back. Rewind a little further and the country’s non-appearance in the 2005 Euros in England was not about inadequate results. The Football Association of Wales had declined to fund the female squad through the qualifying campaign.Fishlock made her senior debut in 2006. Coincidentally, an odyssey that would lead to her becoming Wales’s record cap holder (162 at the last count) and all-time leading scorer (47 goals) began with a 3-2 defeat in Switzerland at a tiny ground in suburban Zurich. Back then she combined playing for Cardiff with working for a telecoms company but, when her talent was subsequently spotted by the then Dutch champions, AZ Alkmaar, everything changed.At AZ she was sometimes coached by the men’s manager, Louis van Gaal. Fishlock credits him with teaching her the importance of controlling a game’s tempo and helping inspire an eclectic career in which she has won two Champions Leagues, at Frankfurt and Lyon, and collected almost every available domestic honour with Melbourne Victory and Seattle Reign.“I pick the right moments to say: ‘We’re going forward,’ or: ‘We’re going to slow it down,’” she says, in a luxury resort hotel set amid the Vale of Glamorgan’s lush undulating countryside. “My position makes those tempo-setting decisions kind of important. But it’s about the team as a collective being on the same page and recognising those moments.”Fishlock is a big believer in “living in the moment and enjoying it” but her impending presence in Lucerne and St Gallen for Euro 25 group-stage games against the Netherlands, France and England represents the fulfilment of a long cherished ambition. As her American wife, her former Reign teammate Tziarra King, says: “Jess has worked her whole life for this; Euro 2025 means everything to her.”There were moments when the dream seemed near impossible but, after she overcame a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in 2019 and the anguish of losinga World Cup qualification playoff against Switzerlandin the final seconds of extra time in 2022, a watershed arrived 15 months ago. It is no exaggeration to say the appointment of the half-Welsh former Canada defender Rhian Wilkinson as head coach has altered an entire national narrative.View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock celebrates after Wales’s playoff victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin last year.Photograph: Shauna Clinton/Sportsfile/Getty Images“Rhian’s transformed us,” says Fishlock of a coach who won the US’s National Women’s Soccer League in her previous job with Portland Thorns. “I think in the past we haven’t really had a manager that’s believed in us this much but Rhian’s unwavering. She’s raised the bar. From minute one, she introduced a set of non-negotiable standards, wielded the hammer and established whole new expectations. It’s brought the best out in us all. It’s always been an honour and a privilege to represent this country but she’s put us in a spot where we’re now able to compete against top teams.”Fishlock believes that, for too long, Wales were conditioned to accept their supposed limitations. “In the past we would just agree, I guess, that maybe we couldn’t do this or we couldn’t do that but Rhian just doesn’t accept that,” she says. “I think she really, truly, does believe in us. She communicates very clearly and she’s instilled so much confidence. We knew we were good enough but we maybe just had a block. Now you can see us improving. We’ve raised our game; it’s just so exciting.“We’ve had to meet Rhian’s standards; before we, perhaps, never had that challenge. I’m very proud that we’ve risen to it together. It hasn’t always been easy, we’ve had downs, but all of us have been pleasantly surprised by what we’ve been able to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve broken through several ceilings – now we have to burst a big one.”It helps that Wilkinson tailors differing formations and starting XIs to specific opponents. “Our flexibility could surprise people this summer,” says Fishlock. “A lot of our squad can play different positions and read the game very well. That’s crucial; I think it will be key to our success.”Like her former Reign teammate Megan Rapinoe, she has long campaigned for human rights and social justice and was awarded an MBE for services to women’s football and the LGBT community in 2018.View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock feels Wales have raised their game under Rhian Wilkinson.Photograph: AFF/AlamyFor the moment, though, the arguments she invariably calibrates as expertly as her measured through balls are on hold. “It’s really important not to be ignorant of what’s going on in the world,” says Fishlock. “But right now it’s also very important to remember we’re here to concentrate on doing our jobs in Switzerland.Additional focus is provided by the men’s team’s manager, Craig Bellamy. “Craig and I have had a number of good conversations,” she says. “He’s a big supporter of our team and he cares so much about our country. Welsh people are very passionate; we’re very different from the English, we’re not frightened to come forward and say how we feel and what we think. It’s about how small but proud we are as a nation.”The precedent set by the men’s team in reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2016 serves as a lodestar. “Our squad takes huge inspiration from that, and from every Welsh sporting achievement,” Fishlock says. “But now it’s up to us. We’ve got to get to Switzerland, get out of the group and write our own story.”Explore more on these topicsWales women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

However, they have had a tumultuous buildup to the tournament, where they will aim to defend their title from 2022. The retirement ofthe goalkeeper Mary Earpsandmidfielder Fran Kirby, followed bythe withdrawal of centre-back Millie Bright, for very different reasons, put them at the centre of a storm of intrigue one month out.Where does that leave the team? Despite those absences England’s squad is packed with potential. The return of Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway following knee surgeries this year is a huge boost, despite their limited match action this season. Bright’s absence means there is pressure on Greenwood to be at her best alongside Leah Williamson in central defence.Look down the squad list and the midfield looks somewhat light, with only five players named, including Stanway, who only played 60 minutes of football in 2024-25. “We have to announce it as strikers, midfielders and defenders, but you can move players around into different positions,” said the head coach, Sarina Wiegman. “So it looks like there’s not much depth on paper, but in the team we have enough depth in midfield.”Williamson can play in midfield, as can Maya Le Tissier, or Lauren James, and the former head coach Phil Neville experimented with Lucy Bronze more centrally. However, any of these players being forced to shift positions would be a big departure from a desired starting XI and a test of their adaptability.Can England defend their title? They have a shot. However, having been drawn in the trickiest of groups, with matches against France, then the Netherlands and finally Wales, they will not be afforded time to grow into the tournament. Progressing to the knockout stages having beaten some big names, on the other hand, would benefit the group’s momentum.EnglandThe coachSarina Wiegmanhas a remarkable record in major tournaments, having reached four finals in a row,winning the Euros in 2017 with the Netherlandsandfive years later with England, while getting to two World Cup finals. She heads to Switzerland with a third successive European title in her sights but also perhaps under more pressure than ever. The retirements of Earps and Kirby and subsequent withdrawal of Bright left many asking if all remains sunny in the England camp. Having previously been applauded for her straight-talking style and the clarity it provides for players, her ruthlessness is now raising some concerns. However, if that approach leads England to victory again, the narrative will shift back into it being a positive.Star playerLeah Williamsonoozes star quality and following the withdrawal of Bright, and Greenwood only recently returning from injury, there is more pressure on the Champions League winner to deliver from the back. The 28-year-old is as vital to England’s forward play as she is to their defensive structure and solidity, her incisive passes from deep and driving runs critical to the way England play.Having missed out on the 2023 World Cup following an ACL rupture, the journey back to full fitness and peak performance hasn’t been the smoothest. However,Arsenal’s Champions League triumphshowed the centre-back is back to her best and in the final there was no beating her. “No one ever knows what’s going on behind the scenes,” she said afterwards. “I was only fully fit from illness or injury in November last year. I keep my head down, keep trying my best and keep working.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The treble-winner has 15 caps for England and will start in goal for the holders as well as helping guide the uncapped Khiara Keating and Anna Moorehouse through it. Hampton was winning the battle to be England’s No 1 anyway, with the 24-year-old’s distribution a highlight, but Earp’s presence on the global stage was considerable. Hampton has shown she can perform when it matters, having been preferred to Earps several times, including againstSpain in the Arnold Clark Cupand Nations League. Euro 2025 will pose a greater challenge.Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top flightThe Women’s Super League enters its next phase after one season under WSL Football, the body which took over the running of the top two tiers from the FA in August 2024. Rebranded and with new minimum standards to be introduced, including the Championship (now WSL2) aligning with the top flight in becoming a fully professional league, expectations of next season are high. Arecord five-year broadcast rights dealwas signed with the BBC and Sky Sports in 2024 and is worth £65m plus production costs. Meanwhile growing attendances,spearheaded by Arsenal, and increasing club investments at the top end, such as Alexis Ohanian’s £20m in Chelsea, have put playing in England on the wishlist of many top international players.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandThe sky’s the limit. However, England are in a difficult group. Escaping that will be a feat in itself but, while anything other than winning the tournament will feel disappointing, a semi-final exit would not be a disaster. Things cannot progress upwards in a straight line for ever.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballEngland women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Joel Marklund/BILDBYRÅN/ShutterstockFilippa Angeldahl, Stina Blackstenius and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd are among the world-class talents who will spearhead Sweden’s campaignByElla LindvallSat 28 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 08.31 EDTShareThis article is part of theGuardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewSweden’s journey to the Euros was both complicated and straightforward. The complicated bit came first and involved being drawn in the same group as England and France: Sweden ultimately finished third despite drawing twice with the European champions. That led to the simple bit: a playoff where Serbia were taken apart 8-0 on aggregate.After that came a mixed Nations League campaign. Denmark were beaten home and away, Sweden scoring eight goals over two matches. Wales proved a harder nut to crack, with Rhian Wilkinson’s team coming away with two 1-1 draws.Given that every match was competitive the head coach, Peter Gerhardsson, could not afford to rotate his squad much. For example, going into the game against Norway on 26 June, there was only one goalkeeper available with international experience: Jennifer Falk. The two back-ups, Tove Enblom and Emma Holmgren, are yet to play at senior level.Gerhardsson, however, was unconcerned. “I don’t know if it really matters,” he said. “If one of them had played and conceded a lot of goals, that selection might have backfired – and then you’d have to take that result with you into the Euros.”In general Sweden have been fortunate with injuries but during the final camp Arsenal’s Rosa Kafaji withdrew with a foot injury and in the big win against Denmark in early June, the Barcelona star Fridolina Rolfö also suffered a foot injury. On 9 June Barça said the player had suffered ligament damage but Sweden’s medical team are confident she will be fit for the opening fixture against Denmark on 4 July.The key midfielder is Real Madrid’s Filippa Angeldahl, Gerhardsson’s trusted general on the pitch, and she contributes with her fair share of goals. Nathalie Björn and Magdalena Eriksson are reliable choices at centre-back, while on the right, Hanna Lundkvist has become first-choice but she is now facing competition from the youngster Smilla Holmberg.Up front, the attacking trio of Rolfö, Stina Blackstenius and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd will once again lead the line, having proved their consistency for some time now.The coachThis is a special tournament for the head coach,Peter Gerhardsson, his last in charge. He will be replaced by the former Australia head coach, Tony Gustavsson, after Euro 2025.Originally from Uppsala and a former top-flight player for Hammarby, Gerhardsson has been in charge since 2017. In nearly eight years he has led Sweden to two World Cup bronze medals, an Olympic silver and a European Championship semi-final. He also walked into a broom cupboard after a press conference at the 2023 World Cup, to everyone’s amusement, a moment immortalised bythe Guardian cartoonist David Squires. Gerhardsson was delighted: “For me, who liked cartoons when I grew up, that was big. It can’t be easy to feature in a Guardian cartoon. I managed that without even trying! I felt: ‘Damn, that’s fun.’ The fact that they were poking fun at me I don’t care about. I am who I am. I try to be honest to myself so here I am, that has pros and cons. You have to take that.”Star playerJohanna Rytting Kaneryd. Sweden have several high-profile players, such as Stina Blackstenius and Fridolina Rolfö, but Chelsea’s Rytting Kaneryd was trusted by her club coach Sonia Bompastor during the 2024-25 season and was named Sweden’s footballer of the year for 2024-25. She played a key role in Chelsea’s domestic treble and was one of Sweden’s most important players in both the Euro qualifiers and the Nations League. She is best known for her speed and fearless one-on-one play down the flank. As Magdalena Eriksson said: “As a former left-back I can just say that she’s a full-back’s worst nightmare.”One to watchThe 18-year-old full-backSmilla Holmbergis one of the most exciting and intriguing players in the squad. Holmberg and another youngster, her Hammarby teammate Ellen Wangerheim, both have huge potential. But while Wangerheim has been linked with several big clubs abroad it has been relatively quiet for Holmberg. That might be about to change. She made an impressive debut against Italy in the Nations League and if she continues on the same path most clubs will want her. A fearless full-back who is not afraid to attack, she is also remarkably composed in defence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It produces talented players who frequently move on to top international leagues. However in recent years the Swedish league has lost some status globally – a challenge currently being addressed in Sweden to keep pace with the rapidly growing major leagues. The league is officially classed as professional but some aspects are more semi-professional. Many players have other jobs alongside their playing careers. There is a lot of talent coming through, including Häcken’s Felicia Schröder, as well as the Hammarby duo Wangerheim and Holmberg.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandSweden are traditionally a strong tournament team. They should advance from the group, though Germany will be a tough opponent. A potential quarter-final against England or France would be a major obstacle and it’s reasonable to think that the journey will end there.The Sweden team guide was written by Ella Lindvall forFotbollskanalen.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's Euro 2025Sweden women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I hope she will be involved and that she will get better soon.”Aitana BonmatíThe England defender Jess Carter echoed Wiegman’s sentiments, adding: “Obviously it’s really sad hearing of anyone becoming unwell, and we all just want her to get better soon and [we] wish her all the best. And then hopefully after recovering, she gets to the tournament and continues to put on the performances that she does.”Speaking to the media after Spain’s 3-1 defeat of Japan in a pre-tournament friendly, Montse Tomé, their coach, said “we can’t talk about deadlines” for the influential Barcelona midfielder’s return, after Bonmatí posted a photograph of her watching the match from a hospital bed with a cannula in her arm on Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to reports in Spain, the fever failed to subside and so more extensive tests were carried out which confirmed she has viral meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Viral meningitis is caused by an infection and is the more common version of the disease, as opposed to bacterial meningitis. According to the NHS, viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within seven to 10 days.Spain begin their Euro 2025 campaign in six days’ time, when they play Portugal on 3 July. They then play Belgium on 7 July and Italy on 11 July.Bonmatí wasnamed the winner of the Ballon d’Orfor a second consecutive time in October, receiving almost double the votes of her closest rival for the award, Caroline Graham Hansen. The midfielder was critical to Spain’s Women’s World Cup triumph in 2023 and secured a sixth league title and fifth Supacopa de España this season, but was denied a fourth Champions League title by Arsenal’s 1-0 defeat of Barcelona in last month’s final.“Aitana, for us, is a very important player, we will wait for her as long as we can,” said Tomé. “The information I have told you is what I have and I am not going to explain more, if I said something more I would be wrong.”Explore more on these topicsSpain women's football teamAitana BonmatíWomen's footballWomen's Euro 2025newsShareReuse this content"

The club, who have appealed against that penalty, will be in danger of having no players if they fail to pay June’s wages on Monday’s due date.Under Fifa regulations players would be entitled to give notice of their intent to terminate their contracts. The regulations state: “In the case of a club unlawfully failing to pay a player at least two monthly salaries on their due dates, the player will be deemed to have a just cause to terminate his contract, provided that he has put the debtor club in default in writing and has granted a deadline of at least 15 days for the debtor club to fully comply with its financial obligation(s). Alternative provisions in contracts existing at the time of this provision coming into force may be considered.”Wednesday are understood to have belatedly paid some players last month’s wages – payments for March were also late – but not all of Danny Röhl’s squad have received their salaries. A club source said May’s salary payments had been targeted, with Chansiri making sure the younger players and those under contract were paid in order to protect their resale value, whereas older squad members approaching the end of their contracts were not.The captain, Barry Bannan, the striker Callum Paterson and the defender Akin Famewo are out of contract next week after rejecting new deals offered last month, and it is unclear whether they have been paid. After contemplating a no-show Bannan is understood to have reported for duty as instructed on the first day of pre-season training on Thursday, but Paterson and Famewo did not turn up.View image in fullscreenBarry Bannan, Sheffield Wednesday’s captain, turned up for pre-season training despite being out of contract next week.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PAAll of Röhl’s coaching staff are also out of contract next week and the manager, despite having two years on a contract that includes a seven-figure release clause, is expected to depart sooner rather than later. The Germanwas interviewed by Southamptonbefore they appointed Will Still last month, and is admired by Leicester, who have parted company with Ruud van Nistelrooy. Röhl may choose to leave Hillsborough even without a job to go to.Wednesday do not have pre-season fixtures arranged beyond an under-21s game against Frickley Athletic, and planned renovations to their training ground, including the installation of two new pitches, have not been completed. Hillsborough is in need of a major overhaul, with the infrastructure of the 126-year-old ground so poor that the boiler was unable to generate sufficient hot water for the players to shower in comfort at various points last season.Chansiri is believed to have acknowledged the gravity of the situation, and is willing to engage in serious talks regarding a sale. For years his family have funded multimillion-pound losses at Wednesday from the profits of their seafood business, Thai Union Group – total losses over his 10-year stewardship are more than £150m – but no longer appear willing to subsidise the club. TUG remains the world’s biggest suppliers of canned tuna but its stock value has halved over the past decade, with the value of Chansiri’s stake dropping from £18m to £9m. The family’s overall stake is worth about 20 times that amount.View image in fullscreenSheffield Wednesday’s 126-year-old ground has seen much better days.Photograph: Malcolm Bryce/ProSports/ShutterstockWednesday are attracting potential buyers, with two US consortiums understood to be particularly interested, but none have got anywhere near what they regard as Chansiri’s outlandish valuation. Towards the end of last year the 57-year-old was telling brokers that Wednesday were worth twice as much as Sheffield United, who were being bought for £111m, and although his asking price has dropped it remains far too high for the would-be buyers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The stadium is owned by a company called Sheffield 3 Limited, which is controlled by Chansiri.Wednesday’s attempt to include the £60m stadium sale in their 2017-18 accounts for the purpose of profitability and sustainability regulations, even though it did not take place until the following season, led to their being docked six points by the EFL (reduced from 12 on appeal).View image in fullscreenDejphon Chansiri’s rare public statement will have done little to reassure supporters.Photograph: Paul Thompson/ProSports/ShutterstockChansiri is conducting sale negotiations, often from Bangkok. Wednesday are woefully understaffed at management level, with no chief executive or sporting director, leaving the club secretary, Lindsey Hinton, to put out the fires locally.Chansiri issued a rare public statement on Thursday, saying a potential sale with an American group had collapsed after the buyer failed to pay a £5m deposit, but it will have done little to reassure supporters.“I take full responsibility for being unable to fulfil my current obligations,” Chansiri said. “But a further obligation I have is to ensure that if the club is sold, it is sold to the right people with the right credentials, who can sustain Sheffield Wednesday and take the club forward.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayChampionshipFinancesFootball LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thanks to increased investment in the women’s game, there are now more than 3,000 full-time female players across the continent, and that professionalisation is why my overriding feeling about this summer’s Euros is that the quality is going to be so much higher than we have seen before. And it will be so tight.In Spain, England and Germany there are three strong favourites who are all capable of going on to win it and I would add the Netherlands to the top four. I was so impressed when we [the United States]played the Dutchin December. They will need everybody fit but, on their day, they are a top side. Beyond that, this tournament is going to show the prowess of the Nations League, which was introduced since the most recent Euros, and the impact that tournament is having on equality.We have seen the increased strength in depth of competitive teams in the Nations League, whether it be a resurgent Belgium who have got some real qualities in their side, or Italy who I think are on the rise – and it’s about time – and of course you can never rule out the French. If they manage to get things together they might win a tournament. At the moment you have to talk about France in that next bracket outside the favourites. Can they reach the levels their club teams do? I don’t know, but you cannot overlook them.View image in fullscreenSpain's Esther Gonzalez celebrates after scoring against Portugal in April.Photograph: Miguel Vidal/ReutersTo win this tournament it will take a team, first and foremost, and as a coach you have to work hard to keep everyone connected and feeling valued. I’ve learned that from failures in my career, not just the success of winning a gold medal. You want to make sure that, when you stand at the podium, the player who played no minutes feels a part of it. Do not underestimate the importance of that – the team that gets that right has a great shout of going all the way and winning the final in Basel.A lot of the buildup to this tournament has been dominated by news of the players who are not going to Switzerland, whether that beFrance leaving out Wendie Renardor Fran Kirbybringing forward her retirementfrom international duty after Sarina Wiegman spoke to her honestly about her chances of playing. All 16 head coaches have had to disappoint players. As a coach, these types of conversations are really hard, when you tell someone they are not selected. You can still be kind, but there is no easy way to do it, because you’re giving someone the news they don’t want to hear.In my experience, when you deliver that news, players just want honesty, so being straight-up and direct is the best approach. You have to be able to say: “Look, I’m just giving you a call to let you know that you didn’t make the squad,” and usually I give a rationale behind that, and then you ask if there are any questions. And if there aren’t then it’s best to end the call there and then, because they don’t want to be on the call with you, they want to process it.It’s a little bit like parenting, in many regards; if your child comes home disappointed about something, it’s best not to say, “Oh, but you’re good at maths,” if they are not. Instead I say: “Oh that’s tricky, how does that feel for you?” and you process it because the reality is we all spend our life facing lots of setbacks. So I may have changed some of my style over the years but I always believe in delivering news in a humane way. At the end of delivering news to maybe 15 or 20 players that aren’t picked, you are exhausted, as well as disappointed for them all, but it is part of the job.View image in fullscreenJule Brand is part of a Germany team full of young talents.Photograph: Marco Steinbrenner/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockWe were only allowed to pick 18-player squads for last summer’s Olympics, but that was not the only difference my staff and players faced in France; you played a match every three days. In the World Cup or Euros you are usually playing every four-to-five days and that extra day makes a huge difference in players’ recovery. For the teams in Group D this July – France, England, the Netherlands and Wales – to win the tournament, for example, they would have to play six times in 23 days, and trust me, when players are recovering, every second counts.After an evening game, think about it, these players aren’t going to sleep until 3am, so the day after a game is an absolute wipe-out. For some players it’s a combination of massage, ice-baths and mobility, and with the USA we get cryotherapy chambers and oxygen tanks. For some people it’s just about going for a walk, getting fresh air and sleep, it’s very individualised, but assume matchday+1 is just a write-off. Matchday+2 is usually when the most explosive players feel their body the most, so for a winger, a forward, those Ferrari players who burn the most petrol, phwoar, matchday+2 is tough for their bodies. Now if you add the extra day in-between, you can start your engines again in training and you’re in a much better position.Going back to the teams who might win it I have to say that, at the Olympics, I was very impressed with Germany and their young cohort that have come through. They have now been through their cyclical change and I think this is another German group that is on the rise. They have got players such as Jule Brand, Lea Schüller and Klara Bühl who can cause endless problems. The main question is if they have enough depth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The loss of Millie Bright, to any dressing room, is huge – she’s a leader who will calm a group and also keep them focused. It’s the same with Mary Earps in different capacities. Now it will be interesting to see how England cope if there are any injuries or suspensions – there’s a lack of experience on their bench, which sometimes happens when you’re evolving a team and it’s England’s time to experience that. Not with the starting XI though. In their starters they possess a depth of experience. They will need Lauren Hemp, Alessia Russo and Lauren James to be fit, of course, but it is a high-quality, experienced England team.Spain have a rising star in Clàudia Pina and, in Alexia Putellas, they’ve got a player who is back to her top, top level. Ask any player that plays against Spain and they will say it works your brain so hard. But they can be beaten. Yes, there are differences between Barcelona and Spain, but playing-style wise and methodology-wise there are a lot of similarities – you have to be so deadly in your transitions because you won’t dominate the ball, and you have to accept that and disrupt it in organised ways, which I thought Arsenal did superbly in the Champions League final. Reneé Slegers did an incredible job of setting the team up for that. It showed how it can be done.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Euro 2025England women's football teamSpain women's football teamGermany women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

The senior team’s head coach, Thomas Tuchel, who had flown especially from the United States to watch the final, addressed England’s victorious players in the changing room.Carsley, who this month signed a contract extension that will take him through to the next tournament in Albania and Serbia in 2027, said he is already turning his attention to whether England can repeat their success, after emulating the victories of Dave Sexton’s sides in 1982 and 1984.“It was a great target to go for and the most important thing is that the young 21s keep winning, keep producing players for the senior team,” said Carsley. “We spoke a lot about the position where potentially we’ll go for three, so I’m definitely looking forward to that. It’s a great target to go for. I don’t think it’s been done yet, so it may be looking at the squad as well. We’ve got a strong squad, but I think we have to give the squad so much credit, and I’m so proud of the players, the way they’ve conducted themselves for the 29 days that we’ve been together.”The captain, James McAtee, revealed that Tuchel and his assistant Anthony Barry had been “giddy” after the victory and believes the victorious players had boosted their chances of being promoted to the senior squad in future.“He came in and gave everyone a big hug,” said the Manchester City forward. “It’s good to see him and hopefully he was impressed with us.”Only Elliott – who was named as player of the tournament – and Charlie Cresswell remain from England’s triumph in Georgia two years ago and Carsley paid tribute to the winning mentality this inexperienced squad have shown after losing to Germany during the group stages.“We spoke about the difference between having hope and having belief, and this group definitely thought they could, they believed they could win this tournament, which is a big thing, especially when things aren’t going your way,” he said. “We started off very clunky at the tournament, we stayed in there, they stuck together, they got better as the tournament went on, and they’ve got what they deserve.View image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott (right) celebrates with Tyler Morton (left) and James McAtee after winning the player of the tournament trophy.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/Reuters“But over the four years, we’ve beaten almost everyone in terms of France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Germany, so we should take heed from that. I said it’s a massive positive, the fact that we can not only compete at this level, but we can win consistently, or in a good style.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In two tournament cycles he has won it twice. On top of this exceptional tournament success, he has overseen player development with many under-21s making their debut for the senior team.“We are delighted Lee has extended his contract with us.

Several clubs in England and Europe are tracking the 19-year-old defender but it is understood that there is no plan for him to leave Stamford Bridge at the moment.Sources close to Acheampong have privately said that suggestions that the youngster is frustrated at Chelsea are incorrect. Acheampong, who started at right-back inChelsea’s win over Esperance in the Club World Cuplast Tuesday, signed a new five-year contract last year and enjoyed a breakthrough campaign under Maresca last season.The academy product will only go on loan if he agrees with the club that it is best for his development but the long-term plan remains for him to thrive at Chelsea.Fernández finally flourishing with Chelsea as Benfica reunion awaitsRead more“The clubs that you mentioned, they like Josh, but we also like Josh,” Maresca said. “Any club likes good players. My plan with Josh is quite clear. I said many times that I really like Josh.“I think he potentially can be a top defender for this club. It’s on him to have the right timing to do the things. We are full of young players here, full of talented players, even defenders. So I think the best plan for Josh is to be with us and I’m very happy if he’s going to be with us.”Chelsea face Benfica in the last 16 in Charlotte on Saturday afternoon. It will be thefirst time that Enzo Fernandez faces Benfica since leaving themfor £106.7m two years ago. Fernandez has the most goal involvements (14) of any Chelsea player in 2025.“I am very pleased with Enzo,” Maresca said. “Firstly because he’s a nice boy, he’s polite. And then because with us, since we started, he’s working very well in all the aspects, inside the pitch, outside the pitch.“We said already many times that with us this season’s struggle will be at the beginning to understand the way we want to play.

All in a day’s work on the internet. Offline, though, they have found themselves less equipped for the consequences of affluence. A string of kidnappings has plagued the industry over the past year and left traders across the globe paranoid, fearful and keen to invest in physical security measures.Arsalan grew up working class in Karachi, Pakistan. He hustles in any setting. At 14, he started a business exporting T-shirts overseas. By 17, the pandemic swept it all away. Inside, online and penniless, the booming world of Bitcoin beckoned him.To learn how to trade digital coins, he would record himself explaining how the markets worked. His phone didn’t have enough storage to keep the videos, so he’d upload them onto Facebook groups. To his surprise, people were watching.Israel-linked group hacks Iranian cryptocurrency exchange in $90m heistRead moreArsalan says he went from $24 to $340,000 in five years. Along the way, the 23-year-old amassed more than 160,000 followers across various social media channels.“Crypto is my bloodline,” he says. “It’s the only business that accepted me when I was poor.”But a knock at the door on Christmas Day, 2024, would reveal the price of his audience. A group of men bundled him into the back of a flashing police car. They darted through checkpoints with ease, driving further away from Karachi and into the night. After an hour, they stopped. With a gun to his temple, Arsalan was ordered to take out his phone, reset its passwords, and hand it over. Holding the keys to his kingdom, the car sped away.Once home, Arsalan ran to the computer and opened his Binance wallet. It was empty. As he stared at the zeroes on the screen, five years of sacrifice washed over him. 16-hour days alone in his office. Parties unattended. Purchases never made. Life as Pakistan’s cryptocurrency posterboy was over.“I made this money from very, very hard work,” he says. “After this case, I will not trust anyone.”Increase in kidnappingsArsalan’s abduction is not an isolated event; kidnappings of cryptocurrency industry figures have surged in the past 18 months. There have been at least 231 physical attacks against digital asset holders to date, according tonews reports. Almost a third of these have taken place since the start of 2024.This year, a single French gang cut off the finger of an entrepreneur, doused an influencer’s father in gasoline and tried to snatch a CEO’s daughter from the streets of Paris, according to French police. An Italian investor was tortured with a chainsaw and taser for weeks in a New York City townhouse, local police said. A British trader was allegedly held captive in a Spanish hotel room. A popular influencer in Houston, Texas, was held at gunpoint and pistol-whipped in her own home while her three assailants demanded millions in cryptocurrency, according tolocal news reports. The list goes on.As the industry matures, so does the cybersecurity guarding exchanges and wallets. The value stored within these digital vaults is soaring. The result: hacks are becoming heists. Cryptocurrency has long suffered from sophisticated and devastating digital attacks. Now, however, thefts are manifesting in the offline world, too. For the industry’s high-rollers, the targets on their backs have never felt heavier.View image in fullscreenPolice officers stand alert on a street in Mereau, near Vierzon, central France, as they secure the area following the kidnapping of David Balland, co-founder of crypto company Ledger.Photograph: Tom Masson/AFP/Getty Images“Everybody’s a bit on edge,” says Louis d’Origny, the founder of FTXCreditor, a platform that buys bankruptcy claims. “In five minutes, you can find someone’s address. You can see our wallets online. You can see millions of dollars a day transacting out of these wallets. You’d be very tempted to show up at a house with a machete.”Recent attacks have even led his co-founder to move house, after realizing his home address was available online.Navigating an increasingly dangerous offline world, the industry is on edge, feeling as though securing their empires now falls to them as law enforcement struggles to keep up.Cost of blockchain fortunesBuilding one’s fortunes on blockchains entails novel risks.Firstly, blockchains, the technology on which cryptocurrency is based, create public ledgers, so balances and transactions are visible. Every online wallet corresponds with an address in the form of a randomly generated series of characters. To avoid hacking, bigger sums are typically stored offline, on a small piece of hardware called a “cold wallet”, which also corresponds to a public address. Assailants invade homes to steal devices or force hostages to unlock their online wallet at gunpoint.Criminals have started to find who owns which wallet, by using illicit software to analyze blockchain data. Other times, they will hack exchanges to access personal data, as was the case last month, when Coinbase support agents in India were bribed to leak the data of 70,000 users.“A lot of these [crypto] guys thought they were moving around in silence. But, people are now able to find out that they are actually some of the richest guys in their cities,” says says a US-based founder and trader, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Secondly, transactions are instant and permission-less – kidnappers don’t need a bank to approve their withdrawal. This can also make looted funds easier to hide. Assets are swiftly sent to various decentralized exchanges, which do not require know-your-customer information. Once there, funds can’t be frozen by centralized entities like Binance or Coinbase.Everybody’s a bit on edge. You can see our wallets online. You can see millions of dollars a day transacting out of these walletsLouis d’OrignyNew bodyguards and new gunsIn Karachi, Arsalan’s kidnappers were found within 48 hours. The two policemen among them had been bribed to help orchestrate the plan. Following the attack, Arsalan was offered protection from three other officers and a police car. But, fearing this could actually endanger him further, he declined.For many of crypto’s kings and queens, unfettered access to one’s money via blockchains can feel buffered from institutional corruption. “There is no justice in Pakistan if you’re poor,” says Arsalan. “But decentralization means there are no institutions, no people, no banks … I own this money.”But self-custody comes with a downside: there are fewer middlemen deterring a thief. This means taking matters into their own hands – or a pair they’ve hired.“I used to like my space away from my [bodyguards], but now I want them closer,” says the anonymous US-based founder and trader, who doesn’t reveal his security arrangements to anyone, even his close circle. “In crypto, no one trusts anybody. Half of these guys are scammers,” he says. Over the past month or so, his two guards have not left his sight – even for walks around the block. “Everyone’s being a lot more cautious.”Over the past six months, Jethro Pijlman’s global security services firm, Infinite Risks International, has seen a rise in cryptocurrency investors from western cities wanting protection. Requests range from safeguarding team meetings to guarding entire families around the clock.Paris leads when it comes to new requests, says Pijlman, as France emerges as a hotspot for attacks, particularly after the high-profile kidnapping in January of David Balland, the entrepreneur whose finger was severed. In mid-June, an investor was abducted from a Paris suburb, while his partner was ordered to deposit the key to his cryptocurrency account.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will feature the “most comprehensive security effort in the event’s history”, conference organizers said in a statement. For the first time, local police, special forces and the coast guard are being deployed to the site. Prepping security began almost a year ago, taking three times longer than usual, according to Bettina Boon Falleur, head of EthCC.Companies are also taking measures to protect their staff.Kraken, the second-largest exchange in the US, has deployed armed guards to accompany its top executives at all times, including outside their homes, according to a source familiar with the matter.Matthew Liu, co-founder of the cryptocurrency Origin Protocol, was among the attendees of Donald Trump’s private gala for the top owners of his token last month, a guest list which was leaked to theNew York Times. Liu says his company is evaluating hiring a team of bodyguards for trips.“It’s a cost, but the cost of getting kidnapped or dealing with violence? It’s very, very scary,” says Liu. He’s also begun learning how to shoot a firearm and using a multi-signature wallet, whereby multiple people across the world need to sign-off on a payment.His company has also introduced a new rule when the team goes to conferences: no posting until after the event.Many crypto investors are increasingly conscious of their exposure, after publicly sharing ... details of their success ... onlineJethro Pijlman“Many crypto investors are increasingly conscious of their exposure, especially after publicly sharing – or oversharing – details of their success and affluent lifestyles online,” says Pijlman in regards to his clients. Indeed, for an industry that’s chronically online, its titans have often built large social media followings, while their wealth stays encrypted in anonymous blockchains. “This illusion of invisibility may have led to a false sense of security.”Wiped out life savingsFor Arsalan, he watched his savings be chopped up and sprinkled across the cryptographic abyss. Over the next four months, he fell into a deep depression. He went offline and relied on whatever handouts his father could afford to give him. He considered ending his life, he says.As Arsalan’s case demonstrates, kidnappers haven’t exclusively targeted only multimillionaires or only westerners.Between 2020 and 2023, a Florida-based gang accessed the personal data of everyday cryptocurrency investors, and were able to steal from their wallets remotely.The gang then carried out four home invasions against the same victims, spanning North Carolina, Texas and Florida,accordingto the US Department of Justice. Account holders were forced to unlock their wallets at gunpoint, while their families were tied up. One man’s mother was tortured. Another man was abducted and found 120 miles from his home.View image in fullscreenA Kraken ad in New York last year.Photograph: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesTwo of the attacks targeted seniors, court documents show.“I always dreamed of having a good retirement. I worked for it. I feel like I deserved it,” one victim, 70, told the court during the sentencing. Her husband has Parkinson’s. They’d hoped to take one last trip together – “to have at least some good years, good times”, she said. The couple lost $3m in cryptocurrency at 2022 prices via wire fraud. Wanting more, the gang invaded their home and held them at gunpoint to claim whatever was left. Their portfolio would be worth nearly $10.7m today.“One whole life of savings and you just took it all,” she said.Insuring assetsIn the case of the retirees, the judge ordered the defendants to pay restitution to the victims. Receiving it looks unlikely.Despite the burgeoning risks, only 10% of cryptocurrency holders across the world have coverage on their digital assets, according to areportby insurance firm GlobalData. Only two insurers offer kidnapping and ransom (K&R) coverage for crypto companies: Aon and Canopius. Glenn Morgan, SVP, head of digital assets at Aon, says he’s seen an increase in clients asking about coverage in recent months. Amid the surge, insurers may be on the eve of a windfall: last month NBC Newsreportedthat three crypto-specific insurance companies are working on K&R policies.From the moment Arsalan checked his balance, he knew any chance of recovery would fall to him. Without the help of law enforcement, he’s been able to trace and recover about $160,000 of cryptocurrency, while the police have seized $60,000 in cash and a luxury car. It’s all now held by local police as case property. He thinks it’ll be at least six years before it’s returned to him, given the pace of Pakistan’s courts.He says seven people have reached out to him with similar ordeals they didn’t report. Trading digital assets in Pakistan is a legal gray area, as banks are forbidden from facilitating transactions. When asked why they targeted crypto traders, the kidnappers said they thought victims wouldn’t have legal recourse, according to Arsalan.In the meantime, Arsalan trades on. He wants to rebuild within a year: “They grabbed my money but they did not grab my brain.”He’s also returned to social media, posting his first video in May. No amount of threats will make him give up crypto, he says. Despite all of its risks, public ledgers still feel safer to him than institutions.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesCybercrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do not, under any circumstances whatsoever, make fun of Vice-PresidentJD Vanceby sharing one of the millions ofunflattering memesdedicated to him. Don’t you dare chuckle at the images of him looking like the “lollipop kid” in Shrek (the resemblance is uncanny) or a chicken nugget. And, whatever you do, do not share the meme that you can findhere, where he looks like a big bald baby. You risk hurting the poor man’s feelings and, also, you might get kicked out of the country.So says a 21-year-old Norwegian called Mads Mikkelsen, anyway. Mikkelsen recently accused American border officials of denying him entry into the US because he had a meme of a bloated baby Vance saved on his phone. Mikkelsen, who had travelled to the US to visit friends, told the Norwegian paperNordlysthat immigration officers at Newark airport interrogated him, forced him to give fingerprints and blood samples, and went through his phone. After they found the Vance meme, as well as a picture of Mikkelsen holding a homemade wooden pipe, they sent him home.“Both pictures had been automatically saved to my camera roll from a chat app, but I really didn’t think that these innocent pictures would put a stop to my entry into the country,” Mikkelsen told Nordlys.Why does this billionaire have 100 kids in 12 countries? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hasrejected Mikkelsen’s claimthat he was kicked out of the country for disrespecting the vice-president. “FACT CHECK. Claims that Mads Mikkelsen was denied entry because of a meme are unequivocally FALSE,” theyposted on Facebookearlier in the week. “TRUTH: Mikkelsen was refused entry into the US for his admitted drug use.”A homeland security assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, alsocalled the story “BS”in a post on X.Mikkelsen, meanwhile, insisted to thefact-checking website Snopesthat the meme played a role in getting him denied entry. The 21-year-old claimed border officials told him he was getting sent home because of “extremist propaganda [the meme] and narcotic paraphernalia”. However, that claim hasn’t been verified.We may never know if the Vance meme really did play a role in getting Mikkelsen kicked out of the country. While I don’t normally side with border officials, one imagines the pipe picture was probably the actual culprit. Still, the story, which made headlines around the world, won’t helpAmerica’s tourism industry. International visitors are staying out of the US after a spate of stories about tourists getting sent to Ice detention centerswithout any explanation. The World Travel & Tourism Council has said the country could lose $12.5bn ininternational visitor spendingthis year.The story has also reignited interest in JD Vance memes, which have been circulating for months now, peaking at end of February after the vice-presidentscoldedVolodymyr Zelenskyy in an exchange that launcheda million memes. Indeed, the Irish lawmaker Ivana Bacik recently held up the Vance baby meme while speaking in the Irish parliament aboutthe Mikkelsen story.While claims that making fun of Mr Hillbilly Elegy may get you deported might be exaggerated, the fact that so many people immediately believed Mikkelsen’s claims is a sign of just how badly the US’s international image has been damaged and how dystopian the country has become. The US is heading veryquickly towards authoritarianism. It is cracking down ondissent and protest. Book banning has surged and theTrump administrationhas instructed the Department of Education toend their investigationsinto these bans, calling them a “hoax”. Free speech rightsare being shredded.And the people responsible for all this? They’re not evil geniuses, they’re embarrassing dweebs with massively meme-able faces. “I knew that one day we might have to watch as capitalism and greed and bigotry led to a world where powerful men, deserving or not, would burn it all down,” Rebecca Shaw said in aGuardian piece earlier this year. “What I didn’t expect, and don’t think I could have foreseen, is how incrediblycringeit would all be.”Immigrants in the US are worried about getting deported if they report domestic violence“The Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, a national network of advocates for those hurt by domestic violence, found that 75% of the 170 advocates they surveyed across the country said the immigrants they serve fear they’ll face arrest or deportation if they contact authorities,”reports USA Today. Meanwhile the Fox News host Jesse Waters seems to think all this is hilarious. “I bet a bunch of guys that are dating illegal alien Spanish girls are like Ice, here’s the address! She hasn’t been very good,”Watters recently said. In related news, a man wasrecently arrestedfor allegedly impersonating an Ice officer and sexually assaulting a woman, saying he’d deport her if she didn’t comply.Nato chief says he doesn’t actually consider Trump ‘Daddy’Mark Rutte made a weird statement in which he referred to Trump as ‘Daddy’ andthen quickly walked it back.Michigan lawmaker says he doesn’t support a woman’s autonomy over her own bodySpeaking at an office hours event, the Michigan representative Karl Bohnak (a Republican), said “I don’t” aftera constituent asked him, “So you don’t support a woman’s autonomy over her own body?”Supreme court paves way for red states to defund Planned ParenthoodThe case, Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, “is part of a longstanding effort by anti-abortion activists to ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood by cutting it out of Medicaid”,the Guardian reports. “Of the 2.4 million people treated at Planned Parenthood each year, almost half use Medicaid.”Armenia’s prime minister offers to show his penis to religious leaderThe prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan,told his Facebook followersthat he was prepared to expose himself to the head of the Armenian church, to prove they were wrong that he had been circumcised.

In fact, Palestine has moved to the heart of domestic politics thanks to an organized, grassroots movement of Palestinians and allies, students and activists, that paved the way for this mayoral win.Zohran Mamdani has struck a blow to the Democratic party’s passivity | Moira DoneganRead moreOver the course of the last two years of genocide, protests and social media activism has shifted the national discourse around Palestine. A Quinnipiac poll has found that sympathy for Israel has reached anall-time low, with Pew showing that over71% of Democratsaged 18-49 have a negative view.On Tuesday, the day of the Democratic primary (as well as the hottest day New York has seen in over13 years), I stood on the corner of 146th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, trying to convince New Yorkers to rank Mamdani on their ballot. One of the leaders of our canvass was a student who was doxed forfighting for her university’s divestmentfrom Israel alongside Mahmoud Khalil. Later that evening, after Cuomo’s concession, Mamdani’s campaign manager thanked Jewish Voice for Peace, whose chapters are integral in organizing against Israel’s genocide and apartheid, for itsearly endorsementof his campaign.While Cuomo was rich in money, receiving $26m in Super Pac funds as opposed to Mamdani’s $1.8m, Mamdani’s wealth was in the people already organized on issues of progressive politics, including Palestine.The Mamdani campaign’s “joyous” ground game, tens of thousands of people who volunteered to knock on over 1.6m doors, is not simply a story of individuals being organically moved to action by progressive politics or a charismatic candidate. It is instead a story of people who have for years been organizing to oppose an electoral system that marginalized them, who saw Mamdani as an alternative to “elected officials [who] endorse or overlook genocide” whether they organized through ethnic organizations like Desis Rising Up and Moving (Drum) or theDemocratic Socialists of American (DSA).This is not a campaign that can be recreated with any fresh face, or just any economically progressive platform. Bernie Sanders is wrong to say that Kamala Harris would “be president of the United States today” had she simply had a platform geared towards the working class, and focused on knocking on doors.People came out for Mamdani because he rejected a party machinery whose establishment candidate, Cuomo, was literally part of Benjamin Netanyahu’s legal team. It mattered that Mamdani started his college’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter. It mattered that Mamdani said he would arrest Netanyahu, that he’d disband the Strategic Response Group of the NYPD, which I’d watched brutalize my Cuny college students as they protested. People came out to campaign for him, rain or shine, because he refused to decry the phrase “Globalize the Intifada” even as he endured vile smears and a death threat for it.If the mayoral race is areferendum on Israel, there was arecord turnoutfor Mamdani. People who had not voted in prior elections showed up to the polls, with Mamdani winning in deeply Hispanic and Asian areas, and doing extraordinarily well among young people of all races. Polling showed himsecondamong Jewish voters.Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary, however, is just one big step in what will continue to be a tough mayoral race. Perhaps the largest threat this campaign will face is the pressure placed on it by the pro-Israel machinery of the Democratic party. The senator Kirsten Gillibrand suggested he may be athreat to Jewish New Yorkers, Laura Gillen, a congressperson, called him “too extreme” and Tom Suozzi, another congressperson, said he had “serious concerns” about his campaign. Mamdani is reportedly scheduled tosit down for meetingswith Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who have so far declined to endorse him.Mamdani is also being targeted by the right. In a grossly racist action, the Tennessee Republican Andy Ogles called for Mamdani to bedenaturalized and deported, posting on X “Zohran ‘little muhammad’ Mamdani is an antisemitic, socialist, communist who will destroy the great City of New York.” And even as shecalled his campaign“unique” and “smart”, Marjorie Taylor Green retweeted an AI-generated image of the Statue of Liberty covered head-to-toe in a black burqa saying, “This hits hard.”Mamdani’s very identity is a challenge to a two-party system that has normalized anti-Muslim hate, and through its prism anti-Palestinian repression and genocide. Trumpbegan testing his mass deportation policyon the Palestinian students who led the movements that made the Mamdani campaign possible, including by kidnapping and imprisoning Khalil, the negotiator for the Columbia encampment. Trump justified his travel ban, which Mamdani’s home country Uganda may be added to in the coming months, as part offighting antisemitism.What his pathway to victory in the primary shows is that his continued strength, and that of any other candidate hoping to secure a similar victory, will not rely on political endorsements. Instead, it will rely on him staying true to the authenticity that made this campaign resonate with millions of people inNew Yorkand around the world.This story was amended on 28 June 2025 to correct that the primary was on Tuesday, not Wednesday, as previously stated.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionNew YorkDemocratsUS politicsAndrew CuomocommentShareReuse this content"

I’ll furnish the war,” was the storied response of the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst to Frederic Remington after the illustrator was sent to Cuba to cover an insurrection and cabled back to the boss that there was little going on.Much has changed since that famous (if true) exchange of the late 19th century, in the heyday of sensationalism known as yellow journalism.But one thing that hasn’t changed is that there’s nothing like military conflict to capture the attention of the public, with plenty of help from the media. And the media – whether a tabloid newspaper or a cable news network – benefits, too.These days,Donald Trump’s recent strike on Iranhas proved the point once again, with the media’s attention intensely focused onOperation Midnight Hammer, as it was dramatically dubbed.The mainstream media has enabled Trump’s war on universities | Jason StanleyRead moreFirst the emphasis was on the threat of attacks toIran’s budding nuclear arsenal, then on the possibility of all-out global war, then on the strikes themselves and then the announcement of a supposed ceasefire.All to the greater glory of Trump, at least as he tells it.For those who are trying to bring public attention to other important matters – even matters of life and death – that’s a frustrating reality.Jennifer Mascia knows this all too well.She is a founding reporter forthe Trace,a non-profit news site dedicated to tracking the epidemic of gun violence in America and trying to do something about it, through exploring solutions.Whenelected officials in Minnesota were shotearlier this month – the former state House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and the state legislator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded – it was a huge story.Huge, but fleeting.“Pitted against a global conflict, domestic news doesn’t really stand a chance,” said Mascia, who previously contributed to the now-defunct Gun Report at the New York Times, begun by the then columnist Joe Nocera.That’s true for domestic news that, in an earlier era, would have commanded the media’s attention for many days, if not weeks. The Minnesota violence was even more newsworthy because of an early manhunt and disinformation swirling around the apparent assassin’s political leanings.Still, coverage seemed to disappear in the blink of an eye.“The Trump era has all but ensured that important news will get smacked out of the news cycle in favor of the latest development in Trumpworld,” Mascia wrote to me in an email, after we had talked by phone.Mascia is quick to clarify that she’s not suggesting that the media ignore what the chaotic president is doing.“It’s important that we cover Trump’s constitutional breaches. We shouldn’t become numb or complacent in the face of eroding democracy,” she said.But it was remarkable to see how quickly the Minnesota shootings faded from media attention. A CNN contributor herself, Mascia is often called in to provide perspective for “Day Two” of coverage after the initial reporting of gun-related news. But often these days, she notes, thereisno Day Two.By then, the media has moved on.“Maybe if the Israel-Iran war wasn’t going on, we’d still be talking about it,” she said. “Anderson Cooper would be broadcasting from Melissa Hortman’s funeral. But instead, he’s in Tel Aviv.”And, of course, this extends to all sorts of other subjects, not just gun violence.Those who try to focus attention on voting rights, the rule of law, crucial supreme court decisions, widespread citizen action such as the vast “No Kings” protests – to mention just a few – may get a modicum of attention.But nothing compares to a show of military force. And Trump, always attuned to how he’s being perceived, is well aware of that.“A spectacular military success,” he crowed after the strikes. “A historic success,” echoed his defense secretary. Pete Hegseth couldn’t countenance being asked actual questions and claimed the press was trying to distort the story “for their own political reasons to try to hurt President Trump or our country”.Was the administration’s bragging accurate? Perhaps not, said intelligence reports that indicated the strikes may have only added months to the time Iran needs to produce the material for a nuclear weapon.But no matter.The strikes – from the lead-up to the aftermath – sucked up all the oxygen in the media universe for many days.Even by Thursday early afternoon, the top four news articles (plus one photo) on the Washington Post mobile app, for example, were Iran-related.And Fox News, of course, remained largely a cheering section.Whatever the effect on world peace, military conflict sure is good for ratings, as William Randolph Hearst knew in his bones.“Historians point to the Spanish-American war as the first press-driven war,” noted a PBS article accompanying the film Crucible of Empire.It wouldn’t be the last.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS press and publishingOpinionUS politicsIranDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps other politicians should cautiously take noteGary Nunn is a freelance journalist and authorSat 28 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 13.54 EDTShareIdid not get out of bed this morning expecting to praise the public use of an expletive, but such is 2025. If any president was going to break this presidential norm,as NPR put it, it was always going to be Donald Trump.“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing,” the president told a group of reporters this week. “Do you understand that?” he asked, before storming off.It appears to be the first time a president has deliberately used the F-word live on camera to a press scrum or in a public forum, instead of being “caught” using the term accidentally on a hot mic (even that has only happened a handful of times). Cue plenty of puns from journalists about the “dropping of the F-bomb”.For the record, Trump actuallyused the F-word about Iran in 2020, but the slightly delayed radio broadcast bleeped it out. Plus, asthis 2016 video compilation shows, it’s not unusual for him to swear.But what was different about this time – coming as it did at a moment of heightened global anxiety about military escalation – is that it came across as … authentic. Many people watching will have felt, heard and even shared that frustration about Israel and Iran’s alleged breaking of the ceasefire. Trump’s swearing made the point more forcefully than any diplomatic “disappointment” could have done. It wasn’t eloquent, but I believed it.We know other presidents – such as Lyndon Johnson, and especially Richard Nixon – swore in private. They wouldn’t have dreamed of risking the reputational damage to do so in public, and would have had to apologise if they did. No British prime minister has ever said “fuck” publicly to my knowledge. Few world leaders ever have.1:02Trump swears in outburst at Israel and Iran over ceasefire violations – videoWhich is potentially part of the problem. The most common complaint about the political elite is that they’re out of touch; that we can’t trust a word that comes out of their mouths because it’s all untrustworthy scripted spin. Yet at the same time we believe they’re swearing like sailors – and saying what they really think – behind closed doors (a perception bolstered by iconic roles such asPeter Capaldi’s Malcolm Tucker, the foul-mouthed spin doctor in The Thick of It, or the blue-mouthed Roger Furlong from Veep.)Of course, swearing doesn’t equate to honesty. And, in Trump’s case, the obscenity only masked his own complicity in creating the situation that frustrated him – from pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 to his “monumental” airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. But my point is that the public clearly doesn’t trust the polished and sanitised scripts that characterise so much political speech.I’m not suggesting world leaders all suddenly disrespect the gravitas of their office. Can you imagine Keir Starmer being encouraged to swear? He’d sound like a headteacher attempting to rap. What I am saying is there’s power in judicious swearing.You want to appear more human to voters? Act more like one. YouGov polling reported in April revealed that just8% of Britons never swear. Perhaps an occasional curse or two would allow politicians to ally themselves with the 92% of us who do.Linguistic norms are always changing. For six years, I wrote aregular columnfor the Guardian’s Mind your language section. During that time, I saw changes that would incense any purist. For instance, the BBC made even less use of those with received pronunciation accents and started broadcasting more voices that really sound like people across the country. Such “real” accents are supposed to make the institution seem less remote and more trustworthy. The same is true of the institution of politics. Sounding more like real people does nobody any real harm.If the stakes are literally life and death, and people aren’t listening, a well-placed, truly meant expletive will wake everyone up. At time of writing, the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding. Maybe the F-bomb did the job after all.Gary Nunn is a freelance journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

Never before in modern history have those with the fate of the world in their hands been so old. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are both 72. Narendra Modi is 74,Benjamin Netanyahu75, Donald Trump 79, and Ali Khamenei is 86.Thanks to advances in medical science, people are able to lead longer, more active lives – but we are now also witnessing a frightening number of political leaders tightening their grip on power as they get older, often at the expense of their younger colleagues.This week, at their annual summit, the leaders of Nato – including Emmanuel Macron and Mette Frederiksen (both 47), Giorgia Meloni (48) and Pedro Sánchez (53) –were forced to swallowTrump’s demand for increased military spending. The average age of Nato heads of state is 60. Germany’s Friedrich Merz is 69, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is 71.All bowed to a new5% defence spending target– an arbitrary figure, imposed without serious military reasoning or rational debate, let alone serious democratic debate at home. It was less policy, more deference to the whims of a grumpy patriarch. Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte – himself just 58 – went so far as tocall Trump “Daddy”. That’s not diplomacy. That’s submission.This generational clash plays out in other arenas. Ukraine’s 47-year-old president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is resisting the imperial ambitions of septuagenarian Putin. Septuagenarian Xi eyes a Taiwan led by a president seven years his junior. Netanyahu, three-quarters of a century old, is overseeing devastation in Gaza, where almosthalf the population is under 18. In Iran an 86 year old rules over a population withan average age of 32. Cameroon’s Paul Biya, 92, has been in power since 1982 in a country where themedian age is 18and life expectancyjust 62.There is no gerontocratic conspiracy at work here – no senior citizens’ club bent on global domination. But there is something disturbing about a world being dismantled by the very people whose lives were defined by its postwar architecture. Khamenei was six when the second world war ended.Trump was born in 1946, the year the United Nationsheld its first general assembly. Netanyahu was born a year after Israel was founded. Modi was born in 1950, as India became a republic. Putin entered the world in October 1952, months before Stalin died. Xi in June 1953, just after. And Erdoğan was born in 1954, two years afterTurkey joined Nato. These men are the children of the postwar world – and as they near the end of their lives, they seem determined to tear it down. It almost looks like revenge.Dylan Thomas urged usto “Rage, rage against the dying of the light”. Rarely has the line felt so literal.Yes, the rules-based international order was always messier in practice than on paper. But at least the ideal existed. There was a shared moral framework – shaky, yes, but sincere – built on the conviction that humanity must never repeat the atrocities of the first half of the 20th century and that dialogue and diplomacy were better. That conviction has now evaporated, not least in the minds of those who should cherish it most.This is an unprecedented moment. The architects of the previous global disorder – Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Mao – were all in their 30s or 40s when they rose to power. A new generation built a new world, and lived with its consequences. Today, that new world is being unmade by an old generation – one that will not live to see the wreckage it leaves behind. It’s easier to shout “drill, baby, drill” when you’re statistically unlikely to experience the worst of climate collapse. Après nous le déluge, as the French say.You might think that a generation so fortunate to benefit from longevity would leave behind a legacy of care, gratitude and global stewardship. Instead, we are witnessing the worst resurgence of repression, violence, genocide, ecocide and contempt for international law in decades – waged, more often than not, by ruthless septuagenarians and octogenarians who appear more interested in escaping prosecution than preserving peace.But it doesn’t have to be this way.After leaving office, Nelson Mandela foundedthe Elders, a network of former world leaders working to promote peace, justice and human rights. Inspired by African traditions of consensus and elder wisdom, the Elders are an example of how age can bring clarity, compassion and conscience – not just clout.The problem isn’t old age. It’s how some have chosen to wield it. The world doesn’t need more ageing strongmen clinging to power. It needs elders who are willing to let go – and guide. The kind who think about legacy not as personal glory, but as the world they leave behind. In this age of age, what we need is not domination, but wisdom. And that, in the end, is what separates a ruler from a leader.David Van Reybrouck is philosopher laureate for the Netherlands and Flanders.

It’s time for Labor to show some courageZoe DanielThe public wants the ads banned but the government keeps bowing to pressure. Now, with its whopping majority, what’s the excuse?Sat 28 Jun 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 21.37 EDTShareTwo years ago this week the Murphy report was delivered to the government, recommending the banning of gambling ads. And for two years the Albanese government has failed to act in the face of pressure from vested interests. Over those two yearsAustralians have gambled awayanother $60bn.In June 2023 the Labor MP Peta Murphy said: “Australians are the biggest losers in the world when it comes to gambling. We have a culture where sport and gambling are intrinsically linked. These behaviours are causing increasingly widespread and serious harm to individuals, families and communities.”Australians know we’re the biggest losers by a large stretch over any other nation in the world. Australians know that gambling causes mental and financial stress. Australians know that gambling losses can trigger family violence. Australians know that gambling ads are normalising gambling, for children and adults.Australians want it to stop.Australia Institutepolling in Marchreconfirmed the majority view that three in four Australians support a total ban on gambling ads phased in over three years. These numbers are mirrored in surveys by the AFL Fans Association.But the government is putting power before people.Tabcorp ‘clearly emboldened’ by government inaction on gambling ads, David Pocock saysRead moreAt a public forum run by the Kooyong independent, Dr Monique Ryan, the Curtin independent, Kate Chaney, and me in Melbourne on Wednesday night, John, who has experienced gambling harm, said because of failed policy “a lot of people have seen suicide as the only option to escape the predatory behaviour of the gambling companies”.The failure runs long and deep and crosses party lines. Murphy represented the outer Melbourne seat of Dunkley, which has more than its fair share of struggling Australians. She knew, especially after the social policy committee inquiry proved it, that online gambling and its blanket advertising was preying on their vulnerabilities.She achieved rare multipartisan support for the report, which recommended a three-year phased gambling ad ban. That was just one of 31 recommendations, among them implementing a national strategy on harm reduction and national regulation, an ombudsman, a harm reduction levy, a public education campaign, more independent research and improved data collection.“A phased, comprehensive ban on online gambling advertising is recommended within three years,” Murphy said. “This will give major sports and broadcasters time to find alternative advertisers and sponsors, while preventing another generation from experiencing escalating gambling harm.”But to appease the gambling companies, broadcasters and sporting codes, both major parties have offered a halfway house, a partial ban to reduce ads per hour and keep ads out of prime-time sport. Previous similar policies have increased the number of ads in other programs including during news and family drama.When pressed on his reticence to implement a full ban, theprime ministerhas repeatedlyimpliedthat gambling is part of Australian culture.That’s disingenuous.Firstly, this is not a debate about banninggambling, it’s aboutthe adsthat are encouraging it and causing untold harm.Secondly, private sports betting has only been available since SportsBet was licensed in 1993. The “culture” has been built by profit-driven industries, and it can be changed by a government with courage.Before an election, you can (perhaps) understand why a government may not want to defy powerful media companies that are embedded with sport in this country and historically have had the power to turn elections.David Squires on … Australia’s intrusive sports gambling adsRead moreAfter, with a more than 90-seat majority, what’s the excuse?If the issue is the profitability of the broadcasters – and I’m all for a strong media landscape – that should be addressed separately. Our communities should not be saddled with gambling problems to keep media and multinational gambling companies profitable. Nor should fans be preyed on by sporting codes that get a commission from each bet. It is immoral.Had the government found its courage at the time, we would now be just one year off a full ad ban. Instead, they’ve failed to honour Murphy’s committee’scommonsense recommendations.In turn, Australian communities have experienced another two years of gambling ads, normalising the link between betting and sport. During the last term of parliament, I twice tabled a private member’s bill to ban gambling advertising. South Australian MP Rebekha Sharkie also tabled legislation to address the issue. In all cases the government refused to debate it.Now is the time.Chaney and Ryan have kicked off a new “ban gambling ads now” push this week. They have support from their communities, gambling advocates and fans. On the backbenches in both major parties there is also support for this change.The opportunity sits with Anika Wells, the new minister for sport and communications (a vexed coupling in this context), who must respond to the Murphy report.Peta Murphy died of breast cancer in December 2023.

Generous public spacesRhiannon Lucy CosslettHaving a child makes you see cities differently. We deserve better than shuttered playgrounds and locked paddling poolsSat 28 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 12.13 EDTShareThere’s nothing like a boiling hot summer with an energetic small child to make you acutely aware of the need for outdoor space. We are lucky to have a garden, albeit an overgrown one that isn’t exactly child-friendly, so, like many parents, we mostly rely on public space in order for him to play and get the huge amount of exercise he needs. And, if you are able-bodied, there’s nothing like having a child to make youlook at public spacesdifferently.Steps instead of ramps. A lack of benches on which to feed a baby, or give a toddler their snack. No shade. No access to toilets or changing tables. Nowhere to fill up a water bottle. No fences or gates dividing pedestrianised space from a busy road, or a deep body of water, or myriad other hazards. These are just some of the things that start to matter. Before your eyes, the urban environment becomes transformed and often inhospitable. Things such as locked playgrounds (I’m looking at you, Camden council – Falkland Place playground has been closed for literally months at this point) have the potential to ruin your morning. In a heatwave, broken splash pads and locked paddling pools (most recent personal disappointments include Brighton and Leamington Spa) feel like acts of particular cruelty.It’s no wonder, then, that the privatised “public” spaces that have become common across cities, all of which share a certain slick homogeneity, start to feel appealing. Before I had a child, I disliked the new development atCoal Drops Yardin London’s King’s Cross. Walking around it when it reopened, it felt cold and dystopian. That, though, was before the people arrived. Now it feels safe, lively and vibrant, full of children shrieking with delight as they run in and out of the Granary Square fountains. It’s a child-friendly space that isn’t child-dominated: from the food market to the outdoor cinema to the students practising dances and drinking tinnies by the canal, it feels happily communal.But in the UK, actual public, child-friendly space, as opposed to “pseudo-public space” created from private investment, such as the King’s Cross redevelopment, is very much a postcode lottery. The first play fountains I ever encountered – in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester, which had been redesigned ahead of the Commonwealth Games in 2002 – used to be fantastic, but for years now this has been an areadogged by antisocial behaviour. Promises of redevelopment have stalled because ofbudgeting issues. The city deserves better.In Spain, a chat on the doorstep is a custom worth preserving in the digital age | María RamírezRead moreAs temperatures increase, we should look to the continent for inspiration. Although I hoped that the increased focus on public space during the pandemic would result in more pedestrianised areas containing outdoor seating and greater investment in outdoor spaces, that hasn’t always materialised. We may never have the weather, or national temperament, that turns us into thesort of societythat revolves around a piazza, but the Spanish and Italian models for public space and how they integrate children’s play with adult socialising, such as those lovely shaded playgrounds fringed with bar and cafe tables that have so impressed tourists they have become asocial media phenomenon, are inspiring.To an extent, they exist that way because there’s a recognition that the middle of the day is too hot for kids to play outside, and so the evenings become a time for everyone, with spaces blurred between adult drinking and dining, and children’s play and exercise. That is increasingly becoming the case here, too. It feels as though it’s becoming more common to see children in the playground until quite late in the evening, so why not start to incorporate urban design around the adults who care for them?I am not one of those people who thinks that everything is better in other countries. Just today I was reading the comments under a video about Italian children crashing out late at night in their prams while the grownups socialised. The now-adults were reflecting on how much, as children, they disliked that, how they didn’t actually want to play out in the piazza until midnight, they just wanted a nice, quiet bed to lie in. Meanwhile, I’m doing my son’s bedtime routine at 7pm when it’s still light outside. Surely there has to be a middle ground, a public space that caters to both adults and children during the light evenings that feels safe and inclusive?After all, heatwaves are only going to get more and more common.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

This is never more true than in the countryside, where the impacts of an extreme concentration of ownership and control are blamed on those who have nothing to do with it. Rural people are endlessly instructed that they’re oppressed not by the lords of the land, but by vicious and ignorant townies – the “urban jackboot” as the Countryside Alliance used to call it –stamping on their traditions.Near Bridport in Dorset right now, an entire village is facing eviction, following thesale of the Bridehead Estatefor about £30m. The official new owner,Bridehead Estate Ltd, is registered to the same address, with the same officers, as a company calledBelport. TheTelegraph reportsthat the estate “was bought by Belport, a private equity firm, on behalf of a wealthy client last autumn”, but no one knows who the client is. So far I’ve received no response to the questions I sent to Belport.The people of Littlebredy, a village of 32 homes,wholly owned by the estate, say they have been ordered to leave from January. At the beginning of this month, access to parts of the 800-hectare (2,000-acre) grounds, widely enjoyed by local people,was terminated, withred signsto this effect and padlocks on all the entrances. No one knows who is doing this to them. The sense of powerlessness is overwhelming.One person has been evicted already, to make way for an estate office. When she complained about her treatment on social media,the first replystated, without a shred of evidence: “You’re being evicted so that young fighting age male refugees, who are escaping war in France, can have somewhere safe to live, who, as far as our government is concerned, have priority over you … VOTE REFORM!” That’s how divide and rule works: never mind the anonymous plutocrat evicting her, the true culprits, somehow, are asylum seekers.We are lectured by rightwing parties and the rightwing media about the need for “integration”. But that word is used only as a weapon against immigrants. It is not they who rip communities apart, tear people from their homes and shut us out of the land, causing social disintegration. It is the power of money.But look, a spider! The cosmopolitan city, swarming with immigrants and trans people, is coming to get you! It willterminate the traditionscountry people love andimpose its own cultureinstead. It is drummed into our heads that what rural people want is different to what the oppressive urbanites desire. But it’s not true.Embarrassingly for the self-professed guardians of the countryside, some of the evidence comes from their own surveys. Future Countryside – which tells us it is “powered by the Countryside Alliance Foundation”, the charitable arm of the Countryside Alliance – commissioned polling in 2023. Its question about a wider right to roam in the countryside was phrased in a way that made it sound threatening: “To what extent do you agree that the public should have the ‘right to roam’ meaning that anyone can wander in the open countryside regardless of whether the land is privately or publicly owned?” Even so, there was almost no difference between the responses of urban and rural people: 55% of urban people and 54% of rural people agreed it was a good idea. Even more strikingly, when asked which political party “would do the most to prioritise/protect/promote the countryside?”, only 9% each of urban and rural people named the Conservatives, while 38% in both categories said the Green party.Perhaps unsurprisingly, these answers failed to find their way into Future Countryside’s public presentation of the results. Instead, the only mention of a right to roam was a comment from an anonymous rural respondent: “They weren’t brought up in the countryside. They think they can wander across all the fields with the right to roam.” Links to both the rawpolling data and the public presentationon the organisation’s website currently show a “404 error” when you try to open them.View image in fullscreenA thatched house in the village of Littlebredy on the Bridehead Estate, Dorset.Photograph: Graham Hunt/AlamyStrangely, writing a year after these results were published, the chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, Tim Bonner, claimed that a wider right to roam is “completely contradictoryto what the public actually wants”. With admirable chutzpah, he accused those calling for it of waging a “culture war in the countryside”.WhenYouGovframed the question more objectively, for a poll commissioned by the Right to Roam campaign, it found that 68% of urban people and 68% of rural people supported it. Italso discovered, in stark contrast to the claims of certain rural “guardians” who call it “the social gluethat keeps rural communities together”, that opposition to hunting with dogs is strong everywhere: 78% of urban people and 74% of rural people are against it. As the access campaignerJon Moses points outin an article for the Lead, “the issues over which we’re told we’re most divided are often the issues on which we actually most agree”.That view is supported by somefascinating researchpublished in the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties. It found that while in several other western countries there is a stark political divide between urban and rural people, this does not apply in Britain. “We do not find any evidence that rural Britons are more resentful, dissatisfied or ‘left behind’ compared to their urban counterparts.” On cultural issues, it found, “ruralites are often less – not more – authoritarian than urbanites … and are less likely to support an undemocratic leader”.We are fundamentally the same people, despite the best efforts of the culture warriors to divide us. But we must be persuaded that other people don’t want what we want: that we are the outsiders, the interlopers, the weird minority, pushing against the social current.In reality, the weird minority are the 1% who ownhalf of all the landin England, and the subset of that groupwho hide their ownershipbehind front companies and opaque trusts. If the government’sproposed changesto the Land Registry go ahead, it may become easier to discover the true owners of places such as Bridehead, though I suspect we will still struggle.On 5 July, the Right to Roam campaign will organise apeaceful trespassat Bridehead, to draw attention to the almost feudal powers blighting rural life. The real conflict is not town v country, but money and power v people. That holds, regardless of where you live.

With the end-of-financial-year sales period upon us, here are some strategies to ensure you are being conscious about your on-sale consumption.No backyard required: I tried growing vegetables on a 20th-floor balcony – here’s what I learnedRead moreUnderstand your brain on saleBelieve it or not,our brains are wiredto encourage us to buy things at a reduced price, especially when there is a sense of urgency – ie during sales and promotions.Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, a professor of consumer psychology at Anglia Ruskin University, says this is because of three things. “When we see a price tag that we perceive as a good deal, the part of our brains that deals with pleasure is activated,” she says. Then, when we make a purchase, we get a dopamine hit that makes us feel good and, finally, when there is a time limit on the availability of the discounted price, it triggers heightened adrenaline. This combination means sales shopping can make people “feel giddy with excitement”.Being aware of this dynamic and recognising it when temptation arises is the first step to exercising self-control and resisting the urge to make an impulse purchase.Give yourself permission to take a beatThe second step is to take “a calm pause between looking at an item and purchasing”, says Dr Kate Luckins, the author of Live More With Less. This should help to “counter the frenzy of the sale”.If you’re shopping in store, one way to do this is by holding on to the item while you continue browsing and delay heading to the checkout. Or, if you’re shopping online, stand up and walk away from your computer or put down your phone and do something else to see if the shine of the product wears off. Alternatively, sleep on it.“In that pause, you will either obsess over the item you’re considering, or you will move on and forget about it,” Luckins says.Keep a list of things you need and set a budgetSo as not to miss out on the savings promotional periods offer, Stephanie Atto from Australian Consumer and Retail Studies recommends keeping a list of products you are looking to buy and sticking to the list during sales periods. “To resist sales pressures, consumers should focus on being informed and assertive,” she says. “Be prepared by understanding your needs, doing your research and setting a budget.”The popularity of this strategy is borne out by data. Pallant says the increased frequency of sales periods has trained consumers to wait to make purchases. “A recent shopper survey from Mailchimp suggests 76% of consumers use these events to buy products they were planning to buy anyway.”Do research to check if it’s actually a good dealAlthough it might feel like being increasingly online gives retailers an advantage, Pallant suggests inverting this dynamic by keeping track of what you want to buy, what a good price is and gathering your own data.How to stay warm this winter without breaking the bank – or the planetRead more“Do your research about how often these brands or products go on sale and what a good discount really is,” he says. “There are so many sales events now that if you miss out on one, you might only have to wait a couple of weeks for another.”Unfollow and unsubscribeGiven the frequency of email and social media marketing, you can do yourself a favour ahead of time by “setting tech limits”, Atto says. This can be as simple as running through your inbox and unsubscribing from brands and retailers that always seem to be communicating promotions, or unfollowing social media accounts that do the same.Think about every purchase as an investmentAs the designer and poet William Morris said: “Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.” Regardless of how much your dopamine-hungry brain is calculating you will save with the purchase of an item, once you’ve bought it, it’s yours – so it’s worth assessing whether it is a good investment.Try exercising some reverse Marie Kondo (the decluttering expert) and ask before the purchase: Does this item truly bring me joy? In six months, when I am cleaning out my cupboards, is its quality so good that I will still be proud to own it?The flip side of this is that shopping on sale can be an opportunity to buy something of beautiful quality or craftsmanship that might normally be out of your budget. “Buying one piece or product we love rather than a bunch we kind of like at a discount is much more satisfying in the long term,” Luckins says.Share your tipsTell us hereYour responses, which can be anonymous, are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions.

Yet there manages to be a genuine twist in the lineup: grime legend Skepta, as a last-minute replacement for alt-metal band Deftones, who have been forced to cancel due to illness. Skepta happens to be kicking around because last night, at Glade, he performed a DJ set alongside Mochakk from São Paulo and Carlita from Istanbul – an advertisement of his house-techno project Más Tiempo, launched with Jammer in 2023, with regular slots in Ibiza.But he’d not required the full force of his production for Glade, so stepping in for a billing just shy of the headline slot on Glastonbury’s second largest stage, Other, is certainly a challenge. On that, of course,Skeptasteps up to the plate with incredible energy and conviction, saying “Let’s go!!! No crew, no production but am ready to shut Glastonbury down. Victory lap time. Pre-Big Smoke 2025!” (his multi-genre festival taking place at Crystal Palace Bowl, south London, in August.)And who better to teleport to the slot than the MC and rapper who always seems to be in a million places at once, revealing numerous side missions, whether that’s heading up a luxury fashion house, auctioning off paintings to Sotheby’s, or getting a chieftaincy in Ogun State, Nigeria? That kind of calling requires someone as frenetic and spontaneous as the microphone champion.View image in fullscreenMicrophone champion … Skepta.Photograph: Anna BarclaySkepta only gets 30 minutes with the mic, but his performance is so kinetic and zesty and expansive that you feel that it is longer, and wonder what it might have been if he had been called to the stage with real notice (Skepta’s last Glastonbury performance of this kind was on this stage with Boy Better Know in 2017). A siren marks his arrival, and he’s accompanied only by long-term collaborator DJ Maximum. Though he has a forthcoming project, Fork and Knife – which will, among other themes, track his parents’ migration from Nigeria to London – he wisely reaches for the more recognisable bangers, kicking off with recent hit Cops & Robbers, his collaboration with Sammy Virji: “DJ play one for the badman, DJ play one for the ladies.” Dressed in shorts from his own Mains brand, a durag and frameless glasses, he flawlessly rattles through hits old and new: That’s Not Me, Redrum, It Ain’t Safe.What makes Skepta so remarkable and a cut above other MCs is that clarity in his rapping delivery. His flow is so explosive and complex and his tracks are peppered with memorable lyrics and puns such as: “We don’t talk about beef, by the way, did I mention I just turned vegan?” But what also shines through is the multigenerational appeal Skepta has over 20 years on from his beginnings in the Tottenham-based grime collective Meridian Crew. Archival footage played behind him takes us from his early days of clashing, to his 2008 1Xtra freestyle with his brother JME and videos of him rapping with his crew around the estates of north London. Yet while Skepta is spoken of among his grime peers like Wiley, Frisco, JME and Kano, he is also ranked alongside the younger generation such as Dave and Central Cee. And of course, the acclaim of Mercury prize-winning album Konnichiwa and his collaboration with A$AP Rocky, Praise the Lord, (which takes off well here) helped him to crossover stateside in a way that had been semi-unprecedented for British rappers.From this set, it is easy to see why Skepta has endured – that crisp, fresh delivery, that unceasing hunger and energy, but also the evolution. Of course he runs the full gamut of his discography, but as he closes he plays the newly released Victory Lap with Fred Again, a sickening 140bpm dubstep track with a modern electronic production and a Doechii sample. It’s indicative of how curious and genre-pushing Skepta is, and shows that his pursuits into other ventures have only complicated his music for the better. No doubt when he’s back again, with more preparation time, he’ll be an even bigger Glastonbury highlight.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025FestivalsMusic festivalsSkeptaGrimeRapreviewsShareReuse this content"

And while a healthy, roaring crowd has assembled for Haim’s set, which they posted about on Instagram an hour before their stage time, it doesn’t necessarily feel like there is the same mania around Haim’s surprise appearance as there was around other artists such as Lorde, Pulp and Lewis Capaldi.Perhaps that’s because, in their 13 years as a band, Haim have basically become part of the furniture at Worthy Farm: they played in 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2022, and also performed on the festival’s Covid-era live stream. There is a sense, perhaps, that the chance to see Pulp on the Pyramid stage for the first time in 30 years or Lorde return from a performing hiatus is a bigger deal than rock’s most affable sisters.View image in fullscreenLyrics stretched into frenzied screams … Haim on the Park stage.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAIndeed, the sheer reliability of Haim is at the top of my mind during their Park performance. Although their set is themed around their recently released fourth album I Quit – the staging features a giant digital sign flashing slogans including “I quit dick” and “I quit caring about what people think” – it leans on big, eternally great hits from past albums. Danielle, Alana and Este gallop on stage to the irresistible stomp of The Wire, from 2013’s Days Are Gone, and the crowd saves its biggest sing-alongs for the urgent, frustrated The Steps (from the band’s 2020 opus Women In Music Pt III) and Want You Back, from 2017’s Something To Tell You.While it’s fantastic to hear these songs in such a gorgeous live setting, in the Park’s natural amphitheatre, it also feels like a slight shame, because the songs from I Quit are total standouts. Blood on the Street, an absolutely sizzling breakup song, is extended into what feels like an eight-minute cross between a cabaret show and a jam band, with Danielle punctuating one lyric with a yelled “What the fuck?” and imperiously stretching her arm out demanding a guitar at one point, and Este stretching her lyrics into frenzied screams. Down to Be Wrong, a highlight of the record, provides a spectacular final song: Danielle’s voice sounds sublime on the chorus, and it’s even better when sung back to her by a devoted, ardent crowd.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsHaimreviewsShareReuse this content"

Twelve months and some provocative onstage comments about Palestine and Conservative MPs later, they’re both folk devil and cause celebre, whose appearance at the festival is the most hotly debated of 2025 – both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition have had strong opinions about it.Kneecap lead anti-Keir Starmer chant during politically charged Glastonbury setRead moreIt’s a perfect example of how quickly stories can become overheated in the 21st century: vastly more people now have a opinion about Kneecap than have ever heard their music, which is, traditionally, a tricky and destructive position for a band to find themselves in. Invoking a name one probably shouldn’t invokeunder the circumstances, you might want to ask the surviving members of the Sex Pistols how that worked out for them.Still, the West Holts area is so packed, it has to be closed down to prevent a crush. The stage is barely visible for flags, most, but not all of them, Palestinian (there’s still room for WE LIKE TO MOVE IT MOVE IT, SMITHY’S ON A BENDER and indeed I EAT ASS – THAT’S AMORE). Kneecap themselves seem happy to lean into the controversy: their appearance is preceded by a montage of voices condemning the band – Sharon Osbourne figures heavily – and much booing from the audience. Their ongoing travails are regularly referenced – “everyone in that fucking tent agreed with me”, protests Mo Chara (real name Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) about the Coachella appearance that intensified the whole business. Bandmate Móglaí Bap (Naoise Ó Cairealláin) suggests that the audience should attend Ó hAnnaidh’s forthcoming court hearing – he’s been charged with what Bap calls a “trumped up” terrorism-related offence for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a London gig, for which Mo Chara has been unconditionally bailed – and “start a riot outside the courts … the Daily Mail will love that! Fuck the Daily Mail! Fuck Keir Starmer!” The latter is among a longer list of enemies that also includes Rod Stewart, who’s made the impressively ballsy choice to preface his Glastonbury appearance with an expression of support for Nigel Farage.View image in fullscreenTriumphant … Kneecap at West Holts.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIt’s probably too late to say that it would be a shame if said controversy completely drowned out Kneecap’s actual music, but the point stands. Behind the furore, the trio are really good at what they do. Mo Chara and Móglaí Bap are impressive rappers – raw-throated but dextrous, far funnier than you might expect if the only stuff you heard about Kneecap revolved around recent events. And live, their sound comes into its own, a fizzing stew with a bassy intensity that has a hint of the Prodigy about it: Fine Art’s sudden lurches from dubstep to four-to-the-floor pounding; Get Your Brits Out’s warped take on classic Chicago house.As the crowd break into circle pits and moshing, with a degree of encouragement from the band, it feels genuinely exciting, a feral moment in a festival that’s thus far tended towards sunkissed good vibes. What happens next – whether Kneecap’s ongoing notoriety turns out to be a brief flashpoint, something more lasting, or indeed ultimately the undoing of them – remains to be seen. For now, for this audience, they are triumphant.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025KneecapRapGlastonbury festivalFestivalsMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier the broadcaster confirmed itwould not be able to support a live streamof the performance.The broadcaster has not yet confirmed when the footage will be available on iPlayer.Users of the Glastonbury app received a push notification almost an hour before the band were due to perform saying the West Holts stage was closed. However, spectators were still getting in 20 minutes before the start of the set.The show opened with clips of news and various TV discussion shows, with politicians and commentators saying the group should be banned and had been “avoiding justice for far too long”.‘We just want to stop people being murdered’: Kneecap on Palestine, protest and provocationRead moreThere was booing from the crowd for Sharon Osborne calling them a “pathetic band”.“Glastonbury I’m a free man!” shouted Ó hAnnaidh, to wild cheers from the crowd.“If anybody falls down, you’ve got to pick them up. We’ve got to keep each other safe,” he added.The group, who rap in English and Irish, performed an energetic set including Your Sniffer Dogs Are Shite, Get Your Brits Out and Fine Art in front of a backdrop which said “Free Palestine”, occasionally varying with other phrases including “Fuck Badenoch”, referring to the leader of the Tory party.The crowds chanted: “Free Mo Chara, free free Mo Chara!”“Mo Chara’s back in court for a trumped up terrorism charge,” said Móglaí Bap, also known as Naoise Ó Cairealláin.“It’s not the first time there’s a miscarriage of justice for an Irish person in the British criminal justice system,” he said.Ó hAnnaidh cut a defiant figure, saying his plight in the courts was nothing compared to the suffering of the Palestinian people. The band urged people to come out to support Ó hAnnaidh at his next court date at Westminster magistrates court.“I want to say a big thank you to the Eavis family [organisers of Glastonbury],” Ó hAnnaidh added, for “holding strong” in the face of criticism.Asked on Wednesday about the controversy, organiser Emily Eavis said: “There have been a lot of really heated topics this year, but we remain a platform for many, many artists from all over the world and, you know, everyone is welcome here.”On numerous occasions, the trio chanted “Fuck Keir Starmer!”, with the crowd passionately shouting back. They also had the crowds chanting the Irish republican slogan, “tiocfaidh ár lá”, which translates as “our day will come”.The band laughed with the crowd asking: “Is anyone going to see Rod Stewart tomorrow?”The 80-year-old rocker was criticised ahead of his Pyramid stage performance after saying he thought the public should give Nigel Farage “a chance”.Describing him as Rod the Prod, Ó hAnnaidh said: “I mean, the man’s older than Israel.”Paloma Faith, the musician and public speaker, was in the crowd for Kneecap’s performance.She told the Guardian: “A lot of people are now being demonised because there’s such a fear of terrorism. And I understand that fear but I don’t think that Kneecap have anything to do with that. They’re all about the soul and the heart of freedom of people.“I don’t know anyone who likes to see children being killed on such a huge scale for any reason and I think [Kneecap] stand by that. Obviously they come from the perspective of a marginalised community at the hands of British colonialism.”She said artists who speak out on human rights issues were worried about being misquoted by the press or having their words taken out of context at a time when peaceful activists are coming under increasing attack from governments.She added: “Everyone’s a bit scared now. People are going to jail for stuff that isn’t what we perceive as violent. It’s scary times.”It comes after the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said on Monday that the pro-Palestinian campaign group Palestine Actionwould be proscribed under anti-terror laws.If approved in parliament in a vote next week, this would make membership and support of the group illegal and punishable with a prison sentence under anti-terror laws.On stage, Kneecap reiterated their support for the group and band member JJ Ó Dochartaigh, known as DJ Próvaí, wore a Palestine Action T-shirt, underneath a red boiler suit associated with the group as he surfed the crowd.Explore more on these topicsKneecapGlastonbury 2025newsShareReuse this content"

My day at Glastonbury without a phoneNo lineup, no map and no meet-ups with friends: is it possible to survive the festival phone-free?Glastonbury 2025 – live updatesAmmar KaliaSat 28 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 10.54 EDTShareFor someone who gets lost on the way back from a restaurant bathroom, the 364-hectare (900-acre) sprawl of Glastonbury is a navigational nightmare. I’ve been to the festival three times, and between the music and the drinking I’ve always been glued to my phone, risking a rolled ankle as I hurry along, staring at the site map on the app and racing to recorrect my route to the shows. Losing power or losing my phone hasn’t ever seemed an option here. Without it, I would cease to function.But perhaps, at the ripe old age of 31, it is time to face my fears. What would happen if I ditched my phone for the day? Would I perish from boredom or find myself liberated, finally embracing the full freedom of the Glastonbury experience?I feel like a frightened puppy at the start of the day, stowing my phone in my bag and attaching myself to colleagues who can show me around instead. I follow my first benevolent handler to the circus fields to watch a talk – so far, so straightforward. But as I head off to find some water, I momentarily lose my bearings on my way back to the group. I have to remind myself to be more attentive once I’m cast off alone to follow the signs (and the many helpful stewards I ask) to the Pyramid stage. Supergrass are playing and as I watch their skittish set I feel my phone start to buzz. I instinctively reach for it, worrying I’m missing out on group chats or work goings-on, and feel strangely bereft when I realise I have to let it vibrate, ignoring it to focus on the stage.My Glastonbury food odyssey: 10 of the best dishes – whether you’re feeling hungover or healthyRead moreI begin to feel a bit bored – something I haven’t felt since I first had a smartphone to fill every quiet moment with scrolling. I am considering the state of modern boredom when the Spice Girl Mel C walks past. If I’d been staring at my screen, I never would have noticed her. I head over to ask for a selfie before realising I’d need to take my phone out, settling for an awkward wave instead.As the sun reaches a woozy afternoon peak, I reach into my bag and turn the phone off, free now to wander. I soon spot a group dressed as pirates and ask where they’re off to. They hand me a warm bottle of vodka and squash and invite me to tag along. This is their eighth Glastonbury as a group and two of them, Jo and Chris, got engaged here last year. “It’s the most magical place on Earth,” Jo says. “Nothing bad can happen to you, so have fun!”We spend the next few hours together, stumbling past an Elvis impersonator, the millennial rappers Rizzle Kicks and someone in a morph suit singing Frank Sinatra’s My Way on a karaoke machine.As night falls, I find myself alone again, but no longer bored or lonely. Sebastian, a Greenpeace volunteer, spots me scribbling and asks what I’m up to. He tells me he’s been coming since the 1980s. “It’s changed a lot and there’s more of a corporate atmosphere these days,” he says. “But you won’t find a place with more friendly people in the world.”We try to make our way to the hedonistic south-east corner before losing each other in the crowd. Soon, though, the magic of the festival strikes, as I spot a friend from primary school who I haven’t seen in two decades. In a sea of 200,000 people, this meeting feels very unlikely, and as we catch up into the early hours, I realise I would never have found myself here had I followed my phone and had arranged plans.Bleary-eyed, I eventually make the long walk back to the tent. When I wake up and turn on my phone, I realise I missed a meeting with a photographer the day before and an interview for another piece in the afternoon. There are downsides to being uncontactable, but it feels a small price to pay for a revelation: my sense of direction hasn’t improved, but I now feel comfortable with getting lost. Perhaps I’ll leave my phone at home more often.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalFestivalsMusic festivalsMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They played a set on a painstakingly built sound system which had been assembled in a special tent with mycelium-based sound-baffling discs and tweeters hung from the top of the tent.

But despite the in-jokes and commitment to the bit, the music is strong; they deliver a tight, confident performance for the full hour, which frequently climaxes in their frenetic percussive breakdowns. And when the music drops and the audience join in for a full-blown a capella, you know they’re bona fide popstars.”View image in fullscreenFans watching Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso at West Holts stage.View image in fullscreenCa7riel and Paco Amoroso at West Holts stage.

Some fairly eye-popping figures are being bandied about regarding the cost of their set’s staging – which allegedly vastly outweighs the fee the band are being paid – while one dubious online source insists Healy has shaved his head for the occasion. He hasn’t (he appears onstage tonsorially intact), but clearly large sums of money have been spent somewhere along the way.What ensues isn’t quite as complex as their last tour, which featured lead singer Matty Healy eating raw steak, doing push ups, climbing through a television and Prince Andrew’s face appearing on a bank of television screens accompanied by the strains of Mahler’s 5th Symphony. Nevertheless, there are huge video screens everywhere: not just behind the band, but above them and at either side of the stage, and indeed below the actual video screens that Glastonbury traditionally provides. The treadmill that ran across the front of the stage during their 2018 tour – there for Healy to glide around on, something he does with admirable insouciance – makes a reappearance, while, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, the rear half of a car makes an appearance stage right at one point. Healy sings from within it.View image in fullscreenSplitting the G? Matty Healy of the 1975.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThe screens alternately bathe the stage in white or pink light, show Adam Curtis-esque montages of news footage, flash up lyrics as Healy sings them – a good idea in the case of Part of the Band, a song packed with authentically funny lines. But this being the 1975, never a band to miss the opportunity to make a meta point about being in a band, they also flash up critiques of Healy’s lyrics – “MINDLESS HOLLERING” – and more generally, of the 1975 themselves: “They’re essentially making robotic Huey Lewis tunes” is a particularly cutting judgement on the band’s signature synth-heavy, pastel-hued 80s pop-rock-influenced sound. Later, the screens render their lyrics as meaningless gibberish by displaying what it sounds like he’s singing – “oh mah hez smell like chocolate”. And this is done immediately after Healy informs the audience that he’s “the greatest songwriter of my generation … a poet”.“I was only joking,” he adds later, although his talent as a frontman is less open to question: there’s something gripping about the way he switches from straightforward “Glastonbury-are-you-with-us?” enthusiasm to role-playing as a raddled, tormented pop star, pint in one hand, cigarette in the other. He makes earnest pronouncements about the lasting friendships at the centre of the band and is seemingly astonished at the size of the crowd: “Oh Jesus,” he mutters as the lights reveal its full extent, “yeah, it’s normal, it’s fine”. But then, there’ll be arched-eyebrow examinations of his own genius, from posing to dancing with wild enthusiasm.It’s a show that’s frequently strange and self-deprecating – an intriguingly different approach to the business of headlining the world’s biggest music festival – although it runs the risk of the actual music they make getting lost somewhere amid the visual bombardment and commentary. Happily, their set also functions as a reminder that behind all the irony, the 1975 are impressively skilled at the prosaic business of writing songs.View image in fullscreenLove it if we made it … the 1975.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIf You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know) or She’s American have pop-facing melodies strong enough to shine through. The one point where the staging seems to overwhelm the show itself is during a lengthy interlude when the band vanish from the stage entirely and the message “Matty is changing his trousers” flashes on to the screen. It’s a very risky move indeed at a festival where there’s always something else you could be watching: a minor exodus duly takes place in the audience. But when they return they start rolling out the big hits: It’s Not Living (If It’s Not With You), Sex, Love It If We Made It’s dense parade of millennial angst, the gleaming pop of The Sound. It ends with About You’s appropriately epic balladry, and the members of the 1975 embracing each other, apparently genuinely emotional: a straightforward conclusion to a bold, experimental, occasionally confounding, but ultimately hugely impressive performance.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025The 1975reviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m a character. Shit is thrown on stage all the time. If I’m supposed to know every fucking thing that’s thrown on stage, I’d be in Mensa, Jesus Christ.”He added: “I don’t know every proscribed organisation – I’ve got enough shit to worry about up there. I’m thinking about my next lyric, my next joke, the next drop of a beat.”The set also comes after 30 music executives signed a secret letter, which was leaked by the DJ Toddla T, attempting to get the Belfast artists pulled from the lineup.In response, more than 100 popular musicians signed a public letter in support of the group, including Massive Attack, Pulp, Fontaines DC, Thin Lizzy, Idles, Paul Weller, this year’s Mercury Prize winners English Teacher and the BBC radio DJ Annie Mac.Ó hAnnaidh said: “The fact that the letter was leaked changes things. And I hope that these people regret it. I think they’re already starting to.”The trio are also backed by Glastonbury’s founder, Michael Eavis, and his daughter, Emily, who has taken over the running of the festival in recent years. Shetold the BBC: “There have been a lot of really heated topics this year, but we remain a platform for many, many artists from all over the world and, you know, everyone is welcome here.”View image in fullscreenA festivalgoer wearing a tricolour balaclava similar to the one worn by the rapper DJ Próvaí.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThe crowd is expected to be heaving at the West Holts, one of the site’s smaller main stages, which may pose a challenge for Glastonbury organisers, who have previously been accused of allowing potentially unsafe overcrowding when popular acts have been scheduled to play smaller stages and tents.The band are also likely to be giving the BBC a headache, as the organisation attempts to meet impartiality guidelines while anticipating similar scenes to Kneecap’s Coachella performance in April, when “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people” was displayed on screens and the group led crowds in chants of “Free, free Palestine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Monkeys ran ahead, gorillas bounded behind and bringing up the rear were a pair of handsome, ambling giraffes. Down Greek Street they marched, past pubs and cafes, resulting in an actual zebra crossing as the pack moved across Cambridge Circus, passing in front of bemused drivers, and on through lanes of shoppers in Covent Garden.This was central London on late Friday afternoon: streets overrun not by tourists but byThe Herds, a staggeringly ambitious public art project. In April, a menagerie of lifesize puppet animals began a 20,000km route from the Congo Basin to the Arctic Circle, signifying the displacement of animals and humans caused by the climate crisis. This weekend they are in London; next week they travel north for the Manchester international festival. I spent an hour following the herd on their journey from Soho to Somerset House, during which the puppets either joined in a series of performances – or watched them along with the rest of us.View image in fullscreenPuppeteers take the animals for a run near Tower Bridge on Friday morning before heading to the West End.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockFirst up, the animals (made by the South African collectiveUkwanda) circled the sundial pillar at Seven Dials during a performance of When I Grow Up from Matilda, the musical hit at the Cambridge theatre opposite. An anthem from one of London’s most popular shows, it served as more than just a quick crowd pleaser as it fitted the future-facing project. Watching them brought to mind Greta Thunberg’s speech at the UN climate summit in 2019: “The eyes of all future generations are upon you.”There was humour in seeing the giraffes amid the trees of Covent Garden, with the musical’s lyrics about growing “tall enough to reach the branches”. But during London’s sustainedheatwaveit was disquieting, too, to hear the lines: “I will spend all day just lying in the sun / And I won’t burn cause I’ll be all grown up.”View image in fullscreenThe puppets pass Covent Garden tube station.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockApproaching the market, an area traditionally popular with acrobats, magicians and mimes, the puppets rested before a particularly illustrious street performer:Juliet Stevenson, who has a long history of raising climate awareness. Evoking a kind of animal whisperer, Stevenson stroked one of the creatures tenderly while giving a speech, delivered as if amid dystopia, about trees that lost their will, animals “screaming their pain” and “a desert forming inside me and outside”.We walked on and, within the crowd, a woman discussed the puppets with her child: how thirsty and dry the animals looked, with their corrugated cardboard bodies. The design, with material fraying and the inner frames exposed in places, makes them seem fragile despite their robustness. Another crowd member waved her family’s own homemade turtle, recycled from similar materials. In such close quarters, you could feel the strain on the puppeteers and their skill at bringing the creatures to life, not just through movements but vocal exhalations too. The project smartly mirrors the importance of collective action: three people control each gorilla, another trio handle each giraffe (two from beneath supporting the body and one with a pole operating the head). I’ve always loved watching the care in the eyes of performers when they are manipulating puppets – here, it was often incredibly moving to witness.View image in fullscreenThe puppets pause during a performance at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe creatures would momentarily pause, survey their surroundings, rise on their back feet and stampede. Throughout the hour, this herd grew as more passersby joined in. “We are the ones we’ve been waiting for,” actor Chipo Chung told the crowd in a speech beside the market before the journey snaked around the corner and stopped outside theRoyal Opera Housewhere tenor Ryan Vaughan Davies appeared on the balcony to sing from The Magic Flute. The giraffes leaned in to listen.This West End leg of the journey was co-curated by Amir Nizar Zuabi (artistic director of The Herds) and theatre and opera director Joe Hill-Gibbins, who staged a particularly muddy version ofA Midsummer Night’s Dreamat the Young Vic in 2017. (That venue’s former artistic director, David Lan, is one of the chief producers on The Herds.) Shakespeare’s “forgeries of jealousy” speech, increasingly used to reflect our own climate disruption, was performed by Zubin Varla as Oberon and Hattie Morahan as Titania. (A gorilla rested its paws on Varla; a monkey nuzzled Morahan.)View image in fullscreenCollective action … The Herds.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe route ended in the courtyard of Somerset House, with blistering drumming by Andy Gangadeen who was circled by the animals. The creatures were laid to rest in the scorching heat, their fragmented design now disturbingly evoking carcasses.‘Get ready to sweat!’ The animal mega-marathon stampeding from the Congo to the ArcticRead moreOutdoor art disruptions, like the journey of the puppet pachyderm and giant friend inThe Sultan’s Elephantby Royal de Luxe in London in 2006, usually leave joy in their wake. After such performances, the spaces feel charged with a sense of wonder at the memory. Leaving The Herds and retracing the animals’ route back through to Soho, I felt anguish at their absence but a galvanising urge that brought me back toMatilda’s defiant lyrics. Just because we find ourselves in this story, it doesn’t mean that everything is written for us.The Herdsis in London until 29 June, and across Greater Manchester 3-5 July, as part ofManchester international festival.

But behind the scenes, he was unravelling into psychosisMichael SegalovSat 28 Jun 2025 06.45 EDTShareFrom the road, it’s barely visible; glimpsed, maybe, if peered at with cheeks pressed against the property’s imposing iron gates. There is otherwise little out of the ordinary in this quiet Kent corner of London’s affluent commuter belt – St Michael’s has a village hall, a country club, a farm shop. But at the end of a snaking, hedge-lined driveway is an incongruous home: a sprawling, six-bedroom neo-Georgian mansion, almost every inch, inside and out, covered in the trademark black-on-white line drawings of its owner, Mr Doodle, the 31-year-old artist Sam Cox.A car honks twice behind me. A woman in her 80s steps out. “It’s mindblowing, isn’t it?” Sam’s grandmother Sue says, eyebrows aloft. “And terribly … different.” The gates ahead buzz open. “Take it slowly,” she offers, by way of warning. “You’ll want to give your eyes a few minutes to adjust.”Corner turned, the house comes into unobstructed view: an imposing modern manor enveloped floor to roof in lines, curves and cartoon-ish characters. All exterior walls are doodled over: statues, plant pots, phone box, chimney, guttering and window sashes, too. Standing in the doodled doorway to greet me are Sam and his artist wife Alena, 35, both in full doodle dress-up. “I sometimes say it’s like graffiti spaghetti,” Sam says of his style, inviting me to step over the doodled doormat. “It’s influenced by early-era New York street art, but intertwined, overlapping and cartoonish.” Six-foot-something Sam is gentle and softly spoken – most animated when talking about his work.He’s joined by younger brother Tom – now Sam’s manager – and mum Andrea. Dad Neill and grandpa David are also on the payroll, today tasked with entertaining Sam and Alena’s two-year-old son Alfie. Having first found success in viral videos during the late 2010s, Sam’s various artistic ventures now earn significant sums: during one nine-month period in 2020, his artwork racked up $4.7m in sales – one piece fetched nearly $1m. That year, he was the world’s fifth most successful artist aged under 40 at auction.Sam purchased his St Michael’s property for £1.35m in 2019. Its evolution from rural residence to live-in illustrated installation was the realisation of an ambition held for a decade. “I must have been 15 when I first planned it,” he says. “I was set a project called Obsession by my graphics teacher. He wanted me to document my fixation with drawing. I doodled on some furniture, clothes and my childhood bedroom.”“I was fine with that,” Andrea interjects, as we step into the kitchen: doodled oven, doodled taster, doodled extractor fan. “He also asked to do the family bathroom. That was a no.”“The obvious next step was a whole house,” Sam says. “It was always a target in my head.”In December 2019, the purchase complete, Sam’s uncle Graham Wells – a builder – was tasked with stripping the house back to its bones. Every surface, inside and out, was painted white – a nearly 5,000 sq ft blank canvas. It took a little over two years, all in, for Sam to decorate the house in its entirety: spray paint on the outside, black acrylic and bingo markers indoors. The result is a truly transfixing optical overload.View image in fullscreen‘A whole house was always a target in my head’: Cox’s home.Photograph: Julian Anderson/The GuardianWe all settle on the doodled sofas. His parents’ house – where Sam was raised – is a short walk through the village. “I tried to talk him out of it at first,” Andrea says, sipping from her doodled teacup. “We looked around with the last owners who asked if Sam was going to doodle it. No, he told them. I’m not sure it would have been sold to him if they’d known. For the exterior, I came up with all sorts of alternative suggestions. Why not try projections? Then you could switch it off.” Sam was having none of it. “We’ve had no complaints from the neighbours. I know it was your dream,” she glances over at her adult child, “but it was like being in a nightmare at the time.”Sam, who is listening quietly, fidgets his fingers. To the millions of followers who watched online, the house’s transformation was a triumph. Set to jaunty music,one time-lapse victory videodocumenting his efforts has been watched someseven million times. What it fails to capture is the devastating toll of the undertaking, now explored in a feature-length documentary due to air on Channel 4. “Midway through the project,” Sam says, “I had a psychotic episode …”Andrea puts it bluntly: “At one stage, we were worried Sam was going to doodle himself to death.”The drawing started when Sam was a toddler. “He drew when he was small,” Andrea says, “but, we thought, so do all children. The older he got, the more he doodled. Comics and cartoons first, then video games became his inspiration. By his early teens, drawing was pretty much all he did.” Occasionally, she felt creeping concern .“I’d say, ‘Sam, are you sure you don’t want to go outside for a bit?’ But he was just happy, hurting nobody. Evenings, weekends, any spare time - it was constant.” Socialising seemed of little interest. At night, he could be found doodling under the duvet. “We’d be watching TV, and I’d turn to see him face-down in a page.”“It was a fun place to disappear into,” Sam explains. “I’d get stacks of A4 printer paper from the supermarket and fill up every page.” All through school, this carried on, encouraged by graphics teacher Morgan Davies, now Mr Doodle Inc’s creative director. “Morgan introduced me to graffiti, and artists like Keith Haring, Yayoi Kusama and Jean Dubuffet.” Aged 15, there was an evolution in his artwork: “What poured on to the page changed from drawings that looked like characters from the Simpsons into what it is today.”Sam kept it up while studying illustration at the University of the West of England. Friends would often find him doodling in the corners of pubs and clubs. Fuelled by energy drinks, he’d draw for 16 hours a day, sometimes more, as his obsession deepened. “Every day I’d wake up and want to draw,” Sam says. “Anything else was an inconvenience.”“Must not sleep” became a mantra, scrawled across notebooks – wasted doodle-able hours. During his student days, Sam started to experiment with the idea of an artistic alter ego – a character to accompany his work. He turned up to give a third-year presentation in a fully doodled suit, replete with doodled accessories (fedora, briefcase), announcing he was The Doodle Man from Doodle Land. Friends accepted their quirky mate; others found the vibe … unusual.The Mr Doodle moniker stuck. Sam began to inhabit this kooky persona with increasing regularity. “I was already handing out Mr Doodle business cards on the street, leaving them on train seats, and throwing them out of my university flat window to try to generate attention. Dressing up and becoming this character felt a natural extension to getting myself out there: a backstory and narrative formed.”I thought I’d live here as Mr Doodle. Never seen out of clothes and character. The boundaries between me and him blurredIn early YouTube videos, Sam would traverse the streets of Bristol in doodled clothes looking to use his drawings as currency: “I’d try to trade them for stationery, bus rides, a portion of fish and chips. Mr Doodle gave me confidence.”“It offered him a mask, we thought at the time: a way of being extroverted that didn’t always come naturally,” Andrea says. She wasn’t thrilled by his antics; certainly, she resented being asked to film him bouncing around their garden in a doodle bunny costume. “Only, how could I tell him to stop, when it made him happy?”After graduating in 2015, Sam set up a studio in his parents’ garage. Commissions started small: office walls, street murals. Then, in 2017, while drawing in an east London pop-up shop, a passerby filmed him at work. That recording ended up going viral on Facebook, and his online influence started to snowball: hundreds of thousands of followers flocked to his accounts. Lucrative brand collaborations followed: Samsung, Disney, Red Bull, Fendi. At auction, his canvases started fetching tens of thousands.An admirer of Sam’s work, Ukrainian-born Alena – then living in Kyiv – got in touch, and the pair started talking. There were visits to their respective countries, and the relationship got serious.View image in fullscreenCox with his mother Andrea and wife Alena in the doodled house.Photograph: Julian Anderson/The GuardianAt the time, Sam oversaw every aspect of his booming business – in part down to his determination to pour every penny into savings, eyes firmly on the doodle-house prize. Sam was stretched beyond his limits: less sleep, more drawing, travelling to Bangkok, Tokyo, Seoul for commissions. He also spent extended periods inhabiting his alter ego, his longest drawing marathon lasting 36-plus hours. That’s when he got the keys to this house. “I thought I would live here as Mr Doodle,” he says, “never seen out of the clothes and character. The boundaries between me and him would blur.”Work started in February 2020. Those first few weeks Sam felt unwell. “It was physical, initially,” he explains. “Like I had the flu: cloudy head; I was slow to respond in conversation and couldn’t keep up with TV.” A cold, Sam thought. Severe stress, maybe. “I had weird daydreams, hallucinations, panic attacks …”Once, when Alena was visiting, the pair got an early night. “As Alena was winding down,” Sam says, “I turned to her and said: ‘I’m really worried if I go to sleep I’ll never wake up.’” She tried to calm and console him.“I’d never seen Sam cry before,” she says, “but I woke up in the night and he was still awake, sitting up, in floods of tears, distraught. Then it escalated quickly.”Sam was driven to A&E, “convinced he had dementia”, Andrea explains. “He insisted on saying goodbye to us all, certain he wouldn’t survive until morning.” A series of emergency brain scans found nothing. A woman in the waiting room kept catching Andrea’s eye. “This lady was marching around erratically, shouting about the Bible.” It wound up an anxious Andrea. “For God’s sake, I thought, will you just sit down? I was entirely unaware that the next day, that would be my son.” A psychiatrist assessed Sam. His suggestion: take him home and keep an eye on him.Back at his parents’ house, Sam wouldn’t settle. “There was a look in his eyes,” Alena says. “It wasn’t the Sam I knew in there.”Sam nods: “The only way I can describe it is that I didn’t know who or where I was.”His parents reverted to basic instincts. He climbed into their bed and they held him tight, stroked his hair, and encouraged slow, deep breaths. They told him he was loved. “But he wasn’t having any of it.” Andrea shakes her head. “He jumped up and started shouting out the windows and yelling down the stairs. All sorts of nonsense was coming out of his mouth. There was no reasoning with him. So Neill took him back to hospital.”This time, the psychiatrist was clear: Sam needed to be sectioned. “They were trying to sedate him,” Andrea continues, “but Sam was so manic that the drugs didn’t have an effect. He was convinced his brain was inside the heart monitor, that people were trying to kill him, and that he was no longer Sam. He was running through the corridors shouting: ‘I’m Mr Doodle, and I need help.’ It was as if someone else was inside him, and had taken over his body. Like he was possessed.” He was diagnosed as havinga psychotic episode and psychosis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He knows he was taken to an ambulance. “I was convinced the paramedic was my friend Steve, and kept trying to escape, running around the hospital car park. It was like I’d entered this alternative, Matrix world that I’d invented in my head.”Eventually, he was corralled into a psychiatric ward in Canterbury, where his psychosis worsened. The next six weeks were a blur: two weeks at one secure unit, then a month at another. “I wasn’t able to understand who or what was in front of me.” He became conspiratorial, believing meals and medication were laced with poison. He was consumed by religious and spiritual delusion. “I believed I was connected to God. That if I breathed deeply, I could control things. If I tapped my right foot, I’d send someone to heaven, or my left foot could send someone to hell. I thought screaming certain words gave me specific powers.” He looks to the family now sitting around him. “And I know I said the worst things to all of them.”Sam believed he had become the character he’d constructed. On one visit, he turned to Alena and announced, “Sam is dead, call me Mr Doodle now.”View image in fullscreenA prototype for a Mr Doodle doll.Photograph: Julian Anderson/The GuardianArt was intertwined with his psychosis; at times, it was the only connection the family found to the Sam they knew. “I wanted to draw on the hospital walls,” says Sam, which wasn’t exactly encouraged. “They’d put me in a confined room, and I’d draw on the walls in soup and bread. People coming and going seemed, to me, to be artists I’d been inspired by.” His senses were heightened. “Colours were so intense; if I heard music, it would feel like my whole body was vibrating.” On the psychiatric ward, Sam’s doodling remained relentless. He still has the sketchbooks. “If I drew something square or angular, it was an evil character. Circular, bouncy shapes were happy and angelic. There are lots of notes about God and religion scattered through.It was like I was living in Doodle Land, and I didn’t know how to get back again.”When doctors discharged Sam in April 2020, he was still unwell. At home, he’d sit, having imagined conversations with Donald Trump and Kanye West. One time, midway through a chat with his mother, Sam declared: “You’re not my mum, you’re Nigel Farage.” It didn’t help that the pandemic was in its early stages. “I was already distrusting of things – then there was talk of this disease. I was convinced it was a plot.”“We could be anywhere,” Andrea expands, “and something would switch: he’d see something not there, or believe something entirely irrational. We’d be quietly watching TV, and Sam would turn around and ask: ‘Why are they talking about me?’ It could take hours to talk him down. We couldn’t even watch David Attenborough – Sam thought the rocks were giving him dirty looks.”Occasionally, flickers of the old Sam returned – initially, in conversation with his grandparents. Over months, these became more regular. He only came off the last of the medication in early 2024.View image in fullscreenCox at work …View image in fullscreenand some of his more colourful doodles. Photographs: Julian Anderson/The GuardianPsychotic episodes can be triggered by substance abuse, sleep deprivation, stress or specific physical conditions. “I didn’t feel stressed at the time,” Sam says. The family doesn’t seem convinced. “But there was definitely too much in my head.” Episodes such as this have no clear end point, and doctors couldn’t guarantee it wouldn’t strike again. Sam was unperturbed and, within weeks, wanted to return to project Doodle House. “I thought you should never draw, never be Mr Doodle again,” Tom says. “That this place would have to be abandoned.”“I tried to talk him out of it,” Andrea says. “But he was determined. So we just encouraged him to take it slow, not all day and all night: stop, walk, break, breathe. Alena was here, keeping Sam under control, making sure he took breaks and his tablets.”The pandemic helped, slowing Sam’s other projects. His parents took over the business admin. “Plus, I was sleeping a lot more because of the medication,” he says. “There was no 24 hours of nonstop drawing, as before.” Joey the cockapoo’s arrival was a boon. “I’d stop drawing to take him out for walks.” Soon, Alena was pregnant – another responsibility.The documentary, the family hope, marks an end to this chapter. “Speaking about it has made the whole thing feel more normal for all of us,” Andrea explains. “Before this, I’d never been inside a psychiatric hospital.” The topic feels taboo, perhaps, even in an era of mental health awareness. “When Sam first got ill, I wasn’t telling people – not embarrassed, but I didn’t understand, or know how to explain. Now we just talk about it as if he had appendicitis.”Sam and Alena take me on a tour, past doodled walls, floors and ceilings; lamps, log burner and chandelier; dressing gown and laptop; toilet and bathtub. There’s a doodle garage, complete with doodled Tesla. Dream-themed doodles decorate the bedroom; each of the 2,000 tiles in its en suite bathroom are adorned with appropriately aquatic doodle designs. We step outside, passing the doodle water butt and American yellow school bus, through the evolving sculpture park.In the back corner of the four-acre estate is an imposing, newly constructed modern studio, designed by architect Guy Hollaway. Its exterior is wrapped in metal panels, each with intricate laser-cut doodle shapes. Inside, white double-height walls provide Sam with a blank backdrop to work on. In one corner, floor-to-ceiling racks display his recent works. The smallest among them sells for roughly $80,000. Another corner displays a grid of square drawings, each with crisscross coloured lines. It’s a new style he’s experimenting with, inspired by the NHS-issue felt-tip pens he relied on while hospitalised.View image in fullscreen‘When we first started,’ Alena says, ‘I couldn’t imagine living there …View image in fullscreenNow it’s home.’View image in fullscreenPhotographs: Julian Anderson/The GuardianThe studio is a flurry of activity: Tom is taking a phone call, Alena moves materials around. Photographs are being taken. In the corner, at a table, Sam sits, thick, black pen in hand, entirely at ease. Smooth, freeform lines fill up the white page. Swoop, circle, dot dot dot. Up to the corner, looping down. Squiggle, glide, squiggle.Alena perches next to me. “The first time we met,” she tells me, “Sam told me this was his dream: to buy the big house, and to doodle it. I knew what I was signing up for.” I’m not convinced that grandma Sue was right, I say: my eyes haven’t yet adjusted. “When we first started,” Alena replies, “I couldn’t imagine living there. It was so sterile. But I started to make it homely, with little softening details. Now it’s home. It’s not too much for me, honestly, any of this. Without doodles, Sam and I would never have met. I find them comforting.”“When I start drawing,” Sam says, “I don’t think before shapes and characters just merge into something. I enjoy the physical feeling of moving the pen along the paper – it’s like that sensation of spreading soft butter on toast. It just feels satisfying. The noise that it makes. I feel content in myself when I do it, emotionally. It’s when I’m happiest. Seeing the work made in front of me is a high – it’s that feeling I’m chasing each time I draw. This itch that’s satisfied by seeing work appearing in front of me.” He still feels that intense pull to draw: “I don’t get lost in it now, but left to my own devices, I could do this for ever”The Trouble with Mr Doodleairs on Channel 4 on9 July at 10pm.Explore more on these topicsArtMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The surge in sales pushed UK fiction revenue above £1bn for the first time.View image in fullscreenCustomers at Saucy Books in Notting Hill, which has turned into a meeting spot for like-minded book lovers.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“The popularity of the store speaks for itself,” says Sarah Maxwell, the founder of Saucy Books. “We even had to ticket our first week and give time slots to customers.”But she believes sexism is keeping the genre from the mainstream. “There’s so much snobbery and bias,” Maxwell says. “People think it’s less than or low quality, which is not true at all. These are all very high quality authors and high quality stories.“I think there’s an inherent misogyny around it. A lot of the time, the sorts of things that women like across arts and culture tends to get discounted. These books are about the female perspective and female gaze when most media is through the male gaze.Romantasy and BookTok driving a huge rise in science fiction and fantasy salesRead more“That’s why I have a smut hut, because I feel like we need to reclaim some of these words.”The smut hut, a space dedicated to erotic titles, sits in the corner, adorned with ornaments such as whipped suncream, chapstick and a placard reading “Traders Dicks”. It’s seems less like a bookstore and more a community centre.During the Guardian’s visit on Thursday afternoon, dozens of women filter through the shop, browsing titles and starting conversations about their favourite authors. Most of them have learned about the store through TikTok.View image in fullscreenThe smut hut at Saucy Books, a space dedicated to erotic titles.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianOne customer is browsing the shelves with her mother. She says she can get through a novel in under three hours, and last year she read 300 books.Deck chairs and a tiki parasol adorn the store’s perimeter, while inside brightly painted shelves hold up titles such as Swept Away, The Unhoneymooners and The Friendship Fling.“I was really surprised that a shop like this didn’t already exist,” says Maxwell, a creative strategist and former tech executive from LA. “When I went to find books of OG romance writers, I couldn’t find any of them in-store. It made me quite angry. You have these amazing authors, who carry the publishing industry – 20% of fiction sales is romance books – and they’re getting no shelf space whatsoever. I felt like I needed to do something.”A genre of swords and soulmates: the rise and rise of ‘romantasy’ novelsRead moreMany contemporary romance books are marketed under tropes such as “enemies to lovers”, “forbidden love” and “second chance romance”. The “romantasy” genre (a blend of romance and fantasy) is a constant fixture on bestseller lists, largely due to the dedicated following it has gained on TikTok.Series such as Rebecca Yarros’s Fourth Wing and Sarah J Maas’s A Court of Thorns and Roses (known by fans as Acotar) feature female protagonists entering high-stakes relationships in magical worlds.Jessica Roberts, a shop assistant at Saucy Books, has noticed that the current craze is for a trip to the wild west. “Cowboy romances are very popular right now. Two girls came in their cowboy boots to purchase them yesterday,” she says.Among those visiting the store on Thursday are Rebecca Pollard and Haley Page from New York. “I got [Haley] all the Acotar books, I think they’re the best way to start. They’re like a gateway drug into becoming a psycho,” Pollard laughs.“I feel like a cult leader. I have a library at my house, and when my friends call me I’m like, ‘what do you need? I’ve got it’. People are like, ‘I’m so happy it’s books for you and not drugs, because you’re such a pusher’.”View image in fullscreenHaley Page, left, and Rebecca Pollard. Pollard bought Page Sarah J Maas’s Acotar series, which she says is the best way to get into the romantasy genre.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianPage says: “I’m a very hard sell, but she tells me something and I will listen. I’m so excited to read these, I’m taking them to Mykonos tonight. I’m going to be at the beach with my new book boyfriend, and I’ll be calling Rebecca every second like ‘oh my god’.”Pollard says she’s been waiting desperately for the sixth book in the Acotar series. “I would do anything to become invisible and just go and check Sarah J Maas’s laptop.”And she thumbs her nose at the mainstream responses to the genre.“I get really defensive when people use derogatory terms. Don’t call it fairy porn until you’ve read it, because you have to wait 380 pages for a kiss in the second book of Acotar. Why is it smut, because it’s centred around female pleasure?

The volume was set to near-silence – my dad, asleep in another room, had schizophrenia and frontal lobe syndrome, and I didn’t want to wake him. Then, like some divine interruption to the endless blur of news and repeats, I stumbled acrossBuffy the Vampire Slayer. The show may have been barely audible, but it hit me like a lightning bolt.Before Buffy, life was like a pressure cooker. I secretly yearned for a more alternative lifestyle, but even wearing jeans would have been a big deal in my family. I had an assisted place at a private school as my parents were quite poor. Mum would say: “If you don’t study, we’ll have to put you in the other school, and you’ll just get beaten up.” It sounds like fear-mongering, but she was right: the students in the local school were known to beat Pakistani people up every Shrove Tuesday. So I dedicated my life to working hard.After Buffy, the foundations of my world imploded. I made a secret Myspace account, and got into metal bands such as Kittie and Murderdolls. I started wearing lipstick and eyeliner, got tattoos and bought a PVC skirt on eBay. For a while I felt like two people: I was the same old Sofia in the week, but on a Saturday I’d step into my new identity and hang out on Goth Green – a patch of grass near a couple of shops selling alternative music and clothes.As a young Punjabi person with conservative Pakistani roots, my future felt predetermined and grim. But Buffy cracked open my understanding of feminism: suddenly it wasn’t just some abstract, academic concept; it was cool and empowering. For Buffy, defeating the series’ villain, the Master, seemed impossible, but she always kept going.I remembered how Buffy always got back up, no matter how broken she wasHer resilience became a lifeline, especially during one particularly dark incident. It was my cousin’s wedding, and I wore a black sari – an incredibly liberating act for me at the time. A family member came to our house afterwards: he was angry, and, as well as not approving of my clothes, claimed I’d spoken to him disrespectfully. After a heated argument, he beat me up. I remembered how Buffy always got back up, no matter how broken she was. That image of defiance really stuck with me in that moment; it gave me the strength to get back on my feet.Because my dad was ill, we had a lot of people, mostly men, visit our house and try to tell me what to do with my life. They said I should go to Pakistan and have an arranged marriage. Witnessing Buffy’s independence made me realise I didn’t have to follow a prescribed path. Instead, I took the leap and did an art foundation at Newcastle College, which was where I found a new community. Naturally, Mum found it hard to accept that her daughter was an art student – so much so she told people I was studying geography.I’m glad to say that she came around eventually. At first, she called Buffy “rubbish” in Punjabi, and said what I was going through was just a phase. Thanks to some encouragement from my cousins, she started to realise the show wasn’t too much of a leap from the south Asian dramas on Zee TV that she loved. She even got so at ease with my aesthetic that she bought me silver flame New Rock boots for my birthday from one of the Goth Green shops.Decades later, I now work as a freelance multidisciplinary artist. I’d never have guessed that a TV show would have been the catalyst that propelled me here. The most unexpected twist of all: Buffy made my mum go to Goth Green.Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Ticketmaster have since informed customers that the event will no longer go ahead as planned and they will be refunded.An online campaign group, No Stage for Abusers, called on the Brighton Centre and Brighton and Hove city council, which owns the venue, to cancel the performance.Four women had sued Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, accusing him of rape, sexual assault and bodily harm. However, after a year-long investigation, the case against him wasdropped in January.Prosecutors in California found that the statute of limitations had been exceeded and argued they would not be able to bring charges that prove Warner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.The identities of the women were not revealed, but Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, who sued Warner in a case that has now been settled, stated that she was part of the criminal investigation.Marilyn Manson: Unmasked review – should a tour bus really need the age of consent pinned to the wall?Read moreIn 2021, Manson’s former fiancee, the Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, also named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Warner has dismissed the allegations as “falsehoods”.Last week, Green Party MPSiân Berryexpressed her concerns about Warner’s scheduled performance in her constituency in Brighton, writing anopen letterto the leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Bella Sankey.In Berry’s letter, which was co-signed by a host of groups and the University of Sussex students’ union, she made the case for cancelling the concert, saying it went against “the city’s well-renowned values”.Berry wrote: “Many survivors in Brighton and Hove, and organisations supporting them, will have serious concerns about this booking and its wider impact on other people visiting the city centre, local residents and the wider community.”She added: “The council has a responsibility to take action where there are risks of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.”Supporters of Warner point out that Warner has not been found guilty of allegations against him. Others said the decision infringes on freedom of speech.One person told The Argus: “This is cancel culture, nothing more, and it’ll backfire when artists don’t add a Brighton and Hove date to their tours and stick to London, which incidentally hasn’t bannedMarilyn Mansonfrom their city.”Explore more on these topicsMarilyn MansonBrightonSiân BerrynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s just the medicineRhik SamadderSat 28 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTShareIlove watching real-life siblings on-screen. They bring a knotted history to every interaction, the way they look at one another, or don’t. They may love each other; they’re definitely stuck with each other. Daisy May and Charlie Cooper were the last to bottle such contradiction; I’m delighted we now haveSuch Brave Girls(BBC One, Wednesday 2 July, 11.40pm), returning for a second series, in which creator Kat Sadler stars alongside her sister Lizzie Davidson. Cattier than Longleat, it features some of the most savage writing on TV, and makes me yowl with pleasure.It’s about traumatised women making terrible choices. Bear with. The ever-excellent Louise Brealey plays Deb, whose husband abandoned his family 10 years ago after popping to the shop for teabags. In financial trouble, she spends her time trying to lock down relations with drippy, slippery widower Dev, played by Paul Bazely, explicitly for his big house. Single-mindedness has made her grim, grasping and less maternal than a stressed hamster. Bad news for daughters Josie and Billie, who give off the stench of joint captivity, and have split into twin coping strategies: one depressed and passive, the other overconfident, bullish and equally lost.There are many jokes about sex, all three women wildly pursuing or running away from ludicrous men. But its most adult theme is desperation, which every character is thinly masking. One of the funniest running jokes is the way Deb and Billie dismiss the “haunting presence” of Josie. Deb has no time for her depressed daughter’s big feelings, interest in art or grapples with lesbianism. Life is about finding a man and moving in with him. She urges her to “Remember the family crest! Ignore, repress, forget.”Scowling harder than Kanye West, Davidson gets to spit the most deliciously vicious lines. “She only shaves one leg,” she hisses of an unmarried aunt, “so when she sleeps on her side she can pretend a man is spooning her.” She’s no fan of Josie’s rare smile, either. “Your mouth’s doing the right thing, but your eyes are calling Samaritans.” Having turned her obsessive attention away from drug-dealing Nicky, she’s now chasing a much older, married man. (They meet in the mornings, as he’s too tired to get an erection at night.) “There’s nothing wrong with having an affair, right?’ she asks, a shade of self-awareness crossing her face. “I honestly think it might be the most feminist thing you can do,” responds Josie.View image in fullscreen‘Your mouth’s smiling, but your eyes are calling Samaritans’… Davidson with Louise Brealey as Deb and Kat Sadler as Josie in Such Brave Girls.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Various Artists LimitedThefirst seriesannounced Sadler as a brilliant voice. Her writing pitilessly skewers the discourse around pop-feminism, queerness, sexuality and mental health. Pitiless does not mean unempathetic – the show was born of personal experience. During lockdown, Sadler revealed to Davidson that she’d spent time on a psych ward after twice trying to kill herself, and her sister admitted she was £20,000 in debt. They found themselves laughing. If you’re in a raw place, the fun they have with self-harm, workplace shooting, dissociation and the self-delusion required to live a lie until you die, may be too much. For most of us, it’s the medicine.Directed by Simon Bird ofThe Inbetweeners, and co-produced by A24, there’s big underwriting, too. The first series saw a few mannered performances from the supporting cast, but these have settled in now. Its female trinity remain a scream, as the story tacks farcical in ways I won’t spoil here. Let’s just say they’re riding that family crest like a surfboard into disaster.Dark comedy is a phrase overused, and perhaps meaningless. Granted, you have to be the kind of person who finds a mother warning her daughter, “Try not to poison this family with your personality” funny to get Such Brave Girls. I’d argue that is the central brain-stem of the British psyche. There are strains of Peep Show, Julia Davies, Sharon Horgan and Fleabag. Like them, the show has no message other than that life is absurd, pain inevitable and people ridiculous. That makes it more clear-sighted and honest than any show telling us what to think. And you get sisters tearing strips off each other. Truly, there is eloquence in blood.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherTV comedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Arifa Akbar on a lifetime of insomnia – and a possible cureFrom Van Gogh’s starry skies to the nocturnal workings of Louise Bourgeois and Patricia Highsmith, sleepless nights have long inspired heightened creativity. Could those artistic impulses actually help us to sleep?Arifa AkbarSat 28 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareIcan’t remember when I first stopped sleeping soundly. Maybe as a child, in the bedroom I initially shared with my brother, Tariq. I would wait for his breathing to quieten, then strain to listen beyond our room in the hope of being the last one awake, and feel myself expanding into the liberating space and solitude. By my early 20s, that childhood game of holding on to wakefulness while others slept began playing out against my will. Sound seemed to be the trigger. It was as if the silence I had tuned into as a child was now a requirement for sleep. Any sound was noise: the burr of the TV from next door, the ticking of a clock in another room. When one layer of sound reduced its volume, another rose from beneath it, each intrusive and underscored by my own unending thoughts. Noise blaring from without and within, until I felt too tired to sleep.The artist Louise Bourgeois suffered a bad bout of insomnia in the 1990s, during which she created a series of drawings. Among them is an image that features musical notes in red ink, zigzagging across a sheet of paper. They look like the jagged score of an ECG graph that has recorded an alarmingly arrhythmic heartbeat. It sums up the torment of my insomnia: there is a raised heartbeat in every sound.View image in fullscreenVan Gogh’s The Starry Night, 1889.Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyI have been told that to overcome an inability to sleep you must find its root cause, but this quest for an original impetus is guesswork. Was it self-inflicted in childhood, or does it track further back than that, to infancy, to the womb, to genetics? One starting point is Professor Derk-Jan Dijk’s view of a “sleep personality”, and the idea that childhood sleep habits can be the same later in life. I was born in London, but my family moved to Lahore when I was three years old, before returning to the UK a couple of years later. In Pakistan, there was vigorous, carefree slumber, on the roof of the house on the hottest nights, with the extended family in close proximity. It was sleep as communal ritual. Then the standstill after lunch when everyone lay down again in siesta. I remember my sister, Fauzia, sleeping beside me on these afternoons. There was no hint of insomnia until the move back to Britain when we found ourselves homeless, living in a disused building in north London for a while, crammed into a single room, before moving into a council flat.In light of Dijk’s words, I see how my insomnia might be a reaction against this early chaos, along with my exacting need for order and silence in adulthood, but that is my own armchair analysis. There are so many gaps in sleep science that I wonder if sleep is by its nature too mysterious to systematise.If science can’t explain the grey areas around sleep, maybe art can shed a light. It is surprising, given the painting’s sense of joyous night-time, that Van Gogh painted his post-impressionist masterpiece The Starry Night in the midst of depression, after being admitted to an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the summer of 1889. A year before, in a letter dated 16 September 1888, Vincent tells his brother, Theo, that he is doing six to 12 hours of non-stop work, often at night, followed by 12 hours of sleep. By the following year he was in the grip of a “FEARSOME” insomnia. On 9 January 1889, weeks after slicing part of his ear off in a high state of anxiety, he writes to Theo about his torment. He is fighting sleeplessness with a “very, very strong dose of camphor” on his pillow and mattress, he says, and he hopes it will bring an end to the insomnia. “I dare to believe that it won’t recur.” I read Van Gogh’s hope as optimistic desperation. In my case, it has always returned. Yet, even in his “insensible” state, Vincent tells Theo that he is reflecting on the work of Degas, Gauguin and his own art practice; he continues to think, paint, write letters, with the insomnia existing alongside his productivity.View image in fullscreenOne of Louise Bourgeois’s Insomnia Drawings (1994-1995).Photograph: © The Easton Foundation / Licensed by DACS, LondonThe glittering night sky Van Gogh imagines beyond the confines of his asylum is an embodiment of the way we so often think of the gifted artist at night: synapses fizzing, imagination touched by divinity, a compulsively unsleeping genius channelling a heightened state of buoyant creativity. Countless artists and writers have elected to work after dark, from Toulouse-Lautrec, documenting night revelries at the Moulin Rouge, to Franz Kafka, Philip Guston and Patricia Highsmith. Musicians, too: theRolling Stones’ all-night jamin the lead-up to their appearance at Knebworth in 1976, for instance; or Prince, whose recording sessions could last across a continuous 24 hours. Certainly, if Van Gogh still suffered from insomnia when he was painting The Starry Night, it makes sleeplessness seem beatific – a curse turned gift.There is none of this buoyancy in Louise Bourgeois’s night scribblings. She suffered from sleeplessness throughout her life but faced a particularly debilitating bout of night-time anxiety between 1994 and 1995, during which time she made her Insomnia Drawings series. “It is conquerable,” she said, and for her it was conquered, by filling page after page of a drawing diary with deliriously repeated doodles and circles within circles, a mess of scribbles that look like screams on paper. They are so different from the enormous stainless steel, bronze and marble spiders and other caged sculptures for which Bourgeois is better known, but I feel a peculiar kind of excitement upon seeing these images, with their agitating boredom and alertness, side by side.The artist Lee Krasner also painted her way through chronic insomnia, around the time her mother and then her husband, the painter Jackson Pollock, died – the latter in a drink-driving car crash in 1956, with his lover Ruth Kligman, who survived, in the seat beside him. Krasner’s Night Journeys series has some similarities to Bourgeois’s drawings, featuring repeating, abstract patterns, but washed in an earthy sepia brown. The patterns are insect-like, as if ants are crawling across the retina. I am inspired by the images. Rather than seeking escape or avoidance of their sleepless state, Bourgeois and Krasner stare it in the face, and it stares back at them, an abyss of maddening monotony.There has only been one instance in my adult life when sleep became easy. Or rather, it became compulsive – as much as the insomnia was, and perhaps even more disturbing. It happened when Fauzia died in 2016,at the age of 45, of undiagnosed tuberculosis. She had been admitted to hospital with an unknown illness, and lay wired to a ventilator in intensive care. When the hospital called to say she had had a fatal brain haemorrhage one morning, the shock of it was too much to take in. So I began to sleep. No amount was enough and I felt increasingly worried by the long, blank nights, which did not bring relief but became as strangely burdensome as the insomnia had once felt.Haruki Murakami’s novel After Dark features two sisters, the younger, Mari, mourning the older sibling, Eri, who is in a coma-like state. The book takes place over a single night in Tokyo as Mari roams through the city, meeting its nocturnal characters: a trombonist, a Chinese sex worker, the manager of a love hotel. All the while Eri lies in a trapped and mysterious kind of sleep. It might be an undiagnosed illness, a psychological condition or even a radical protest at the world and her place in it – we are never sure.Mari refuses to see her sister as “dead”, even though there seems no prospect of Eri’s waking up. She looks at her sister’s face and thinks that “consciousness just happens to be missing from it at the moment: it may have gone into hiding, but it must certainly be flowing somewhere out of sight, far below the surface, like a vein of water”. This is how I saw Fauzia as she lay in hospital, after her haemorrhage. Even though we were told she’d remain on a ventilator for 24 hours as a formality before being pronounced dead, I kept watching for her to twitch awake, sure that it would happen. It seemed as if she was in a deep sleep, albeit so submerged by it that she had become unreachable.In her lifetime, Fauzia went through long bouts of oversleeping brought on by depression. There seemed to be a rebellion in it, too. From the age of 19, when she first became seriously depressed, she began holing herself up in her room, sleeping for the night and most of the following day. In the medieval era, the act of daytime sleeping, for men and for women, was seen to harm one’s reputation. Many still regard it as slovenly and it can be subversive for exactly this reason. For a woman, especially, to refuse to get up and assume her role in the world – which may be one of monotonous domesticity, of caring for others, or of participating in the tedious, lower-rung machinery of capitalist productivity – might be a defiant act of saying “no”.At night we become more anxious, which sets off a reaction in the nervous system, a surge of adrenaline and cortisolWhat might look like inertia, or passivity, can be an active summoning of inner strength, as suggested by Bruno Bettelheim in his psychoanalytic interpretations of fairytales in The Uses of Enchantment. He speaks of Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) not as an example of meek femininity but as an adolescent “gathering strength in solitude”. Her sleep is a temporary turning inward in order to foment, mobilise and psychically prepare for the battles of adulthood to come.A glassy-eyed, self-medicating woman in Ottessa Moshfegh’s novel My Year of Rest and Relaxation also “hibernates” in her New York apartment. She is a Manhattan princess, narcissistic and hard to like, who does not want to experience any of life’s sharp edges. Yet there is something I recognise in her overwhelming desire to disconnect from the terrible reality of the world. She plans to sleep for a year and wake up cured of her sadness, and she is. My sleep wasn’t a cure, but the oversleeping did eventually lift and leave me feeling less numbed to my own sadness. Now I was glad to be returned to myself, and to my insomnia – an old friend, missed.There is evidence to suggest that women sleep differently from men and feel the effects of insomnia in discrete ways. Professor Dijk cites the familiar list of causes, from lifestyle to social class, wealth and genetics, but he has also found sex-based biological factors, with differences in the brainwaves of women and men when they sleep. Women intrinsically have different circadian rhythms, which are on average six minutes shorter than men’s cycles; they experience more deep (or “slow wave”) sleep and may need to sleep for longer; while a mix of social factors, from breastfeeding to lower-paid shift work, means they face higher levels of insomnia.Sleep science makes a significant connection between hormones and sleep for women in the throes of menopause. About 50% of women who suffer with insomnia as they approach menopause are thought to sleep for less than six hours a night. The cumulative effects of this sleeplessness can be so intense that some have questioned whether they might be linked to UK female suicide rates, which are at their highest between the ages of 50 and 54.View image in fullscreenArifa Akbar.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The  GuardianThis brings another kind of insomnia for me, as I turn 50. It creeps duplicitously into my night, so I don’t recognise it; I fall asleep quickly but am awake again at 4am with alarm-clock precision. This is not the organic and woozy “biphasic” interruption believed by some to have been common in the centuries before electric light, in which communities were said to have a first and then a second sleep through the night, getting up to work or chat in between in a brief window referred to as “the watch”. My brain is pin-sharp, as if the sleep before has been entirely restorative and I am ready to start the day, except there is a move towards a certain line of thought, a search for the faultlines of the previous day, the urgent address of an old argument or decision far in the future. And it is, in its scratchy insistence, so much like Bourgeois’s scribbled red balls and Krasner’s insects, that I wonder if they were experiencing menopausal sleep disruption while creating their works.Whereas younger insomniacs struggle to fall asleep, those in midlife might doze off quickly but wake up in the middle of the night as a result of hormonal changes, and it is in these 4am “reckonings” that they encounter the night-time brain, says Dr Zoe Schaedel, who sits on the British Menopause Society’s medical advisory council. “Our frontal lobe [which regulates logical thought] doesn’t activate as well overnight, and our amygdala [the brain’s command centre for emotions, including fear, rage and anxiety] takes over.” So the very nature of thinking is different at 4am. In the daytime it is primarily logical, but at night we become more rash, anxious, catastrophic. That sets off its own physiological reaction in the nervous system, with a surge of adrenaline and cortisol, as well as rising heart and breathing rates.Between the waking, there is a welter of dreams, so many it seems like someone is changing between the channels on a TV set. Dr Schaedel says this apparent assault of dreams is an illusion. When oestrogen drops, women start sleeping more lightly and waking up in the latter part of the night, in the shallower REM, or dream, phase, which gives the impression of dreaming more because you are waking up more often in the midst of them.Still, I am wrongfooted by this second life in my head, this middle-aged night, as busy, as complicated and as exhausting as the day. When insomnia is at its most agitating, engaging the brain visually may be a way to lull ourselves back to sleep, says Dr Schaedel. This idea makes better sense of Bourgeois’s scribbling. Maybe I would find my own recurring patterns on paper if I did the same thing, I think, and so I put a notebook beside my bed. I know I have had a maelstrom of dreams but, when I try to discover them on paper, it is like a stuck sneeze. I write a few words down, but I am left straining for more. A few snatched images come back, but far more float out of view, so much unreachable. The next night I can recall even fewer details, although I know I have dreamed heavily. So my odyssey of dreams evades any attempt at codification. They are determined to remain mysterious, on the other side of daytime.This is an edited extract from Wolf Moon: A Woman’s Journey into the Night, published by Sceptre on 3 July at (£16.99).

Inside LA’s divisive $700m art galleryLos Angeles County Museum of Art’s new building has been a decade in the making and has long vexed critics, but its CEO hopes to turn things aroundLois Beckettin Los AngelesSat 28 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 28 Jun 2025 09.01 EDTShareAs Los Angeles county’s new $720m art museum building nears completion, it’s stillhauntedby a single, vexing question: how do you hang art in a gallery where every single wall is made of massive slabs of concrete?Designed by Peter Zumthor, a prizewinning Swiss architect, the new building at theLos AngelesCounty Museum of Art (Lacma) has sparked controversy in the art world since its initial designs were made public in 2013.The monolithic concrete structure, which has been compared with afreeway overpassand an “amoebic pancake”, was built to replace four older Lacma buildings, which were torn down to make room for the stylish newcomer. The building will hold a rotating selection from Lacma’s permanent collection of more than 150,000 art objects from around the globe.The creation of the new gallery space has been marked by unusual drama and contention. One of Lacma’s major donorspublicly broke with the museumas a result of conflict over how the permanent collection would be displayed. The construction site, which borders the LaBrea Tar Pits, is famous for the ancient fossils preserved in bubbling tar. Building a gigantic concrete building on tar-filled land in an earthquake-prone region caused additional costs and delays: thirteen sabre tooth tiger skulls were uncovered during construction.As the estimated cost of the project rose by nearly $100m, Zumthor, the star architect,publicly distanced himselffrom the results, saying he had repeatedly been forced to “reduce” his design, and that the experience had convinced him to never again work in the US.The building, which was initially conceived as anall-black structureevoking a tar pit or an oil spill, will now remain the raw gray of unadorned concrete.On Thursday, Lacma’s CEO, Michael Govan, who has championed the divisive project fornearly two decades, gave an early tour of the new space to a group of journalists, including some who have publicly criticized the building’s design. The building, named the David Geffen Galleries after its largest donor, will officially open in 2026.View image in fullscreenMichael Govan, the CEO of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, has spent nearly two decades defending his vision for a hulking concrete gallery designed by a star architect.Photograph: Gary Leonard/Museum Associates/LACMAOutside, the structure resembles a gleaming dinosaur egg on squat concrete legs, with a long tail of a gallery that curves over Wilshire Boulevard, allowing visitors to enter on both sides of the street. Inside, the building is all hulking concrete surfaces and curving walls of windows that let in the southernCaliforniasun – a striking but controversial choice for a museum, since paintings and drawings are typically kept out of direct sunlight.Govan defended the wraparound windows as essential for giving the museum a sense of place; he wanted visitors to “know you’re in Los Angeles – these collections are in Los Angeles”.The CEO led a crowd of journalists into one of the gallery’s multiple entrances, which is at the top of a daunting flight of concrete steps. The museum CEO loves stairs, he explained: the only exercise he gets is climbing Lacma building stairs and pacing while talking on the phone.As Govan walked the journalists through the sinuous galleries, he was energetic, full of quotations and anecdotes about Zumthor, his star architect. Zumthor was not there.Govan noted that the sleek leather benches in the sunlit galleries were only there as temporary place-holders: Zumthor had requested red-brown leather benches stuffed with duck feathers, which had yet to be installed.When asked to respond to the many criticisms of the project, the CEO was defensive. The “whole idea” of the space “was a new idea, right, so you can’t – no one’s ever experienced this before”, he said. “That is the spirit of experimentation. That proof will be in the final results – of whether it works, and how the public responds to it.”View image in fullscreenThe building was designed by the prizewinning Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and has sparked controversy in the art world.Photograph: Iwan BaanOpposition to Zumthor’s evolving design had been fierce. Some of the most dedicated critics of “the blob” hated it so much they held analternative design competitionand boughtfull-page newspaper adsin protest.But to Govan, his building is not just a new gallery: it’s a fundamentally new way of experiencing art, an attempt “to reinvent art history for the 21st century”.The space was designed to be “non-hierarchical”, Govan said. He did not want to organize the museum’s permanent collection by time period or geography or type of art: he recalled telling Zumthor that “I don’t want anyone in the front.”In practice, this means that all of the gallery space is on a single floor, and the layout of the rooms is unpredictable and confusing to navigate.“The building itself really avoids linear histories or linear paths,” Govan said. “The remit was to make something that was more like wandering in a park, where you curate your own journey.” When the gallery opens in 2026, Govan said, the first show will be organized around the “muse” of four different oceans, includinga mix of Mediterranean art, and a Pacific collection that brings together California artists with those from Japan.Zumthor and Govan’s vision has its prominent defenders. Brad Pitt showed up to a public meeting in 2019 to praise Zumthor’s “mastery of light and shadow”, and spoke in favor of the new Lacma building for so long that an elected official told him to “wrap it up”. Architectural Digest, in a preview piece in June,hailed the new building’s“curatorial provocations and challenges to the shibboleths of the art world”.View image in fullscreenThe wraparound windows are essential for giving the museum a sense of place, says the head of Lacma.Photograph: Iwan BaanBut while the journalists on Friday’s preview tour were polite, their questions made clear that the criticisms of Lacma’s new building were not going away.The practicality of the concrete walls has remained front and center in the debates, including in aseries of eviscerating columnsby Los Angeles Times’ art critic Christopher Knight, who won a 2020 Pulitzer prize for his critiques of a building plan funded in part by$125m in taxpayer dollars.“How do you hang paintings on concrete walls?” Knightasked in 2019, calling the idea “nutty”. He nicknamed Zumthor’s building “the Incredible Shrinking Museum”, noting that the amount of planned gallery space in the new structure had shrunk throughout the planning process, resulting in asmaller amount of total display spacethan in the razed buildings it replaced.Asked again on Friday about how curators would hang art on the minimalist concrete, Govan was breezy: “You can just drill right into the walls,” he said. “It’s very sturdy–you can hang Assyrian relief.”When they needed to change the exhibit, Govan said, they would simply fill up those holes and drill new ones. He noted that there were several patches on the walls already.Someone asked if constantly drilling and patching the walls would destroy the beautiful minimalist surface of the concrete.“It’s supposed to be like a good pair of old blue jeans that gets better with time,” the CEO said. And he believed in the new gallery’s longevity. Earlier, he had said, buoyantly, “This building could last 500 years.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But my sandy toes and salty hair are products of the Atlantic, not the Pacific. AndthisSanta Cruz belongs to Portugal’s Costa de Prata, not California.Mutual monikers are not the only parallels: this coast has 300 sunny days a year, top-notch surf (after Malibu, nearby Ericeira was the second place to be designated a World Surfing Reserve), and blond sands stretching towards wave-carved coastal bluffs and ocean arches.In this former fishing village, just an hour’s drive north-west of Lisbon, tranquillity flows like the tides. A soul-healing clutch of low-slung, whitewashed streets waymarked by an out-of-place beachside crenellated turret – the sole remnant of a palace plan thwarted by the 1929 Wall Street crash – it’s the kind of delightfully textbook Portuguese place you stumble upon serendipitously. And once you do, you won’t want to leave. Japanese poet Kazuo Dan visited in 1971 to have a “conversation between Heaven and Earth” – a chat he continued for 16 months.California cravings? Noah’s grilled cheese and portobello burgers hit the spotIf you’re a surfer, you’ll instantly agree. If not, lessons will leave you convinced. Check-in at chicNoah Surf House(room sleeping four from €320 B&B), complete with an ocean-view infinity pool and skate park, and arranging all-age surf classes is effortless. Flawlessly renovated Villa Galega (doubles from €115 B&B) affords a more homely escape.Santa Cruz and surrounding Torres Vedras boasts11 beaches certified as pollution-free– more than any other Portuguese municipality. Tread the dune-crossing boardwalk to river-wrapped Praia Azul to flop on the finest sweep.Back in town, beachside feasts don’t come better than breezyBronzear. Split a steaming pot ofarroz de peixe, a seafood-stacked rice stew, or take plump, signature crabs as your table’s centrepiece during September’s Festival da Sapateira. California cravings? Noah’s grilled cheese and portobello burgers hit the spot. Pair with a local Touriga Nacional red wine – a robust stand-in for a Cali Cab Sav – or slip away to the family-run wineryQuinta da Almiarafor a vine-hemmed, in situ tasting.Evenings usually end ringing the doorbell ofManel, the town’s oldest bar, for jazz-accompanied candlelit cocktails and Lisbon-brewed IPAs. Out front, an engraved stone shares Kazuo’s words contemplating chasing the setting sun to the end of the sea – the haiku that Santa Cruz’s surfers now scrupulously honour.Daniel James ClarkeSwap a cabin inNew Englandfor amökkiin FinlandView image in fullscreenTraditional mökki cottages in rural Finland.Photograph: Wmaster 890/Getty ImagesAlmost two centuries after it was written, Walden; or, Life in the Woods, Henry David Thoreau’s book about the two years he spent living in a self-built cabin on a lake in Massachusetts, still inspires generations of Americans to go in search of what he called the “tonic of wildness”. It’s an American dream of simplicity and self-sufficiency that was also beautifully captured in the 1981 film On Golden Pond, in which Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn fish, paddle and ponder life for one last summer in Maine (though it was filmed in New Hampshire).But North America doesn’t have a monopoly on this kind of bucolic escape. The Nordic countries know all about the appeal of cabin life – and Finland, with 19 hours of sunlight in midsummer and sublime wild landscapes, is an idyllic alternative.Mökki, or Finnish summer cottages, sit on lake shores or on rocks by the seashore and are often passed down through families. With about 20% of Finns living within the Helsinki metropolitan area, these cabins are a sanctuary for spending time in nature: fishing and messing about on the water in summer; skiing, ice-swimming and snowshoeing in winter. Many are off-grid, so part of the ritual includes splitting wood, gathering water, warming up in the wood-fired sauna … and letting your phone battery die. You’re free to roam the coast or forage in the surrounding forest too – theJokaisenoikeudetor “everyman’s rights” law gives everyone the freedom to wander and collect wild food.You don’t need to have friends or family with a mökki to stay in one–there are an estimated 500,000 of them and only a fifth of Finns own one outright, so many are available for those new tomökkielämä(Finnish cottage life).LomarengasandFinland Cottage Rentalsallow you to rent directly from owners, while onSviskärin the southern Åland archipelago you get a 28-hectare (69-acre) island all to yourself – perfect for foraging, sea dipping and the “tonic of wildness”.Sian LewisSwap the Appalachian Trail for Europe’s even longer E1 pathView image in fullscreenThe E1 trail starts at Norway’s North Cape.Photograph: Achim Thomae/Getty ImagesIn 1948, Earl Shaffer, a US second world war veteran, set off on a long walk. He had his ex-army rucksack and some old boots, but no tent or cooker. His goal was to be the first person to complete the 2,200 miles of the Appalachian Trail in one continuous yomp, a thru-hike as it came to be known. When 67-year-old grandmother Emma Gatewood repeated the feat in 1955 (with even simpler kit), the Appalachian Trail was on its way to becoming the world’s first long-distance celebrity footpath.These days about 3,000 people attempt a thru-hike every year (about aquarter of those succeed) but the experience is now very different, with huts every six to eight miles, water stashes left by “trail angels”, and well-established support logistics.In Europe it can be harder to find sustained remoteness, but the 2,050-mile Scandinavian section of theE1 long-distance footpathis about as close as you get.This full 4,420-mile route had its origins in post-second-world-war rapprochement ideals and was devised by a team from the then European Ramblers Association led by the British walker Arthur Howcroft (who died in 2023 aged 96). The path starts at Norway’s North Cape and officially finishes in Palermo, but it is in Scandinavia that it crosses the greatest amount of wilderness.Once you reach Halmstad on the Swedish coast, you have almost one Appalachian Trail’s worth of walking under your beltThe early stages are well inside the Arctic Circle and not to be underestimated, with navigation, river crossings and snowfields constant challenges. Long stretches are unmarked. There are some concessions to practicalities: bothNorwayandSwedenhave excellent systems of mountain huts.Once you reach Halmstad on the Swedish coast, you have almost one Appalachian Trail’s worth of walking under your belt, but there is no need to stop: in E1 terms you are not even halfway. A ferry crosses to the Danish port of Grenaa, and the path begins again, continuing across Germany and the Alps with several long, tough days. Some great stages then cross Tuscany and Umbria, but once in southern Italy the path, by all accounts, can be a bit sketchy and seems to fade away in Campania, though route-marking is improving.After his failed attempt to complete the Appalachian Trail, authorBill Brysondescribed the benefits of long-distance trails succinctly: “For a brief, proud period I was slender and fit. I gained a profound respect for wilderness and nature and the benign dark power of woods. I understand now, in a way I never did before, the colossal scale of the world.”Kevin RushbySwap New York for BerlinView image in fullscreenBerlin, the other city that never sleeps.Photograph: hHanohikirf/AlamyBuzzy and culturally rich, with extensive museums and galleries, oodles of nightlife and concerts – from classical venues to techno clubs – lush green spaces, family-friendly activities and striking architecture, New York and Berlin have plenty in common. But as someone who knows both cities well, Berlin gets my vote.While NYC’s nightlife is diverse – and has bounced back since Rudy Giuliani’s ugly, destructive campaign against it in the 1990s – it’s way more commercial thanBerlin, whose underground electronic scene, especially techno, is edgier and more experimental. FromBerghaintoSisyphos, Berlin’s clubs also stay open longer (sometimes for days; it truly is the city that never sleeps, at least on weekends). They also don’t tend to have dress codes – unless you count skimpy lingerie and kinky harnesses. VIP areas and even mobile phone photography are strictlyverboten. Berliners can quaff beers openly on the streets, and indulge in a bit of public nookie at nightclubs – as distinct from official swinger or sex spots such asKitKat.Berlin gives great gastro, too, excelling at affordable, mid-range restaurants that tick all the trend boxes – small plates, natural wines, plant-based menus found at buzzy neighbourhood spots such as Kreuzberg’s vegan havenHappa, Neukölln’sLa CôteandSorrel, and Prenzlauer Berg’sEstelle. And while it doesn’t have a Chinatown or a Little Italy, you can find every national cuisine on the planet (albeit with less spice, to appease the sensitive German palate).NYC certainly has fantastic cultural big-hitters, from the Guggenheim and the Met to Moma and the American Museum of Natural History, but Berlin has the Unesco-heritage Museum Island, Mies van der Rohe’s slickly modernistNeue Nationalgalerieand its own natural history and German history museums. It also excels in unusual venues that New York doesn’t have, such as theHamburger Bahnhof, in a former railway station,the Boros Collectioninside a second world war bunker, andSilent Green, an art and concert space in a former crematorium.As for green space, New York’s Central Park may be one-and-a-half times the size of the Tiergarten, but Berlin has vastly more green recreational spaces overall, with about 2,500 inner-city parks and unique areas such as the sprawlingTempelhofer Feld, a former airport, and the massive Grunewald forest.One last thing: with much lower population density and fewer tourists (12.7 million people visited Berlin in 2024 versus the 64 million who went to New York), there’s more room on the streets and fewer queues for the major sights.Bis bald(see you soon) … y’all.Paul SullivanSwap the Grand Canyon for Montenegro’s Tara River CanyonView image in fullscreenWhite-water rafting on the Tara River Canyon, Montenegro.Photograph: Marketa Novakova/AlamyLet’s get one thing straight: size wise, the Grand Canyon sprawls for 278 miles along the Colorado River, whereas the Tara River Canyon covers a mere 51. But what the Montenegrin canyon lacks in size it makes up for in depth: as Europe’s deepest gorge, it plunges 1,300 metres (4,300ft), only 300 metres less than the average depth of the Grand Canyon (and just over 500 metres less than its deepest point).As this Unesco world heritage site slices through northern Montenegro’s Durmitor national park and eventually slides across the border into Bosnia, it adds even more drama to this section of the Dinaric Alps’ forbidding mountains and glacial  lakes.For adventurers who like a challenge, Tara means one thing: white-water raftingFor adventurers who like a challenge, Tara means one thing: white-water rafting. The choice of excursions all around the region is enormous, but you can get a taste of it in a few hours by joining one of the trips from the town of Žabljak, which in winter is one of Montenegro’s ski centres. Eventually, you’ll be rafting under the soaring concrete arches of the awe-inspiring Đurđevića Tara Bridge, whose beauty is best admired from below.There’s a whole mini industry set up around the bridge, including ziplining and stalls selling souvenirs. As someone at the opposite end of the daredevilry scale – and thanks to speeding cars and a concrete path that’s barely a foot wide – I found it scary enough just walking on the bridge to take in the admittedly extraordinary view.But there are other ways of enjoying the beauty of Tara without worrying about Montenegrin motorists. Not far from Žabljak is the car park for the Ćurevac mountain peak and viewpoint, which is reached after a 40-minute hike and offers sweeping views of those magnificent gorges. It’s only one of scores of hiking routes that wind above and alongside the river, some of which are part of the 1,200-mile Via Dinarica trail that goes from Slovenia all the way to Albania.Right by the border with Bosnia and the confluence of the Tara and Piva rivers is another collection of rafting centres as well as campsites offering mellower ways of exploring Tara. Boat trips along gentler stretches  of water give you the chance to swim in absurdly clear waters, lunch on organic food and drink cold beer brewed with spring water. And in this land of €3 pints, you’ll find your euro going way further than your dollar ever would.Stay atGreen Topnear Žabljak, which has well-equipped one-bedroom self-catering wooden chalets with gardens, barbecues and mountain views from £95 a night.Mary NovakovichSwap the Mojavedesert for Tabernas in SpainView image in fullscreenThe Tabernas desert in Spain.Photograph: Nachteule/Getty ImagesWhen the Italian film director Sergio Leone chose to shoot his westerns in Europe, there was only one place that could convincingly double for the American west – the Tabernas desert in south-east Spain. With its dry riverbeds snaking through arid mountains and sandstone canyons, it’s easy to imagine yourself in California’s Mojave desert.Tabernas might not have the Mojave’s famous Joshua trees, but it is home to flora, fauna and a landscape reminiscent of the US desert. Prickly pears, giant aloe and palm trees line the trails, while lizards scuttle among otherworldly rock formations and eagles soar in the vast sky.Tourism is still low-key here. For decades this barren part of Andalucía was not on the radar of the Spanish tourist board, and large areas are monopolised by swathes of plastic greenhouses. But with a growing appreciation for Tabernas’ unique status as Europe’s only desert, as well as the renaissance of Leone’s movies, its charms are being re-evaluated. You can take a guided horseback ride through the desert with theMalcaminos ranchand pitch your tent atCamping Fort Bravo(€45 a night), one of the original movie sets still in use today. For a little more comfort –and to live out your California homesteading fantasy – you can book into one of their western-styled log cabins (from €80).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bewitched by cowboy lore as a teenager, I rode across the American deserts in search of the mythical west (admittedly on a motorcycle rather than horseback), seduced by the romance of life on the trail – billy cans boiling over campfires and a wide-open wilderness that promised a freedom unimaginable in fenced-off, old-world Europe.Joshua Tree national park in the Mojave desert became my go-to destination each time I found myself in California. But in recent years, I’ve been exploring Spain, scouting routes for the forthcomingSpaghetti Western Trail, and finding the same magic in the Desierto de Tabernas. The scale is of course smaller than the Mojave, but the silence, the stillness, the hint of sage on the warm air and the sense of exploration are as thrilling as my early US road trips.Leone was enthralled by American style and myth but always from a distance. “I can’t see the US any other way than with a European’s eyes,” he said. “It’s a country that fascinates me and terrifies me at the same time.”If you feel the same way right now, but still yearn for a cowboy adventure, you could do worse than follow in his footsteps and head for Tabernas.Lois PryceSwap Yellowstone for Carpathia in RomaniaView image in fullscreenA bear in the wilds of Carpathia.Photograph: Istvan Kadar/Getty ImagesThe jaw-dropping landscapes of the US’s 63 national parks lure millions of visitors to the great outdoors each year. Yellowstone, established in 1872, is the oldest of them all – a sprawling 3,472 square miles of dazzling scenery including canyons and active geysers. Mostly in Wyoming but stretching into Montana and Idaho, it’s home to wildlife from grizzly bears and wolves to bison and antelope, and is crisscrossed by thousands of miles of trails.Although it can’t compete in size, the rugged, forested Făgăraș mountains in Romania offer a thrilling taste of the wild and exciting wildlife-spotting opportunities closer to home. This area of Transylvania, on the southern edge of the Carpathians, is among the wildest places in Europe, where brown bear, wolves, lynx and – recently reintroduced – bison roam.‘A Yellowstone for Europe’: Romania’s ambition for a vast new wilderness reserveRead moreIt’s where theFoundation Conservation Carpathiais working to create the continent’s largest forest national park, buying land for conservation and reforesting clear-cut areas on its mission to establish a 200,000-hectare wilderness reserve, which has been dubbed a “Yellowstone for Europe”.Unlike the vast lodges in Yellowstone, staying in these tiny cabins means you’re close to the action, engulfed by the landscapeAs I hike through forests on steep zigzagging paths with my guide Răzvan, the thrill of the wild is real – we see a viper and pass fresh bear prints. Gouge marks on a tree and overturned stones reveal the bear’s hunt for food. I watch with bated breath as a group of bison wander on a hillside close by – thankfully upwind of our scent.We stay atBuneahide, a wooden shelter overlooking a lake, with bunks, a double bedroom, a kitchen and huge soundproofed windows that make the most of the views. As night falls, I stare into the dark as if glued to a movie. Something moves in the half-light – and slowly a young female brown bear wanders into view, sniffing the air, rubbing against a tree. It’s not long before a large male appears, just metres away from the hide. I’m mesmerised as I watch him pawing the ground for food before sloping off into the woods.Unlike the vast lodges in Yellowstone, staying in these tiny cabins mean you’re close to the action, engulfed by the landscape. We hike higher to Comisu hide, at 1,600 metres, with sweeping views over the mountains as a storm rolls in. Owls call out in the moonlit night as I drift off to sleep, dreaming about this vibrant wild world.Jane DunfordVisitFoundation Conservation Carpathiafor more informationSwap seafood in New England for Normandy and BrittanyView image in fullscreenFreshly shucked oysters for sale in Cancale, Brittany.Photograph: Alan Morris/AlamyFor all our sniffiness about American cuisine, few people dispute the quality of the country’s seafood. Although you can no longer get a lobster roll at McDonald’s in New England, the fast-food joint is one of the few places in the region where they’re not on the menu. Cycling down the Atlantic coast last summer as part of research for a US travelogue, I rejoiced in the casual abundance on offer at the roadside – baskets of fried clams in Connecticut, oysters in Maine, crab benedict in Massachusetts … 3,000 miles and a world away from the grand silverfruits de merplatters of Europe.You don’t have to fly across an ocean to get your shellfish fix, however. While you’re unlikely to find yourself tempted by a lobster surf and turf burger in France, seafood can be surprisingly accessible if you swerve Parisian bistros and go straight to the source.La Cale, in Blainville-sur-Mer on Normandy’s Cotentin peninsula, an easy drive (or a day’s cycle) from Cherbourg, istypiquement françaisfor its pride in local produce (oysters, whelks, clams etc, as well as galettes and spit-roast meat), but rather less so in its casual feet-in-the-sand ethos and informal service. Remi, the proprietor, is described online as “eccentric” – his van is graffitied with the words “Rosbeefs welcome … frogs too”. Do not pass up themoulesfrites, or theteurgoule, a traditional Normande spiced rice pudding.Further down the coast, in Brittany, I’ve earmarked Cancale, in the Bay of Mont Saint Michel, for a return visit, because if you ever wanted proof that the French can let their hair down, look no further than the people sitting on the sea wall with paper platters of oysters and plastic cups of cold sancerre. The oysters come from the seafrontmarché aux huîtres, which offers a bamboozling selection, all shucked to order, and the wine from an enterprising booze van parked nearby. The shells, once you’ve finished, are thrown on to the beach.One step up, in that there’s table service, but with no more steps between sea and plate, isMaison Quintin, on the Atlantic coast near Saint-Philibert, where you can feast on the family’s own oysters under the pines as the sun sets over the estuary, supplemented with skewers of plump prawns and langoustines, crab, grilled lobster, and their homemade seafood rillettes on toast. Reservations essential – laid-back vibes guaranteed.Felicity CloakePeach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisineby Felicity Cloake ispublished by Mudlark (£16.99)Swap the Florida Everglades for Italy’sMarano LagoonView image in fullscreenErnest Hemingway called Marano Lagoon ‘piccola Florida’ because it reminded him of the Everglades.Photograph: Nicola Simeoni/AlamyIt was on a slow journey through the extensive wetlands that border Italy’s Adriatic that I first came upon the little-known Laguna di Marano, a carefully preserved eco-paradise, barely touched by tourism. This gossamer web of interlocking lagoons, canals and river deltas stretches from Venice all the way up to Trieste. Local legend has it that Ernest Hemingway called these wetlands and the adjoining sandy beach resort of Lignano “piccola Florida”, because it reminded him of the Everglades and the Florida Keys.The US author first came to this part of Italy as a volunteer at the end of the first world war. He returned in the 1950s to find inspiration for his book Across the River and Into the Trees while duck hunting and fishing on the Marano Lagoon – though for sea bream and mullet rather than marlin, his favourite quarry in the waters around Florida.At the bar of the rusticTrattoria Barcanetain the bustling medieval port of Marano Lagunare, I order a glass ofrefosco dalpeduncolorosso, a rustic local red wine favoured by the writer. It may not be as glamorous as sipping a Hemingway martini in a Key West cocktail bar, but it was the perfect aperitivo before tasting chef Claudio Moretti’s exquisite cuisine, a delicate carpaccio of sea bass and grilled eel from the nearby Stella River delta, both freshly caught by the port’s many fishers.This gossamer web of interlocking lagoons, canals and river deltas, stretches from Venice all the way up to TriesteMarano Lagunare is the perfect base for exploring the surrounding wetlands. Thetourism officecan arrange activities from canoeing and kayaking to walking and horse riding. Renting a small boat with a guide is my choice, a retiredpescatore(fisher) for the perfect insight into local life on the water. While the vast, open expanse of the lagoon is breathtaking, dotted along the edge of the water is something you will never see in Florida – traditionalcasonithatched huts still used today by fishers.The landscape changes dramatically as we enter the protected reserve of the Stella delta. Here, the freshwater channels become narrower, bordered on both sides by tall golden reeds – definitely a feel of the Everglades – as we catch glimpses of pink flamingos, purple herons, egrets, cormorants swooping down and a neat squadron of geese flying past. It may be smaller than the Everglades (62 square miles as opposed to 2,357), but the one thing truly different from a Florida nature excursion is that there is no need to look out for alligators.John BruntonSwap California’s Highway 1 for Ireland’s Wild Atlantic WayView image in fullscreenThe Dingle peninsula section of the Wild Atlantic Way.Photograph: Marco Bottigelli/Getty ImagesMy left foot shook on the clutch – not from tiredness, but from something resembling fear. Conor Pass had seemed like a good idea at breakfast. One of Ireland’s highest and narrowest mountain roads? Why not? The car seemed to float as the road narrowed to a one-lane ledge between cliff and sky. No turning back now – just a slow crawl upwards with mist curling over the bonnet from the valley below.Still, this is the scenery the Wild Atlantic Way promises – and delivers. It’s a 1,600-mile coastal drive from Malin Head, the country’s most northerly point, in County Donegal, to Kinsale in County Cork in the south-west – and Ireland’s answer to California’s Highway 1, the 656-mile Pacific Coast route that skirts sea bluffs, redwood groves and epic coastal views.Big Sur’s iconic Bixby Bridge resembles theMizen Headfootbridge in West Cork. Highway 1’s “million dollar view” is eclipsed by the Atlantic sweep from Slieve League, or the cliffs that tower above powder-white Keem beach on Achill Island. Connemara’sSky Roadand the Burren’sAtlantic Driveecho Big Sur’s drama, winding between limestone and ocean. However, my favourite stretch – theDingle peninsula– is hard to match. Its mountain-to-ocean setting is visual theatre dialled to max.Inch beach, a long curve of sand stretching three miles into Dingle Bay, is a gentle introduction before I turned north to hair-raising Conor Pass (optional and clearly marked) and descended into Dingle town.I stepped out on the headland and watched the surf pound the shore ferociously as if it was punishing it for some ancient grievanceThe road then turns otherworldly along theSlea Head Drivewith Ventry beach’s three miles of bone-white sand perfect for barefoot walking – somewhat like Highway 1’s famous Moonstone beach.As I drove on I stopped at every layby I could, because there’s always something around the corner; a hidden cove or early Christian monument. AtCoumeenoole beach, I stepped out on the headland and watched the surf pound the shore ferociously as if it was punishing it for some ancient grievance.And then cameDunquin Pier– the lane zigzags down a steep slope like a spiral staircase that plunges into the ocean, which was enough of a reason to ditch the car on the roadside and walk down. This is where the boats leave for the Blaskets, and it feels like the edge of the world.Offshore, the Three Sisters – three jagged peaks rising from the ocean floor – remain in focus, their silhouettes a reminder of the sea stacks off Big Sur. About halfway along the Slea Head Drive, the magnificentBlasket Centredelivers staggering island views.Vic O’SullivanExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysUnited States holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This sumptuous coffee and walnut cake, which you, too, can whip up in less than an hourFelicity CloakeSat 28 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTShareToday is my birthday, so I’m celebrating with a classic that, for all the stickytres lechesand sophisticatedsachertortesI’ve enjoyed in recent years, remains my absolute favourite, my desert island cake: that darling of the WI tea tent, the coffee and walnut sandwich. The greatNigel Slater once named ithis last meal on Earth, and I’m hoping to have it for tea.Prep30 minCook25 minServes8225g room-temperature butter4 tbsp instant coffee(see step 1)100g walnut halves4 eggs225g soft light brown sugar225g plain flour3 tsp baking powder¼ tsp fine saltMilk(optional)For the icing165g room-temperature butter425g icing sugar¼ tsp salt4 tbsp double cream(optional)1 Soften the butter and brew the coffeeView image in fullscreenIf you’ve forgotten to get your butter out of the fridge, begin by dicing and spacing it out on the paper to soften (remember, you’ll need some for the icing, too).Mix the coffee with two tablespoons of boiling water and leave to cool – I like the nostalgic flavour of instant coffee here, but you can substitute three tablespoons of espresso or other strong coffee, if you prefer.2 Toast the nutsView image in fullscreenToast the walnut halves in a dry pan until they smell nutty, then set aside a quarter of the most handsome-looking ones to use as decoration later. Roughly chop the rest. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and grease and base line two 20cm sandwich tins. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat.3 Cream the butter and sugarView image in fullscreenPut the butter in a food mixer or a large bowl anchored with a damp cloth to steady it, then beat it briefly to soften. Crumble in the sugar to break up any lumps, then carry on beating for several minutes, until the butter is really light and fluffy; scrape down the bowl as required.4 Add the eggs and flourView image in fullscreenWith the mixer (or your wooden spoon) still going, gradually pour in the eggs and beat to incorporate, again scraping the sides as necessary.View image in fullscreenTip the flour and baking powder into a bowl, whisk to knock out any lumps, then add to the batter. Using a large metal spoon, gently fold the bottom of the mixture over the top, but do so only once.5 Add the coffee and chopped nutsView image in fullscreenAdd the salt, half the coffee (keep the rest for the icing) and the chopped walnuts, then slowly fold in, just until the flour and coffee are completely incorporated – bear in mind that the more more vigorously you fold, the more air you will knock out of the batter, so it’s important not to overdo it.View image in fullscreen6 Finish the batter, then bakeThe batter should by now fall from the spoon, slightly reluctantly but without the need for violent agitation; if it doesn’t, loosen with a little milk. Divide evenly between the two tins (weigh them for perfection).View image in fullscreenPut in the oven, on the middle shelf if using a conventional setting, and bake for about 25 minutes (check after 20, though!), until well risen but not too dark. Remove the tins from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then take out of the tins and put on a rack to cool completely.7 Start the icingView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, make the icing. Beat the butter until soft; my mixer is not good with smaller amounts so I tend to use a mixing bowl, again anchored to the work surface with a damp cloth, and electric beaters or a wooden spoon. Sift in the icing sugar to get rid of any lumps, then add the salt.8 Finish the icingView image in fullscreenBeat to combine, then add the reserved cooled coffee and the cream – though optional, the latter does make the icing easier to spread; for a less rich result; use a splash of milk instead. Put the less perfect looking of the two cakes (there’s always one) on a platter.9 Decorate, then serveView image in fullscreenTop the cake on the platter with a little less than half the icing, leaving it thicker around the edges where it will be seen, then pop the second cake on top. Spoon the remaining icing over the second cake, spreading it out neatly and adding a few swirls for interest, then arrange the reserved toasted walnuts pleasingly all over the top. Avoid chilling before slicing and serving, unless it’s really necessary.Felicity Cloake’s new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisine, is published by Mudlark at £16.99.

Is anyone still makingthe baked feta pasta from 2021? Has the“marry me chicken”resulted in an uptick in matrimonies? But the tossed noodles (guay tiew klook) currentlydoing the roundson Thai social media platforms really whet my appetite. In short, they’re noodles tossed with mince, garlic oil and a dark, sweet, salty and tangy hot sauce, and they just make so much sense that they really couldn’tnotbe great. I love them, so I’m passing on the baton to you using a combination of crumbly tempeh and walnuts instead of the mince.Thai-style tossed walnut and tempeh noodlesBlack vinegar (Chinkiang vinegar) andLaoganma crispy chilli in oilcan be found in south-east Asian supermarkets or online, while Thai Taste makes a great and widely available vegan fish sauce.

Coat with a tablespoon of the oil and put to one side.Put a wide frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the beansprouts and a splash of water. Stir-fry for two minutes, then tip into a colander.Put three tablespoons of rapeseed oil in the same wide frying pan and set it on a medium heat. Once hot, add the garlic, fry for about two minutes, until crisp, then tip into a small heatproof bowl. Stir the soy sauce, black vinegar, fish sauce, brown sugar and lime juice into the garlic bowl.Put the remaining three tablespoons of oil in the same frying pan, keep the heat on medium and, when the oil is very hot, add three-quarters of the spring onions and cook, stirring, for two minutes. Add the tempeh and walnut mixture and fry, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until it turns crumbly and golden.Put the noodles in a large bowl, and top with the tempeh and walnut mixture, the beansprouts, the remaining raw spring onions, the chilli oil sediment and the coriander.

Bitter little things, cumquats – spelled kumquats outside Australia – are not quite as versatile as most other citrus. So, I say “when life gives you cumquats, make marmalade!” – then use it in a punchy and tangy cocktail.The Lady Marmalade is a late-night specialty in our household. You can make a non-alcoholic version by shaking up the marmalade with a tangy fruit juice. Grapefruit with a splash of lime works well; the marmalade adds texture and complexity thatelevates the juice to mocktail status.The cocktail is made with mezcal and apricot brandy but you can swap out the mezcal for aged tequila, brandy or whisky. You could also use a brighter marmalade based on lime, lemon or grapefruit, and switch the lime juice for lemon to pair with a lighter spirit.To make the spiced marmalade, you’ll need a saucepan, juicer, microplane, measuring jug and scale.For the cocktail, you’ll need a rocks glass, shaker and a jigger.View image in fullscreenCara Devine’s cumquat marmalade and other preserves from recipe book Behind the Home Bar.Photograph: Gareth SobeySpiced cumquat marmalade – recipe500g cumquats1 cup (250ml) water, or enough to cover the cumquats250g granulated white sugar, or to taste (I like to keep my marmalade quite tart)Pinch salt1 tsp ground cumin½ tsp smoked paprika½ lemon, zest and juiceQuarter or slice the cumquats (depending on size). You can cover the cumquats with the water and leave themto soak overnight if you have time. This softens the fruit, which helps it to cook faster and keeps the flavour fresher, but it’s not imperative. If you do this, cook the cumquats in the same water you soaked them in.Put the cumquats, water and sugar in a saucepan and stir over a low heat for 10-15 minutes until the fruit is tender and the sugar has dissolved. Add the salt, spices, lemon zest and juice while still over a low heat, then increase the heat and bring the mixtureto a rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium and continue boiling for about 20 minutes, or until the marmalade has thickened.To check if it has reached setting point, place a small plate in the freezer until cold, then drop a dollop of marmalade on the cold plate. Tilt the plate and, if the marmalade doesn’t run, you’re good to go. If it runs, continue boiling for a few minutes, then use the same cold plate method to check again. Or you can just eyeball it, if you’re a cowboy like me. Fish out any pips you can see.If marmalade isproperly jarred and sealed ina sterile container, it can last in the pantry for up to six months. Once opened, keep it refrigerated and use within 12 weeks.View image in fullscreenLady Marmalade cocktail recipe45ml mezcal15ml apricot brandy2 tbsp spiced cumquat marmalade30ml lime juiceCubed iceCumquat halves, to garnishAdd the alcohol, marmalade and lime juice to your shaker tins with ice and shake hard.“Dump” into your glass (in other words don’t strain it, just pour in the same ice you shook with), adding more ice if necessary to fill the glass.
