Here are your responses.Peep Show (2003-2015)Peep Show is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, and we need an update on what Mark, Jeremy, Sophie and Super Hans are up to these days. Are Mark and Jez still living together? Did Sophie have any more children? Did Super Hans ever make it to Macedonia to open his moped rental business?Mark Hawksley, 46, WisconsinGreen Wing (2004-2007)View image in fullscreen‘The coolest, funniest comedy ever’ … Green Wing.Photograph: Channel 4Green Wing is the coolest, funniest comedy I’ve ever seen, with so many new ideas. Please can we have another series – and one without the “sad” part that crept into the latter third? I loved the visual and physical comedy pioneered in Green Wing – at least, I hadn’t seen it before – for example, the cart-wheeling through the glass corridors, slow and fast-motion, dancing and walking – by Joanna Clore from HR especially. It was also the first comedy I had seen with such a great mix of well drawn characters. It was just very, very funny and without being too cringey. I haven’t listened to the new audio version … but then where’s all the visual fun in that?Uli Sattler, 59, ManchesterSapphire & Steel (1979-1982)Sapphire & Steel was grownup TV for kids. It scared the pants off me, but I was hooked. I would even go out on a limb and say I preferred it to Doctor Who! It starred David McCallum and Joanna Lumley, who were brilliant. Obviously, we have lost David, but Joanna would still be great in it, and we could bring in some other elements to keep it new. Just a great opportunity for some intelligent spookiness. I am a film-making lecturer, and a few years ago one of our students started a campaign to bring it back, but it came to nothing.Ian Crook, Garstang, LancashireDeadwood (2004-2006)View image in fullscreenAl Swearengen himself! … Ian McShane in Deadwood.Photograph: Warrick Page/HBODeadwood was just the best thing on TV at the time. My husband and I had embarked on an odyssey from London home to Scotland, and were gutting and rebuilding a stone cottage in Argyll, so all the building and mud in this western was relatable. There was no streaming back then so my husband (no longer extant) and I waited agog for each new episode. The story was well written and multilayered. It was easy to be interested in and want to follow the characters. I think my favourite was Seth Bullock but there were so many – Trixie, Seth’s sidekick, Al Swearengen himself. As I haven’t seen the final film I’m not qualified to say where next. There were so many good actors playing so well in a set which reeked of dirt and difficulty.Judith Witts, 79, EdinburghFoyle’s War (2002-2015)Foyle’s War is the finest historical detective drama ever. Although it isn’t possible to revive it, as the writer-creator, Anthony Horowitz, has moved on to other projects and the lead actor, Michael Kitchen, has retired, the programme was robbed of the opportunity to tell more stories of the second world war home front by meddling, wrong-headed executives who cancelled and re-commissioned it twice. Fans have long speculated on the possibility of a prequel, as per Endeavour and Morse, exploring young Foyle’s great war experience and his interrupted early police career.Lesley Johnson, Vancouver, BC, CanadaTop Gear (2002-2022)View image in fullscreen‘It’s needed now!’ Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond on Top Gear.Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./AlamyTop Gear, with EVs and alternative fuel cars. I loved the trio of Jeremy, James and Richard, but I think a modernTop Gearshould be almost like the pre-00s version, with a focus on news and reviews. But I would also include the big adventures as once-per-series specials. For presenters, I would choose Jack Scarlett from Everything Electric, paired with Alex from Autoalex on YouTube and Richard’s daughter, Izzy Hammond. Automotive journalism is needed now as the car industry is facing its biggest changes in a generation – from EVs to alternative fuels to hydrogen. If we had education on TV, attitudes to net zero and transport based on net zero might change.Luci Bassindale, 21, NewcastleFirefly (2002-2003)View image in fullscreen‘Let’s see them in middle age!’ … Gina Torres in Firefly.Photograph: Fox Network/Sportsphoto/AllstarFirefly was probably the best sci-fi show ever produced for the small screen, and a good movie too. It was a brilliant realisation of cowboys and Indians in space with an excellent cast of actors all showing their good and bad sides – some very bad. Their interactions could be cutting, but it was obvious that they were friends who would willingly die for each other. It would be very interesting to see the characters in middle age.Kevin Brown, 73,Ynys Môn (Anglesey), WalesThe Peripheral (2022)I’d like to see The Peripheralreturn, as anything involving William Gibson is always going to be fascinating, and while I love the book, the TV series was taking things in an interesting new direction. I liked the world-building too; the collapsed and civil-war racked “post-jackpot” US seems far more prescient today than when series one was broadcast, as does a London run by kleptocrats. When it comes to characters, I really liked Chloë Grace Moretz’s Flynne Fisher; she is sorely underused these days and deserves meaty roles like this. However, Alexandra Billings’ magnetically scary Inspector Lowbeer stole the show from the moment she arrived, late in series one, and I really wanted to see how the character would develop.Ian Simmons, Southend-on-SeaThis Life (1996-1997)This Life really captured the post-uni life, trying to forge a path. It had a tight script, strong characters and great acting. Since This Life aired, there are so many other things that would have to be considered – the size of student loans, shrinking job markets, the growth of AI, social media toxicity, how the drinking culture changed – phew, where do you stop? But post-university life is still a rich, fertile ground for storylines. They could introduce a new set of actors, giving opportunities to even more diverse characters – although it would be good to see if Egg managed to get a Michelin star.Jeanette, LondonExplore more on these topicsTelevisionPeep ShowTop GearTV streamingChannel 4Television industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sure the Beeb likes to do the news, but there is nothing it likes more than reporting on itself. The holy grail of its output. There are whole departments within the Beeb dedicated to making TV and radio programmes about other BBC TV and radio programmes.There can be no other organisation that subjects itself to quite so much self-analysis. Only a psychotherapist would be able to fully determine whether it is solipsism or self-hatred. Maybe both. So much so that it goes out of its way to recruit people whose sole job is to criticise it.Some who are even ideologically opposed to it. Would not be that bothered if it no longer existed. Or lost its licence fee. Not that anything would ever be said to this effect. Because all its critics are motivated solely by love. This hurts them so much more that it hurts the BBC. Really.Monday afternoon saw the latest round of self-harm as Samir Shah, BBC chair, Robbie Gibb, a member of the board, and Michael Prescott, a former adviser to its editorial guidelines and standards committee and author of a leaked memo that led to the resignations ofTim Davie, the director general, and Deborah Turness, head of news, gave evidence to the Commons culture committee.Picking over the entrails of its failures in parliament. This was peak BBC. It’s a wonder they didn’t suspend all its afternoon programming and screen the sessions in their entirety. This was bigger than a state funeral.First in the hot seat was Prescott. No one was more mortified at the damage his memo had done than Mike himself. All he had ever wanted was to save the Beeb from itself. Open his heart and you would find BBC engraved on it.There had never been any party politics involved. He was just a good old centrist dad. Come to think of it, he didn’t even really understand how this politics thing worked. Even though he had been the political editor of the Sunday Times for four years from 1997 to 2001. Now all he wanted was the quiet life.Poor old Mike. There he had been minding his own business, sending off a 19-page memo never anticipating it would precipitate some high-level resignations. It had just been a small everyday thing. Just a few problems. Come to think of it, they weren’t even really problems, he said.Rather they were incipient problems. Minor criticisms that had the potential to develop into problems. They were so small, they were hardly detectable to the naked eye. It was only because he loved the BBC so much that he felt it necessary to raise them. And even then he had expected them to be dealt with quietly. Behind closed doors.So all he had done was raise the matter with the BBC board, Ofcom and the culture committee. And then all of a sudden it had appeared in the Daily Telegraph. No one had been more surprised than him.He had no idea how this could have possibly have happened. Maybe the Telegraph employed mind readers. For someone in the eye of a storm, he seemed remarkably incurious. Naive even. And it wasn’t as if he had had 10 years working at the Sunday Times to give him some insight into how these leak thingies worked.You could have knocked Mike down with a feather. Just imagine a critical memo falling into the hands of a media organisation that actively wished the BBC harm. Except Mike couldn’t imagine this because he had an imagination bypass. He was just an ingenu.He had no idea why the Telegraph had focused on the culture wars of Trump, Gaza and gender. If it had been left to him he would have splashed on an incorrect story about people from ethnic minorities paying more for their insurance. Even though the BBC had acted on that.The rest of the session was just more of the same. Mike insisting that he was doing the BBC a favour by holding them to far higher standards than he had ever met himself as a journalist. He merely wanted them to go the extra mile in the pursuit of impartiality. Why hadn’t the BBC broadcast a documentary on Kamala Harris inciting violence? Even if she hadn’t. That’s what he expected. He wanted the BBC to be the best version of itself possible.As for how he got the job at the BBC, Mike was also guilty of the same level of self reflection as the BBC. As far as he was concerned, it was merely his own brilliance. He had filled in an application and the panel had no choice but to appoint him. And it certainly had nothing to do with the fact that he was friends with Gibb. Because, look, when you reach Mike’s status in life you can’t help but know everyone important. That’s merely how the establishment works.Come the second session, Shah was a picture of misery. Chastising himself repeatedly as he apologised over and over again while trying to muddy the waters. It’s tough being expected to reach 100% purity. A world where mistakes cannot be tolerated.Robbie Gibb – make that Sir Robbie Gibb: he was knighted for his brilliance as Theresa May’s communication director, some people fail upwards – was the master of deflection. Nothing was, or ever has been, his fault. Other people had made errors but never him.He, too, bowed down before the majesty of the Beeb. Wishing it only well. But he had been saddened that some people had not been able to leave their politics – their leftwing politics – at the door. He might be a Tory but when it came to the BBC he was always impartial. He too was mystified that the memo got leaked to the Telegraph.There had been no boardroom takeover of the BBC by the right. It was just the right were the only people who could be trusted to run the corporation. Would he be resigning? Heaven no. Things were all going ever so well. As the session ended you couldn’t help wondering if it had been the wrong people who had lost their jobs.Explore more on these topicsBBCThe politics sketchTim DavienewsShareReuse this content"

Is it true thatyou can’t swimon your period? No. Does the scent of a person menstruatingattract bears? Also no.There is one period rumor I’ve always kind of enjoyed, though: when women are in close proximity for long enough, their menstrual cycles will eventually sync up, also known as “menstrual synchrony”. I’ve had several friends over the years claim that my period had yanked them on to my cycle.“I remember hearing that from family members when I was younger,” says Dr Rachel Jensen, Darney-Landy fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Jensen says she understands why this belief is so popular: “The idea that our bodies would synchronize with those we are close to is comforting and connecting.”But the body doesn’t actually work that way. Below, what you need to know about this common myth.Is menstrual synchrony real?No.The idea gained a lot of attention in the early 1970s, when Dr Martha McClintock published the first scientific paper onmenstrual synchrony. In it, she observed students living in a college dorm, and determined that women who live in close proximity or share a common environment experience a convergence of their menstrual cycles. This became known as the McClintock Effect.A number of subsequent studies in the 1990s confirmed McClintock’s finding. Some suggested that the shift may be the result of “olfactory cues” or pheromones whichaccelerate or delaythe menstrual cycle.But more recent studies that have been “more rigorously designed” have “generally failed to show any synchrony between menstrual cycles in women living together,” says Dr Jewel Kling, chair of women’s health at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.And research has failed to show how the body would even trigger this effect. “There isn’t a biological mechanism for menstrual syncing,” says Jensen.Why do so many people believe in menstrual synchrony?“Many women think this is true,” says Dr Salena Zanotti, OB-GYN at the Cleveland Clinic.If it seems like people’s periods are syncing up, that’s the result of information biases and statistics rather than biology.We are more likely to know and remember the menstrual timing of those we are close with, Jensen says. This means that if our cycles sync up, we are more likely to notice.Since menstrual cycles vary in time and length, it’s statistically likely that the cycles of two people will eventually overlap, Jensen says: “Studies show that cycles sync up at the same rate as we would expect based on mathematical probability due to chance”.What affects menstrual cycle timing?Many factors affect the timing and duration of one’s menstrual cycle, experts say.

(Not true.)Nor is it true that people should not have sex or exercise while on their period, says Jensen. “Both are safe, though people should be aware that there is still a risk of STIs or pregnancy while on their period,” she says, adding that exercise can help with certain period symptoms like cramps or mood changes.Such menstrual myths seem to propagate freely, while some facts remain under-discussed. Kling says that menstrual-related conditions such as painful menses (dysmenorrhea), abnormal uterine bleeding, and physical and psychological premenstrual symptoms are very common. “Up to 85% of women experience some menstrual-related syndrome,” she says. “And 40% report being significantly bothered by them.”It doesn’t have to be this way, says Zanotti. “Periods are a normal way of life,” she says. “They do not have to be very painful and very heavy.” If one struggles with their cycle, she suggests seeing a medical provider to help manage it.Although the myth of menstrual synchrony is relatively harmless, Jensen notes that “there can be serious consequences if people follow inaccurate health advice.”“If you see or hear something on social media or from a friend, it is always a good idea to check with your doctor before acting on it or even passing it on,” she says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyMenstruationWomenWomen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then a few minutes later, you’re squinting, adjusting your lighting or playing around with TV settings – it’s a night-time scene and you’re unable to make out what’s going on. Prompting the question: ‘When did everything on screen get so dark?’This question isn’t new, gaining traction after a few incredibly poorly lit battle scenes in the final season of Game of Thrones, with articles and posts popping up begging explanation,one Reddit user commenting: “If you need an article to defend that not being able to see shit is a stylistic choice, maybe the stylistic choice should be reconsidered.”Film critic and journalist Barry Levitt feels strongly on the subject. “If you walk outside on a warm day, you’ll find infinitely more colour than you would in a contemporary blockbuster.”Wicked forever: the enduring appeal of The Wizard Of OzRead moreLast year’s biggest film Wicked received widespread critique for the way it felt on screen,even being compared to a TV advert. It’s harder still, to refrain from critique when The Wizard of Oz, a film oftencredited with changing film colouringforever, serves as the first in this cinematic universe.This month’s much-anticipated sequel Wicked: For Good has been similarly criticised. In his review for the New Yorker, Justin Changasked: “Why is everything in this movie, for all its lavishly gilded, emerald-studded set design, either too dim or too bright – so blindingly backlit that Oz seems to be under perpetual thermonuclear attack, or so murky that you could scarcely tell a monkey from a Munchkin?”Technicolor, used in The Wizard of Oz, enabled extremely vibrant colours to be captured through a specialised camera splitting the light that enters into blue, green and red light. These beams were sent to separate strips of black and white film, with post-production combining these into the larger than life, deeply saturated colours we’re familiar with. But itsexpense and complexityspelled its own doom as technology moved on.View image in fullscreenJudy Garland and Ray Bolger in The Wizard of Oz.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./Alamy“The prevalence of flat monotone images in film and TV today is due in part to changes in camera technology and a lack of careful colour grading work.” saysLaura Hillard, lecturer in cinematography at the University of Salford.Modern digital cameras capture what it sees in a more realistic way without the stylistic saturation and texture that was inevitable with film.Somecredit The Lord of the Rings for marking a turning point in visual effects, with grading and editing utilised to naturally integrate these as realistically as possible. And many of us will recall from the pre-digital time, 1991’s The Addams Family was one of many films able to portray dark, gloomy environments and moods without any struggle to understand what’s happening on screen.“What I’m noticing these days, if we call it a trend (though I prefer to think of it as a specific stylistic direction), is a move towards lower contrast, softer highlights, more muted colour palettes, and a less visible lighting style,” saysHootan Haghshenas, a digital colourist with credits including 2016’s The Salesman. “And even though it can appear effortless, there’s usually a huge amount of work behind achieving this kind of naturalistic look, just as much as in more traditional, stylised lighting.”He adds: “There is sometimes a misconception that darker images are purely a cost-saving strategy in lighting or production design. That can occasionally play a part, but it’s not necessarily true.” Haghshenas believes “we’re simply in an era where film-makers have far more control and freedom over the final image than ever before.”It’s not simply down to technology though.Jon Constantinou, a producer and director, explains that the visuals of a film can be a battle between “abstraction and immersion”. With abstraction being something “very obvious that you are watching a depiction of something on the screen which you have to use your imagination to relate to, it oftentimes takes a little minute to get into it but then you’re along for the ride” and immersion being a “trend that kicked up at the dawn of digital, typically involves a combination of wider angle camera lenses, with the cameras being placed closer to the action”intending to make you feel like you’re there, experiencing this reality on screen.Constantinou speculates an immersive approach was taken to Wicked, to ground you in the same experience as Glinda and Elphaba – confirmed inan interviewwith director Jon M Chu. “I think what we wanted to do was immerse people into Oz, to make it a real place,” he said.“There’s a strong creative preference at play. Many film-makers want a visual world that feels grounded, atmospheric and emotionally truthful. Darker images can add tension, intimacy and realism,” echoes Haghshenas.View image in fullscreenMia Goth and Oscar Isaac in Frankenstein.Photograph: Ken Woroner/NetflixIt’s not just Wicked experiencing visual criticism, Frankenstein’s lighting seemed inconsistent with the intended gothic tones, with many believing itfelt like a video game, unlike Nosferatu, another gothic creature horror that enthralled with itsmasterful use of lighting and darker tones.Decider’s reviewof Frankenstein recognised “that signature Netflix flatness in its lighting and focus, a lack of contrast that makes the surfaces stick together across each focal length. Few elements on-screen feel real and tangible, and for a film about blood and sinew, that’s a problem.”“That signature Netflix flatness” has become a more commented on problem with the streamer’s increased dominance in Hollywood. Vice dived into this topic three years ago, finding that Netflix had restrictive lists of approved cameras and wished all content to be shot in 4K UHD, ready for when 4K TVs became the norm in home. Though similar to the jump from digital to film, compressing 4K data into something watchable on the average TV set also results in something uncanny and not at all lifelike. Not much has changed since then – last yearEsquiredevoted a takedown to the streamer’s “bizarre visual language”.Meanwhile many series and films have fallen short in trying to capture darkness with criticism aimed at Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, The Handmaid’s Tale and The Batman.Our at-home television technology has rapidly been advancing (even if it’s maybe not advancing at Netflix’s schedule), and has also affected how visuals are interpreted on screen. Haghshenas recognises that we can now “see and appreciate the subtle texture that would have been lost a decade ago. So film-makers now have a real incentive to craft detailed, tactile images, knowing the display technology can support those nuances.” Even if immersion is what is aimed for, it can be lost when viewers want to fiddle with settings and lighting at home.“Lighting challenges have always existed, regardless of the aesthetic trends of the time,” says Haghshenas. It’s hard to predict future trends on screen – we saw the 3D come and go, meanwhile immersion seems to be hitting new heights with the Las Vegas Sphere hosting anAI enhanced version of The Wizard of Oz, claiming that it “transports audiences, making them feel like they have stepped inside the film”.The response to Chu’s use of colour in Wicked: For Good has been mixed. Levitt recognises that while it “has more colour than most, it’s still weirdly muted” while Den of Geek’s David Crowbelievesthe issues of lighting and colour are “more glaring” in the sequel. Maybe it’s bad timing – a colourful universe has its biggest expansion in an exceedingly colourless time in cinema.Explore more on these topicsWicked: For GoodWickedFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With as many as 100 HouseRepublicanshad been expected to defy Trump in voting to release the Epstein file, Trump was forced into a humiliating U-turn on the subject last weekend.Jimmy Kimmel accuses Trump of trying to get him fired and tells him: ‘Quiet, piggy’Read moreTrump has frequently had contentious relationships with media organizations. However, questions about Epstein, with whom Trump was close friends for more than a decade, seem to trigger the president more than any other issue he has faced.“Quiet. Quiet, piggy,” Trump, 79,told a reporterfrom Bloomberg on Friday, after she began to ask him why he was behaving so erratically “if there’s nothing incriminating in the files”.In a statement to the Guardian, a White House official said: “This reporter behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way towards her colleagues on the plane. If you’re going to give it, you have to be able to take.”The Guardian asked if the White House was suggesting that the reporter had used the term “piggy” to refer to her colleagues on the plane. The White House did not respond.In any case, it is clear that Trump finds questions about his actions regarding Epstein particularly upsetting. And while Trump, a self-styled tough guy, has curiously been able to restrain himself when responding to questions from men, it is when faced with questions from women that he has exploded.In the Oval Office on Monday, after Trump had paraded around a foreign leader whothe US intelligence committee believesapproved the killing of an American journalist, the president was asked why he decided to “wait for Congress to release the Epstein files” rather than releasing them himself.Trumpreacted furiously, chastising the reporter both for the Epstein question and asking Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, about Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.“It’s not the question that I mind. It’s your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter – it’s the way you ask these questions. You start off with a man [Prince Mohammed] who’s highly respected asking him a horrible insubordinate and just a terrible question – and you could even ask that same exact question nicely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As far as the Epstein files is, I have nothing to do withJeffrey Epstein,” Trump said.The president then spoke for a while about how he believed the media and Democrats had overblown the Epstein saga – despite Republicans and the right wing having spent years demanding the documents be released – before adding: “People are wise to your hoax and ABC is – uh – your company, your crappy company, is one of the perpetrators. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll tell you something, I think the license should be taken away from ABC. Because your news is so fake, and it’s so wrong, and we have a great commissioner, chairman who should look at that.”Trump has frequently reserved his harshest criticism for women,callingfemale journalists“nasty”and infamously referencing menstruationto dismiss questionsfrom Megyn Kelly. It’s clear that questions about Epstein, however, have the president particularly uncomfortable – and unfortunately for Trump, they aren’t likely to go away.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In my view, yes.”View image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: Michael Prescott, Caroline Daniel, Samir Shah and Robbie Gibb.Composite: BBC, Reuters, GettyAlso appearing before MPs, Prescott said he did not believe the BBC was “institutionally biased”, but said he believed the BBC repeatedly failed to properly follow up issues raised at the EGSC.However, Daniel disagreed. “The real issue is the culture of the BBC in terms of the level of attention paid to these issues,” she said.“In my view, the fact that we had a robust committee to debate issues of impartiality … was actually really significant. I think there are few organisations when you actually have that level of auditing internally on a regular basis.”She also disputed the account of the BBC’s US election coverage portrayed in Prescott’s memo. “Michael’s account is a personal account rather than a comprehensive review of everything that was covered in the committee,” she said.Prescott said his memo was a “reasonable edit” of concerns raised, but conceded it was “unbalanced” because it did not include examples of where an internal review had praised the coverage.Claims of political pressure over the memo from within the BBC have focused attention on Robbie Gibb, the board member who was Theresa May’s communications chief in Downing Street.Appearing before the committee, Gibb said he had no intention of resigning, despite BBC staff and some MPs calling for him to leave the corporation because of his political links. He said Prescott’s memo had “been weaponised and I have been a victim of that weaponisation”.Gibb ridiculed the idea of “a coup” from the right. “It is up there as one of the most ridiculous charges,” he said. “It’s complete nonsense. It’s also deeply offensive to fellow board members.“Everyone who knows me knows that I’m hugely impartial,” he said. “I have friends across the political divide. I have impartiality through my bones.” He said he did not think the BBC was institutionally biased.Prescott confirmed he was friends with Gibb and that Gibb had had a role in his appointment, but added that the BBC’s HR department was also involved. He said his memo was all his own work, though based on research by the EGSC’s adviser, the longtime BBC journalist David Grossman.Prescott insisted he had no political bias, as MPs suggested all his criticisms appeared to come from the right. He said he was a “centrist dad” and that he was “no soul mate” of Gibb.Samir Shah, the BBC’s chair, also came under pressure for his own role in the crisis, with accusations that delays in the BBC’s response left the corporation open to attack.He said he had wanted to make sure the board was united and that they were right in understanding the issues. Shah defended Gibb, saying he was interested in accuracy and impartiality. He also said he tried to stop Davie resigning.The most serious issue to emerge from Prescott’s memo was an accusation that the BBC had selectively edited aDonald Trumpspeech to make it appear clearer that he encouraged the US Capitol attack.Prescott said that President Trump was “probably not” defamed by the Panorama edit, over which the president is threatening to sue.Shah and Caroline Thomson, another BBC board member appearing before MPs, said Turness and BBC News wanted to apologise for the edit. However, they said they were among the board members who wanted BBC News to go further in stating the show was misleading about Trump’s role in the Capitol riots.Shah also rejected allegations from a fellow board member, who has since resigned, that he did not properly consult all board members in the run-up to the resignations of Davie and Turness. Shah said he called tech investor Shumeet Banerji on the weekend of the resignations to discuss the situation.Thomson said Shah had “the unanimous support” of the current board.Shah confirmed the Guardian’s report that the BBC wants its new director general to have a deputy responsible for its journalism, to make it a more manageable job.The BBC also confirmed it was reviewing how the EGSC works and its composition. Some BBC insiders believe Gibb had too much power on the body, which recently had only four members.Explore more on these topicsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Ukraine is pressing for Europe to be involved in the talks.The original 28-point US-Russian plan was drawn up last month byKirill Dmitriev, Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, and Trump’s representative Steve Witkoff. It calls on Ukraine to withdraw from cities it controls in the eastern Donbas region, limit the size of its army, and not join Nato.During negotiations on Sunday in Switzerland – led by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak – the plan was substantially revised. It now includes only 19 points. Kyiv and its European partners say the existing frontline has to be the starting point for territorial discussions.On Monday, Zelenskyy said: “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points, no longer 28, and many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework,” adding that sensitive issues were to be discussed with Trump.They say there can be no recognition of land seized byRussiamilitarily, and that Kyiv should make its own decisions on whether to join the EU and Nato – something the Kremlin wants to veto or impose conditions on. Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told the Financial Times such issues had been “placed in brackets” for Trump and Zelenskyy to decide upon later.Map of Ukraine showing areas controlled by Russian forces in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblastsRubio hailed Sunday’s talks as “very very positive”. Writing on Truth Social on Monday, Trump, who days earlier had accused Ukraine’s leadership of having “zero gratitude”, also struck a positive tone.“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!” he wrote.Ukraine’s delegation briefed Zelenskyy about the talks on Monday after returning to Kyiv from Geneva. They described the latest version of the plan as more realistic. Separately, Zelenskyy spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, and urged him to involve European countries in the process. Vance reportedly agreed.But in the clearest sign yet the original 28-point plan – widely seen as favourable to Moscow – still falls short of several key Kremlin demands, Putin’s top foreign policy aide on Monday said Moscow would seek to “rework” parts of it.“We were given some sort of draft … which will require further reworking,” said Yuri Ushakov, adding that “many provisions” of the plan appeared acceptable to Russia, but others would “require the most detailed discussions and review between the parties”.Underscoring the Kremlin’s hardline stance, Ushakov said Moscow would reject a European counter-proposal from the weekend, which, according to a copy seen by Reuters, changes the meaning and significance of key points concerning Nato membership and territory.“The European plan, at first glance … is completely unconstructive and does not work for us,” he said.The UK and EU were blind-sided last week when the original plan was leaked to US media. Thearmy secretary, Dan Driscoll– Vance’s friend and university classmate – was sent to Kyiv with a military delegation to brief Zelenskyy on its contents.Since then, European governments have sought to revise the document, which appears to have originally been written in Russian. EU leaders attending an EU-Africa summit in Angola welcomed a degree of progress, but said far more work remained to be done and insisted Europe must be fully involved and Russia must be present if talks were to advance substantively.The European Council president, António Costa, praised “a new momentum”, saying after talks on the sidelines of the summit that while issues remained, “the direction is positive”.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also called the “refined peace framework” agreed in Switzerland “a solid basis for moving forward”, but added: “Work remains to be done.”Von der Leyen said the core principles the EU would always insist on were that “Ukraine’s territory and sovereignty must be respected – only Ukraine, as a sovereign country, can make decisions regarding its armed forces”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the talks were delicate because “nobody wants to put off the Americans and President Trump from having the US on our side in this process”.Tusk also stressed that any peace settlement needed to “strengthen, not weaken, our security” and must not “favour the aggressor”. Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said Russia “must be forced to the negotiating table” to see “aggression … never pays”.Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, said there was more work to do but progress was being made. A group of countries supporting Ukraine – the coalition of the willing – would discuss the issue in a video call on Tuesday, he said.The chairs of the parliamentary foreign affairs committees of 20 European countries, including France, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the UK, issued a rare joint statement saying just and lasting peace would not be achieved by “yielding to the aggressor” but must be “grounded in international law and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty”.On Monday,the White House pushed back against criticism, including from within the Republican party, that Trump is favouring Russia.“The idea that the US is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters.Zelenskyy is at his most vulnerable since the start of the war, after a corruption scandal led to two of his ministers being dismissed while Russia makes battlefield gains.Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, was hit by what officials said was a massive drone attack that killed four people on Sunday. With smoke rising from the rubble, one man was seen crouched and holding the hand of a dead person.“There was a family, there were children,” Ihor Klymenko, Red Cross commander of the emergency response team in Kharkiv, told Reuters. “I can’t tell you how, but the children are alive, thank God, the man is alive. The woman died, unfortunately.”Across the border, Russian air defences downed Ukrainian drones en route to Moscow, forcing three airports serving the capital to pause flights. A reported Ukrainian drone strike on Sunday knocked power out for thousands of residents near Moscow, a rare reversal of Russian attacks on energy targets that regularly cause power blackouts for millions of Ukrainians.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Have I ever tried to take it out on any individual on the basis of where they’re from? No.”The interviewer accused him of caveating his answer, and asked again if he categorically denied the claims.“I would never, ever do it in a hurtful or insulting way,” Farage responded. “It’s 49 years ago. It’s 49 years ago. I had just entered my teens. Can I remember everything that happened at school? No, I can’t. Have I ever been part of an extremist organisation or engaged in direct, unpleasant, personal abuse, genuine abuse, on that basis? No.”Challenged again about whether he had racially abused anyone, Farage responded: “No, not with intent.”When the interviewer told Farage that he did not understand what he meant by “not with intent”, the Reform leader responded: “You wouldn’t.”Farage added: “No. I have never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody.”Last Tuesday, contemporaries accused Farage, 61, of racist behaviour at Dulwich college, including the targeting of minority ethnic children for abuse, singing a “Gas ’em all” song that referred to the killing of Jewish, black and south-east Asian people, and burning a school roll in a year when there were said to be more Patels than Smiths.The alleged behaviour spanned a number of years until Farage was 18.Among those who have accused of Farage of racist behaviour at Dulwich college was the Bafta and Emmy-winning director Peter Ettedgui, 61, who claimed Farage, when 13 and 14 years old,would sidle up to him and growl “Hitler was right” or “Gas them”.Another minority ethnic pupil claimed that when he was around nine years old he was similarly targeted by a 17-year-old Farage.“He walked up to a pupil flanked by two similarly tall mates and spoke to anyone looking ‘different’,” the pupil said. “That included me on three occasions; asking me where I was from, and pointing away, saying: ‘That’s the way back,’ to wherever you replied you were from.”Farage had not personally responded to the claims until his interview on Monday.His spokesperson had previously said the claims were “without foundation”, and questioned why some of those who had given testimony had not made the claims before.“If things like this happened a very, very long time ago, you can’t necessarily recollect what happened,” the spokesperson had said.“Our statement was very clear that these allegations date back 45 years. And I think that at any point in time, when Nigel was leader of Ukip, when he stood in the 2010 general election, the 2015 general election, during Brexit, maybe in the 2019 general election, you would have to ask yourself, why didn’t this come up before?”Asked if Farage therefore believed those who made the allegations were inventing them, the spokesperson said: “I’m saying there is no primary evidence. It’s one person’s word against another.”Farage’s refusal to address the claims in public last week prompted Keir Starmer to call him “spineless”.On aToday in Focus podcastlast week, Ettedgui, whose credits as a director include Kinky Boots, McQueen and Super/Man: the Christopher Reeve Story, had spoken of his anger at the response from Reform.He said: “The easiest thing for him to have said when these allegations first came up would have been: ‘Yes, I did say some extraordinarily upsetting things to people that were racist. And I unreservedly apologise to them for that. But I can assure them and the general public that this has nothing to do with my politics today.’ He’s never said that.“I mean, there was a statement that went out from someone from Reform, a spokesperson from Reform. He says there’s no primary evidence, it’s one person’s word against another. If things like this happened a very, very long time ago, you can’t necessarily recollect what happened. I mean, that makes me really, really angry. Because of course you can, you know, of course I can.”Mike Katz, Labour peer and former chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said: “Farage seems to think that you can racially abuse people without it being hurtful and insulting. Let’s be crystal clear: you can’t.“Farage refuses to discipline the racist views of his MPs and he won’t take action on the toxic culture within his party. He should finally come clean on claims over his past and apologise to those who bravely spoke out. Failure to do so would be yet more evidence that Farage is simply unfit for office.”The Liberal Democrat president-elect, Josh Babarinde, said: “The Reform leader’s refusal to deny that he’s said these racist remarks is unbecoming from someone who wants to be our next prime minister.“The British people deserve a straight answer. It looks like the mask has slipped and fact-of-the-matter Farage is turning into no-answers-Nigel.”Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is due to write to the health secretary later this week, the Telegraph reported.Sunak, who is leading a cross-party alliance of 125 MPs, met Streeting on Monday evening to hand him an open letter urging the government to introduce tests so men at the highest risk,including Black men, men with a family history of prostate, breast or ovarian cancer, and those carrying the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are “no longer left behind”.David Cameron reveals prostate cancer diagnosis and calls for targeted screeningRead moreThe letter says: “Our current opportunistic PSA [prostate-specific antigen]testing systemis unstructured, inefficient and unfair – a postcode lottery where some men succeed because they know to ask or can pay privately, while others are turned away despite repeated requests.“Yet the data hide what cannot be modelled: eroded trust among communities who feel abandoned. Black men,already at higher risk, often believe the system fails them. Families bear devastating emotional and financial burdens from late-stage disease – costs absent from formal modelling but among the most compelling reasons to act.“We now have the tools to deliver screening safely and effectively, yet the system is frozen waiting for next-generation trial data.“Waiting would entrench inequality and allow preventable deaths. Evidence is strong enough to act now. Perfection must not be the enemy of progress.”The push comes a day afterDavid Cameron disclosed he was treated for prostate cancer.He called for a targeted screening programme.Cameron, 59, told the Times: “You always hope for the best. You have a high PSA score – that’s probably nothing.“You have an MRI scan with a few black marks on it. You think, ‘Ah, that’s probably OK.’ But when the biopsy comes back, and it says you have got prostate cancer.“You always dread hearing those words. And then literally as they’re coming out of the doctor’s mouth you’re thinking: ‘Oh, no, he’s going to say it. He’s going to say it. Oh God, he said it.’”Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, with about 55,000 new cases every year.There is no screening programme for the form of the disease in the UK because of concerns about the accuracy of PSA tests.A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last monthsuggestedprostate cancer screening could reduce deaths by 13%.Researchers found that one death from prostate cancer was prevented for every 456 men who were invited for screening and that one death from prostate cancer was averted for every 12 men in whom prostate cancer was diagnosed.Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerHealthNHSRishi SunakWes StreetingDavid CameronnewsShareReuse this content"

There might be 99% or 95% that you like, but 1% or 5% that you don’t,” she said.The chancellor met MPs in parliament on Monday night promising them that tax rises would be kept to a minimum and that the budget would prioritise cutting the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and cutting the cost of debt, saying the last part was just as vital because of the need to lower borrowing costs to free up more money for public services.The chancellor said she was “determined to keep the contributions people make as low as possible” and said businesses would benefit from action to cut the cost of living, meaning people would have more disposable income.Reeves is expected to reveal in this week’s budget that the UK’s economic growth forecasts have been downgraded in each of the next five years despite the government naming growth as its number one mission at the last election.“Cutting the cost of living was the thing that we all campaigned on, because we know that inflation reaching double digits, interest rates going through the roof, the economic instability under the previous government cost all our constituents dearly,” she said.“We’ve increased the ‘national living wage’ and the national minimum wage. We’ve protected the triple lock, increasing it last year and increasing it again from next April. We have properly funded free childcare commitments. We’re rolling out free breakfast clubs at primary schools for all children, and extending free school meals to an additional half a million children.“But I know that there is more to do, which is why we have already announced a freeze in prescription charges and rail fares. But there is more we can – and will – do.“On Wednesday, this will be a fair budget. It will be a budget that delivers strong foundations, secures our future and delivers on our promise of change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the spending measures expected are the lifting of the two-child benefit cap and action to make cuts to energy bills, policies that are likely to be popular with MPs.But since rejecting a long-trailed potential rise in income tax, the Treasury will seek to fill its fiscal hole with a string of different tax measures, including a potential new property levy on high-value properties, an income tax threshold freeze for two more years, apay-per-mile schemefor electric cars and measures to makesalary sacrifice schemes less generous.The chancellor said that budget speculation in the run-up to Wednesday had been “incredibly destabilising” – and compared it with the previous year’s budget, where rumours were run about pension reforms that contributed to people taking out lump sums early and then the reforms were not enacted. “They are not serving their readers at all,” Reeves told MPs.Reeves said the Office forBudgetResponsibility’s report on Wednesday would conclude that a downgrade of productivity was a result of Brexit and the Conservatives’ austerity measures – and would say explicitly that it was not due to the policies of the current government.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesLabourTax and spendingEconomic policyBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the children, surrounded by horses, donkeys and chickens, were homeschooled. Weekly trips to San Salvo, a town on the Adriatic coast with a population of 20,000, exposed them to the outside world.But the idyllic life came under scrutiny from local social services in September last year when the entire family was hospitalised after eating poisonous mushrooms picked from the woods.The authorities investigated further and found the family’s dwelling to be “dilapidated, in terrible hygienic conditions and lacking the necessary utilities”, a court document showed.Last week, the judge of a juvenile court in L’Aquila upheld a prosecutor’s claims that the children were suffering from “serious and harmful violations” of their rights owing to living off-grid, and ordered their removal. They were taken away by police on Thursday afternoon and taken to a church-run facility. Their mother is with them, although both parents have limited access to their children, according to their lawyer, Giovanni Angelucci.In its ruling, the juvenile court noted that “the family unit lives in housing hardship” and has “no social interaction, no fixed income”, while the home “has no toilet facilities” and “the children do not attend school”.As they awaited the court’s decision, Trevallion and Birmingham gave several interviews to the press, generating support from thousands who signed an online petition calling for the family to be kept together.Trevallion described the children’s removal as “a great heartbreak” that had caused them “shock”. “It was the worst night of my life,” he told the local news site,Il Centro, the day after the children were taken away, adding that in the care facility they were made to sleep in a separate room to their mother. “This is the hardest thing,” he added. “It’s a terrible situation.”He toldLa Repubblica: “We live outside of the system … this is what they’re accusing us of. They are ruining the life of a happy family.”Trevallion declined to speak further on Monday and Birmingham could not be reached for comment.Angelucci said the couple would appeal against the removal of their children, claiming that the judge’s report contained “falsehoods”, especially related to their schooling.The couple met while travelling in Bali and contemplated raising their family in Spain before settling inItaly. Trevallion told La Repubblica they would like to stay in the country but were also ready to move to Australia.The case has generated political controversy and a backlash against the juvenile court’s top judge, Cecilia Angrisano.Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, expressed “alarm” over the children being taken into care and instructed her justice minister, Carlo Nordio, to assess whether there were grounds to send inspectors. The deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, compared the case to a kidnapping.Italian magistrates often come under attack by Meloni’s government, and the ANM union on Monday warned against the “exploitation” of the case, saying the court’s decision was based on factors including the children’s safety, sanitary conditions and education.Chiara Saraceno, a well known Italian sociologist, said: “It is very difficult to understand what is happening there. But there is nothing wrong with wanting to provide an alternative education. The problem is how isolated these children were and how hygienic their [living] conditions were.”However, Saraceno questioned the focus of the social services on this particular case, when “so many impoverished children live in houses”. “In these cases, you have to wonder: where are the social workers?”Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Farage replied: “Not necessarily racist things. It depends how you define it.”Crick pressed Farage on the letter’s accusation that he had taunted someone in class and was excluded, suggesting the taunts had been on racial grounds. Farage said: “I was excluded from class dozens of times all over the years.” He said he did not accept this was for racist comments.14 May 2019Response to the anonymous Independent letterThe Independent publishedan anonymous letterby a former school friend of Farage. The letter writer,who later revealed himselfas Jean-Pierre Lihou, wrote of vividly recalling Farage’s interest in his initials, NF, and the symbol of the National Front. He said he recalled Farage singing “Gas ’em all”, shouting “Send ’em home”, and talking about Oswald Mosley.Farage did not respond directly to the claims. He said: “To say that this is going over old ground is an understatement. The period during which I was at Dulwich was highly politically charged with the rise of Thatcherism to the Brixton riots just down the road.“There were many people of that time who were attracted to extreme groups on both sides of the debate.”He added: “Whoever sent you this must be a little out of touch to say that I supported Oswald Mosley as he believed in a United States of Europe. Some people need to get over Brexit.”November 2021Crick’s biography of FarageCrick returned to the subject of Farage with a biography, One Party After Another (disclosure: Henry Dyer acted as a researcher for the book). Crick had new details on the subject of Farage’s school days, with contemporaries making allegations of racist and antisemitic language and abuse. Others said they had never heard him saying anything racist or insulting.Farage told Crick in an email: “Let’s get one thing straight. I joined the Conservative party in 1978, and thought all of the far right parties/movements to be ludicrous/barmy/dangerous. There were some hard left class-of-1968 masters [who] joined the College and several of us thoroughly enjoyed winding them up.“Terms of abuse thrown around between fifteen-year-old boys were limitless; there were no boundaries. I think red-haired boys fared especially badly.”16 October 2025The first letter from a barrister for Reform UKAdam Richardson, barrister for Reform UK, responded when the Guardian approached Farage to comment on the fresh claims that contemporaries had made of racist and antisemitic language and abuse.The denial was emphatic. Richardson described the allegations as “wholly untrue”.Richardson said: “The suggestion that Mr Farage ever engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour is categorically denied.”27 October 2025The second letterRichardson responded again after the Guardian asked Farage to comment on the testimonies and concerns of contemporaries. Richardson said Farage “does not intend to respond to the frankly farcical recollections from 40 years ago since Mr Farage has become a political figure as they are simply not credible and conjecture.”He added: “However, should the Guardian publish any allegation suggesting that Mr Farage engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour, or that such claims bear upon his present character, you can expect proceedings to be issued forthwith. Those proceedings will seek an injunction, a public retraction, and the maximum award of damages permissible, including aggravated damages for malicious publication.”10 November 2025The third letterThe Guardian noted the change in Farage’s response compared with his 2013 and 2019 comments, and asked Richardson why Farage now claimed allegations relating to racism and antisemitism were “wholly untrue”.Richardson reiterated: “The allegations that Mr Farage engaged in racist or antisemitic behaviour are wholly untrue, defamatory, and malicious.”11 November 2025‘These allegations are entirely without foundation’Pressed to comment, a spokesperson for Reform UK said: “These allegations are entirely without foundation. The Guardian has produced no contemporaneous record or corroborating evidence to support these disputed recollections from nearly 50 years ago.“It is no coincidence that this newspaper seeks to discredit Reform UK – a party that has led in over 150 consecutive opinion polls and whose leader bookmakers now have as the favourite to be the next prime minister.“We fully expect these cynical attempts to smear Reform and mislead the public to intensify further as we move closer to the next election.”19 November 2025‘One person’s word against another’After a session of prime minister’s questions in whichKeir Starmer called on Farage to explain himselfin light of the Guardian’s reporting, Farage’s spokesperson was questioned by journalists.The spokesperson said: “Our statement was very clear that these allegations date back 45 years. And I think that at any point in time, when Nigel was leader of Ukip, when he stood in the 2010 general election, the 2015 general election, during Brexit, maybe in the 2019 general election, you would have to ask yourself, why didn’t this come up before?”Asked if Farage therefore believed those who made the allegations were inventing them, the spokesperson said: “I’m saying there is no primary evidence. It’s one person’s word against another.”Twenty peoplehave spoken to the Guardian to allege he has a racist past.24th November 2025‘Never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody’In a broadcast interview, Farage’s response changed from the outright denials his representatives had given.Asked if he had racially abused fellow pupils at school, he replied: “No, this is 49 years ago by the way, 49 years ago. Have I ever tried to take it out on any individual on the basis of where they’re from? No.”The interviewer accused him of caveating his answer, and asked again if he categorically denied the claims.“I would never, ever do it in a hurtful or insulting way,” Farage responded. “It’s 49 years ago. It’s 49 years ago. I had just entered my teens. Can I remember everything that happened at school? No, I can’t. Have I ever been part of an extremist organisation or engaged in direct, unpleasant, personal abuse, genuine abuse, on that basis? No.”Challenged again about whether he had racially abused anyone, Farage responded: “No, not with intent.”When the interviewer told Farage that he did not understand what he meant by “not with intent”, the Reform leader responded: “You wouldn’t.”Farage added: “No. I have never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Sad to see,”wrotefar-right activist Laura Loomer, one of Trump’s most fervent online backers.She returned to the theme several times. “I had to drink a bottle of ginger ale today after seeing Mamdani in the Oval Office because it physically nauseates me seeing Islamic jihadists infiltrate our government and continue to get a pass to promote Islamic jihad and anti-American values with zero push back,” Loomerwrote.In Friday’s news conference, Trump retreated from his previous all-out opposition, forecasting that Mamdani “can do a very good job” as mayor, despite having previously threatened to withhold funds from New York for electing him.Loomer seized on that to predict that theRepublicanswould suffer catastrophic defeats at next year’s congressional elections and in the 2028 presidential election.“The Democrats will have a landslide in the midterms after today. Mamdani is the face of the Democrat party,” shewrote. “How will the GOP campaign ahead of 2026 if Mamdani and his policies are now considered rational and good for New York?”Elise Stefanik, a member of Congress who is running to be New York state governor next year, had a similar reaction.“We all want NYC to succeed,” shewrote. “But we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one. If he walks like a jihadist. If he talks like a jihadist. If he campaigns like a jihadist. If he supports jihadists – he’s a jihadist.”Inna Vernikov, a Republican New York city councillor,wrotethat she was “disappointed” that Trump had “legitimized” Mamdani.“We should never KOSHER a Marxist with Jihadist aligned views,” she posted. “Did we forget that@ZohranKMamdaniwants to cease [sic] the means of production, disproportionately tax white neighborhoods, & eliminate the anti-terror unit? Did we forget that he refused to condemn ‘globalize the intifada,’ refused to condemn Hamas.?”Benny Johnson, a pro-Trump influencer, seemed to implicitly condemn the president’s approach by highlighting a hardball question posed by fellow activist, Jack Posobiec, who asked Mamdani if he was planning “race-based property taxes” on white people.“This is how it’s done@JackPosobiec,” hewrote.But not all Trump supporters were downcast.Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist who has praised Mamdani’s skills and depicted him as a political threat, suggested Trump was using political subtlety.“He’s going to boost Mr Mamdani, whose policies will crater the city,” Bannon said in a discussion with Posobiec on his War Room podcast. “Trump will let him collapse because he’s a Marxist jihadist.”Some Mamdani supporters seemed as disorientated as Trump backers by the show of harmony.Jumaane Williams, New York’s public advocate and a Democrat, called the meeting “pretty shocking”.“My belief is that it would have went well, just knowing who our mayor is. But I don’t think anyone could have expected this,” he toldSpectrum News NY1.“I think the proof is in the pudding. But we may have staved off what was [an] inevitability in just a few weeks. And so the longer we can stave off harmful things to our city, the better.”Bill de Blasio, a former Democratic mayor of New York who endorsed Mamdani’s candidacy, said the meeting reflected his own meetings with Trump in the White House.“I think Trump has actually a lot of respect for Mamdani. As they say, game respects game,” he told CNN. “I had this same exact experience. I went to meet with Trump 10 days after the 2016 election. What I learned is, if you engage Trump and you show him you’re not afraid, he is actually willing to do some give and take.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

But, on the other hand, it’s an incredibly accessible art form. And actually, anyone can make a stop-motion animation in their home with very minimal equipment.”The exhibition will feature 150 items, including sets and storyboards such as the train chase scene from Wallace & Gromit: The Wrong Trousers.He said: “I don’t think a stop-motion sequence quite like that had ever been filmed before. Just to see how they planned it out at the storyboard stage before they do any filming or modern making is really lovely.”View image in fullscreenThe Aardman exhibition at the Young V&A will include 150 items, including the submarine from Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Photograph: David Parry/V&AThere will also be the interior and exterior of the submarine used by Wallace and Gromit’s arch nemesis, Feathers McGraw, inVengeance Most Fowl.

It considered trying to host the Art of Aardman, which toured in 2023, but the institution, which has had a major refurbishment and wasnamed museum of the year in 2024, decided to work on something more suited to its younger audience.The exhibition will be a key part of Aardman’s 50th anniversary celebrations, which will take place throughout 2026.Peter Lord andDavid Sproxtonfounded the UK’s biggest animation production company while still at school, producing early projects on their kitchen tables.

The duo have since appeared in four short and two feature-length films, becoming the studio’s best-loved creations in the process. The animation studio has won four Oscars and has ventured into video games.In an interview in 2009, Park said he believed Wallace and Gromit remained popular because they were distinctly British. “The fact they’re made from plasticine means their faces can convey emotions very subtly,” he said. “Gromit says a lot just by raising one sardonic eyebrow.”In 2018, Lord and Sproxtonhanded over a 75% stake in the business to their 140 employeesin order to “safeguard independence” for the studio.

The empire that’s dominated Europe for five centuries is on the brink of collapse, its capital at the mercy of a barbarian leader. What do the people do? They do as they’ve always done. The rich scramble to hide their wealth. The poor run for their lives. The fateful decisions of a tiny number of power-obsessed men bring the mightiest civilisation on Earth to its knees. Sounds familiar? And yet.

An equally un-self-aware era when it was totally fine for a Tory politician in trilby and tie (Kenneth Clark) to chart western culture’s triumph over the barbarians. (Some may say:plus ça change.) Next, in 2018, came its well-intentioned successor fronted by Simon Schama, Mary Beard and David Olusoga. Which, like a weak emperor, was trying to be everything to everyone and thus, not unlike ancient Rome’s Honorius, suffered mixed reviews and plunging ratings. Now the sumptuous threequel strides into the arena, all fire, war, disease, disaster and slick Netflix-era dramatic re-enactments. It also comes, somewhat aptly, at a time of deep existential crisis within the BBC itself. Which in less ancient times was the instrument of another empire that fell …In Civilisations: Rise and Fall, beautifully narrated by Sophie Okonedo, the emphasis is not on the rise but the fall of four ancient worlds: Rome, Egypt, the Aztecs and the samurai of Japan. One by one, they go down due to a set of circumstances with which we present-day civilians are grimly familiar. Climate catastrophe, war, pandemic, mass migration, the insatiable greed generated by colonisation, gross inequality … Need I go on? Valerie Amos, one of the series’ commentators, says it best: “The seeds of a society’s destruction are sown within it.” Modern civilisation, take note.View image in fullscreenSet in stone … statues in the British Museum, featured in Civilisations: Rise and Fall.Photograph: Ikram Ahmed/BBC/BBC StudiosEach monumental nosedive is brought to life by an on-trend compendium of diverse experts – Antony Gormley on a 550-year-old Aztec turquoise skull! Alastair Campbell on the toxic dynasty of the Ptolemies! Alongside this are re-enactments featuring bejewelled and berobed actors staring portentously into the middle distance to make up for the lack of dialogue that mostly had my blood thirsting for a rewatch of Game of Thrones, Shōgun, even Gladiator.Standing for all the brutal history is a choice selection of cultural artefacts held in the British Museum. How exactly we came to possess such ancient treasures as a 2,050-year-old head of Augustus, or the Rosetta Stone – whose Egyptian hieroglyphs are interpreted here to illuminate one of Cleopatra’s most important decisions – or one of the most lethal samurai swords ever created, is not part of the story. Which is a shame because actually it very much is. Who knows, perhaps reparation will be the subject of Civilisations: 4? In the meantime, I recommend watchingEmpire with David Olusogaas an excellent, if unintended, companion piece.The objects really are extraordinary. Such as the ornate silver Projecta casket (AD350-400), used in the first episode to tell the age-old story of how the vast wealth held by the super-rich 1% of Roman elites led to less going into the imperial coffers, and ultimately to the empire’s downfall. “Wealth inequality is the most common and crucial element in societal collapse,” says Luke Kemp of the Orwellian-sounding Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and one of Civilisations’ most astute commentators. “It corrodes the social fabric … hollows out societies, leaving them to be a brittle shell which can be cracked asunder by numerous different shocks.”View image in fullscreenWhy spend your own downtime in a state of extreme anxiety? … Civilisations: Rise and Fall.Photograph: BBC/BBC Studios/Marcell PitiCivilisations: Rise and Fall reminds us, over and over, that the past is the place to go for the solutions to what’s going so catastrophically wrong in our present. Nice idea, if only those in power were capable of learning the lessons of history. At the same time, the artefacts reveal that nothing changes. Humans are as awful as they ever were. Consider a 1,875-year-old terracotta theatre mask expressing deep-seated Roman prejudices towards northern peoples, which leads a commentator to explain the racist root of the word “barbarian”. It comes from the ancient Greekbárbarosand was used to describe the “bar-bar” of foreign languages that the Greeks, then the Romans, couldn’t understand or accept.It’s gripping, if despairing stuff. And mightily stressful to watch, using running countdowns – 15 years until the fall … eight years … two years … The Fall! – to demonstrate history’s terrifying and inexorable march. Gone are the days of Mary Beard trotting round Rome in her high tops, rhapsodising over some crumbling epitaph. Documentaries about ancient history have become more immediate and frightening – necessarily so. As Kemp puts it: “Every civilisation throughout history has had an expiry date.” Considering we can’t know ours, the apocalyptic nature of much of our viewing schedules these days is … interesting. We seem to want to spend our ever-narrowing downtime in a state of extreme anxiety. I guess it must be the stage we’re at in our own demise.Civilisations: Rise and Fall aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewHistoryClassics and ancient historyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Gemma’s norks are “in agony”, her lactation-based woes exacerbated by sleep deprivation and the fact that her insufferable berk of a mother is currently stuffing the spare room with statement cushions and endless unasked-for reflections on her butcher boyfriend’s cleaver. “It’s been three months now,” says Gemma, fixing Rita with a thousand-nappy stare. “It’s hell.”There is much of this sort of thing in Danielle Ward’s Daddy Issues, the second series of which arrives amid celestial parps of jubilation and the assurance that everything will be OK … ish. Eventually. (Hopefully). Currently, however, all is not tickety-boo in Stockport. To the joys of single motherhood Gemma must now add mum Davina (previously Susan Lynch but now played, with no little glee, by Jill Halfpenny), who has invited her current squeeze, “the sausage man”, back to her daughter’s flat. (“He turned up with a massive pack of chops, Gemma. I weren’t gonna say no.”)Davina operates within a mushroom cloud of delusion. Every utterance is delivered with nose aloft and glitzy bosom directed ceiling-wards, in the manner of Jane McDonald sharing an anecdote about her tights with a Channel 5 camera crew. Davina’s contributions to the household include bitching about baby Sadie’s nappies and making passive-aggressive comments about Gemma’s weight. “My cousin was eight stone just one month after giving birth,” she informs Gemma, sweetly. “Mum,” replies Gemma with fathomless patience. “She was in a coma.”Brilliantly acerbic though the first series of Daddy Issues was, you sensed it never felt entirely at ease with itself. It was too broad-brushed in some places and slack-trousered in others. At times it bore the baby giraffe gait of a new comedy struggling to find its knees, never mind its feet. But oh, the second series. Not only has it found its feet, it has Deep Heated its knees and – if we can toss another tortured idiom into the ball pit – hit the ground sprinting. Much of this is down to David Morrissey as Gemma’s dad Malcolm, a perpetually deflating travel-mattress of a man, forever panicking as another puncture springs up while he’s still struggling to apply sticking plasters to the previous seven. Having been booted out of Gemma’s flat at the end of the first series, Malcolm has returned to the dilapidated bedsit of his terminally divorced friend (and “emotional support dickhead”) Derek. And galvanised by his newfound responsibilities as a grandfather, he has made himself useful by installing a flap in the bedsit’s boarded-up front door. “It’s like a cat flap,” he explains. “But for fellas.”Here, amid the incessant rat-tat-tat of sublime one-liners, is a comedy with enormous affection for its characters. For all their buffoonery, these are complex and believable souls. Not that its softer bits are ever mawkish, mind. Nor is there ever the sense that its trickier themes (fractured families, young motherhood) are being shoehorned in to Generate Debate® or to #make_u_think. Instead, it’s all folded in together: love, regret, fear, daftness, joy, boredom, urinary tract infections and any other number of everyday messes, because, well, that’s life innit. And so, when the ever-eager Malcolm brings Gemma toast in bed and promises to help out “for ever” with Sadie, we leave on a shot of Gemma’s childlike face flitting, as it so often does, between gratitude, guilt and the knowledge that there is no easy way out of the situation in which she is now wedged.Similarly, when Derek (a character whose seething misogyny would have been dialled down in lesser comedies) threatens in episode two to embark on a redemption arc, any actual progress is swiftly extinguished with a damp tea-towel. In Daddy Issues the irredeemable remain irredeemable, their hopelessness allowing the marginally less hopeless to huddle closer together and reassure themselves of their moral superiority. Before calling the guilty party a dickhead, obviously.“Might as well come back, then,” says Gemma to Malcolm, ushering him, and us, into a future lined with love, doubt and cat flaps for fellas. Join her? Really, you’d be a dickhead not to.Daddy Issues series two aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyAimee Lou WoodComedyParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

And what explains the pronounced gender gap?Mon 24 Nov 2025 12.09 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 13.33 ESTShareName:Rage rooms.Appearance:Full of old appliances and angry women.Hang on, rage rooms aren’t new, are they?No, the idea of charging people to smash stuff up safely as a form of commercialised catharsis reportedly emerged in Japan in 2008, around the same time Chicago entrepreneur Donna Alexander started charging people $5 to break things in her garage. But it really went global in 2015 and 2016.Ah, yes,the Brexit vote, the first Trump administration– angry times.Makes sense. So, what’s new?They’re booming again, especially with women. The Times reports bookings at Virgin’s Ultimate Xtreme Rage Room are up 219%. Weston-super-Mare’s Activity Dome has seen a surge of 150%, and 90% of them are women.Funny, I never imagined Weston-super-Mare as a particularly angry place.Oh, it’s seething. And the local rage room is “a very popular emotional outlet for ladies who want to relieve work, relationship and childcare stress”, according to manager Tyler Austin.Not to mention irritation at being called“ladies”.Be thankful it wasn’t “feisty ladies”, I suppose.So what’s bringing women to rage rooms – are we getting angrier?Yep – in 2022,BBC analysisof Gallup polling data from around the world showed women’s anger levels rising over the preceding decade. In 2017 (when #MeToo went mainstream) they started diverging from men and by 2021, there was a 6% gender anger gap. Women taking on adisproportionate caring burdenduring the pandemic definitely didn’t help.Nor did the recent rollback of reproductive rights inthe US, I reckon.Or the fact that women in the UK have been working for free since last Saturday, thanks to thegender pay gap. And of course, ole “grab them by the pussy” is back in the White House, calling afemale reporter “piggy”. Also, men sneezing violently and loudly.Yes! What is that about?!That’s probably an “emotional outlet” too.But what if you don’t feel up to smashing stuff? It sounds awfully energetic. Women are exhausted, what withthe mental load, worrying aboutsexual assaultand wondering if their faces are so offensive to the male gaze, they need adeep plane facelift.How aboutscreaming?Scream clubs, where you meet in public to let it all out, are all the rage.Any quieter options?Dr Jennifer Cox, who wrotea book about women’s anger, suggests underwater screaming, whacking a pile of coats with a wooden spoon, “hurling ice cubes at a patio or slapping a wet flannel into a sink”. But wouldn’t it feel incredible to just smash something?I’d go to a rage room with wall-to-wall printers. They’re the only thing worse than the patriarchy.Well, Johannes Gutenbergwasa man.Do say:“Women need safe, satisfying outlets for their anger, darling …”Don’t say:“… so I trashed your Tesla with your golf clubs.”Explore more on these topicsWomenPass notesHealth & wellbeingMental healthHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On this important day, I knew where I needed to be ...Mon 24 Nov 2025 12.06 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 13.32 ESTShareIt would have been my late mother’s birthday last Monday, and because I am either astronomically stupid or fathomlessly wise, I elected to spend it at a public meeting about nuclear disarmament. I’d call it a blast from the past, except I feel superstitious about introducing explode-y words too near the nuclear topic.I spent my entire childhood worrying about nuclear war, partly because it was the 80s, and everyone did, and partly because we spent our lives demonstrating against it. We had “Protest and Survive” stickers everywhere, in droll parody of the public information booklet “Protect and Survive”, along with “Nuclear Power? No Thanks”. We were also early adopters of climate change anxiety, while fiercely against the closure of coalmines. If you’re wondering where we expected to get our power from, well, obviously we didn’t need central heating: the combination of political fervour and long johns was very warming. When I say we, of course I mean “my mother”; my sister and I had very little agency in this quest for peace.We did go toGreenham Common, site of the women’s peace camp, but never stayed over, and that’s not the bit that stayed in my mind. I remember endless marches through central London, ending with some speakers – they all seemed to be vicars, except one, who was always Tony Benn. They would describe in exquisite detail all the things a hydrogen bomb would do to your flesh, and the flesh of your loved ones and pets, and then what would happen to the teeth and gums of anyone whose flesh had mysteriously been spared. It strikes me now as a bit medieval – godly men getting excited about mortification. But back then all I thought was: I am bored and terrified at the same time,how is that possible?The anti-nuclear argument has moved on, changed beyond all recognition, although the personnel hasn’t. Prof Mary Kaldor was a giant in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), then its Europe-wide arm, END. She spoke last week, havingauthored a reportwhich says that the nuclear deterrence paradigm is basically bust. It was an answer to yesterday’s problems – and actually, the cold war began three-quarters of a century ago, so it’s very much the day before yesterday – and today’s threats are different. Our enemies will come at us with hybrid warfare, designed to destroy democracy from within by sowing chaos, disorder and polarisation. Russia could use a drone or a bot farm or a misinformation campaign or£30,000 in the pocket of the now former leader of the Reform party in Wales, but in none of those scenarios would threatening to annihilate a quarter of a million of their civilians be very helpful.My mum died this year. And the glut of apples from her tree has brought with it a new kind of grief | Zoe WilliamsRead moreIt would be better – and cheaper – Kaldor suggested at the meeting, to build democratic resilience from within. Someone else said later that land armies hate nuclear weapons, because they scorch the territory, make it un-takeable; and the only people who liked nukes were the navy. Then an ex-Marine said: “Are you kidding? The navy hates them too, because they’re so expensive, and there’s no money left for the fun stuff.” I guess he meant boats? Anyway, it was fascinating, but it was also bittersweet, as I could imagine my mum hopping up and down, saying: “But … tell them about the incinerated flesh! This is nothing like scary enough!”Then the nuclear physicist Patricia Lewis made the elegant argument that no population, given the choice, would ever use a nuclear weapon, and all autocracies knew that: the only way these weapons could work as a real threat is if democracies stopped listening to their people, which is to say, became less democratic. So the real thing nuclear weapons deter is democracy itself. My mother would have loved that, though she definitely would have stood up at the end, saying: “This is more of a statement than a question: why, oh why is nobody talking about radiation sickness?”Anyway, I marked her birthday equal parts missing her and freshly committed to opposing nuclear obliteration – which is pretty much what she would have wanted.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The two are inseparable: her story justifies the crackdown. It moralises the crackdown. And it silences criticism of the crackdown. Sold as an origin story from within an immigrant and racialised experience, the purpose is to imbue her politics with sacred authenticity – the credibility of the first person. It is clever and effective. It is cynical and disgraceful.“I am the child of immigrants” is how Mahmood now starts her fable. Immigrants who came here legally. She goes on to tell us that immigration is tearing this country apart, and proposes policies that mean UK-born children, who have known no life anywhere else,will be deported. As she launches policies that willleave refugees homelessand without support, tear families apart, punish those legally in the country for claiming any benefits and make settlement and security a long and arduous process,Mahmood declares: “this is a moral mission for me”.A test of logic for sure, but the story can help. You see, after being accused of “stoking division” with “immoderate language”, Mahmood says “unfortunately, I am the one who is regularly called a ‘fucking Paki’ and told to ‘go back home’.” Sheknows –better than virtue-signalling white people – what the trenches actually look like. And so she must protect immigrants by hurting them. In her telling, racism and xenophobia seem not themselves objectively bad things that must be combatted, but a natural outcome that occurs when too many rights are given to immigrants and asylum seekers. If only they had fewer rights, then people wouldn’t hate them so muchand we would hit some golden ratio where everyone will be happier. Because immigration perception and immigration reality are famously aligned things.Credulous observers will quiver in the face of her personal conviction. Whatever you think of her politics, you’ve got to see that she means it. Because how can she not? She is brown and the daughter of immigrants! Let me break it to you gently: it is entirely possible for people of colour and the descendants of immigrants to be disingenuous and use their identities as excuses for their terrible politics. The former Conservative home secretary Suella Bravermandedicated her maiden speechin parliament to her father and mother, both immigrants. And yet, she later said “I would love to be having a front page of the Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda. That’s my dream, it’s an obsession”.Mahmood is not a novelty, just an addition to the ranks of Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Priti Patel and even Rishi Sunak, who in various forms used their identities to dictate what the correct immigration and race politics should be, because they’ve been there. Mahmood is just the firstLabourpolitician to do so. Her contribution reveals two things. One is mundane, the other is structural. First, there is nothing unusual or new about immigrants creating different, lower classes of immigrants and then separating themselves from them: legal v illegal; working and housed v needing benefits; assimilated v ghettoised. But here is the structural part: being a politician of immigrant background is a powerful thing in a country utterly banjaxed by immigration discourse.This is a sort of late-stage identity politics. A way in which the victim narrative so condemned by critics of “wokeness” remains holy and unquestionable when it is used for a purpose that isn’t equality. It’s using identity as a way to elevate and uphold stories that can be wielded in the service of authority, not to challenge it.It takes a prodigious amount of stupidity or ignorance not to see that the home secretary provides that important service, at a time when the nation is riven by racism and xenophobia. Reform UK is ascendant, and the Labour government is trying to outflank the right while trying not to look enormously racist and xenophobic while doing so. Enter Mahmood to reassure you that it is, in fact, a sort of kindness to force children on to planes andeye up itemsthat are not of “sentimental value” so that asylum seekers can contribute to their costs. Enter Mahmood to collapse all sorts of categories together, in one instance saying division is caused by asylum seekers, in anothersaying it is causedby the high recent rate of net immigration, expanding the numbers of people that need to be slapped with harsher conditions so they don’t force the public to become racist.And it also requires a very short memory to believe that Mahmood is acting out of evangelist conviction, rather than convenience when, not too long ago, she supported ageneral amnesty for undocumented workerswho have been living in the UK for 10 years, and in 2020called on the Tory governmentto halt a deportation flight. She nowvows to fight“vexatious last-minute claims” that “frustrate” removals.But to show you the allure of being an anti-immigration immigrant, this will not be seen as a cynical reversal but, as the Spectator puts it,as a conversion–a final seeing of the light. And who cares about the embarrassing optics of it all, when the reward is Mahmood’s admission into the ranks of the contenders, the players? Much has been written, since her two-story debut, of the “new hardwoman of British politics”, theproponent of “Mahmoodism”, a devout outsider driven by conviction politics, thenext prime minister. Michael Gove is barely able tocontain his excitementat the minister he considers “far and away the most impressive person in the Labour government”.There is a sort of gamified glee to it all. The contrast between the pain Mahmood is about to inflict on some of the most vulnerable and desperate – exemplified by the flippant “sorry, we’re closing!” imagery thataccompanied her announcementthat asylum hotels will be shuttered – and the excitement she has triggered in the political discourse, tells its own story. Mahmood is here to provide the answer, to absolve. To free the country from its anxieties about immigration and race. To turn away from the hard work of confronting the economic failure, cultural capitulation and cowardice that has enabled the rise of the far right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which parts of it will survive?Mon 24 Nov 2025 10.31 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 12.41 ESTShareThe US president, Donald Trump,has said“something good just may be happening” at the talks in Switzerland intended to end the war in Ukraine. European and Ukrainian negotiators have been attempting to “rework” the28-point peace planthat the president put forward last week into onemore favourableto Ukraine. Trump keeps signalling that he is willing to compromise, but his original plan put Ukraine in a very tough starting position, handing Vladimir Putin concessions that Russia has so far failed to gain on the battlefield.It is true Russia has made recent advances – especiallyaround Pokrovskand Myrnohrad in Donetsk province, and in parts of Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine lacks the troops and firepower to retake all the territory lost since 2022, let alone Crimea. But the Ukrainian army isn’t about to unravel, and neither is Putin close to fulfilling hisoriginal objective: conquering the four Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia fully controlsonly Luhansk. This war could drag on until the summer. By then, Putin’s forces will have fought Ukraine for as long as Stalin’s fought Nazi Germany.Ukraine’s shortages are well known: too few soldiers to hold an 800-mile contact line and inadequate air defences after Trump severely cut direct US military assistance. Europe’sstepped-up supporthasn’t compensated. What is remarkable, given Ukraine’s disadvantages, is the scale of Russia’s losses:more than 1 millioncasualties according to the UK Ministry of Defence, nearly150,000confirmed dead, and more than23,000pieces of equipment destroyed or damaged. Ukrainian deep strikes on Russian refineries –at least 17by mid-November – have caused fuel shortages,long linesat petrol stations,panic buying, higher prices,rationingand a cut inrefining capacityby up to a fifth.Ukraine makes significant changes to US ‘peace plan’, sources sayRead moreIt is in this context that Trump unveiled his peace plan – an early Christmas present for Putin. It was negotiated byKirill Dmitriev, a Putin confidant and CEO of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, and on the US side by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, seems to have played a minimal role.Witkoff and Kushner may be shrewd business negotiators, but they have scant diplomatic experience and even less knowledge of Ukraine. (Witkoff hasrecited Kremlin talking pointsafter meeting Putin.) Their influence stems largely from personal ties to Trump. Pitting them against someone like Dmitriev virtually guaranteed a deal tilted toward Russia. A few examples illustrate the imbalance:Ukraine– not Russia – is required to cap its armed forces at 600,000. Russia faces no comparable constraints.Ukraine must amend its constitution to drop its commitment to joining Nato.Russia had long expressed concerns about Nato expansion; President Boris Yeltsinobjectedin the mid-1990s, well before Putin took the helm. But acknowledging Russia’s concerns is different from claiming Ukraine’s Nato membership was imminent in 2022. Between Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit – where it vaguely promisedeventual membership– and the invasion, Ukraine made no concrete progress toward accession. Had Nato truly wanted Ukraine in, it could have moved swiftly, as it did withFinland and Sweden.And that’s only the beginning. Trump’s plan recognises Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de-facto Russian – granting Putin parts of Donetsk he hasn’t captured. It freezes battle lines, allowingRussiato retain territory seized in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The plan doesn’t give Putin everything, but it gives him enough to claim victory.What does Russia concede? Virtually nothing. The plan does say frozen Russian assets will help rebuild Ukraine, but Moscow was never going to recover that money anyway.Meanwhile, Russia receives further rewards: readmission to the G8; reintegration into the global economy; negotiations toward a staged lifting of sanctions; and cooperation with the US on energy, infrastructure, AI and rare earths. The plan also demands Ukrainian de-Nazification, validating Russia’s absurd narrative that Ukraine is riddled with Nazis – something any visitor can see is false.Despite Russia’s ongoing war crimes –atrocitiesin Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka;forced relocationsto Russia of children; repeated strikes on apartment buildings, most recently in the western city ofTernopil; andabuse, torture, and executionof Ukrainian prisoners of war – the plan grants the Kremlin full immunity from prosecution, negating international criminal court warrants for Putin and his top officials.None of this should be surprising. Trump has been open about his admiration for Putin. He has been disdainful toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has even blamed Zelenskyy forstarting the war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that hardly justifies forcing Ukraine to accept a one-sided deal crafted without its participation – and accompanied by an ultimatum of mere days.Other supporters of the plan insist, as Trump has, that it’s time to end the blood-letting, even as Israel’sstrikes in Gaza continueduring the ceasefire underwritten by Trump. Some who rightly criticise Israel’s conduct seem oddly indifferent to Russia’s war crimes.Trump certainly has the authority to halt weapons deliveries to Ukraine – his decision to do so was another boon for Putin. But he has gone far further. By concocting a plan that may as well have been written in the Kremlin and excluding Ukraine from negotiations, he hasn’t just put his thumb on the scale. He’s put his hand on it. That’s morally indefensible and strategically myopic.There is some positive news. After reports that Rubio told members of Congress the 28-point plan was produced by Russia, heheld talkswith Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s closest adviser, to rework it based on Ukraine’s reactions–although Rubio has denied this. TrumpaccusedUkraine of ingratitude but added that the plan was “not my final offer” and that his deadline could be extended. If the upshot of all this is that Trump’s proposal doesn’t fly, that will be a good thing – above all for Ukraine.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaDonald TrumpEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

I think a pretty clear picture of the man emergesMon 24 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 14.03 ESTShareWhen I see theallegations of racismagainst Nigel Farage from his schooldays, I can’t say I am greatly surprised. There are those who believe that the Reform UK leader’s persona must have been developed to win over working-class voters, or the “red wall”. I know that it is quite in keeping with the sentiments expressed by plenty of young men in elite institutions like English public schools – the kind of men who run the world.Farage was educated at Dulwich college from 1975 to 1982; there, fellow students have told the Guardian, he allegedly used racist insults about fellow pupils and sang a song with the lyrics “Gas ’em all”. I attended Eton a couple of decades later, but the attitudes of some of the people I encountered there were not very different. One pupil, having fallen out with me over some perceived slight, boasted thathis great-grandfather was a slave driver. A Jewish friend who was there with me at the same time told me how common it was to hear “Jew” or “rabbi” being used to describe anyone who was thought to be mean with their money. When I later saw Old Etonian Boris Johnsonreferring to black peopleas “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”, I thought back to the peers of mine who would erupt into rants filled with racist stereotypes whenever they saw the West Indies cricket team on the TV.But there is another reason I am not surprised when I read about Farage’s alleged teenage behaviour. As grim as these stories are, just look at the damage that Faragehas gone on to do as an adult, and the company he hasgone on to keep. If you were looking in the school yearbook, wondering “where are they now?”, then under his entry you would want to add: “He inspired the country on a tide of xenophobia to leave the EU, a decision that most of the countryeither regrets or outright hates, and afterwards went abroad to get a standing ovation from the German far right”. What has truly changed since Farage’s schooldays is the society around him. We will get back to that in a moment.For now, though, I am thinking about school. I don’t know what Farage was like when he was a teenager, but – in my own regrettable experience, and as I am reliably informed – the majority of people who expressed racist worldviews at school and university have not moved away from those opinions with age. If anything, they have become significantly more extreme in their outlook, viewing the era of Trump and Musk with relish.And why wouldn’t they? Not only have several of my former classmates retreated behind their walls and gates, they are now fuelled by the various algorithms that send a never-ending stream of loathing to their smartphones. Just as a mosquito requires stagnant pools of water in which to thrive, so their stagnant social circles provide the perfect breeding ground for increasingly toxic strands of bigotry. I was recently at a university reunion and it was striking to see one man, who has somehow gone on to scale even greater heights of racial prejudice than in his student days, surrounded as if he were a returning hero. Most disappointing was to see an old and close friend voice deep and growing enthusiasm for the politics of Johnson.Almost as disappointing was to hear of Farage’s visit to my old school and to hear that, in the words of one onlooker,Eton boys had cheeredFarage’s “worst comments on migrants and Covid”, and had subjected visiting girls to “racial slurs” and “misogynistic comments”. When I saw this quote, my sympathies went immediately to the students of migrant heritage in that environment, especially the visibly foreign ones. The college said it had apologised “unreservedly” for the “totally unacceptable” behaviour, but it is difficult to understand what other outcome they expected. This is what Farage does; this is his skill. When it comes to stoking hatred, Farage is what is referred to in the football world – a world that, for shameless political gain, he is nowpretending to understand– as a generational talent. He is a Pied Piper, leading his followers to a future that – for now, at least –they find absolutely exhilarating.Where, though, is his vision of immigration leading the UK? To answer that we can look tothe actionsof senior members of the current government, who have already bent their policies to his will. The mood they have created is so sour that, as reported by the Guardian, “record numbers of overseas-trained doctorsare quitting the UK, leaving the NHS at risk of huge gaps in its workforce, with hostility towards migrants blamed for the exodus.” For the longest time, the approach by European politicians such as Farage has been “if you don’t like it, then leave”. It should be no surprise that, increasingly, the response is “with pleasure”.We return, now, to how the society around Farage has changed. We have long had a media culture that prefers its political shows to bepopulated by entertainersrather than experts, and that trend has accelerated in recent years. We are also now in an era when, every single day, the richest personin modern history– who, according to The New Yorker, is responsible through aid cuts for the deaths ofhundreds of thousands of human beings– wakes up and amplifies themost extreme far-right contentfrom the biggest communication platform the world has known, a platform he solely owns. In the UK, the soaring economic inequalities – supercharged by Brexit – have led to such scarcity that many voters areturning against those arrivingin the country, blaming them for trying to steal more of a shrinking pie.Of course, it is in Farage’s interests to stop people from focusing on who is actually using the bulk of resources, because the greediest consumers are some of his funders and friends. Farage’s ultimate message is simple:open borders for the super-rich, closed borders for everyone else. It’s not quite as catchy a slogan as “take back control”, but, as the reality of his true position becomes clearer, it may just take flight. If that does happen, then we will be able to say that the adults in the UK are finally taking Farage as seriously as several of his classmates always have.Musa Okwonga is an author and football podcaster based in BerlinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to kickstart a democratic “resurgence”, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, haswarnedof an “axis” of autocratic states targeting liberal democracy in Europe. Havingpromisedto “fight” for what she calls European “values”, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has just announced a new“democracy shield”and aCentre for Democratic Resilienceto prevent foreign interference and deal with external threats. I keep hoping for similar scrutiny of democratic backsliding within the EU – but so far it has not happened.Foreign interference, disinformation and the creepingilliberalism of Hungary, Polandand Slovakia deserve attention. But lost in this fretting is a more inconvenient truth: within Europe’s “mature” democracies, there is a steady corrosion of the rule of law, a degradation of political discourse and the normalisation of racism, xenophobia and discrimination.Growing up in a country where democracy was fragile and frequently interrupted, I learned early that the issue is not merely about elections. It is about the quality of governance and of politicians. It depends on protecting human rights and dignity, ensuring social justice, respecting minorities – and minority views – and creating a genuine sense of belonging for all citizens.That is why I am troubled when EU governments and political elites undermine the rule of law, constrain free speech, normalise police violence and ignore signs that racism and xenophobia have seeped into public life. Across the bloc, the demonisation of racialised refugees and migrants has become common. Ironically, even as they champion democratic renewal, Merz, Macron and von der Leyen are chipping away at the very values they claim to defend.When Merzurged journaliststo “ask your daughters” about why Germany’s changing “cityscape” threatens their security, he did more thaninfantilise German women. He activated toxic colonial and orientalist tropes of Black and brown men as violent, hypersexual, uncivilised aggressors, as bodies to be policed, controlled and deported. Though he lateracknowledgedmigrants’ economic contributions, the damage was done. Merz moved Germany’sOverton windowon what is considered acceptable in political discourse, thereby giving more oxygen to the far right.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz and Ursula von der Leyen at the G20 summit, Johannesburg, 22 November 2025.Photograph: Michael Kappeler Pool/Shutterstock/dts News Agency GermanyIn France, too, Macron’s legacy will be marked not only by his attempts at liberal reforms but by hislegitimisation of far-right narratives. By echoing Marine Le Pen’s rhetoric on national identity, Islam and migration, Macron has normalised what was once unsayable for centrists. The far-right National Rally now stands as a respectable government-in-waiting precisely because the so-called liberal centre helped embed its ideas in the mainstream.A similar dynamic is playing out within EU institutions. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni may have set the shameful example byoutsourcingthe processing of asylum seekers to Albania, but it is the European Commission that hasincorporated deportationas a legitimate policy tool in the EU’s new migration pact – and von der Leyen who keeps signingmigration-deterrencedeals with regimes such as those in Tunisia and Egypt that areaccusedof abuse and torture.Israel’s genocide in Gaza has laid bare the many ways in whichthe EU is in violationof its own norms and principles, as well as in flagrant breach of its obligations underinternational lawto prevent and punish genocide. In Germany, police forces have beencondemned by UN expertsfor criminalising and suppressinglegitimate Palestinian solidarityactivism. In Belgium, the use of teargas, batons and water cannon against peaceful protesters outside the European parliamentprompted callsfor an investigation from Amnesty International. EU institutions are quick to condemn state violence in other parts of the world, but are silent when it occurs within their own borders.After every European election, we reassure ourselves that the “centre is holding”. The reality is that whether in national governments or in the European parliament, far-right parties areincreasingly shapingthe European agenda. The conservative European People’s party has grown ever-more comfortable forming majorities with far-right groups, especially on environmental policy. Politicians across Europe are adopting far-right talking points on migration and Muslims. The excuse is always that this is being done to contain the hardliners, even thoughstudies consistently showthat such mimicry amplifies and normalises extremism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spain’s Pedro Sánchez has shown moral clarity on Gaza and adopted a national migration policy which isrooted in dignityand solidarity. In the Netherlands, Rob Jetten of the centre-left D66, expected to lead a new coalition, ran on a platform of hope rather than hate and spoke out against Israel’s genocide. The UK Green party’s Zack Polanski and Ireland’s new president Catherine Connolly are helping to revive a progressive political discourse in their countries. And across the Atlantic, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, a proud son of immigrants and unapologetic advocate for justice, housing and solidarity, has demonstrated that democracy’s vitality depends on moral courage and inclusive coalitions – and that racial and religious identity can be a source of pride.European leaders should take note that, even as the EU arms itself with a “democracy shield”, strengthening democratic resilience is not only about fighting external threats, adversaries and disinformation. It is also about building inclusive democracy at home, dismantling racism, ensuring equality and creating a sense of belonging for all European citizens.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group?Sean SzepsYou wake up to messages, you go to sleep to messages, you duck into a meeting and come back to 64 unread notes about sunscreenMon 24 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 17.08 ESTShareWhen I was little, I thought hell was a fiery pit beneath the Earth’s surface. The image was vivid: flames, tortured souls and a cartoonish devil with a pitchfork.Now that I’m an adult, I know better. Hell is actually a parentWhatsAppgroup.The parent WhatsApp group – known colloquially as Satan’s Slack channel – is one of those parenting surprises no one warns you about. People tell you about the sleepless nights, the lost identity and the toys that reproduce overnight. But no one says:“You’ll one day discuss nits with 30 adults as though global peace depends on it.”What began as a simple way to share school updates has mutated into a relentless stream of chatter. There are simply too many messages. You wake up to messages, you go to sleep to messages, you duck into a meeting and come back to 64 unread notes about sunscreen. Linda has posted the same information seven times because she doesn’t trust anyone to read it. Which, to be fair, is accurate.When I was growing up my parents got information the old-fashioned way: crumpled notes in backpacks and gossip at pickup. They weren’t part of a digital micro-community of helicopter-adjacent strangers debating uniform policy. They didn’t refresh their phones at 9.38pm to discover that it’s going to be Harmony Day and every child needs to wear “something representing their heritage”.No moaning about the teachers and definitely no nudes! How to survive the school WhatsApp groupRead moreMy parents didn’t live in constant communication with other parents. They weren’t expected to be this connected, worrying about real-time reminders. And maybe, I’m going out on a limb here, that distance was healthy.I don’t say this lightly … I thinkWhatsAppis ruining parenting.I don’t think it’s evil, per se. In fact, it’s one of my favourite apps for keeping in touch with friends abroad. But the problem is: it’salways on. School parenting used to happen at drop-off, pickup and during homework battles at the dinner table. Now it happens first thing in the morning in bed, 11 minutes later in the bathroom and while sprinting through Kmart before school to find a T-shirt that screams “my child is Cuban-Italian”.There’s no off switch. Go offline for an hour and suddenly everyone else knows that swimming starts this week, not next, that the assembly has been moved (again), and that Sharon’s selling year 1 tea towels for charity and you were supposed to submit your child’s portrait last Tuesday.These groups are built for people who are permanently available and find deep meaning in the phrase “quick reminder”. They are not built for me. Or anyone with boundaries. Or a child.Here’s the hypocrisy of it all: we limit our kids’ screen time, tell them to be present and post quotes about how “childhood is a short season” to our 600 Instagram followers. Then we feel pressured to check our WhatsApp 16 times a day, watching the theatre of parenting confusion unfold in real time.And it is theatre. The WhatsApp group act is part coordination, part performance. Every “thanks for the reminder” is less about gratitude and more about signalling: “I’m a good parent too, I swear.” Even if I forgot the bake sale once. Or twice. Fine, three times.I’m worried it’s making us all a bit dumber. Because if the information lives in the group, we stop paying real attention. We rely on the collective brain, on someone else (probably Linda) to notice, remind and repost. It’s the parenting equivalent of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Maybe things would be simpler if our only option was talking to people in public.The worst part? I’ve become complicit. I can’t quit. Somewhere along the way, I volunteered to be the WhatsApp rep for my daughter’s class. I haven’t slept properly since.I used to worry about my heart health. Now I worry I’ll die suddenly and come back as the eternal moderator of every year 2 WhatsApp group, trapped forever between reminding people about permission slips and guilt-tripping them about class fundraisers.‘A giant parenting group’: how online comedians are making a living by laughing about the chaos of kidsRead moreAll I want is a note in the backpack or a quick chat at pickup. I’m craving an actual conversation with a teacher instead of ignoring her because I’ve already checked WhatsApp four times between leaving my car and getting to the gate.I want a little space back. A crack in the digital noise. I miss the quiet confidence of not knowing everything all the time. The small mystery of what happens to my kids between drop-off and pickup. The trust that things will be fine, even if I’m not across every single message.Maybe that’s the real lesson of modern parenting? Not to be more connected but to remember that it’s OK to step back. That missing something isn’t failing.

EU leaders must help Kyiv resist the bullyingMon 24 Nov 2025 13.37 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 14.01 ESTShareThere was a grim familiarity to the unveiling of Donald Trump’s latest peaceproposalsfor Ukraine last week. As in August, when the US president invited Vladimir Putin to a summit inAlaska, Kyiv and its European allies were excluded from discussions that ended up echoing Kremlin talking points. Yet again, Mr Trump publiclyscoldedVolodymyr Zelenskyy for not being more grateful for his ongoing mediation efforts. And as in the summer, Mr Zelenskyy and blindsided European leaders strove to stay polite while scrambling to limit the damage.The salvage operation appears to have been relatively successful, following Sunday’smeetingin Geneva between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and a Ukrainian delegation. The 28-point plan reportedly drafted by Mr Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser, Kirill Dmitriev, was in effect a repackaging of Mr Putin’s maximalist demands. A deal premised on the handing over of new territory in the Donbas region to Russia, restrictions on Ukraine’s sovereignty, and drastic limits on the size of its future army, could never be acceptable to Kyiv. Mr Rubio,suggestinga more “refined” framework was now being developed, seemed to at least acknowledge this fundamental difficulty.As the usual stream of self-regardingblusterand bombast emanates from the White House, it is impossible to know whether a negotiating endgame is truly at hand. But certain principles bear restating as a starting point for meaningful talks. Future European security, and the basic principles of international law, demand that Mr Putin’s brutal aggression is not simply rubber-stamped and rewarded, and that Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence is prioritised. To Kyiv’s persistent disadvantage, Mr Trump’s administration likes to position itself as a neutral broker between unequal warring parties. In response, European countries must insist on a proactive role in forthcoming peace negotiations, and try to exert some moral leverage.Europe, after all, is now bearing the bulk of the cost of Ukraine’s continued resistance. It can use its influence and collective weight to furnish Mr Zelenskyy with the negotiating cards which Mr Trump has previouslyassertedthat he lacks. If the EU can belatedly reachagreementon a €140bn “reparations loan” to Kyiv, underwritten by frozen Russian assets, Mr Putin’s apparent judgment that he can outlast Ukrainian resistance may begin to look questionable. A combination of arms and financial support, and greater economic pressure on Russia, are needed to alter calculations in the Kremlin and genuinely bring Mr Putin to the negotiating table.This, rather than attempting to bully Mr Zelenskyy into a form of capitulation, is the path to achieving a just and sustainable peace. As Ukraine’s president wearilyrestatedat the weekend: “The crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war, and it is Russia, and only Russia, that has been refusing to end it.”There are already signs that the Kremlin is preparing to reject modifications to Mr Witkoff’s Putin-friendly plan. Yet whether through naivety, a crude notion of realpolitik or a greedy desire to open up Russian markets, Mr Trump and his aides seem repeatedly minded to lobby for peace on Moscow’s terms. Searching for a moral compass in the White House is a futile exercise. Europe’s leaders need to start trying to shape some facts on the ground.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But only a real bargain between rich and poor nations can weather the climate shocks that are comingMon 24 Nov 2025 13.37 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 20.50 ESTShareThis year’s UN climate talks in Brazil’s Belém ended without a major breakthrough. The text of the finalagreementlacked a deal to shift away fromfossil fuels, delayed crucial finance and the “mutirão” decision contained no roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation. But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year’s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.Developing countries are far from united on some issues. Over rare earth mineralsChina sees any move as targeting its dominance, while Africa sees it as essential for governance. Elsewherepetrostatesdid not support Colombia’s call for a fossil fuel phase-out. Yet the global south broadly coheres around a simple principle: its nations must be equipped to survive a climate emergency they did not create. That means cash to buildflooddefences, make agricultural systems resilient, protect coastlines and rebuild after disasters strike. They also demand front-loaded finance to transition to clean, green economic growth.But climate finance is a hard sell in the global north. Rightwing populists in the west rail against cash being spent onclimateand foreigners. Any issue that fuses the two becomes a difficult political terrain. Then there is the broader geopolitics – one in which spiky confrontations have become the norm. For parts of the rich world,clean industrialisation of the global southisn’t a priority – it’s an economicthreat.Donald Trump did not send a team to Brazil, the first time since 1995 America was not officiallyrepresentedat the annual climate summit. This may not have been entirely unwelcome. The US, which owes the largest climate debt in the world, hasblockedmeaningful finance deals for years – and itsreshoringagenda is designed to keep key industries at home. This is not entirely without logic: some analysts sayChinais the proof that the west has reason to fear too rapidly empowering poorer nations.But such a narrow worldview will only hinder progress. As Evans Njewa, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group,statedbluntly after Cop30 ended, Belém was missing ambition. For him the world’s most vulnerable countries came seeking protection; they left with promises postponed. Yet the disappointment felt today is a spur for greater action tomorrow. The LDCs are looking to Cop31 in Turkey and, ultimately, to Cop32 in Ethiopia to change minds.This year’s UNadaptation reportcould not be clearer: the scale of the task ahead is vast. Developing countries, it suggests, require more than $310bn per year by 2035 – yet they received only $26bn in 2023, down from $28bn the year before. Needs are rising faster than finance. The UN warns that without a dramatic course-correction the poorest countries will be leftexposedto heatwaves, wildfires and floods.The urgency of the crisis explains whyAfrican negotiatorsare so insistent that adaptation finance must be from the state, preferably in grant form. To imagine otherwise, they say, is delusional; currently private finance makes up only 5% of adaptation cash and most of that is philanthropic. Private capital will not build sea walls, restore mangroves or protect subsistence farmers. Cop30 underscored a simple reality: only by moving beyond symbolism and self-interest can the world secure its future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In India, rising heat, unpredictable rainfall and water scarcity already disrupt cotton cultivation, small weaving clusters and garment production hubs. These communities are expected to adapt and decarbonise, yet they receive almost none of the meaningful support that would make such a transition viable.The gap between what developing nations require and what is currently offered is not only a financial gap, it is also a structural gap created by unequal development. Treating climate finance as a loan-driven obligation rather than a shared responsibility undermines the very idea of a just transition. Debt cannot be the pathway to climate resilience for the global south.A credible transition will require grant-based finance, accessible technology and long-term partnerships that build local capacity. Countries likeIndiaare already expanding renewable energy far faster than historic emitters did during their industrial rise. What we seek is not charity. We seek fairness consistent with science, history and the Paris agreement. Climate ambition must finally rest on climate justice.Nirbhay RanaGurugram, IndiaGeorge Monbiot’s opinion piece on climate data (There’s a catastrophic black hole in our climate data – and it’s a gift to deniers, 21 November) echoes what Deepak Varuvel Dennison reveals about artificial intelligence in his long read article (What AI doesn’t know: we could be creating a global ‘knowledge collapse’, 18 November): that invaluable data from the world outside the US and English-speaking countries is ignored or marginalised. In this way, vital local knowledge, experience and wisdom gets lost.As Monbiot emphasises, this skewing of data has enormous consequences for tackling climate change and our overall concept of reality. Unfortunately, we see the same skewing in news coverage reflected in the mainstream media. This hegemony will become ever more pronounced as AI usage expands. It is essential that this distortion of data sourcing is recognised and corrected if we are to retain a meaningful and truly representative concept of reality and are thus able to make effective decisions.John GreenLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As this has not been piloted or thoroughly modelled, there is little evidence to support this claim.The focus should be on fixing the swathe of inefficiencies plaguing the system, which could be resolved and make a real difference now. Courtrooms across the country are sitting empty, and prisoners do not arrive on time, so cases begin late or not at all. And when these obstacles are overcome the entire system from start to finish is riddled with problems due to a lack of basic resources. These problems will persist unless a long‑term plan is implemented.The government should first test whether efficiency reforms to the crown court estate, prisoner escort and custody services, and court technology would make a difference before making any major constitutional change.The criminal justice system is not in this crisis because of jury trials. At the very least, the CCBD should be modelled and piloted before doing away with a longstanding tradition, which may result in a further lack of trust and confidence in our criminal justice system.Barbara MillsChair, the Bar CouncilHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I don’t think it comes as a surprise to anyone, given that we’ve all seen eye-watering prices for rail travel and are bombarded with adverts for £20 flights to Nice. We’ve all read the stories of people who flew from one UK city to another via Mallorca or some such location because it was cheaper than getting the train.It does come as a surprise, though, that there’s no tax on aviation fuel. I’m the director of the charityFlight Free UKand I speak to a huge number of people about air travel. They are almost always shocked to discover that there’s no tax on the fuel.Taxing airline fuel is not the only answer to encouraging more people to choose low-carbon travel, but it’s a start.

After Gueye’s red card, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s 29th-minute strike proved the winner as United lost for a first time in the competition at home after an opponent was reduced to 10 men.Everton brush off bizarre Gueye red card to beat lethargic Manchester UnitedRead moreGueye’s marching orders came after he approached Keane, was pushed away, and then slapped the defender on the cheek, causing the referee, Tony Harrington, to send him off for violent conduct. Gueye later apologised to his teammates.Moyes said: “I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn’t do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.“If nothing happened [no red card], I don’t think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised. I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it. I was told that [by] the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.“I’m disappointed we got the sending off. But we’ve all been footballers, we get angry with our teammates. He’s apologised for the sending off, he’s praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised.”Defeat ended United’s five-game unbeaten run.Ruben Amorim­echoed Moyes’s sentiment. The head coach said: “Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn’t mean that they don’t like each other. Fighting is that you lose the ball [so] I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was how I felt when I watched. And I don’t agree with the sending off.”United remain on 18 points, two behind Crystal Palace in fifth place, which may again be enough to seal a Champions League place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Brazil winger did not even take kindly to being nicknamed Messinho – “Little Messi” – earlier in his career. He called the nickname “disruptive” and made clear that he had no interest in trying to be someone else. “I don’t like comparisons,” the 18-year-old told ESPN Brasil last year. “For those who don’t know how to deal with it, it’s quite disruptive. Me being Estêvão is very good.”Chelsea no doubt agree. After all, opposition defenders aside, who could possibly complain about Estêvão just being Estêvão? Not for nothing is he widely tipped to win the Ballon d’Or one day. The teenager’s talent is outrageous, his start to life in England has been better than expected and, although the obvious risk with heaping too much praise on a young prospect is that it makes them take their eye off the ball, it is telling that those who know Estêvão say one of the qualities that set him apart is his character.Frank can afford to lose at PSG but sense of foreboding now clings to SpursRead moreEnzo Maresca, Chelsea’s head coach, does not worry about the Brazilian losing focus. For Chelsea, the concern is more about protecting Estêvão from burnout as he adjusts to the physicality of the Premier League. He has made only seven starts in all competitions since his £52m move from Palmeiras last summer and goes into his first meeting with Lamine Yamal knowing there is much to prove before he can be held in the same regard as Barcelona’s 18-year-old winger.For all that Estêvão dislikes being compared to other players, the similarities with Lamine Yamal are striking. Both are left-footed, both play on the right and both love nothing more than taking a full-back to the cleaners. Both are devastating when they cut inside to deliver inswinging crosses or whip shots towards the far corner, but neither can be accused of being predictable. Estêvão, for instance, was at his creative best when he came on during Chelsea’s win against Wolves this month, driving down the outside and using his right foot to cut the ball back for João Pedro to score. Itwas an electrifying cameo.Chelsea have fallen hard for Estêvão. The fans love him and Stamford Bridge erupted when he scored his first league goal in dramatic circumstances, sliding in at the far post to bag astoppage-time winner against Liverpoollast month. This is clearly a player with an eye for the spectacular, which is why Maresca may trust him to start when Barcelona visit in the Champions League on Tuesday night.View image in fullscreenEstêvão was Chelsea’s stoppage time hero when he popped up to score the winner against Liverpool.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesDo not expect Estêvão, who has four goals for Chelsea so far, to be overawed. He is already a starter for Brazil – he scored twice for his country during this month’s international break – and would be making his 100th appearance at club level if he plays against Barça.However, it is worth remembering that Estêvão has not had as much exposure to elite competition as Lamine Yamal, despite being three months older than the Spaniard. Chelsea have not been in a rush. They agreed their deal with Palmeiras in May 2024 but allowed Estêvão to stay with the Brazilian club for another year and represent them at the Club World Cup last summer, meaning much of his football has been played in South America, where the competition is fierce but still not as demanding as in Europe.Lamine Yamal, by contrast, has been competing at the very top since the start. He turned 17 a day before he helpedSpain to beat England in the Euro 2024 final, played a starring role in Barcelona winning La Liga last season and finished second to Ousmane Dembélé in the Ballon d’Or this year.“Both of them are very special players,” said Marc Cucurella, who plays with Estêvão at club level and Lamine Yamal for Spain. “They always want the ball. The only difference is that Lamine has been playing in Europe for maybe two or three seasons and Estêvão arrived this season – but he’s doing really well. If he continues improving he can be at Lamine’s level.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The dribbles are more inventive, more bewitching, and there are times when his crosses and passing defy logic. Chelsea, though, see Estêvão developing into a playmaker capable of operating as a No 10 and will also note that there have been questions about Lamine Yamal’s behaviour away from the pitch this season. Cucurella touched on that, saying there may have been hints of the Barça star “perhaps being a little more distracted”.There was, of course, controversy around Lamine Yamal withdrawing from the Spain squad this month. Injuries have taken a toll. A groin problem has troubled Lamine Yamal, although he looked back to his best when he produced two assists during Barcelona’s 4-0 win against Athletic Bilbao last Saturday.It falls to Cucurella to keep his international teammate quiet on Tuesday night. It is a tall order but Chelsea will back themselves. Barcelona are brilliant in attack but they give up chances anddrew 3-3 with Club Bruggein their previous Champions League game. Maresca, who said Cole Palmer is back in training as he recovers from a broken toe, will think about how to target the Spanish side’s high line.Making use of Estêvão’s wizardry on the right is one way to go. Chelsea will back him to outshine Lamine Yamal. The background checks were thorough when they were scouting him. They loved his talent but they also loved the youngster’s family. Estêvão, the son of a pastor, has been brought up well. It is why he does not care too much about measuring himself against others.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaBarcelonafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even in the best of times, nobody would have expected much from Tottenham there. With two wins and two draws from four matches they can afford to lose this one.Arsenal’s Premier League dominance is not under threat. At least not yetRead morePlainly, a heavy defeat would be less than ideal given Spurs have been bad more often than good since the end of September after anencouraging start to Frank’s tenure. He and the players will see an opportunity to take steps, whether big or small, towards what they believe is their true level. They will remember how they pushed PSG all the way in the Uefa Super Cup at the start of the season, losing on penalties.What is casting the long shadows and sending chills everywhere, is the home game against Fulham on Saturday. Teams are supposed to prefer playing on their own turf, but it is a long way from looking like the case for Spurs, certainly in the Premier League, the competition that matters the most in the boardroom, the one that dictates the manager’s job security.It was not Frank’s fault that he inherited a squad that had won two, drawn three and lost nine of the previous 14 home league games under Ange Postecoglou. It is on him that he has failed to drive any discernible improvement. His record reads: W1 D2 L3.The low point came in the1-0 defeat against Chelseaat the beginning of November when the players were booed off. They were creatively bankrupt, their expected goals of 0.05 the lowest of any team in the league this season. It was 0.07 at Arsenal, the second-lowest.There would be more well‑documented boos from the stands in the next home league gameagainst Manchester United a week later; for Richarlison when he played a loose pass, for Frank when he substituted Xavi Simons. After a wild finale, it ended 2-2.Between times, there was the4-0 Champions League win there against Copenhagenand an episode that went largely under the radar but feels instructive, an emblem of the Temple of Grumbling. When the Tottenham substitute Dane Scarlett won a stoppage-time penalty, the South Stand wanted him to take it. Instead, Richarlison grabbed the ball in his trademark elbows-out style. He was the designated taker so why not?Boos for Richarlison came from the South Stand. Did it affect him as he went through his mental preparations? It is unclear. But he did miss. It mattered not, because the game was long since over. It was, nevertheless, extraordinary.View image in fullscreenFrank was asked if he had seen enough fight in his team. ‘In those duels we didn’t win enough,’ he said. ‘If that’s a lack of fight … we just didn’t do it well enough.’Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThe Fulham game will be Tottenham’s first at home since United and, at this distance, it is one that Frank desperately needs to win. At the very least, he needs a performance, something in attacking terms, because too often his team have failed to fire. In the1-0 home defeat against Bournemouthat the end of August, they recorded an xG of 0.19.It must be noted that Frank has been without the injured Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison all season and Dominic Solanke for pretty much all of it. He has tried every combination of his other attacking players, the impression being that he is groping for, and failing to find, the right blend.Mohammed Kudus (who has been generally bright), Brennan Johnson, Simons, Wilson Odobert, Mathys Tel and Randal Kolo Muani have five league goals between them. Richarlison has five himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eberechi Eze scored a fairytale hat‑trick and might have had four or five. What made it so bad for Frank was the optics of his switch to a 5-4-1 formation. When he went back to 4-3-3 for the second half, his team were 2-0 down.Brilliant Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thump Spurs to extend lead in title raceRead moreOnly once previously had Frank started with a back five – against PSG in the Super Cup, which he described as a “special operation”, a move necessitated partly by having had only six weeks to work with the players. If the Spurs support are going to see their team lose, they would prefer it if they threw a few punches.As an aside, Frank’s decision to drop Pedro Porro for the second time was a huge call. The full-back is an extremely popular member of the dressing room.The lack of creativity, the absence of options on the ball, felt like the biggest problem. To Frank, it was not so. As he picked over the wreckage, he had more urgent worries. The lack of aggression – in the duels and the press. The inability to get close to Arsenal’s players. The failure to force turnovers high up.Frank was asked whether he had seen enough fight in his team. “We were 100% too far from them in these duels we wanted to create or getting pressure, getting close,” he said. “In those duels, we didn’t win enough of them. If that’s a lack of fight, a lack of whatever it is … we just didn’t do it well enough.”It was a typically honest answer, but utterly damning. The Spurs manager has his work cut out to spark a reaction from his players.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankParis Saint-GermainChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Usman Khawaja’s mid-game back problem was annoying for the player and potentially damaging for his team, until it wasn’t. Clearing out the regular dry-powder opener created space in the final stanza of the Perth Test, allowingTravis Head to finish off Englandwith the gory certainty and splatter count of a Mortal Kombat fatality move. Sometimes you mash the buttons and it all just works.Consider an Ashes innings of 123 from 83 balls, on a bouncy pitch where two other players nudged 50, in an effort that did not just win the match, but has sent the opposition into a demoralising tailspin. So the fortuitous success creates a quandary about what to do next.Travball 1-0 Bazball: Head’s big numbers add up to a damning zero for England | Geoff LemonRead moreKhawaja may not be passed fit for the second Test, but if he is should that be enough to reassure selectors his injury will not recur? And even if they believe he is ready should that be enough reason to retain him?During two years of uncertainty about Australia’s permanent opener, Head has been a regular suggestion from some quarters. It made some sense: there is the absence of a highly qualified candidate at domestic level, his history of thriving in seaming conditions and that he already does that job in both white-ball teams. His Perth performance has turned that rumble to a roar.Before proclaiming the case self-evident, it may be worth an appraisal of just how impressive his performance was in a historical contest. Despite the relatively low target, there have been only eight bigger Ashes scores made in a successful fourth innings: the paired efforts of Don Bradman and Arthur Morris pursuing what was the world record of 404; hundreds on separate tours from the great opening pair Herbert Sutcliffe and Jack Hobbs; theBen Stokes 2019 miracleat Headingley; Mark Butcher’s more subdued version at the same ground 18 years earlier; and innings from Australia’s Joe Darling and England’s Jack Brown.All of these are also dwarfed by Head’s strike rate of 148 – even the lightning final stages of the Stokes innings lifted his overall rate to only 62. Nine Ashes tons have been faster than a run a ball and the one faster than Head’s was Adam Gilchrist’s Waca declaration smash. In all Test cricket, five centuries have been faster and you can be assured that none of those were made in the fourth innings of a match. In terms of context, there is no equal.View image in fullscreenUsman Khawaja’s injured back meant Marnus Labuschagne opened in the first innings and Travis Head in the second.Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAPAccordingly, probability says you can not pick this player expecting a similar innings to happen again. We have already seen the one that would define most careers. If Head tries to repeat the magic, it risks distracting his focus and making him attack too hard at the wrong time. Especially in a pink-ball Test, teeing off in the first innings in Brisbane would probably be far riskier than in the fourth innings in Perth. Khawaja has shown there are different ways to counter this threat, like his long, patient 145 against South Africa with a pink ball at Adelaide in 2016, batting more than seven hours to set up a win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putting him lower in the order leaves his gifts less subject to the peril of the moving ball at the top. With Jake Weatherald the new occupant of one opening spot, you can argue Australia do not need two punchy left-handers taking on the bowling from ball one.However sensible your stance, it may now be washed away by pure momentum. Anyone who saw that innings in Perth will want to know what happens if Head mashes another set of buttons. If this innings would define careers for most players, for Head it might make the top five. Maybe there is scope from here to expand that to a top 10?It is reasonable sometimes to be greedy. As Australia weigh up their options, the sensible approach says no.

The Rugby Football Union is also expected to provide any other relevant video captured of the incident.England edge over line for autumn clean sweep but Argentina fume over Curry scuffleRead moreIn an extraordinary press conference after England’s 27-23 victory on Sunday, Contepomi described Curry as a “bully” and accused the flanker of shoving him in the tunnel and telling him to “fuck off”. Contepomi also claimed Curry had “broken” the knee of Juan Cruz Mallía with a “reckless” tackle in the 75th minute – the incident that sparked the post-match bad blood.The Argentina head coach said “there are probably cameras there” and the Six Nations will wait to review the footage provided by England and assess their statement before determining whether further action is warranted. On Monday, Argentina also confirmed that Mallía has suffered a “traumatic” torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee as a result of Curry’s tackle.View image in fullscreenArgentina’s head coach, Felipe Contepomi, said Curry gave him ‘a push, a hit here on the chest’ after the match.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty ImagesArgentina players were incensed with Curry – who was only penalised for the tackle – and surrounded him on the pitch after the match. The bad feeling spilled over into the tunnel with Contepomi saying: “It is part of [Curry’s] nature to bully people. But he came off in the tunnel and he gave me a little smack. I’m 48. [It was] not a smack, a push, a hit here on the chest. So maybe it is his nature, I don’t know. Probably those are the guys we are rewarding and we praise. Maybe that’s where we want rugby to go, I don’t know.“How old is he, 27? He is strong and I am 48 and he comes and just shoves me. Luckily, there are probably cameras there … Richard Hill was there so you can ask him.“I was standing there [in the tunnel] and he was coming and wanted to say hi to one of our coaches but we said no because we were upset. He was reckless and broke our player’s knee. I know it is rugby, but if we don’t look after each other in rugby, it could be dangerous.“He was coming [into the tunnel] and [we] said: ‘Mate, you broke his knee,’ and he said: ‘Fuck off,’ and pushed me like that. Maybe that is the way he is, I don’t know him. I am not happy with the situation. After breaking someone’s knee, you need to be at least humble enough and respectful to say: ‘Sorry I did something wrong,’ but he went the opposite [way].“Maybe it is his way of being a bully. If we want bullies in this game, good on them.

His character is impeccable. He’s a fantastic team man, a very respectful guy. I think Tom Curry’s character is unquestionable.“I’m unaware of what happened in the tunnel, but post-game, on the pitch, emotions are always flying high.

In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.McLaren apologise to Norris, Piastri and fans for Las Vegas Grand Prix disqualificationRead moreIt is exactly the sort of proximity to set nerves jangling unnecessarily with two meetings remaining and 58 points up for grabs. Norris still holds the cards, but a single slip, an error, an unwanted contact, a mechanical failure or even another technical infringement and Verstappen could be breathing down his neck in an all or nothing season finale in Abu Dhabi.Such a prospect was unthinkable when he was 104 points behind Piastriafter the Dutch GPon the final day of August. But for the miscalculation, Norris would have gone into the next round in Qatar with a 30-point lead over Piastri and 42 over Verstappen.There were, asMcLarenargued, mitigating circumstances, albeit nothing that would change the decision. Teams want to run their cars as close to the ground as possible for aerodynamic efficiency and will push the limits. How they set up their car for this depends on the type of circuit, its speed, its surface, whether it is bumpy and how the car subsequently behaves on it. This process of learning continues as the weekend goes on until the setup is finalised before qualifying.View image in fullscreenLando Norris would have a 30-point lead over Oscar Piastri and 42 on Max Verstappen but for the error with his car.Photograph: Eric Gay/APIn Las Vegas, during second practice, vital time was lost to two stoppages and the usual race simulations were not completed, affecting information invaluable to setting up the ride height. The final practice session was wet, when cars behave aerodynamically differently to the dry, not least in not creating nearly as much downforce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All of this added up to excessive wear and a double disqualification.They were aware, it appears, of how close they were to the edge. Late in the race, Norris was instructed to adopt a lift‑and‑coast approach to his driving, ie coming off the throttle before the end of the straights. At the time it was assumed there was a need for saving fuel, but it seems it was to minimise wear to the skid block, which the team knew to be on the limit.Norris alluded to this in the statement McLaren issued, stating the race management in the final phase of the race was because of “issues on our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified”.All of which raises awkward questions as to why McLaren got it wrong when no other team who were in the same circumstances did. This is doubly the case, given they have such a strong car and were still in such a strong position in the drivers’ championship. Had it occurred early in the season, there would have been plenty of time to rectify it. The timing was terrible, with their need to push a margin of error far less urgent than, say, for Verstappen and Red Bull, given the Dutchman was trying to claw back a 49-point deficit.Norris can still close this out. Outscoring both his rivals by two points in Doha, where 33 are on offer during the Saturday sprint race and Sunday grand prix, would seal it there. Quite how safe he and his team are feeling after this egregious fumble in Las Vegas is another question altogether.Explore more on these topicsMcLarenLando NorrisFormula One 2025Oscar PiastriFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Under the arrangement, priority for any loans will be given to developing nations.Extortionate tickets and matches moved at Trump’s whim: are you ready for the ‘greatest World Cup ever’? | Marina HydeRead moreIn a statement Fifa said that the new partnership would seek to “support national governments in designing, financing, and building modern multi-sport venues”.The Fifa president,Gianni Infantino, said the funding was needed to build the kind of stadiums that would enable countries to stage Fifa-approved tournaments. “Many of our Fifa member associations need additional support for the infrastructure necessary to host competitions,” he said. “This agreement is a crucial step in ensuring our Fifa member associations have the facilities to make football truly global.”The arrangement is only the latest addition to a burgeoning relationship between Fifa and Saudi Arabia. The Gulf state will host the men’s World Cup in 2034, while its state-owned oil company, Aramco, became a “major worldwide partner” of Fifa last year in a four-year arrangement.The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), meanwhile, was an official partner at this summer’s Club World Cup, while its spin-off company, Surj Sport Investment, bought a $1bn stake in the streamer Dazn after it had itself paid $1bn to acquire the exclusive global rights to the Club World Cup. Last week, when a Saudi delegation visited Washington for meetings with the US president, Donald Trump, Infantino was part of the group that accompanied Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House.Fifa is a not-for-profit organisation and, in a recent letter to the Guardian, its director of media, Bryan Swanson said: “The revenue [Fifa] generates is reinvested to fuel the growth of football – men, women, youth – throughout Fifa’s 211 member associations globally. Fifa already distributes millions of dollars of its funds to its member associations each year under the Fifa Forward programme. This money is largely used to cover the running costs of associations and for developing participation at a national level, however, and it is understood that a different scale of funding was deemed necessary for the development of stadiums, and national stadiums in particular.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Providing loan financing to developing countries, it has long concentrated its investments on infrastructure, last year loaning $100m to fund hydropower projects in Pakistan. According to a Fifa statement, the new arrangement reflects a change in priorities for the fund, where it “is elevating sport infrastructure as a core component of its development agenda, recognising the sector’s unique ability to generate employment, boost tourism, promote health, and strengthen community ties”.Explore more on these topicsFifaSaudi Arabia and sportGianni InfantinoFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

With all due respect to the competitors at Wetherby, Market Rasen and Southwell on Wednesday, the main event for racing will be the 12.30 at Westminster, as Rachel Reeves rises to deliver her much-anticipated budget speech.The only result that can be ruled out with confidence is that gambling duties will be left untouched. There is a gaping black hole to be filled in the public finances and the UK’s gambling industry, which had a Gross Gambling Yield (total stakes minus total payouts) of £15.6bn in the 2023-24 financial year, could scarcely be a more tempting target.Bryony Frost makes flying return but is thriving in new French homeRead moreThe key point for racing, though, is the extent to which a hike in overall gambling taxes is shared out between General Betting Duty (GBD) on operators’ gross profits from betting – on racing and other sports and events – and the duties payable on fixed-margin gaming products – slot machines, roulette and other casino games – both online and in retail betting shops.The current rate of GBD is 15% of an operators’ gross profits, while Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), the tax on the booming online gaming sector, is 21% of gross profits.And when the chancellor finally delivers her decision, the success, or otherwise, of the sport’s “Axe The Racing Tax” campaign will largely be measured by whether that 6% gap has been maintained, reduced or increased. The campaign had its origins, after all, in a Treasury proposal to “harmonise” the two rates, which was the subject of an official consultation process earlier this year. The British Horseracing Authority commissioned research which suggested that harmonisation at 21% would have an immediate cost to the sport of £66m in lost income per annum, and £330m over five years, at the cost of nearly 3,000 jobs in the first year alone.The focus of the anti-harmonisation campaign was on the sport’s economic significance, in rural areas above all, and the likely effect of removing tens of millions of pounds from an ecosystem which supports the jobs of 85,000 people – who are, in turn, paying tax on their income and spending in their local communities.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowLingfield11.00 Canyouhearthedrums 11.30 Master Of Shanghai 12.00 Al Rufaa 12.30 Connie Moon 1.00 Lahina Bay 1.35 Knickerbocker 2.10 Ten Club 2.45 Roman Spring 3.20 Arthur RoseHereford12.15 Marsiac 12.50 Liam Mera Kai 1.25 Sanitiser 2.00 Recoded 2.35 Copshill Lad 3.10 Granny Hawkins 3.45 SassipantsSouthwell12.40 Valence D’Aumont 1.15 King Of Cong 1.50 Moab 2.25 Precious Metal 3.00 Little Venice 3.35 Captain TriggerWolverhampton4.30 Eden Storm (nb) 5.00 Spirit Lead Me (nap) 5.30 Crown Board 6.00 Woody Y Fernandez 6.30 Ritaal 7.00 Smasher 7.30 Woodhay Whisper 8.00 Leading Times 8.30 Percy JonWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Initially at least, it was mainly left to others to suggest that high-frequency gaming products, which are associated with significantly higher rates of harm than other forms of gambling and do little or nothing to support employment or local economies, would be a better target for a tax hike – although Paul Johnson, the chief executive of the National Trainers’ Federation, put his head above the parapet to give the organisation’s “full backing” to a call by the Social Market Foundation (SMF) think tank for RGD to rise to as much as 50%.The moment when the tide may prove to have turned in racing’s favour, however, was the intervention by Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, in July. Brown backed a call by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank for gaming taxes to be hiked to 50% and betting duty to 25%, but also recommended additional measures to protect the racing industry from damage in the fallout.Brown’s intervention switched the focus away from harmonisation and firmly towards gaming duty above all, and a recent, well-sourced report in the Financial Times suggests that, far from harmonising the duty rates, the chancellor will instead raise gaming duty on both online and high-street games and impose a “slight” rise on the rate for online sports betting only, but exempt bets on horse racing from the increase.From racing’s point of view, this would be the best outcome that anyone could have realistically expected when the campaign began back in April. And while nothing is being taken for granted, there is increasing hope among those at the forefront of the campaign that its message has landed. One senior executive suggested to me last week that the racing is “about 1-4 to get the right result” on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenRecent results from William Hill show significant recent growth in the betting-shop sector.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIf so, then the last six months should also come to be seen as the time when a 20-year boom for the UK gambling industry, fuelled almost entirely by gaming products, finally ran out of road.The bonanza was enabled by the 2005 Gambling Act, which came into force in 2007 when Brown himself was in No 10. It legitimised £100-a-spin roulette machines in high-street betting shops, while also failing to anticipate the growing dominance of online gambling in general, and online gaming and casino products above all. It took 15 years of campaigning – amid fierce resistance from the gambling industry – before the stake limit on FOBTs was cut from £100 to £2.There has been similar resistance, orchestrated by the industry’s lobbying group, the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), to suggestions that gaming duty should be singled out for a significant hike in the budget, even down to a re-emergence of BetFred’s claim, last heard during the FOBT campaign, that most or all of its betting shops are at risk of closure. It did not happen then, and recent results from William Hill, showing significant recent growth in the betting-shop sector, strongly suggest that it will not happen now.The BGC has repeatedly claimed too that a hit to gaming profitability would have knock-on effects for racing, via reductions in sponsorship and offers and promotions for punters.But in reality, it makes little sense to react to reduced profits in one area of their business by reducing investment in another where the relative margin has improved (unless, of course, racing and betting was mainly being used as a loss leader to acquire customers who can then be pushed towards gaming products). It was suggestedin this column over three years agothat the gambling-industry’s gaming-fuelled bonanza could not go on forever, and that the most sensible plan for racing would be to separate itself as fully as possible from the gaming sector ahead of the inevitable crash.If the latest rumour about the outcome of the chancellor’s deliberations around gambling tax is correct, racing may indeed have jumped from the careering bandwagon in just the nick of time.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsBudgetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The corresponding fixture last season attracted an audience of 732,000 because it was free-to-air on the BBC and took place during the men’s international break.Beth Mead: ‘If we don’t adapt to climate change, football becomes a privilege, not a right‘Read moreMultiple sources within the sport have said the noon Saturday kick-off time was the biggest factor behind the drop-off for that game, which is concerning for the WSL given that most of its TV games will kick off at lunchtime this season.Under the £65m, five-year deal withSky, which has the rights for 118 live matches each season, noon on Sunday has been designated as the flagship slot. Sky has also broadcast five Saturday lunchtime games this season, up from two over the whole of the last campaign.The Arsenal v Chelsea viewing figures are a huge drop from the WSL’s average audiences last season, which were 337,000 on Sky and 682,000 on theBBC. The discrepancy is widely attributed to the fact that most of Sky’s live games kicked off later on Sunday afternoons and evenings last season.Sky has scrapped Sunday evening kick-offs because they were unpopular with match-going fans and families, but they did attract good TV audiences, helped by Sky retaining the attention of Premier League viewers.In the first half of this season, 49 of 66 WSL games are noon or 11.55am kick-offs, a significant change from the 2pm Sunday slot that has traditionally been favoured by the WSL. The earlier kick-off slots often clash with junior and grassroots games, which is believed to have had an impact on viewing figures. The Saturday lunchtime slot is problematic for the WSL because it is often up against a live Premier League game and a full EFL programme. Arsenal v Chelsea clashed on 8 November with Tottenham v Manchester United, which kicked off 30 minutes later, and several EFL fixtures.View image in fullscreenThe Premier League’s Tottenham v Manchester United game clashed with the WSL’s flagship Arsenal v Chelsea match on 8 November.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersTNT Sports has the early Saturday Premier League game, which often gains audiences of more than a million, and up to seven EFL matches are available at the same time on Sky. The main EFL game averages an audience of between 200,000 and 300,000, with all seven combined usually attracting about 500,000 viewers.The 70,000 figure was collated by the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (Barb), the UK’s official body for measuring television and streaming habits, based on average views of Sky’s entire programme. Sky prefers to measure views across 90 minutes, with its figure for the game about 78,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This season’s figures for three-minute views and social media engagement are more encouraging, showing significant growth across Sky and the WSL’s channels.The BBC has the rights to 21 live WSL matches this season. Its contract has also presented scheduling challenges, with another prime fixture, Chelsea v Manchester United, broadcast on BBC3 and BBC iPlayer on a Friday evening last month.The concern over broadcast slots feeds into a broader problem about the WSL’s apparent struggle to capitalise on England’s second European Championship win last summer. There was a significant rise in crowds and viewing figures after the Lionesses’ first Euros triumph in 2022 but early evidence suggests that has not been replicated.The average WSL attendance over the first six match rounds has been 6,500, with a study from the Women’s Sports Trust last month reporting a 1% decline on the corresponding period last season. Arsenal are responsible for more than one-third of the league’s ticket sales.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueSky SportsBBCSports rightsTelevision industryWomen's footballSkyShareReuse this content"

Dannatt remains a crossbench peer.The inquiries into the two peers by the Lords commissioners for standards followed investigations by the Guardian as part of theLords debateproject. They are the latest to be punished. Previouslytwo lordswere given sanctions after official inquiries into peers’ conduct prompted by Guardian reporting.Both Dannatt and Evans initially claimed they had not broken the rules.But now, in a statement, Dannatt has said: “I deeply regret the commissioner’s findings regarding my personal honour and I decided that the honourable course of action was not to waste the conduct committee’s time by appealing against the findings but to accept the appropriate sanction.”He added: “I also understand that acting in the national interest in good faith, which was my motivation … is not an excuse or justification for breaching the code of conduct. At nearly 75 no one is too old to learn lessons and I hope that these activities will be placed in the context of my 56 years’ public service.”Evans did not immediately respond to a request for comment.‘Improper interactions’Since retiring from the army, Dannatt has had a portfolio career, with a number of outside interests in addition to his seat in the Lords. He has insisted these roles were in the national interest, and told the watchdog: “I think as far as I’m concerned my personal honour and the national interest are very much one and the same.”But the report found he had failed to act on his personal honour. Instead, he has repeatedly exploited his status as a parliamentarian to lobby the British government on behalf of commercial interests in what the Lords conduct committee described as “improper interactions with ministers or officials” over a period of two years:InJune 2022, Dannatt lobbied ministers and officials to provide millions of pounds in financial support for a venture looking to purchase a fertiliser factory. Three days after the meeting with a minister, he was paid £2,000, followed by a further three payments of £2,000 months later.InJanuary 2023 and September 2024, at the instigation of executives at Teledyne, a US defence company that paid him, Dannatt wrote to Home Office ministers to lobby them for “assurances” the government was taking action against Palestine Action. The letters followed an attack by the group on the company’s factory.InJanuary 2024, Dannatt wrote to the UK’s top diplomat in Ghana to organise a meeting with her that he attended with the director of a British goldmine company. They used that meeting to lobby her to get support from the Ghanaian government for the company, in which Dannatt had shares.Dannatt, a peer since 2011, said that he believed he was acting in the national interest, that he planned to donate his shares in the goldmine company to a charity and expressed remorse that “my misunderstanding of the code of conduct and the publication by the Guardian of highly unwelcome articles has damaged my reputation but more significantly risked that of the House of Lords”.Dannatt also claimed he had not offered to lobby on behalf of the undercover reporters. He told the watchdog: “In my opinion I was not expressing a clear willingness but a theoretical willingness and that I was talking in the future conditional tense using the words ‘could’, ‘would’ and ‘might’.”0:28Lord Dannatt says he would 'make a point of getting to know' the relevant minister – video‘Our mates who now have senior jobs’Evans used his position in the second chamber to get fellow peers to speak at commercial events that his son was holding in parliament. Evans was a shareholder in his son’s company, to which he had also loaned more than £50,000, although he claimed not to remember he had the shares.Evans told undercover reporters, who had expressed an interest in a £25,000 event sponsorship opportunity offered by his son, that he could introduce them to members of the house. He bragged to them how it was “great being a Labour peer at the moment because we’ve got our mates who now have senior jobs”.The parliamentary watchdog’s investigation revealed that the Lords authorities had warned Evans’s son Richard Evans last year that he was breaking the rules.The Lords events team had written to Richard Evans saying that he was charging people more than £400 to attend events and advertising the events without the team’s permission. The rules stipulate that charges for guests must be broadly equivalent to the cost of events held in the Lords and that events cannot be advertised without parliamentary consent.Despite this warning, the events promoted by Richard Evans continued. Later in the year, the Guardian recorded him and his father breaking the rules.LiveLabour peer’s involvement in apparent cash-for-access venture exposed – videoQuick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Both participants and researchers were unaware at the time as to who was in which group.The team focused on results from 308 participants who had lost at least 10% of their body weight by the end of the initial 36-week period before switching to the placebo, finding that one year after stopping tirzepatide, 82% of these participants had regained 25% or more of their initial weight reduction.The team found that greater weight regain at the end of the study was associated with greater reversal of improvements not only in weight, but also in measures including waist circumference, levels of “bad” cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.“Overall, at week 88, participants with 75% or more weight regain after tirzepatide withdrawal reversed cardiometabolic parameters to baseline (week 0) values,” the team write, although they note those with up to 50% weight regain still showed improvements in these areas compared with the start of the study.The team say the findings “support the importance of long-term maintenance of weight reduction through lifestyle intervention and obesity management medications to sustain cardiometabolic benefits and improved health-related quality of life”.Jane Ogden, the emeritus professor in the School ofHealthSciences at the University of Surrey added that taking weight-loss jabs does not always create healthier eating and exercise habits, noting it can sometimes lead to poorer diets as people lose the motivation to eat well and prepare food.“Once stopping taking the medication, people show weight regain as they return to their previous behaviours. With this can come a reversal in cardiac benefits as their diet and exercise behaviours return to how they were before,” she said.Another piece of research suggests that women who stop using weight-loss medications such as tirzepatide or semaglutide before becoming pregnant or early in pregnancy tend to gain more weight while pregnant and have a higher risk of preterm delivery, gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy than those who had not used such drugs.However, Sattar cautioned thatthe latter studydoes not prove cause and effect, and said further trials are needed.“Women receiving [weight-loss jabs] would likely have entered pregnancy at a lower weight than they otherwise would have, and this weight difference is extremely difficult to fully account for in observational analyses,” he said. “Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution.”Explore more on these topicsHealthObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

None of the climbers have been publicly identified.Sgt Kevin McErlain told the Timaru Herald the pair had been connected by a rope when they fell near the summit of Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook.Five climbers and two guides killed in Nepal avalanche, say officialsRead moreThe authorities learned late on Monday night local time that four climbers needed help on the mountain, which is on New Zealand’s South Island. Two of the climbers were rescued by helicopter in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Walker said.They were uninjured. Searchers in two helicopters looked throughout the night for the other climbers, who were found dead hours later.Aoraki is 3,724 metres (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century. Dozens of those who died on the mountain have never been found.This includesthree men, two from the US and one from Canada, who were believed to have died on Aoraki in December 2024. The Americans – Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California – were certified alpine guides.The climbers were missing for five days before New Zealand authorities halted a search for them, saying discoveries of their belongings suggested the men had fallen to their deaths.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandMountaineeringAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He was also charged in September with a rape and grievous bodily harm against another woman in Tottenham in January.View image in fullscreenSheryl Wilkins was found dead aged 39 in Tottenham in September.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PALevy had been arrested in April for Valencia-Trujillo’s murder, and released under investigation.The Metropolitan police urged anyone with information about Levy and the offences he has been charged with, or other allegations, to contact them.Met commander Clair Kelland said:“The investigation into Simon Levy is one of great complexity.“We are working closely with partners across relevant boroughs, including Haringey and Southwark, to encourage reporting and raise awareness of the support we can provide to victim-survivors.“We believe there may be people who are aware of Levy who have not yet made a report to the police.“Whether you are a victim-survivor, or someone with information, we urge you to come forward and speak to us.”The Met said that it had been called on 17 March to reports of an unresponsive woman at a property on the Aylesbury Estate in south London.Police said the cause of Valencia-Trujillo’s death could not be determined and that on 1 April, Levy was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was released under investigation.On 24 August Wilkins’s body was found on Tottenham High Road. Levy, also from Tottenham, was arrested for her murder more than a week after her body was found.The Met said: “On Thursday, 4 September, Levy was re-arrested in connection with Carmenza’s death and also for the murder of Sheryl Wilkins, 39, who died on Sunday, 24 August on High Road, Tottenham.“Levy was charged with Sheryl’s murder on Sunday, 7 September. While in custody, he was further arrested in relation to a separate incident on Tuesday, 21 January, involving another woman in High Road, Tottenham.“He was charged with two counts of rape, grievous bodily harm, and intentional suffocation in relation to that.”Police added: “All three cases are now being treated as part of a single, joined investigation.“Detectives believe there may be individuals who have information relevant to this investigation – or who are yet to report incidents which have directly impacted them – and are asking for people to come forward.”Levy, of Tottenham, will also appear at the central criminal court on Wednesday for a pre-trial hearing over the charge of murder in relation to the death of Wilkins.Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The reimagining of Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby also won best audio drama adaptation, while Gatwa took home the best performance award for what organisers described as his “remarkable poise and flair” in capturing Gatsby’s character.The Speakies are the UK’s first set of prizes dedicated to audiobooks and audio drama. The inaugural ceremony, held at the Royal Opera House and hosted by actor and comedian Sally Phillips, celebrated what the prize called the full “ecosystem” of audio storytelling – from writers and actors to sound designers and publishers – at a moment when listening figures and investment across the sector continue to climb.Best audiobook: science fiction and fantasy went to Juno Dawson’s Queen B, a witchcraft novel about Anne Boleyn, narrated by Nicola Coughlan. The Bridgerton star “brings wit and vivacity to her telling and successfully whisks readers away from the 21st century to the heart of King Henry VIII’s court,” said category judging chair Katie Fraser.View image in fullscreenClever family … JD Kirk’s Him, co-narrated by David Tennant, left, won best crime audiobook at the Speakies; while Georgia Tennant, right, accepted the best romance audiobook award for her narration of Jilly Cooper’s Rivals.Photograph: Dave Benett/Alan Chapman/Getty ImagesJD Kirk’s Him, narrated by David Tennant and Louise Brealey, won best audiobook: crime and thriller. The win came on the same night Tennant’s wife, Georgia Tennant, accepted the best romance audiobook award on behalf of the team behind Rivals, Jilly Cooper’s 1988 novel, newly adapted for audio to coincide with its recent Disney+ screen adaptation. Tribute was paid to Cooper,who died last month.In nonfiction, the best audiobook: memoir prize went to Careless People bySarah Wynn-Williams, her whistleblowing account of speaking out about Meta. Self-narrated, the audiobook was described as a “powerful reclamation of speech and agency”.Why Are You Here, Mrs Hamilton?, a memoir by Post Office scandal victim Jo Hamilton narrated by Monica Dolan – who portrayed her in ITV’s television drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office – took home best nonfiction audiobook. Meanwhile, Mark Gatiss won best performance as a narrator for his reading of Ian Fleming’s From Russia With Love, edging out Stephen Fry among others.Independent publishers made a strong showing at the Speakies. Galley Beggar Press and Spiracle Audio beat major houses to win best fiction audiobook with All My Precious Madness by Mark Bowles, narrated by Paul Hilton. The audiobook was praised for its “ambitious concept” and inventive use of multiple voices, and described as an example of audio evolving as a form in its own right.According to the Publishers Association, audiobook sales in the UKrose by 31% in 2024, reaching a record £268m. Last week, a study from the National Literacy Trust found that while only 32% of young people said that they read for enjoyment, 42% enjoyed listening to audiobooks.Philip Jones, editor of the Bookseller – which co-runs the new awards with the Stage – said the awards reflected a “moment” for UK audio. “I am delighted with our winners for this first year,” he said. “As listener interest grows, investment across platforms and talent increases, and excellence across disciplines rises to the occasion. Bringing this all together under one awards banner for the first time, with all of the talent recognised, truly has been a joy to behold.”This year’s judges included Gavin & Stacey star Laura Aikman, broadcaster and author Michelle Elman, author Abir Mukherjee, Doctor Who star Pearl Mackie, YouTuber Hannah Witton and Guardian audiobook critic Fiona Sturges.Explore more on these topicsAudiobooksRadio dramaAwards and prizesRadioPublishingNcuti GatwaNicola CoughlannewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not clear exactly what caused her cancer. But people who live near coal plants are much more likely to develop the illness,studiesshow, and the residents of Mahul live a few hundred metres down the road from one.Mahul’s air is famously dirty. Even behind closed car windows, there is a heavy stench of oil and smoke.“We are not the only ones facing health challenges in the area,” said Kasbe, who is 36. “It’s all covered with filth.”Two coal plants plant run by the Indian multinationals Tata Group and Adani were due to close last year in a government push to cut emissions. But late in 2023, those decisions were reversed after Tata argued that electricity demand was rising too fast for Mumbai to go without coal.Neither company responded to requests for comment.View image in fullscreenBuildings shrouded in smog in Mumbai, India, in January.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesEconomic growth and the need for air conditioning in climate change-linked extreme heat have seen India’s electricity demand soar in recent years. But an investigation bySourceMaterialand the Guardian reveals the biggest single factor in the city’s failure to end its dependence on fossil fuels: energy-hungry datacentres.Leaked records also reveal the scale of the presence of the world’s biggest datacentre operator, Amazon, in Mumbai.In the city’s metropolitan area, Amazon, on its website, records three “availability zones”, which it defines as one or more datacentres. Leaked records from last year seen by SourceMaterial from inside Amazon reveal the company used 16 in the city.As India transforms its economy into a hub for artificial intelligence, the datacentre boom is creating a conflict between energy demand and climate pledges, said Bhaskar Chakravorti, who researches technology’s impact on society at Tufts University.“I’m not surprised they’re falling behind their green transition commitments, especially with the demand growing exponentially,” he said of the Indian government.Kylee Yonas, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said Mumbai’s “emission challenges” were not caused by Amazon.“On the contrary – Amazon is one of the largest corporate investors in renewable energy in India, and we’ve supported 53 solar and wind projects in the country capable of generating over 4m megawatt hours of clean energy annually,” she said. “These investments, which include our 99 megawatt wind project in Maharashtra, are enough to power over 1.3m Indian homes annually once operational.”Amazon is building hundreds of datacentres around the world as it vies with Microsoft, Google and others for leadership of the booming AI market.View image in fullscreenTata Consultancy Services Ltd office in Mumbai, India.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe company is failing to take responsibility for its role in prolonging the use of the most polluting energy sources, said Eliza Pan, a spokeswoman for Amazon Employees for Climate Justice.“Amazon is using the shiny thing of AI to distract from the fact that it’s building a dirty energy empire,” she said.Yonas denied this, saying: “Not only are we the leading datacentre operator in efficiency, we’re the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for five consecutive years with over 600 projects globally.”Amazon’s claims on green energy are controversial: the company has been criticised for using “creative accounting” by buying renewable energy certificates alongside direct purchases of green energy, as described by a member of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice.‘Everything is contaminated’Mahul, where Kasbe drives his rickshaw, is a former fishing village now home to tens of thousands of people who moved there after slum clearances elsewhere in the city.Kiran Kasbe’s mother.Photograph: Courtesy SushmitaKasbe and his mother arrived there in 2018 after their home in the suburb of Vidyavihar was bulldozed. She had been healthy before the move but deteriorated rapidly until eventually she was diagnosed with brain cancer, he said.Gajanan Tandle, who lives nearby, said pollution-linked illnesses were common. “There are so many cases of skin and eye irritation, cancer, asthma, TB and more, and no assistance from the government,” he said.Another local, Santosh Jadhav, has lobbied the government to move people away from Mahul.“Everything is contaminated. We are tired of fighting for a decent means of living,” he said. “It’s hell for us here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whereas in the US Amazon tends to own its facilities outright, elsewhere it often rents either entire data farms or server racks in centres shared with other companies.Shared “colocation” units account for a larger increase in datacentre energy use worldwide than owned or wholly leased, according to Shaolei Ren, a computing specialist at the University of California, Riverside.“Most of the energy in the datacentre industry is going into colocations,” he said. “They are everywhere.”View image in fullscreenWorkers near Amazon Prime branding in Mumbai, India, on September.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesAmazon’s Mumbai colocation datacentres used 624,518 megawatt hours of electricity in 2023, enough to power over 400,000 Indian households for a year, the leaked data shows.India is poised to overtake Japan and Australia to become the second-largest user of datacentre electricity in the Asia-Pacific region,S&Phas forecast. By 2030, datacentres will consume a third of Mumbai’s energy, according to Ankit Saraiya, chief executive of Techno & Electric Engineering, an Indian power infrastructure supplier.‘Toxic hell’As it scrambles to keep ahead of demand for power, the state government of Maharashtra has extended the life of Tata’s coal plant in Mahul by at least five years. At the same time, it also postponed the shutdown of a 500-megawatt station operated by Tata’s rival, Adani Group, north of the city.When Tata argued for the extension in a petition to the state energy board, the biggest single factor the company cited was increased energy demand from datacentres. Adani said most anticipated new demand in the five years after the date by which its station was due to close would be from datacentres.The power stations are just two of many polluters in Mumbai’s Mahul district. The area is also home to three refineries and 16 chemical factories, according to a 2019 report published by India’s Centre for Policy Studies which called the neighbourhood a “toxic hell”.But the Tata station, opened in 1984 and like other older power stationssubject to laxer emissions rules, is “one of the key sources of air pollution in Mumbai”, according to Raj Lal, chief air quality scientist at the World Emission Network.It contributes nearly a third of local PM2.5 pollution, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. PM2.5 refers to airborne particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter that can cause significant health problems when inhaled.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from a chimney at the Tata Power Co Trombay Thermal power plant in Mumbai, India, in August 2017.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesToxic heavy metals in coal ash from the plant are likely to cause “respiratory diseases, kidney issues, skin problems, cardiac issues”, said Shripad Dharmadhikary, founder of the environmental organisation Manthan Adhyayan Kendra.Even with the Tata plant kept running, Mumbai’s power grid is creaking under the strain of surging demand. To guard against blackouts, Amazon’s colocation datacentres in the city have bought 41 diesel generators as backup and are asking for approval to install more, documents show.In August a report by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) identified diesel generators as a major source of air pollution in the region.The presence of datacentres that require constant power and diesel generators for backup “will naturally exacerbate emissions”, said Swagata Dey, air quality specialist at (CSTEP), asserting that datacentre operators should be required by law to power them with pollution-free solar electricity.One Amazon site in particular, just across the Thane Creek from Mahul, hosts 14 generators. One of the company’s partners received permission earlier this year to install 12 further generators at the site.“Public health impacts must be a central consideration when siting datacenters and choosing energy sources,” said Ren of the University of California, Riverside, who co-wrote a recent paper assessing public health risk from diesel generators at US datacentres.Sushmitadoes not use a surname because in India a surname indicates the caste–a hierarchical and discriminatory social structure.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingPollutionIndiaSouth and central AsiaMumbaifeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the heatwave, which peaked over Friday and Saturday, temperatures soared to between 10C and 12C above average, as low-lying parts of the country widely reached between 30C and 35C and exceeded 35C more locally. Israel’s previous record for the latter third of November was 34.9C.On Friday, temperatures reached 36.2C in Beit Dagan, near Tel Aviv, where the average November high is around 24C, while on Saturday they reached a peak of 37.3C in Eilat on the Red Sea coast, where the average is 27C. Though temperatures were less extreme at higher altitudes, they were still well above average; Jerusalem, at an altitude of more than 700 metres, reached around 27C, in comparison with an average November high of 19C.InVietnam, the rainy season reached extreme levels in south-central parts over the last week, with relentless downpours delivering nearly 2 metres of rainfall to some areas – around the annual average for the region. This caused flooding and landslides, leaving hundreds of thousands of buildings destroyed, damaged or without power, while river levels swelled to record highs, with strong currents sweeping away a suspension bridge over the Ða Nhim River. Major blows have also been dealt to the local agricultural industry, with estimated losses of 3 million animals and 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of crops. At least 90 people are known to have died.In Western Australia, the northernmost region, the Kimberley, is braced for the landfall of the severe Tropical Cyclone Fina on Monday. After developing in the Timor Sea last week, Fina meandered south-west along the coast of the Northern Territory, passing Darwin on Saturday at a strength equivalent to a category 2 hurricane. Winds in the city exceeded 85mph, damaging trees, houses and power lines, while 168mm of rain was recorded at Darwin airport.Fina has now intensified to the equivalent of a category 3 hurricane, and is expected to dump between 100mm and 150mm of rain over the northern Kimberley, with residents warned of flash-flooding dangers and high winds. However, Fina is expected to reduce in severity and weaken during the course of the day as it moves west along the Kimberley coast, possibly falling back below cyclone strength by Tuesday morning.Fiji has been put under a major flood alert by the country’s national weather forecasting centre. A trough of low pressure has persisted over the islands in recent days, bringing heavy rain that is forecast to continue through the week. More than 100mm could fall over the islands, potentially resulting in flash flooding, including the inundation of low-water bridges and crossings.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerIsraelFijiAustralia weatherVietnamanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is suspected she was strangled in Corby, Northamptonshire on 10 November.A manhunt is continuing, to locate Brella’s then husband, 23-year-old Pankaj Lamba, who has been charged with her murder. Lamba is believed to have left the UK for India.Northamptonshire police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on 20 November – a mandatory step because of officers’ previous contact with Brella.The IOPC concluded on Monday that four officers should face misconduct proceedings over their handling of Brella’s claims of domestic abuse. “It is our view the officers may potentially have breached police standards of professional behaviour,” the police watchdog said in a statement.The IOPC concluded that two detective constables had a case to answer for gross misconduct over their investigation into Brella’s claims. A sergeant and chief inspector also have a misconduct case to answer over their supervision and review of the investigation.Northamptonshire police have said those proceedings are under way in relation to four of its officers.Assistant chief constable Emma James said the force would also review the IOPC’s report “thoroughly to understand the issues raised and will seek to implement any recommendations that improve the quality of service we provide”.The police watchdog said Brella contacted Northamptonshire police on 29 August 2024 alleging domestic abuse by Lamba. He was arrested on 3 September and released on police bail, with conditions not to contact his wife, and issued with a domestic violence protection order.Derrick Campbell, the director of engagement at the IOPC, said its investigation examined the police’s response to Brella’s allegations that she suffered domestic abuse.“It has scrutinised their investigation strategy, actions taken, communication with the victim, and any safeguarding considerations. After a thorough review of the evidence, we have determined four officers should face disciplinary proceedings,” Campbell said.The IOPC said its investigation also found potential learnings for Northamptonshire police’s domestic abuse investigation unit, which is being reviewed.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is too early to call the therapy a success, but doctors are encouraged by his progress so far.“Things look really hopeful right now, but Ollie was the first human to receive this therapy and it’s only been nine months out,” said Prof Simon Jones, consultant in paediatric inherited metabolic disease at the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine (MCGM) at Saint Mary’s hospital.“We have four more boys scheduled in and we will need to prove the benefit is long-lasting,” said Jones, the joint leader of the trial.Oliver was born with a condition called Hunter syndrome. It is caused by a faulty gene that prevents the body from making a crucial enzyme that breaks down complex sugar molecules. Over time, these molecules accumulate in organs and tissues, causing an array of symptoms from joint stiffness and hearing loss to heart problems and cognitive decline, resembling dementia. Life expectancy is typically 10 to 20 years.The only licensed drug for children with Hunter syndrome is Elaprase, a weekly infusion that replaces the missing enzyme. The treatment costs about £375,000 per patient and must be taken for life. While the drug can improve movement and organ problems, it does not reach the brain and so cannot prevent cognitive decline.During the one-off therapy in February, doctors collected stem cells from Oliver’s blood and replaced the faulty gene with a working copy. The corrected stem cells were then re-infused back into his bloodstream. There, they began churning out high levels of the enzyme, which also reached his brain.Since having the therapy, Oliver no longer needs weekly Elaprase infusions, an encouraging sign that the treatment is working. The trial is run from Royal Manchester children’s hospital in collaboration with MCGM at Saint Mary’s.Speaking to the BBC, Oliver’s father, Ricky, said: “I don’t want to jinx it, but I feel like it’s gone very, very well.“His life is no longer dominated by needles and hospital visits. His speech, agility and cognitive development have all got dramatically better,” he added. “It’s not just a slow, gradual curve as he gets older, it has shot up exponentially since the transplant.”Oliver’s parents hope the therapy might also help his elder brother, Skyler, who has the same condition. The therapy cannot reverse existing organ and tissue damage, but tests on Skyler show that despite being five years old, he remains largely unaffected.Hunter syndrome overwhelmingly affects boys, but is extremely rare, affecting one in 100,000 males born globally. The five boys on the trial are from the US, Europe and Australia. None are from the UK because patients are not diagnosed with the condition soon enough.“To get the majority of patients treated with this dose we would need newborn screening on the heel prick test, which is now standard for Hunter syndrome in the US,” Jones said. The same gene therapy approach is now being developed to treat other genetic disorders that impair vital enzymes, such as Hurler syndrome and Sanfilippo syndrome.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchHealthGeneticsManchesterGene editingnewsShareReuse this content"

The delegation requested his deportation so he could serve his remaining sentence in Nigeria.A source at the MoJ has confirmed the request was rejected. It is understood the UK government was concerned that Nigeria could offer no guarantees that Ekweremadu would continue his prison sentence after being deported.A government spokesperson said it could not comment on individual prisoners. They added: “Any prisoner transfer is at our discretion following a careful assessment of whether it would be in the interests of justice.”A source said: “The UK will not tolerate modern slavery and any offender will face the full force of UK law.”Beatrice Ekweremadu, who was sentenced to four years and six months, with half spent in custody, was released earlier this year and has since returned to Nigeria.In his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson said all three conspirators played a part in a “despicable trade”. He said: “The harvesting of human organs is a form of slavery. It treats human beings and their bodies as commodities to be bought and sold.”The judge described Ekweremadu as the “driving force” behind the organ-trafficking plot, and said his conviction represented “a very substantial fall from grace”.His Old Bailey trial exposedvulnerability and complacency in the UK health system to organ trafficking.In February 2022, the young man whom Ekweremadu trafficked to London was taken to a private renal unit at the Royal Free hospital in London. It was falsely claimed that man was Sonia’s cousin and had agreed to the £80,000 transplant.Despite bribing a medical secretary the attempted transplant by the Ekweremadus was rejected by the hospital in March 2022. But the medics did not report the incident to the police.The plot was discovered only when the victim, referred to as C in court, fled to the police in fear of his life because he believed he was being lined up by Obeta for another transplant in Nigeria.Obeta had himself received a kidney transplant at the Royal Free in July 2021 from another man allegedly trafficked from Nigeria. He was sentenced to 10 years, two-thirds of which must be served in prison.Nigeria’s request to deport Ekweremadu has been criticised in his home country, and raised questions about why the Abuja government has not tried to intervene over more than 230 other Nigerians imprisoned in the UK.Nigeria’s high commission in London has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Many firefighters responding to the incident did not have specialist wildfire PPE, putting firefighters at increased risk of heatstroke, exhaustion, and burns.”The fire service is also on the frontline in dealing with the increased risk of flooding across the UK.Last month, the Guardian revealed that millions more homes in England, Scotland and Wales willface devastating floods in the coming years, and some towns may have to be abandoned as climate breakdown makes many areas uninsurable.View image in fullscreenFirefighters responding to flooding caused by storm Claudia in Monmouth this month.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersSam Harding, a Monmouth firefighter who rescued survivors when Storm Claudia hit the area this month, said the fire service was struggling to cope with this new reality.“The flooding was some of the worst we’ve had in recent years, and required all of our water rescue resources,” he said. “If there had been another flooding incident elsewhere in south Wales requiring water rescue, I don’t know how we would have been able to respond. Government cuts to funding mean the resilience isn’t there to cope with multiple severe incidents like flooding, and we’re seeing more of them.”The letter, signed by Greenpeace, Tax Justice UK and Friends of the Earth among others, calls on the chancellor to increase government funding “to ensure sufficient firefighters, emergency fire control staff and specialist resources to meet wildfire and flooding risks”.It adds: “We urge you to act decisively to provide the investment, strategy and leadership that firefighters and the communities they protect urgently need to tackle the realities of climate change.”A ministry of housing, communities and local government spokesperson said: “We know the risk wildfires and floods pose to communities, which is why we are taking decisive action to ensure fire services and national bodies can manage and respond to emergencies.“This includes funding a National Resilience Wildfire Advisor to support a more coordinated response to wildfires, alongside making sure emergency services have the resources they need to keep the public safe.”Explore more on these topicsWildfiresFirefightersClimate crisisFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

Contractors working at the sites, backed by video accounts, said the US security guards fired live ammunition and stun grenades as desperate Palestinians scrambled for food.John Acree, a former senior official at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), said that GHF would transfer its work to the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), the new centre set up by the US in Israel to oversee the ceasefire and aid delivery in Gaza.“GHF has been in talks with CMCC and international organisations now for weeks about the way forward and it’s clear they will be adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted,” he said.The GHF had closed its distribution sites after the US-brokered ceasefire took effect in Gaza last month. All were in the part of Gaza that is under Israel’s control and so were inaccessible to Palestinians.In its statement, the GHF said it had delivered more than 187m meals directly to civilians living in Gaza, which it called “a record humanitarian operation that ensured food aid reached Palestinian families safely and without diversion to Hamas or other entities”.Acree said: “At a critical juncture, we are proud to have been the only aid operation that reliably and safely provided free meals directly to Palestinian people in Gaza, at scale and without diversion … We built a new model that worked, saved lives, and restored dignity to civilians in Gaza.”Acree’spredecessor resigned, saying it was “not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”.The US state department thanked GHF for its humanitarian work and its contribution to reaching a ceasefire in Gaza.Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the US state department, wrote on X: “GHF’s model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire. We thank them for all that they provided to Gazans.”A spokesperson for Hamas said the GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.“We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the [Israeli] government,” Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It said the supposed cartel was “nonexistent” and called the US accusations “slander”.After the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, arrived in the Caribbean in mid-November, speculation intensified that US military chiefs were preparing to launch some kind of operation against land targets within Venezuela.Inan open letter, leftwing European politicians including the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Greece’s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and Labour MP Richard Burgon, warned of “the imminent threat of US military intervention in Venezuela”.“If the US launches a military intervention in Venezuela, it would mark the first interstate war by the United States in South America,” the group wrote, noting how past US military operations in Latin America linked to the “war on drugs” had “delivered not security but a torrent of bloodshed, dispossession, and destabilisation”.3:34'War on drugs' or political agitation? Assessing Trump's actions in Venezuela – video explainerEuropean governments have reportedly become so concerned about the prospect of future potentially illegal strikes in the region that France and the Netherlands had joined the UK in limiting intelligence sharing with Washington, AFP reported on Sunday.On Saturday, Reuters said four US officials had told its reporters Washington was poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations in the coming days. Two officials claimed the options under consideration included trying to overthrow Maduro, although the news agency emphasised that Trump had yet to make a decision. Last week, the US president signaled he was willing to talk to Maduro and expected to do so “in a not too distant future”.Amid growing tensions, at least half a dozen major airlines suspended or cancelled their flights in and out of Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week warned of “heightened military activity in or around Venezuela”.Those airlines included Portugal’s TAP, Spain’s Iberia, Colombia’s Avianca, Brazil’s Gol, the Latin American carrier Latam and Turkish Airlines.

Lucky old heaven getting such a dazzling newcomer.”Born June Flewett in London in 1927, she was evacuated as a young teenager to Oxford and eventually employed as a housekeeper at the Kilns, the house Lewis shared with his brother, Warnie, and adoptive mother and possible partner Janie Moore.Speaking to the Daily Telegraph in 2005, she recalled knowing her first meeting with Lewis was “something momentous” and confessed to a “schoolgirl crush” on him.“He looked like a ruddy-cheeked farmer: heavy jowls, stick, tweeds, big shoes, labrador, tall – well, tall to me. I thought he was wonderful.”View image in fullscreenJill, Clement and Emma in 1987.Photograph: Today/ShutterstockIn a letter to Flewett’s mother in 1945, two years after her daughter began living with them, Lewis wrote: “I have never really met anything like her unselfishness and patience and kindness and shall feel deeply in her debt as long as I live.”She recalled the enormous cupboard on the landing at the Kilns, thought to be the original wardrobe into which the brave and curious Lucy – the youngest and kindest of four children who comes as an evacuee to stay with a professor during the war – climbs to discover Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Lewis sent her the book –which he dedicated to his goddaughter, Lucy– after publication, but she wasn’t aware of her direct involvement in it until after his death, when Douglas Gresham, the son of Joy, the American academic Lewis married in 1956, wrote to her saying: “I suppose you know you are the prototype for Lucy.”Lewis had paid for her scholarship to Rada, which she deferred for two years until she was 18, to better care for the writer and Moore when she was laid low through ill-health.After graduating, she adopted the stage name Jill Raymond and progressed quickly to the West End, where she starred opposite the likes of Michael Redgrave and won roles in TV shows such as Torchy, the Battery Boy.View image in fullscreenIn 1954 when Clement was still a celebrity chef.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesIn 1950 she married the then-chef Clement Freud, the grandson ofSigmund Freud, with whom she had five children, including Emma, who became a scriptwriter, and Matthew, the PR executive and head of Freud Communications.In the 1970s, her husband became a Liberal MP and his wife helped in canvass, while also taking part in radio shows.

The assets included four metal shredders and three port facilities, among its 27 UK locations, with headquarters in Stratford-upon-Avon.However, Unimetals struggled earlier this year as the supply of excess scrap and steel was higher than demand, denting prices. Sims allowed it to delay a final payment, but Unimetals was unable to get the money together.Under Sims’s ownership the business had lost £22m in the year to June 2023, the last for which it has published accounts.

Whether he wants an acting credit or has suddenly come over all inclusive remains to be seenMon 24 Nov 2025 11.36 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 11.38 ESTShareIt is said that by 328BC, having made empires kneel to him, Alexander the Great wept … for there were no more worlds to conquer.Similarly, having solved the Middle East and Ukraine issues with only a couple of technicalities to iron out and put an end to so many other wars as well,Donald Trumpmay also be tempted to sob at having run out of important tasks. And yet, just as he is about to kneel in anguish on the Oval Office carpet, he is apparently perking up at the thought of one more mighty challenge.He can revive the Rush Hour movie franchise!Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of Paramount Skydance – which, earlier this year, as Paramount Global,settled a lawsuit with Trumpnot dissimilar to the one he’s recently threatened the BBC with – hasreportedly been leant on by thecommander in chief to revive the affectionately remembered Rush Hour films – the knockabout buddy cop adventures starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.A fourth Rush Hour film is reportedly a central part of Trump’s second-term project – a dream of reintroducing some old-fashioned masculinity into Hollywood culture and it would moreover create some employment for that unlovely Tinseltown hombre who directed the first three Rush Hour films – Brett Ratner.Ratner wasaccused of sexual assault in 2017, allegations which he denied. But, with privileged access, has nowdirected a $40m documentaryabout Melania Trump – the kind of film that can only be described as “soft-hitting”.Does the world really need or want Rush Hour 4? If it did, surely we would have it by now? Market forces in the brutally commercial Darwinian jungle of franchise cinema would have created Rush Hour 4. Or at the very least rebooted it for streaming TV with a younger cast and maybe David Harbour as the glowering police chief.The idea of the Rush Hour series is a quirky odd-couple pairing of two cops: Chris Tucker’s James Carter from the LAPD and Jackie Chan’s Yan Naing Lee from the Hong Kong Police Force. They both get to play “fish out of water” comedy – the water being each other’s culture – with some very broad and arguably problematic sexual comedy. And, of course, there are plenty of fights, with Tucker giving us some all-American punch-ups and Chan busting out some uproarious martial arts moves.It’s all very undemanding, stereotypical stuff and Donald absolutely loves it. Could it be that Rush Hour 4 will feature one of his wooden cameos, or something more? Or it could be that the president is – like Arnold Schwarzenegger – starting to envision a post-political return to the glamorous world of show business. Perhaps he will wish to produce as well as star.But there is another possibility. Recently, Trump played host to New York’s Democratic socialist mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani; the meeting that many thought could only end in the kind of tongue-lashing that the president notoriously gave Volodymyr Zelenskyy on their first encounter. But no. It was all smiles. A very unexpected bromance seemed to be in the offing. Could it be that Trump likes the idea of Rush Hour because it’s so … inclusive? A black guy and an Asian guy united under the American banner. Has Mamdani finally softened Trump’s worldview? If so, and if Rush Hour 4 is the result, well, it could have been worse.Explore more on these topicsFilmDonald TrumpJackie ChanUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We wanted to make a science fiction movie inspired by Dr Strangelove and 2001. We had no money but we did have enormous ambition. Dan co-wrote it, and he was also its production designer and editor, and he acted in the movie, playing Sergeant Pinback.We started off with some money from my parents, shooting on 16mm. It was a very long process of shooting a scene, then pausing to raise money to shoot the next. Dan and I built the sets with help from college friends, and students also acted as cast and crew. The voice of the computer in Dark Star was Barbara “Cookie” Knapp, the wife of our cameraman.The ice vapour was made with kerosene mist – which is not something you want to breathe“Dirty Space” was a choice we made because we thought that, knowing human beings, the kind of sterility you saw in science fiction such as 2001 wasn’t going to happen. Also, of course, it was cheaper. The spaceship was designed by Ron Cobb, a friend of Dan’s. The whole premise, of a spaceship in deep space bombing unstable planets, didn’t really make sense – the film was always humorous.By the summer of 1972 we had 45 minutes of footage, and we shopped it around and got the money to make it into a full-length feature film. We went looking for a distributor and Jack Harris, who’d produced The Blob, took it on. He was looking for a space movie, but there were certain things he wanted included – a bunch of cliches, such as a meteor storm. We needed distribution, so we did it. I wrote the soundtrack, as well as the music for the song Benson Arizona, whichplays over the opening and closing credits. The lyrics were written by Bill Taylor, the special effects technician.The extra footage shot to make it feature-length included the scenes withthe alien. By that point, we were full into comedy. We’d been using a beachball to represent a planet – it had a couple of bathroom plungers stuck to the bottom – and one day I saw it being carried by a crew member. I thought it looked so ridiculous that we should try something similar for the alien! Nick Castle, who played the alien, gave it a lot of character. He later carried on the tradition by playingThe Shape in Halloween.Brian Narelle, played Lieutenant DoolittleFilming was supposed to take a month but ended up happening at intervals over three years. The first scene we shot was in a closet in a student building – I don’t think the spaceship’s control room set had been finished. There was a women’s group holding a meeting in the next room; the noise they were making made things difficult for us and we were annoying them. Coincidentally, George Roy Hill was filming the swimming pool scene forSlaughterhouse-Fivein the gymnasium over the street.The buttons in the control room were upside-down plastic ice cube trays, and my space suit had an inverted plastic dish-drying rack stuck to it. When I was wearing the helmet, I had to act without oxygen. After each line, O’Bannon would rip the helmet off, taking my ears with it, and walk me outside for some cool air.In the scene in which the crew members are relaxing, Cal Kuniholm, who played Boiler, improvised the trick where he stabs a knife back and forth between his spread-out fingers. He accidentally skewered a finger for real, but didn’t flinch or break character. As soon as Carpenter yelled, “Cut!” he went, “Shit! Goddam!” You don’t hear the sound of the stab in the film, but I can still hear it in my head. Watching Dark Star now, I turn away when that happens.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t give me any of that intelligent life crap, just find me something I can blow up’ … from left, Dan O’Bannon, Cal Kuniholm and Brian Narelle.Photograph: Ronald GrantAlthough Doolittle makes a couple of trips to talk to Sgt Talby in the ship’s observation dome, each side of the conversation was filmed at different times – I was really talking to a light on a stand. I didn’t actually meet Dre Pahich, who played Talby, until the premiere. His voice in the film is actually John’s. John voiced the deceased commander, too, when Doolittle visits him in the freezer for advice. The ice vapour down there was made with kerosene mist, which is not something you want to breathe. Between takes, I had a wet cloth over my face and was trying not to slip and break my ass.Dark Star opened in 45 theatres: a movie starring nobody anyone knew, that people didn’t understand was a comedy. Dan O’Bannon left a screening where 12 curious people walked in and didn’t know what they were looking at. He said: “Fuck ’em. If I can’t make them laugh, I’ll scare the shit out of them.” And that was the seed for his screenplay forAlien.A few years later, at San Diego Comic Con, I was introduced to Ray Bradbury. I was thrilled to meet this literary legend, but when Bradbury heard I was representing Dark Star he really let me have it, claiming it had ripped off ideas from his writing. He was wearing these Coke bottle glasses and I felt like an insect being burned under a magnifying glass.John Carpenter on horror classic The Thing: ‘It was an enormous failure and I got fired’Read moreDoolittle’s character – and the entire film – is summarised by one line: “Don’t give me any of that intelligent life crap, just find me something I can blow up.” Right now, that’s an attitude that feels even more disturbing. Doolittle’s lack of success when trying topersuade the bomb not to explodeis also not a monument to our chances of victory over AI. The film has things to say about today that it couldn’t say in 1974.The 4K restoration of Dark Star is out now on UHD and Blu-RayExplore more on these topicsScience fiction and fantasy filmsHow we madeJohn CarpenterComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It becomes a moving treatise on the sadness of letting go of a parentJack SealeMon 24 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 10.45 ESTShareCelebrities are forever taking their parents on televised road trips, and they’re usually cheap, easy commissions. Look how self-deprecating I am, says the famous person as they try to award themselves national treasure status by moving into light-factual programming: the person who knows me best is about to mildly embarrass me on holiday!Be assured that Chris Hemsworth: A Road Trip to Remember is a more serious endeavour. It features some intergenerational joshing as the guy from the Thor movies goes on a motorcycle ride with his old fella, but this is a journey filled with a wistful, desperate longing, towards a destination nobody can quite reach. Craig Hemsworth, 71, has early-stage Alzheimer’s. His mental faculties are starting to slip. But his boy is a Hollywood star, with the resources of a TV company behind him. Can he help?Chris teams up with clinical psychologist Dr Suraj Samtani, who advises on how dementia breaks connections in the brain, and how the patient’s behaviour can slow that process down. Social interactions can forge new neural pathways, but the Hemsworths are particularly interested in what Samtani refers to as “practising retrieving memories from the past”. At home you might sing old songs or watch home movies; this is TV, where grander schemes are possible.So Chris and Craig park their bikes, first, at the home on the outskirts of Melbourne where the Hemsworth kids spent their teens. They’re not just visiting: using an extensive library of family photos, the house has been painstakingly re-styled to look exactly as it did in the 1990s, from the sofas to the posters on Chris’s bedroom wall. Craig sparkles as he remembers making wooden planes for his boys, and how cold the place got in winter. He wants to share this immersive experience with Leonie, his wife of 44 years: “Where’s Leonie? She coming?”Leonie is coming: she’s not on the motorcycle trip, but the producers are flying her to each location. “She’s coming, Dad.” Moments after being told this, Craig has what for him is a new thought: “Where’s Leonie? She coming?”The look on Chris Hemsworth’s face when his father falters is heartbreaking: dementia is as devastating for the loved ones as it is for the patient, we’re reminded, as Chris spectates helplessly and Leonie breaks down in one of her interviews, suffering the slow-motion grief of losing someone who is losing their mind. And so, when father and son get back on their Harley-Davidsons to go further back in time at another former family home way up in Bulman, Northern Territory, the programme becomes as much about Chris as it is Craig.Chris Hemsworth is a superhero on screen and generally a convivial presence off it, but his previous factual series, Limitless, revealed the vulnerable worrier beneath. There he took on extreme challenges designed to bolster wellness, including fighting ageing: he donned a weighted suit that mimicked elderly frailty and spent three days living in a retirement community. He knows he has the genes that make him likely to develop dementia himself. Although his dad’s condition in the present is of course his primary focus, Chris is concerned for his own future welfare.But that’s not what is really at the heart of A Road Trip to Remember. Bulman is the proper outback, hours from the nearest town, where the little boy Chris enjoyed wild early years. Here was where Craig was at his extraordinary best, working as a buffalo wrangler alongside the local Indigenous community, wowing his son just as he would later in life as a professional motorcycle racer and, in a different way, as a child protection officer.Craig was his son’s hero. A Road Trip to Remember becomes not just a programme about Chris’s horror at losing the Craig of today, but a moving treatise on his sadness at letting go, as every grownup must, of the person his parent used to be, the one who gave him his childhood. The sights and the smells of this part of the country feel, Chris says, “very comfortable, safe, [like being] taken back to a time when everything seemed far less complicated”.The programme starts and ends with Chris holding up a cherished photograph, capturing a moment in the bush where Craig, looking eerily like Chris does now, is looking at his boy with all-consuming adoration. “I’d love to go back there,” says Chris, and they do visit that exact spot in the outback, but what Hemsworth really wants is to go back to the time in the photo, not just the place. All the money and science in the world can’t give you that.Chris Hemsworth: A Road Trip to Remember is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewChris HemsworthreviewsShareReuse this content"

The band’s lineup changed about as often as that of the Fall, and Michael was once one of the guys singing backing vocals while dressed as a pineapple.But when frontmanColin Gibbwas forced out after an underage sex scandal, and the other frontman, Alan Barton, left to join the band Smokie, Michael was taken out of the pineapple costume, promoted to singer and effectively left in sole charge of the band. Since the 1980s, he has been endlessly touring the sad disco circuit from Blackpool to Benidorm, belting out Black Lace hits to dwindling drunk crowds as if in some Alan Partridge nightmare.We watch as Dene, along with his girlfriend Hayley and his sweet, gentle, elderly mum Anne, hit the road. But then poor Dene is fired by his manager, who evidently has the legal rights to the trademarked band name and its songs, and some other, younger singer gets to tour under the Black Lace banner. So Dene faces a very uncertain future in the cruel world of showbusiness.The movie presents Dene as a nice guy who loves his mum. That’s probably exactly what he is, but it misses out a more troubled part of his life –a jail sentence in 2016 for benefit fraud. Perhaps the jokey scenes of Dene rolling around on a mobility scooter are an allusion to this. There is always redemption and sympathy, but it would have been better (and more interesting) to talk about this more frankly. In any case, the film has a kind of melancholy that Martin Parr might have wanted to photograph.Still Pushing Pineapples is in UK cinemas from 28 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPop and rockMusic documentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the first five minutes, we’ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titansBring Me the Horizon, who they supported last year. Opener Specter is enough to justify this step up: an anthemic recent single as atmospheric as the dry ice crawling around frontman Noah Sebastian.Although tonight’s set list is rooted in metal, it showcases the band’s ambitions towards other genres, incorporating elements of industrial, electronica and drum’n’bass. This fluid approach is anchored by Sebastian’s supremely adaptable vocals, which switch from croon to scream to whisper, even deftly mimicking the flow of metal princess Poppy during their collaborative single VAN. Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance. The band’s willingness to lean into zeitgeisty pop sounds is key to their mainstream appeal: The Death of Peace of Mind is reminiscent of the gloomy R&B of the Weeknd, by way of Bring Me the Horizon – all falsetto and moody beats with heavy metal drops.View image in fullscreenPulling out the stops … Bad Omens’s stage show.Photograph: PR IMAGEThis unabashedly big sound and anthemic songwriting is well suited to arenas – but Bad Omens themselves are not, at least not yet. They’re more like consummate professionals playing a good reproduction of what’s already on record; it might be big-venue nerves, or how spread out they are, but there’s a lack of connection on stage, like a star and his backing band rather than a group with chemistry. And a reluctant star at that: when Sebastian asks the audience if they’re having fun, he doesn’t seem to be having that much of it himself.AtAlexandra Palace, London, 26 November;then touring.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Really? Think!You must pull yourself together, moon.You say you remember things.What can you remember?It’s embarrassing. You think you’re all right.Only yesterday you put rice crispies in the fridge.What’s going to happen next?If your hand trembles, sit on it. Wipe your mouth.Skittering about. When did you have a decent job?Your voice is like a nervous cough.You must pull yourself togetherAnd shut the door if you can’t sing in tune.Your eyes look like two catacombsAnd make me think of furnished rooms.We’ve heard enough of Grandad’s work in Leeds.Your eyes look like abandoned creeds.Miles Burrows, born in Leicester in 1936, published his first collection with Cape when he was around 30. In the succeeding decades he worked in various countries and practised medicine before his more subversive vocation was celebrated by Carcanet’s 2017 publication ofWaiting for the Nightingale. It was followed by a Collected Poems, Take us the Little Foxes, in 2021.This week’s poem, Missing You, is from Burrows’ latest volume,Slow Puncture. It’s related to one of the new poems in the Collected, Remonstrating with the Moon, expanded now with additional “characters” and a focus on the sheer savagery of western social attitudes towards ageing. Like much of Burrows’ work, and important to the pleasure of engaging with it, it presents readers with a bizarre but far from unreal theatrical scene, and insists we stage it in our own imaginations.Missing You seems to gather together a family conference on “what to do” about a very senior relative, who is imagined, cruelly and comically, both as moon and person. As the lights go up, one character whispers resonantly to another “Did you know the moon was so old / It might have to go into a home?” The moon-person, on-stage (it’s fun to imagine the costume and the antics), represents non-personhood, and may be assumed not to overhear these words. As the poem’s title suggests, there is a “you” who is “missing”, as well as a “you” that is missed.In the second couplet I imagine a second voice, raised in corroboration with the first, only to expose an ignorance of lunar fact. The moon-person is imagined to be “edging nearer / The way old people do.” The actual moon, however, is yearly increasing its distance from planet Earth. I’d go further in the dramatisation, and suggest the moon-person is given a speaking part in the next two couplets, tossing random facts together, as if remembering some important information from its specialism, lighting. Art, science and one of the moons of Saturn,Enceladus, are illuminated briefly in cheery non sequiturs.Missing You is a macrocosm of one of Burrows’ favourite devices: the joke and its dismantling. Moon-person’s listed failings include the innocent moon-habit of “Peering into people’s bedrooms” and the harmless practice of storing “rice crispies” in the fridge. But the fun dissipates, and there’s a steadily hardening impatience and anger. This phase of the poem could be expressed as a Greek chorus of unanimous disapproval.The intensifying re-characterisation takes apart the Romantic, or romantically decadent, moons of poetry. This moon is increasingly recognisable as an ageing human body, marked by forgetfulness, hand-tremor, the habit of “skittering about”, the voice “like a nervous cough”. Polite concealment is urgently required. The moon-person in the meantime has begun singing horribly, intending to drown out the repeated commands to “pull yourself together”. It may have begun to feel strangely liberated by the fragmentation of its identity, and the limitless antisocial possibilities revealed.Its face at the end of the poem reminded me faintly of Sylvia Plath’s moon imagery inThe Moon and the Yew Tree. Burrows redoubles the bone-cold bleakness, an effect produced from the similes themselves, and the reiteration of the end-rhymes: “Your eyes look like two catacombs / And make me think of furnished rooms”. “Catacombs” and “furnished rooms” evoke mismatch and connection between echoing hollowness and stifling clutter; both suggest extremes of isolation and human invisibility. Most of us, if we’re like the middle-class characters in Burrows’ satire, will leave furnished rooms behind us when we die.Not all humour has yet drained away. The first line of the last couplet is funny, because “Grandad’s work in Leeds” still cooperates with the oddity of a moon that’s also a person – one proud, it seems, of its working-class roots. But the return in the final line to eyes “like abandoned creeds” is frankly grim. It seems to echo the reference to the Spanish civil war (line eight), which, according to the adjusted calendar of Enceladus, the speaker had decided would be happening about now: “Tonight we have the Spanish Civil War”. The relatives are making war on the moon-person, but they’re moon-people too, their dreams and creeds ephemeral, betrayed by the unavoidable negligence of dying.If Missing You plunges at times into fury and gloom, Slow Puncture is a happy reminder of what a rare satirical and self-mocking talent Burrows deploys. He can be heard inimitably introducing himself andreading from his Collected Poems here.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s the famous portrait of the king himself – puffy, phallic and cruel, looking more like a murderer than a monarch. But there is also ascetic Thomas More, hiding his cruel streak behind fine bones, and sly yet thuggish Thomas Cromwell, with those shifty eyes and the beginnings of a double chin. “Hans the Painter” did the wives too – an appropriately sketchy drawing of Anne Boleyn, a saintly portrait of Jane Seymour who died after giving birth to Henry’s heir, and a pin-up version of Anne of Cleves.It was this last portrait that caused an international incident in 1539 when Holbein was sent by Henry to the Low Countries to check whether Anne was pretty enough to be his next wife. Based on Holbein’s portrait, Henry committed to the marriage in absentia, only to be horrified when the actual Anne arrived on the Kentish coast, looking “nothing so fair as she hath been reported”. The union lasted six months.In this magnificent book, the first scholarly biography of Holbein in more than 100 years, art historian Elizabeth Goldring characterises the Cleves affair as a “debacle” but also points out that it was a rare misstep for Holbein, whose portraits generally struck contemporaries as uncannily lifelike. And even though today we have no way of judging their verisimilitude, there is no mistaking their essential vitality: you would swear Holbein’s people are blinking and breathing before you, ready to reach out and shake your hand.Consider his early pictures of the Dutch humanist Erasmus, commissioned in 1523 when both men were living in Basel. The middle-aged scholar’s deeply etched face manages to convey both generic qualities of intellectual rigour and benign humanism while remaining utterly individual, with a wide, curving mouth and deep-set eyes. And there is a certain cheeky humour in evidence, too. In the background of the portrait now hanging in the National Gallery is a Latin tag, presumably by Erasmus (Holbein had only a rudimentary education), which calls attention to the artist’s juvenile cockiness: “I am Johannes Holbein, whom it is easier to denigrate than to emulate.”View image in fullscreenJane Seymour by Hans Holbein (1536).Photograph: PAINTING/AlamyIt was Erasmus who was responsible for getting Holbein to Britain in 1526, when he wrote a letter recommending the young man to his friend Thomas More. More, who was on his way to becoming lord chancellor, quickly commissioned a series of portraits. Holbein presciently rendered the saintly More as saturnine, with the beginnings of cruelty about his mouth. Here was a man who was simultaneously devoted to God while busily installing a set of stocks at his Chelsea home with which to torture heretics. The fact that More famously opposed Henry’s attempts to obtain a divorce and marry Anne Boleyn may explain why the portrait that now hangs in the Frick Collection in New York has two large, centuries-old vertical splits. Boleyn was reputedly so angry with her nemesis that she dragged Holbein’s painting – the next best thing to More himself – from the wall and flung it on the ground.All that lay in the future, though. After the portraits, Holbein busied himself with painting the large More clan as the epitome of a happy Christian household. Well-dressed women dominate this canvas, with More’s clever daughters and female wards consulting their prayer books while Alice, his second wife, wears an ostentatious crucifix. This mood of prosperous devotion is in startling contrast to a picture Holbein did on his return to Basel the following year. Portrait of the Artist’s Family shows a red-eyed, bone-tired Elsbeth Holbein looking like a soiled Madonna with her two peaky children. Having been left behind to function as a single mother and workshop supervisor while her husband was getting famous in England, Frau Holbein can hardly be blamed for not bothering to disguise her exhaustion and resentment.His great achievement was to bring before us living, breathing men and womenThe chronology of Holbein’s life is complicated and opaque, but Goldring does a good job of keeping things on track without pretending to absolute certainty. It appears that Holbein didn’t stay in Basel very long once the city had become a religious war zone, with Protestant activists creating a bonfire out of Catholic vanities. Instead, he returned to the Henrician court, this time permanently, leaving Elsbeth to fend for herself. To add insult to injury, he seems to have taken up with a woman in London, fathering another two children.Returning to England was, however, no guarantee of political safety. Thomas More would soon be executed for refusing to recognise Henry as the supreme head of the new Church of England, and it says a great deal for Holbein’s survival skills that he did not go down with his erstwhile patron. Instead, on this second and final trip, he shrewdly pivoted towards the new man Thomas Cromwell and the new queen, Anne Boleyn.For Anne’s coronation in 1533 Holbein built an extraordinary triumphal arch out of papier-mache painted to look like marble. (Goldring reminds us that, like all Renaissance artists, “Maister Hans” could turn his hand to anything.). It would take another five years, though, before he finally got what he had been angling for – a place on the royal payroll and the title of “King’s Painter”. What sealed the deal was a series of huge murals undertaken for the Palace of Whitehall. It was here that Holbein’s iconic rendering of Henry first appeared, the one that is recognised around the world today.View image in fullscreenHolbein’s portrait of Henry VIII from 1540.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesBarrel-chested and bulked out with padded shoulders and an enormous codpiece, Holbein’s Henry stands glittering and thuggish, ready to take on all-comers. According to a slightly later source, to be in the presence of this Whitehall Henry was to feel annihilated, which was exactly the intended effect – since the real flesh-and-blood Henry was in a far more parlous state. A recent jousting accident had left him with ferocious headaches and a leg so putrid that you could smell him coming. It was hard not to feel pity.All of which is ironic, given that there was no artist better than Holbein at confronting the brute realities of ailing flesh. Fifteen years earlier, he had painted The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb, a grotesque rendering of Jesus’s decomposing corpse. In this lifesize image, the mouth and eyes hang open, the skin is already going green and the fingers have begun to stiffen with rigor mortis. More than 400 years later, Fyodor Dostoevsky would find the painting so disturbing that his wife insisted on dragging him away, terrified that it would trigger an epileptic seizure. Nonetheless, Holbein’s visceral painting made its way – almost as a character in its own right – into The Idiot (1869).In her introduction, Goldring seems wary of characterising her extraordinary book as a biography. This is doubtless because of a long-held scholarly suspicion of treating works of art as if they are mere anecdotes culled from an artist’s life, rather than autonomous creative objects. But in the case of Hans Holbein it is impossible to see how one could do otherwise than plunge into a world of rich and vital lived experience. His great achievement was to bring before us the living, breathing men and women who plotted, suffered, contrived and triumphed through the most terrifying decades of English history. And it is Goldring’s achievement to show us the process by which this magic happened.Holbein: Renaissance Master by Elizabeth Goldring is published by Paul Mellon Centre (£40).

What this masterpiece reveals about the rogue geniusIn three thrilling works by Caravaggio, the same boy’s face crops up. As one – the astonishing Victorious Cupid – arrives in Britain, we ask: who was this anarchic model and muse?Jonathan JonesMon 24 Nov 2025 10.49 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 13.33 ESTShareThe boy howls as his head is held down, a huge thumb pressing into his cheek as his father’s mighty hand holds him by the neck. This is The Sacrifice of Isaac and I am looking at it in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, feeling distressed by howCaravaggiohas so chillingly rendered the face of this suffering child from the biblical tale. It looks as if Abraham, who has been told by God to kill his son, could break his neck with just one twist. Yet Abraham’s preferred method is with the silvery grey knife he holds in his other hand, ready to slit Isaac’s throat. One thing’s for certain – whoever posed as Isaac for this astonishing work was a great actor. There is not just dread, shock and pleading in his darkened eyes but also grief that a guardian could betray him so utterly.Standing in front of the painting, I know this is a real face, an accurate record of a young model, because the same boy – recognisable by his tousled hair and almost black eyes – appears in two other paintings by Caravaggio. In each, that richly expressive face steals the show. In John the Baptist, he looks mischievously out of the shadows while cuddling a ram. In Victorious Cupid, he grins with a hardness learned on Rome’s streets, his black feathery wings demonic, a naked kid running riot in a well-to-do house.He took a familiar biblical story and made it so fresh and raw that its horrors seemed to happen in front of youVictorious Cupid, which goes on show this weekat the Wallace Collection in London, is the most embarrassing masterpiece ever painted. You feel totally thrown looking at it. Cupid, the god of love whose arrows fill people with often painful desire, is depicted as a very real, brightly lit nude, straddling toppled-over objects that include stringed instruments, a music manuscript, plate armour and an architect’s T-square. This pile of stuff resembles, deliberately, the mathematical and architectural gear scattered across the floor in Albrecht Dürer’s engraving Melencolia I – except here, the melancholic mess is caused by this grinning Cupid and the mayhem he can unleash.View image in fullscreenShock, dread and pleading … Caravaggio’s The Sacrifice of Isaac.Illustration: Heritage Images/Getty Images“Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, / And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind,” wrote Shakespeare, just before this was painted in around 1601. But Caravaggio’s Cupid is not blind. He looks right at you. That face – ironic and ruddy-cheeked, staring with brazen confidence as he struts naked – is the same one that screams in terror in The Sacrifice of Isaac.When Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio painted his three images of the same funny-looking kid in Rome at the start of the 17th century, he was the most acclaimed religious artist in a city enflamed by Catholic revival. The Sacrifice of Isaac shows why he was in demand to decorate churches: he could take a biblical story that had been depicted many times before and make it so fresh, so raw and visceral that the horror seemed to be happening right in front of you.Yet there was another side to Caravaggio, apparent as soon as he arrived in Rome in the winter that ended 1592, as a painter in his early 20s with no teacher or patron in the city, just skill and audacity. Most of the paintings with which he caught the holy city’s eye were anything but holy. What may be the very earliest hangs in London’s National Gallery. A youth opens his crimson lips in a yell of pain: while reaching out his filthy fingers for a cherry, he has instead been attacked. Boy Bitten By a Lizard is sensuality amid squalor: you can see Caravaggio’s dismal chamber reflected in the murky waters of the glass vase.View image in fullscreenWilderness or bedroom? … Caravaggio’s John the Baptist (Youth With a Ram).Illustration: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThe boy wears a pink flower in his hair – a symbol of the sex trade in Renaissance art. Venetian artists such as Titian and Palma Vecchio portrayed courtesans holding flowers and, in a work destroyed in the second world war but known through photographs, Caravaggio portrayed a famous female courtesan, Fillide Melandroni, holding a posy to her chest. The message of all these floral signifiers is clear: sex for sale.What are we to make of Caravaggio’s sensual depictions of boys – and of one boy in particular? It is a question that has divided his interpreters ever since he achieved mega-fame in the 1980s. The complex historical reality is that the artist was neither the queer hero that, for example, Derek Jarman put on screen inhis 1986 film Caravaggio, nor so completely pious that, as some art historians improbably claim, his Boy With a Basket of Fruit is actually a portrait of Jesus.His early paintings do make explicit sexual suggestions, or even offers. It’s as if Caravaggio, then a penniless young painter, identified with Rome’s sex workers, selling himself to survive. In the Uffizi, with this thought in mind, I turn to another early work, the 1596 masterpiece Bacchus, in which the god of wine stares coolly at you as he starts to undo the black ribbon of his robe.A few years after Bacchus, what could have driven Caravaggio to paint Victorious Cupid for the art collector Vincenzo Giustiniani, when he was finally becoming almost respectable with prestigious church commissions? This unholy pagan god resurrects the sexual provocations of his early works but in a more intense, uneasy way. Half a century later, its secret seemed obvious: it was a portrait of Caravaggio’s lover. The British traveller Richard Symonds saw Victorious Cupid in about 1649 and was told its subject has “the body & face of [Caravaggio’s] owne boy or servant that laid with him”. The name of this boy was Cecco.The painter had been dead for about 40 years when Symonds heard this. Similar tales had circulated about Italian artists in the past. It was claimed the sculptor Donatello was obsessively in love with an apprentice, which makes sense if you have ever seen his nude bronze David. But was the story just a way of rationalising the suggestiveness of Donatello’s statue? Giorgio Vasari, the painter and historian, even gossips that Leonardo da Vinci “took for his assistant the Milanese Salaì, who was most comely in grace and beauty, having fine locks curling in ringlets, in which Leonardo greatly delighted”.View image in fullscreenFloral signal … Boy Bitten by a Lizard.Illustration: DEA/G Nimatallah/De Agostini/Getty ImagesWas Caravaggio’s Cecco a fable? No – for, as we have seen, the boy in this painting was the painter’s regular model in the early 1600s, which fits with him being on hand in the artist’s home, as pupil and servant. In all three paintings, he has incredible presence and individuality – performing, you might almost say, for the camera, but in reality for his master. And in two of the paintings, he is stark naked.The most intimate, though, is John the Baptist. As John embraces a ram with curly horns, he sits on a red blanket cushioned with white pillows and comfy fur, his body raked by light that catches his legs and shoulders while his penis is in the shadows, though still visible. It’s meant to be a wilderness but feels more like a bedroom, one that he looks out from relaxed, not in the least embarrassed. Meanwhile, the ram gazes at him, dotes on him. Could this lovestruck face be Caravaggio portraying himself as the horned, devilish beast?That would certainly fit with how Caravaggio’s enemy, the artist Giovanni Baglione, saw him. In 1602, this much less talented rival painted Sacred and Profane Love, a riposte to Victorious Cupid, setting himself up as the Christian antithesis to Caravaggio’s satanic excesses. Baglione depicts the angel of sacred love stepping between a red-fleshed devil with Caravaggio’s features and his “catamite”. The angelic saviour looks lovingly down on the youth while the Caravaggio-faced demon rages at being denied the object of his lust. It’s a vicious parody of Victorious Cupid that makes a dangerous accusation: Caravaggio is a sodomite and his Cupid is his victim.Caravaggio hit back. He and his friend, the artist Orazio Gentileschi, posted rude poems about Baglione in the streets of Rome, accusing him – justifiably – of being a lousy painter. Baglione in turn accused them of libel and took them to court. In his testimony, Gentileschi mentioned that Caravaggio had recently visited his house to borrow a pair of strap-on wings, presumably the ones Victorious Cupid wears.View image in fullscreenA riposte … Caravaggio is depicted as a raging demon in Sacred and Profane Love by Baglione Giovanni.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty ImagesCaravaggio lost the case and was dogged by more charges for violent crimes, until he had to flee Rome after killing a man in 1606. But his untamed genius inspired an artistic movement across the continent. His radical, brutal style, stark use of light, and tough everyday stories caught the imaginations of young artists across Europe, from Orazio’s daughter Artemisia Gentileschi to Georges de la Tour, Diego Velázquez and the Caravaggisti of Utrecht. And, of course, there was Cecco del Caravaggio, as he became known.Whatever else Caravaggio did to Cecco – we will obviously never know – he trained him as a painter. Symonds refers to the model for Cupid as an artist in his own right: “Checco del Caravaggio tis calld among the painters”. Cecco’s Interior With a Young Man Holding a Recorder, in Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum, incorporates a skilful array of objects, including fruit and musical instruments, very much in Caaravaggio’s mode. Even more Caravaggesque is a vessel containing water in which we see distorted reflections, echoing Boy Bitten By a Lizard.View image in fullscreenA haunting, haunted face … Caravaggio put his own features on to the severed head in David with the Head of Goliath.Photograph: incamerastock/AlamyDo we need to know about the private lives of artists? Vasari thought so. For some experts on baroque art, the idea that Caravaggio went around Catholic Rome flaunting his sinful life is unbelievable – yet his paintings do exactly that. What we can’t do is call him gay or queer in any comfortable sense. The past is another country and they desired differently there. The latest serious historical studies of sex relations between males in early modern Italy show that, despite the proscriptions of church and court, there was a lot of it going on.The historian Michael Rocke has found that, during a 70-year period of the 15th century, 13,000 men in Florence – a city with a population of 40,000 – were accused of sodomy. And those who were convicted usually got off with a fine, often “offending” again. But the convention was that mature men desired younger males: Leonardo with Salaì, Caravaggio with Cecco. As Caravaggio’s English contemporary Christopher Marlowe is reported to have said: “They that love not Tobacco and Boys are fools.” This strange, disturbing country of the past is what Caravaggio shoves in your face.Even in that world, Caravaggio was close to the edge and it is there that his art thrives, on a sword-edge of danger. He exhibits his “boy” Cecco in ways that openly defied the church and was called out for this by Baglione. Caravaggio is like Satan, says Baglione’s riposte to his Cupid: he is sin personified.Four hundred years on, we might make more sense of the incredible painting that is coming to the Wallace Collection if we simply use that old word, sin. Caravaggio’s paintings shudder and provoke with sin – the supposedly sinful pleasures of sweet grapes, red wine and sex. He came to see himself as a great sinner. And he was: a murderer who spent his last years on the run, trying to atone with his art.His quest for redemption, by painting altarpieces in southern Italy, plunged him into self-scrutinising reveries. He painted his own face on to the severed head of Goliath, held up by the boy David. It is a haunting, haunted face: Caravaggio imagines himself punished even after death, his eyelids slumped, his mouth open, as his head is held up by the young avenger. For his sins.Caravaggio’s Victorious Cupid is atthe Wallace Collection, London, from 26 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designCaravaggioPaintingExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It looks as though it should be cleaned up, but it won’t be. The rind is not rubbish discarded by a careless visitor: it’s a perfect resin cast made by Armanious.Placed carefully around the gallery are resin recreations of other items more commonly seen in bins: a group of melted candles, blobs of Blu-Tack, crumbly chunks of polystyrene. These might seem unlikely subjects for an exhibition, but Armanious is one of several artists who have turned their eye to trash in recent years. Gavin Turk, Ai Weiwei, Susan Collis and Glen Hayward, among others, all go to similarly painstaking – and often expensive – lengths to recreate items that most people would not look twice at. Trompe l’œil sculptures of rubbish have been exhibited in museums around the world and fetched high prices at galleries and auctions. In October, a pile of sixgarbage bags cast in bronze by Turksold for £82,550 (roughly AU$167,000) at Sotheby’s in London.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningView image in fullscreenVisitors looks at a sculpture by British artist Gavin Turk, titled American Bag, in the grounds of Chatsworth House, England, in 2015Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesAn understandable reaction to Armanious’s shrivelled peel or Turk’s pricey bin bags is: are they a joke? Partly. They are undeniably playful, the artistic equivalent of“is it cake?”, the trend of bakers crafting lifelike replicas of everyday objects out of sponge and icing that swept TikTok, then reality TV.Gavin Turk: art’s king of trash on plastic, protest, prison and canning his peeRead moreArmanious’s creations are the latest in a long line of artworks connected to rubbish. Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque began incorporating scraps of wastepaper into their paintings in 1912. Five years later, Marcel Duchamp famously exhibited a porcelain urinal, an item manufactured to dispose of waste, as art. Ever since, artists have incorporated actual junk into their work to prompt reflection on which objects we value, and why.Creating the illusion of litter, however, is a largely 21st-century phenomenon and artists are pursuing it to varying effect. For Armanious, the labour of making an object, rather than finding one and rebranding it as art, deepens viewers’ investment in it. “The question that’s always asked is: why not just show the real thing? Why bother?” Armanious says. “The answer being, if I didn’t bother making it, you wouldn’t be bothered looking at it.”Sometimes it isn’t always clear what is rubbish and what is art: in 2001,a cleaner in a London galleryaccidentally threw out full ashtrays, half-filled coffee cups, empty beer bottles and newspapers that were actually an artwork by Damien Hirst. The same thing happened againat Sala Murat in Italy in 2014– and again last year, whensome crumpled beer cansmade by French artist Alexandre Lavet were mistaken for rubbish in a Dutch gallery.View image in fullscreenAll the Good Times We Spent Together by Alexandre Lavet. The work was accidentally thrown out by a cleaner at the LAM Museum in Lisse, the Netherlands.Photograph: Alexandre Lavet/LAM museumProducing something new also allows artists to play with materials to comment on what we deem worthy of our attention. In 2008, the British artist Susan Collis had an exhibition at Ingleby gallery in Edinburgh. But on opening night, there was no obvious artwork in sight, just a broom, some screws in the wall and a paint-spattered wooden block on the floor. It was only when visitors looked more closely that they discovered treasure in the detritus. The screws were made from 18-carat white gold and studded with sapphires, while the paint drops and dirt caked on to the broom were opals, pearls and other gemstones.Similarly, for Ai Weiwei’s 2023 exhibition at the Design Museum in London, he made precise marble recreations of a roll of toilet paper and a polystyrene takeaway box, complete with chopsticks. In normal times, these objects would be considered almost worthless, but early in the Covid-19 pandemic they became worth their weight in gold.View image in fullscreenAi Weiwei, Marble Takeout Container, 2015.Photograph: Courtesy Ai Weiwei studioThis heightened questioning of what we value is particularly urgent in our age of climate crisis. Turk made his first bronze bin bag in 2000 and has since made replicas of cardboard boxes, apple cores and much else. (Apples cores are also a favourite subject of Glen Hayward, who carves similar pieces out of wood.) Turk has talked regularly about how we are defined by our rubbish –“We are what we throw away,”he previously told the Guardian– and his bulging bags reveal us to be greedy and wasteful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtesy the artist and Phillida Reid, London.Photograph: C Capurro/Christian CapurroArmanious’s replicas in particular are so accurate that gallery-goers must suspend their disbelief and trust that they truly are casts, not just found items. At Buxton Contemporary, the experience of trying to decipher them becomes a physical and mental task. Some sculptures are placed on the floor, others secreted on windowsills, yet more hung high on the walls, urging people to crouch and tiptoe as they try to look more closely at the works – all while watching their step. The effect is simultaneously unsettling and invigorating.It’s also fun, something that’s not always associated with contemporary art. “If you’re not enjoying the work, and having serious fun, then it’s not working,” says Armanious. “Fun is quite a serious state: it’s fully engaged, amused and curious.”Curiosity is perhaps the word that best describes the feeling engendered by Armanious’s mind-boggling creations. They are so inconceivable that it is tempting to reach out and touch them, to feel the difference between his copies and the originals.

Well, shit, according to Tala Madani. For years now the Iranian-born US artist has been painting Shit Mom, a fetid smear of a human figure intended as a subversion of feminine, maternal ideals. And in the painter’s latest show, Shit Mom has a new child in her care: she has adopted an AI daughter.The rub is immediately obvious: the AI robot represents perfection; Shit Mom its impossibility. As they interact across the canvases, the gleaming mechanical perfection of the daughter – born motherless, hence the show’s title “Daughter BWASM”, or Born Without a Shit Mom – gets streaked with smudges of filthy brown. The more the mum cares for her daughter, the more she taints her. The robot can’t avoid getting moulded in her mother’s image.The show is one of the first instances of AI being used as both toolandsubject in a big London gallery. Madani treats AI like a component of modern society that has to be dealt with, accepted and adapted, rather than just some fancy new toy to gawp at and play with.And they are unique looking paintings: ultra-precise screen prints of AI-generated robots overpainted with loose, brown marks. They’re both glittery and shiny, and dull and gross. In one, two neat pink and orange bots seem to be pregnant with big, gloopy, brown bumps. In another, Shit Mom kneels before her enormous mechanoid child, trying desperately to clean her but only succeeding in tarring her in turd. The whole thing looks like screenshots from I, Robot orEx Machina, caked in skid marks.View image in fullscreenScatological humour as rebellion … Tala Madani’s Shit Mom Ascending a Staircase.Photograph: Fredrik Nilsen Studio/Tala Madani; courtesy the artist and Pilar Corrias, LondonWhich is Madani’s whole shtick. She makes big, clever points in the most intentionally childish, confrontational way. I don’t think these are intended to be beautiful, decorative images. They’re funny, satirical takedowns of societal norms.Where Shit Mom has previously been used to talk about anxieties around motherhood, the character here is dealing instead with technological fears and wider sexism. Why do we call machines “she”? Why are all the robots in cinema hot babes? Madani traces much of it back to early modernists such as Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp. A 1916 painting of a mechanical wheel by Picabia, titledDaughter Born Without a Mother, gets riffed on here (and covered with shit, obviously), while nods to Duchamp’s iconicNude Descending a Staircasereoccur throughout the show. Culture and history have always treated women like machines, mechanical automatons for childbirth and care, and Madani has had enough.Two animated films here play on similar themes. In one, Madani inserts Shit Mom into experimental vignettes ofnude women walkingby Eadweard Muybridge, smearing all the objectified perfection of this early cinematic experimentation. In the other, she makes Shit Mom ascend endless staircases. But I don’t find the films all that interesting – the AI theme is stretched a little thin across the whole show.But with every work here, the artist is rejecting, mocking and spurning norms and expectations. It is scatological humour as rebellion, faeces as fuck you. It’s funny, clever, aggressive, subversive, satirical art. Not shit at all, really.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, the Fairy Godfather has the hots for the dameAnya RyanMon 24 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 04.15 ESTShareThis is not your bog-standard Jack and the Beanstalk. In Sonia Jalaly’s version, the story has been picked up and dropped into a school in Hammersmith, run by the meat-loving monster Fleshcreep (John Partridge, who wears a salami-printed suit). There’s no giant either; just a colossus computer system hidden in the sky, built to wipe children’s brains of all their imagination.It’s all good fun and games, but at times you long for a little familiarity. Still, with the truly wonderful Fairy Godfather (Jade Hackett) at the front and centre of this production, it would take a real Scrooge not to be taken in by all the festivity. Hackett combines wizardry with wisdom to serve up one of the most commanding turns I’ve ever seen on a panto stage.Directed by Nicholai La Barrie, the production fizzes with cheery spark. There’s a fiery love story between Momma Trott and the Fairy Godfather; they’re drawn together like magnets every time they lock eyes on stage. What’s not here are the political jokes that have characterised Lyric pantos of years gone by. Apart from a single reference to theColdplay CCTV cheating saga(very well done), it doesn’t feel particularly topical either.View image in fullscreenNervous character … Joey James as Jack.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSo, La Barrie leans fully into the sparkle of it all. The pop hits come thick and fast, with choreography by Kayla Lomas-Kirton sending the stage into a disco ball frenzy. Jack, played by Joey James, is a nervous little thing and hides behind a sock puppet (used to varying degrees of success) that sits on his arm. His sister Jill (a brilliantly sassy Sienna Widd) has a no-nonsense attitude and refuses to be intimidated by evil Fleshcreep’s threats. When her mum and brother finally enter the giant’s kingdom after climbing a beanstalk made of socks to rescue her, she is totally unfazed by the whole thing.Sam Harrison’s dame might not have the flair of others who have gone before her. But, with Partridge at the helm, this is a properly sinister Christmas hit. Even the audience fear him – proper fee-fi-fo fun.At Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrePanto seasonChildren's theatreLyric HammersmithComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)PuppetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Anyone who’s been listening to the music for at least that long can list myriad reasons why that’s now the case: all the beats sound the same, all the artists are industry plants, all the lyrics are barely intelligible etc.For hip-hop forefather Abiodun Oyewole, though, it boils down to this: “We embraced ‘party and bullshit’, my brother.”Fifty-seven years ago, on what would have been Malcolm X’s 43rd birthday, Oyewole cliqued up with two young poets at a writers’ workshop in East Harlem’s Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) to form what would become the Last Poets, a collective of bard revolutionaries. They outfitted themselves in African prints, performed over the beat of a congo drum and advocated for populism in their verses. The group has had many configurations over the years, but Oyewole, Jalal Mansur Nuriddin and Umar Bin Hassan abide as the standout members. The trio is all over the band’s self-titled first album – which was released in 1970 and peaked at No 29 on the Billboard 200. Their follow-up album, This Is Madness, made them ripe targets for J Edgar Hoover’s Cointelpro campaign against the emerging figures the then-FBI directordeemed politically subversive. Notably, Oyewole could not contribute to that album because he had been incarcerated for an attempted robbery of a Ku Klux Klan headquarters, serving two and a half years of a three-year sentence. (He was trying to raise bail for activists who had been arrested for striking back at the Klan.)Though dubbed “jazz poetry” at the time, the Last Poets’ tight rhythms, insurgent message and prevailing emphasis on Black consciousness would lay the foundation (along with fellow beatniks Gary Byrd and Gil Scott-Heron) for hip-hop music. Everyone from Melle Mel to KRS One to Common has paid some kind of homage to the Last Poets in their work. Oyewole’s “party and bullshit” line, which came from the song When the Revolution Comes on the Last Poets’ first album, would become the title and hook for the Notorious BIG’sdebut single. Black comedians pay tribute to the Last Poets too with every one of theirspoken word slam parodies.Late last year, the Last Poets released an 11th studio album, Africanism, without Nuriddin (who died from cancer in 2018) that takes the some of group’s most resonant poems and sets them to the Afrobeat stylings of the late, great Tony Allen – the genre pioneer who came to prominence directing Fela Kuti’s band. “I’m blown away by the fact that Umar and I both said things that are extremely relevant today,” Oyewole says. “It’s so weird that these problems continue to exist.”At age 77, Oyewole remains as attuned to the big issues as ever. With Bin Hassan, also 77, looking on (his speech has been somewhat limited after he suffered a pair of strokes in the last few years), Oyewole let his opinions fly over the course of our hourlong interview.OnZohran Mamdani, a former wannabe emcee turned Democratic socialist, sweeping to victory in New York City’s mayoral election, Oyewole says: “This is all in divine order.”On the escalation of political violence in Nigeria, a thorny issue Nicki Minajclumsily waded intoduring a surprise recent appearance at the UN, Oyewole says: “We need to recognize that we are one and the same people, Africaandthe diaspora, and make that union a lot tighter.”View image in fullscreenUmar Bin Hassan and Abiodun Oyewole.Photograph: Last PoetsOn the fall ofKanye West, who is featured with Oyewole on the Common song The Corner: “Kanye got hooked on the bitches brew. He got stuck, strung out. I don’t know if you’ve seen Sinners, but Kanye West has been bitten.”After Martin Luther King’s assassination in 1968, Oyewole says, “I wanted to become a serial killer.” In fact, some of those bitter feelings bubble back to the surface when Oyewole segues to the topic ofCharlie Kirk’s death and rightwing efforts to recast Kirk as a civil rights martyr. “It’s embarrassing to have all the flags flying half mast in honor of a racist,” he says, “of someone who insulted every Black woman when he said Maxine Waters, Michelle Obama and Ketanji Brown Jackson weren’t smart. It’s embarrassing that Black people would say: ‘Well, I feel sorry for him.’ There’s nothing to feel sorry for.”Oyewole credits Last Poets co-founder David Nelson for challenging him to express that rage in couplets instead. Earlier this month, while performing on the Soul Train cruise with a lineup that also included the Isley Brothers, Oyewole told guitarist Ernie Isley that their hit song It’s Your Thing inspired the first poem he ever wrote, What’s Your Thing, Brother? – a greeting that Oyewole heard often in the 1960s among activist-minded Black New Yorkers trying to suss out one another’s political bents.You better get a thing before you lose everything,the poem goes.View image in fullscreenAbiodun Oyewole and Umar Bin Hassan.Photograph: Johnny Nunez/Getty ImagesThe Last Poets’ grounding in Black pride and political purpose became heirlooms that were carried forward in the hip-hopmovement –that critical last word intended as much to rally listeners to the dancefloor as join them in common cause against political oppression. It’s a conjoining of ideals that began in earnest with Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s breakout The Message, which sets the story of the Bronx’s 1980s-era crime and dereliction to synth rhythms and breakbeats. Over the decades, rap’s practitioners have dutifully upheld the Black American oral tradition of fighting the power and passing down knowledge of self while also serving up plenty of dancefloor hits. Even Biggie followed up Party & Bullshit on his debut album withThings Done Changed, a reflection on the harsh realities of his Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn community.But Oyewole doesn’t hear that same range of awareness or sense of urgency in hip-hop that is being pushed by the music industry today. “Our music has always been a reflection of our living,” he says, “but we’re dying spiritually.” To underscore his point, he references to an early poem of Bin Hassan’s that was revived for Africanism calledNiggers Are Scared of Revolution– a flash of recognition that perked up his bandmate. “I was a shoeshine boy, going to bars and everything,” Bin Hassan says, “listening to people talk about who they are, from gang members to masters of the world. I had to take the language.”The Last Poets: the hip-hop forefathers who gave black America its voiceRead moreThe poem was meant to be a criticism on the N-word’s repurposing into a term of endearment – but that message backfired as hip-hop effectively sold its soul to secure its prime position in pop culture. “They even changed the feature character from cat to dog,” Oyewole says. “Back in the day when I was growing up, it was: ‘Man, that cat can play the piano’ or ‘That’s a cool cat.’ But now it’s: ‘Yo dog, that’s mydawg… ’“No, I amnotyour dog.”Hip-hop’s outsized role in making the language of Black disparagement more palatable, Oyewole further argues, has only made it easier for Donald Trump (whom he calls “the Taco Man”) and his white supremacist acolytes in government to deny Black excellence in their policy-driven attacks against critical race theory and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion). Nevertheless, Oyewole is confident and remains hopeful that those efforts will backfire too, and that the Last Poets’ mission of returning the power to the people will ultimately win out.“In times of great chaos, there’s opportunity,” he says. “The Taco Man and his efforts to ban books and erase our history? All he’s really doing, in a weird way, is promoting us. But he doesn’t realize that because he’s not smart.”Explore more on these topicsHip-hopRapPoetryinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The heady nights and glistening bodies of cult queer club PDAIn the pounding heat of a sweaty basement, revellers danced till 6am posing in lavish outfits and flexing their thigh-high boots. Liz Johnson Artur relives how she photographed the anything-goes spirit of this DIY oasisCharlotte JansenMon 24 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 09.39 ESTShareFor more than three decades, Liz Johnson Artur has photographed “the people I’m with” – a characteristically modest expression that belies the radiance, intimacy and unshowy brilliance of her pictures, an extraordinary archive numbering thousands of images that celebrate beauty, resilience, community and resistance. Intimate and alive, her photographs – often shot on the fly, in streets, nightclubs and living rooms – pull you right into the moment, just before it disappears for good.PDA, the photographer’s latest book, celebrates a bygoneLondonunderground music scene. PDA was a popular queer club night that ran monthly in a Hackney basement from 2011 to 2021. The abbreviation PDA did not stand for a single phrase, apparently. Rather, the founders playfully suggested it could stand for many things, including Public Display of Affection, Please Don’t Ask, and even Pretty Dick Available.A lot went on in front of – and behind – the DJ booth!The club night’s fluidity and inclusivity were some of the things that enraptured Johnson Artur. “I used to take pictures in a queer club in Brixton in the 1990s. Then it was very separate, men and women. There was mixing – but this was a very different vibe.” While she’s “never been a clubber”, she became a regular at PDA. “There was a lot going on in front of and behind the DJ booth! PDA embraced everyone. They didn’t have a door policy. I was 30 years older than everyone there, but it was beautiful watching them take their space.”View image in fullscreen‘The pictures seem to jump to the sound of a bassline’ … dancers captured in PDA.Photograph: Liz Johnson Artur/BierkeIn black and white and colour pictures taken over several years attending PDA events, Johnson Artur, now 61, captures party-goers flexing their thigh-high boots, bodies glossy with sweat on the dancefloor, cigarettes, smiles and Schweppes. The pictures at times seem to jump to the sound of a bassline.It’s not the first time she has photographed people partying. Why does Johnson Artur love photographing music events so much? “They do something to people,” she says, speaking on the phone as she walks around Brixton on a Monday morning. “They can let go. It’s the most generous art form we have, because it needs us. It lives from how we react to it – and you can feel it’s yours and no one can take that away from you.”I guess I almost developed aunty feelings – we’d all come back and have food at my placeThe book also reflects Johnson Artur’s abiding interest in self-fashioning and self-expression in temporary, DIY and unconventional spaces. She attributes this curiosity in strangers’ lives to the four-day train journeys she would take as a child with her mother, from Germany back to the Soviet Union. “You would spend 24 hours with strangers in a small compartment,” she says, “and you have to get on – you start out being suspicious of each other, but in Russian culture, you put food on the table and you share, and you start talking.”Sharing these small spaces with strangers informed the way she works with her subjects. “I photograph people because each person has a story. I can’t tell it verbally, but I can make a point about human existence – we’re told we’re all different, but the stories, when you hear them, are often quite familiar.”Johnson Artur’s own story reflects a time in the 1960s when African students were sent to study in eastern Europe – which is how her Ghanaian dad met her Russian mother. Johnson Artur was born in Bulgaria and spoke Russian at home, later moving to Germany, where she was raised by her mother. “It’s who I am. I don’t know any different – everyone has their roots, and I don’t see mine as special. My work is not about black this, that, or the other. It’s about wanting to be yourself.”View image in fullscreen‘We have a wonderful time, then suddenly it’s over’ … one of the stars of PDA.Photograph: Liz Johnson Artur/BierkeThey lived for a time as illegal immigrants. As Johnson Artur wasn’t able to go to school, she spent a lot of time on the streets while her mother was at work. She got her first camera in the mid-1980s, when film was prohibitively expensive. “I never had the money to shoot like crazy. If I had five rolls, I had to stretch them to get the pictures I wanted. I couldn’t afford to mess up. I had to focus and learn to work with my tools in whatever situation I found myself in. It’s important to me not to take pictures I consider bad. That’s my German upbringing. Every picture in the archive counts.”In 1991, Johnson Artur moved to London. She studied at the Royal College of Art – and dived into the city’s music scene. “I suddenly experienced music in a totally different way. It was part of your life. Witnessing those places where you could express yourself, where you could make something out of nothing and have agency. People were making clubs in whatever room they could just for a few months. But it’s changing. You can’t do that now. It’s becoming harder to have any space. That’s a very painful thing.”One of the recurring figures in the PDA pictures is Carrie Stacks, the night’s co-founder DJ and nightlife icon. They appear at the decks, but also at home, getting ready, doing their makeup. These more intimate, daytime images give a sense of a close-knit community beyond the club. “I don’t look at it as a club book,” says Johnson Artur. “It is always about looking at people. It’s about how they create spaces to be safe with each other.” The book moves through photographs reflecting the rhythm and energy of a night, from posturing in lavish outfits on arrival at the club, to moments of high intensity, hands-in-air abandon, when the dancefloor is packed and chaotic with limbs and people embrace.View image in fullscreenShowing out: dancers in their finery.Photograph: Liz Johnson Artur/ BierkeIt’s a mix of striking, posed portraits of the club’s attractive young crowd, in which Johnson Artur’s subjects look directly back at her, often wearing little more than some sequins, heels and sunglasses, and moments of unchoreographed candour, in which the photographer and her camera are devoured in the fervour of the action: right next to the DJ booth as someone grabs the mic, or as two people share laughter or a kiss. It’s irrepressibly joyful to look at, an account that pays homage to a time and place but also captures timeless notions of desire, freedom and escape.Strutting into the club in their finery, her subjects emanate a confidence that belies the hostility they often face outside. “Not just on the street but also at home, where many people have big issues being who they are, in their own communities.”The book is the result of a careful and close collaboration with some of the PDA organisers. Was that difficult for a photographer with such stringent standards? “I’m used to holding on to pictures, deciding what goes where based on the quality – and I had to let go of that. It’s an interesting process. You can’t collaborate and only get what you want. You have to open up.”PDA also charts Johnson Artur’s evolving role in the community. “I guess I almost developed aunty feelings,” she says. As soon as her daughter was old enough, she started to take her along too. “We’d all come back and have food at my place. It wasn’t just nightlife. We really enjoyed each other’s company.” That mutual feeling of respect and trust, she says, comes through in the pictures. “When people see you and they trust you, they give. That’s the beauty I get.”A typical PDA night went on until 6am, and the last picture in the book depicts a reveller back outside in the early hours, making their way home again. Shot from behind and from afar, the figure flashes bright white against the darkness of the empty street, the soft focus reminiscent of the bleary-eyed vision after a long night out. It’s also a reminder that nothing lasts for ever. “That’s how we exist as humans,” says Johnson Artur. “We have a wonderful time, then suddenly it’s over.” PDA is a testament to that. “We’re only here for a minute,” she adds. “Let’s enjoy it.”PDA by Liz Johnson Artur is published today by BierkeExplore more on these topicsPhotographyLondonLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But writing for the Bard is the best of all, he saysMon 24 Nov 2025 05.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 07.56 ESTShareThree years back, Matt Maltese was in a casual co-writing session with some friends. Out of it came a song called Magnolias, a stripped back piano ballad about imagining his own funeral. “I didn’t think anything of it,” he says. “And then two years later, we heard some quite bizarre whispers thatRosalíahad somehow heard it.” It was true: six months ago, Maltese was sent the Spanish pop star’s demo of the song. He tried not to get too excited, even when, a few weeks back, a blurred-out photo of a Rosalía album tracklisting appeared online. “On the WhatsApp group we were like: I think that says Magnolias!”Magnolias ended up as the final track on Rosalía’s new operatic masterpiece, Lux: one of the most talked-about albums of the year, currently sitting in the UK Top 5. Maltese first heard the finished song the day the album came out, when he’d got back to London from a US tour. “I took a long jet-lagged walk and listened to the whole album to contextualise it. It’s extraordinary.” On Magnolias, Rosalía changed some words, he says, “and dramatised it incredibly. It’s exquisite. It’s a gift from someone, somewhere, that it fell into her lap.” It’s all anyone has wanted to talk to him about since. “I’ve had a lot of follow backs on Instagram,” he smiles.The 30-year-old British-Canadian has quietly become a successful and influential figure. Across six solo albums since 2018, Maltese’s indie-pop balladry mixes a modern type of male sensitivity with the wry humour of his hero, Leonard Cohen. Aided by a viral TikTok moment, he has six million monthly listeners on Spotify and over 1bn streams combined; his latest album Hers, a lush distillation of longing and desire, was his first to chart.It’s won him A-list fans in Sabrina Carpenter, Doja Cat, Frank Ocean, Laufey and BTS’s V, and made him a songwriter in demand. Maltese has written for and with artists such as Celeste, Joy Crookes, Jamie T and Tom Misch – even the Bard himself. Last year, Maltese wrote music for a Royal Shakespeare Company productionof Twelfth Nightin Stratford-upon-Avon. Next month it comesto the Barbican in London, where we meet by its lakeside terrace on an unseasonably warm afternoon. “Co-writing with Shakespeare,” he smiles. “That’s probably the best one, right?”Growing up in Reading to Canadian parents, Maltese moved to London in his teens, falling into the “great community” of the burgeoning south London scene centred on the Brixton Windmill pub. But among alternative post-punk bands such as Goat Girl, Shame and Sorry, he was very much the odd one out. “I was like, I’m the soppiest one here. They’re ‘fuck the world’ and I’m like, ‘ah, but the world is such a nice thing’.”In 2015 he signed to Atlantic Records off the back of promising Soundcloud demos. “They told me I was the voice of a generation.” But that didn’t save him when 2018 debut album Bad Contestant didn’t perform to Atlantic’s expectations. He was an ill fit for the major label system, he says: “As a snobbish 19-year-old, I said no to a lot of things.” He was once asked to cover John Lennon’s Happy Xmas (War is Over) for a BBC Christmas trailer. “And I insisted that I would only do it if I could record it in a minor key.” He starts laughing. “It was atrocious.” It never got used, and he was subsequently dropped. “But I needed that blow. I wasn’t treating it enough like a job.”He looked at what was left of his £50,000 advance. “I worked out I had eight months before I’d have to quit music and get a job.” So he hibernated in his bedroom, sore from Atlantic’s rejection and “some messy personal relationship stuff”, and worked on songs. “That period was good for me because it made me comfortable in my own skin. It really made me write songs even more from the heart.” His independently released 2019 second album Krystal started a “positive spiral”.View image in fullscreenMatt Maltese performing in October at Fox Theater in Oakland, California.Photograph: Steve Jennings/Getty ImagesHis career really took off in 2021 when his 2017 track As the World Caves In, an apocalyptic ballad that imagined Donald Trump and Theresa May spending the last night on earth together, blew up on TikTok. Charli xcx and Shawn Mendes posted about it; on one “ridiculous day” it was the second most streamed song worldwide by a British artist behind Dua Lipa. After Atlantic, it was vindication, to a point. “They are making all the money from it,” he smiles ruefully: around £20,000 a week at the song’s height.But it brought him a whole new fanbase. “It used to be divorced dads and students.” Now, he has screaming fans in the 18-23 age range. “Especially in America,” he says, where he’s just headlined the 5,900 capacity Greek theatre in Los Angeles. “But it’s so funny to self-identify that I’ve become a TikTok person. I think that skewed a lot of people’s impressions.”Maltese’s real passion is the craft of songwriting. “I didn’t come out the womb with a mic on.” Hence his embrace of the co-writing sideline. Sometimes within a group – Magnolias was written in that session with Danny Casio, Sophie May and Daniel Wilson – but often intimately with the artist themselves.‘It’s impossible not to have contradictions in a contradictory world’: Catalan pop visionary Rosalía on critics, crisis and being ‘hot for God’Read moreHe has a particularly close relationship with the chart-topping jazz-pop singerCeleste. “She’s great at disrupting the norm.” Once, uninspired by the expensive studio environment, she took him to a grotty rehearsal space. “It was January and it was freezing, a big dark room with no heating. We wrote there for a week.” They ended up with three songs for Celeste’s wonderful new album Woman of Faces – destined for the Top 10 this week – and the standalone track Everyday.Joy Crookes is another artist Maltese is close to: after 2021’s Skin, he co-wrote Crookes’ 2025 single Mathematics. When he heard the finished track, he was amazed that UK rap legend Kano had added a guest verse. “I am a white boy from Reading; to have a credit with Kano is just insanity.” Even after Rosalía, Maltese is still getting used to his growing imprint on pop. “I don’t necessarily feel like I’m hugely culturally relevant. I’m just someone obsessed with songwriters from the 70s. I feel very lucky that people care.”Matt Maltese is on tour, playing SWG3, Glasgow, Wed; O2 Ritz, Manchester, Thu; and Roundhouse, London, FriExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockRosalíaCelesteRoyal Shakespeare CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Peter Wollny, the musicologist behind last week’s “world sensational” revelation oftwo previously unknown worksby Johann Sebastian Bach, had a funny feeling when he chanced upon two intriguing sheets of music in a dusty library in 1992.His equivalent of the Columbo turn, from mere hunch to unravelling a secret, would take up half his life.Wollny, now 65 and the director of Leipzig’s Bach archive, was a graduate student at Harvard University when his PhD research took him to the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels, where he came across two unattributed scores from the 18th century.Two long-lost organ pieces by JS Bach performed for first time in 300 yearsRead more“I have to confess that I didn’t even think these were works by Bach at the time,” Wollny said this week, days after the two pieces – Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178 and Chaconne in G minor BWV 1179 – were performed at Leipzig’s St Thomas church for the first time.“The handwriting of the score just fascinated me, and I had this vague feeling that these bits of paper could be interesting some day. So I made photocopies and created a file that I dragged around with me for 30 years.”Despite having dedicated his life to researching the life and music of the greatest composers of the baroque era, he said he did not seriously dare consider that the works could be by the man himself until about two or three years ago.Born in Issum in North Rhine-Westphalia, Wollny studied musicology, art history and German studies at the University of Cologne before embarking on his Harvard PhD, on the music of Bach’s eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. He joined the Bach archive in Leipzig as a researcher after gaining his doctorate in 1993 and has been its director since 2014.1:01Chaconne in D Minor: two long-lost organ pieces by Bach performed for first time in 300 yearsHis colleague and co-researcher Bernd Koska said: “Peter Wollny is someone who tends to weigh things up in his mind very thoroughly before he reaches a conclusion. That’s the way he works.”To the eyes of a trained musicologist, the two works were unusual from the outset. Both are chaconnes, originally a form of Spanish dance that became stylised into its own musical art form around the year 1700. Their distinguishing feature is a short bass line that is repeated throughout the work, known as an ostinato.In almost all chaconnes for organ from the same period, each ostinato bass motif has a set length of six, seven or eight bars – never longer, never shorter. Yet in the Chaconne in D Minor that Wollny had found in Brussels, the composer had set off with a seven-bar ostinato bass and then decided to stretch the same motif to eight bars, then 12 and then 16.The anonymous composer had made other bold choices, such as repeating the bass melody in a higher register with a one-bar delay, creating a canon. They had also turned the ostinato bass into a four-part fugue, a musical tool used to weave a single theme into the broader musical tapestry.View image in fullscreenA page from the manuscript of Bach’s Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178.Photograph: Royal Library of Belgium/AFP/Getty ImagesWollny describes these idiosyncratic touches as the musical equivalent ofhapaxlegomena– words that only appear once in a body of text. “These works didn’t fit into the scheme of mainstream composition around the year 1703 at all,” he said.The only other known composition from this early period to use similarly bold techniques was Bach’s Passacaglia in C Minor BWV 582.In-depth study of Bach, who was famous for incorporating elements that function like mathematical riddles and puzzles into his music, has a notoriety for yielding obsessions. There are sinister Bach maniacs in Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniac films and in novels of the recent Nobel laureate László Krasznahorkai. In the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter chews off a prison guard’s face to the strains of the Goldberg Variations.“If you listen to a lot of Bach, he becomes a part of you,” said John Butt, a professor of music at Glasgow University. “Throughout history there have been a lot of musicologists who believed they had a more personal relationship with his works than everybody else.”As a result, attempts to authenticate or date works by Bach on the basis of the musical stylistics alone had a patchy track record, he said. “There have been a lot of red faces.”Wollny, however, had another special skill that helped his research. “I want to be careful how it put this,” he said. “But it could be the case that I have a talent for recognising handwriting features.”After discovering the two anonymous works in Brussels, he felt an “inner duty” to identify their author, spending several hours studying the unique traits of the lines on paper. “You start by studying the treble and bass clef, because they contain a lot of individuality,” he said.He noticed that the person who had written the documents had a unique way of drawing the C clef at the start of a staff, with a line at the bottom that curled backwards in a manner not dissimilar to the C clef in Bach’s musical notations. “It’s fairly complicated, you need about 10 strokes to get it right,” Wollny said.View image in fullscreenA detail of Bach’s Wedding Quodlibet, showing his distinctive C clef in the top left.Photograph: The Bach Archive Leipzig/Manfred Gorke CollectionHaving already studied Bach’s handwriting in depth, however, he knew that the two Brussels scores couldn’t have been written by the composer personally. Before the widespread and affordable use of mechanical reproduction, composers commonly had students who copied their works – either for the practical purpose of dissemination or, if the composer was already famous, to sell copies for commercial gain.If a doctor makes a mistake it’s not such a big deal. But if I make an error it will sit in books for hundreds of yearsPeter WollnyIn Bach’s case, these “copyists” or their parents would have paid the composer to work for him rather than vice versa – often transcribing his original manuscripts in German organ tablature into scores with notes – to learn through the act of transcription.Over the years, Wollny found 20 more documents that matched the handwriting of the original document in archives in Leipzig, Berlin and Winterthur, in Switzerland, covering the years 1705 to 1715. If the two chaconnes only had words on the title pages, others came with lyrics and introductory texts. “A profile started to emerge. I developed an idea of the copyist’s professional duties and interests,” Wollny said.View image in fullscreenA statue of Bach outside St Thomas church in Leipzig.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianBut he still didn’t have the name. He erroneously assumed for years that the score had been written by a cousin of Bach. In 2012, however, Wollny’s colleague Koska discovered a 1727 letter in which a certain Salomon Günther John applied for a job as organist at a church in Schleiz, Thuringia.Not only did the handwriting match that of the documents in Wollny’s file but the letter also stated that John had learned his instrument under an organist in Arnstadt, the small town where Bach had taken his first job as an organ teacher. “Suddenly, things started to click together,” Koska said.What if the two works were composed by the young student rather than his more famous teacher? The researchers discounted this theory because there were too many small mistakes in the notation, such as incorrect octave layers.Still, Wollny wasn’t 100% sure. “I asked myself: do I only see Bach behind this music because I want to, or is it really true? If a doctor makes a mistake it’s not such a big deal. But as a musicologist, if I make an error it will sit in books in libraries for hundreds of years.”By chance, the final piece of the puzzle emerged from the archives in 2023. A court document written by John dated 1716 from a feudal estate in Oppurg, Thuringia, lost during the second world war and now cleaned up and made publicly accessible, matched the handwriting of the Brussels chaconnes with absolute certainty.Wollny says he doesn’t remember how he celebrated the breakthrough. “I am not someone to punch the air in delight. I just sat there with a grin and contentedly turned the pages,” he said.“Perhaps artificial intelligence means that what I spent 35 years on will in the future be done in a couple of days or hours. Maybe it will be easier and give us even more certainty. But that’s OK.”A picture caption on this article was amended on 24 November 2025. An image of the manuscript of Bach’s Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178 incorrectly said it was of G minor BWV 1179.Explore more on these topicsJS BachClassical musicGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve tested thousands of products at the Filter in 2025 and warmly recommended hundreds of them, including many that have genuinely good Black Friday discounts.Instead of listing price cuts on all the products we’ve featured, we’ve focused on the things you’ve liked the most this year, and looked for deals that undercut their long-term average prices by a significant amount. Ideally, their Black Friday price will be their lowest of the year.We don’t take retailers at their word on discount size, either. Amazon may say it’s “70%” off the RRP, but we study the price history of every item using independent tools such asthe Camelizerto find out how generous a discount really is. If an item’s price has been all over the place in 2025, we’ll give the average price below instead of a “was …” price, so you can judge how good a deal it is.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It began in the stifling heat of summer, when the Filter team sat down to plan our bigChristmas gift guide. One idea quickly rose to the surface: we didn’tjustwant to trawl online for the best, most original, affordable presents around. We wanted to smell the products, taste them, unbox and inspect them, and pour them over ice into a tumbler.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We started to fill out our list. We brainstormed ideas, researched them to find the ultimate iteration of that product, and borrowed samples (returning or donating them when we’d finished). We approached favourite retailers and shops for their new collections, and we attended Christmas press shows in our shorts and sandals to sample things in the flesh. The office slowly filled up with boxes, and themusical biscuit tingrew a bit wearing, though its contents were delicious.We chanced upon gift ideas: a summer holiday in Suffolk led to the discovery of a bracing unisex scent, Norfolk Natural Living’sCoastal Walks. And we included one or two beloved favourites, the things we use regularly ourselves and buy for our own loved ones (Aesop’s Eleos hand cream, I’m looking at you).Luckily, we had a team of experts to help, too: babies (and their parents), kids, teens, relatives and all manner of experts in their fields, from gardeners to foodies, tried and tested things for us. We also rounded up some of our most popular products, whether alcohol, kitchen kit, food or fashion, that had already been tried and rated by our own professional testers.We kept alive to trends: the vogue for pistachio is showing no signs of slowing, so we featured a box ofpistachio truffles; tweens and teens told us the on-trend products they wanted, fromSol de Janeiro shower gelandOwala water bottlestoclaw clips; and we showcased everyone’s love of Guinness with aT-shirtand aNitrosurge.Cleaner, smarter, fatterView image in fullscreenIllustration: Sandra Navarro/The GuardianThese tests didn’t just inform our picks – they had unintended consequences: my neighbourhood had never looked cleaner after I’d put alitter picker, made from ocean plastic waste, to the test. We visited museum shops to see their collections and become more cultured in the process: the National Portrait Gallery’s Cecil Beaton exhibition, and the V&A’s Marie Antoinette were personal favourites. And we put on alittleweight in the name of rigorous food sampling. “I ate half a jar ofchilli jam peanut butterin one sitting,” says the Filter’s deputy editor, Monica Horridge, “and found myself having to fit additional meals into the day so I could test out as many things as possible in theLakeland Only Pan.”Many things didn’t make the cut. A matcha whisk was rejected by our in-house matcha lover for not being up to scratch; some subpar wax melts were so overpowering they made one of our reviewer’s children cry; and a pack of pistachio biscuits were rejected for not being pistachio-y enough.But the result has been our ultimate, thoroughly comprehensivegift guide: 305 presents, from stocking fillers to grooming products, kitchenware to toys, condiments to garden tools.

Not even a little bit. But the terrible moves my friends mock are an antidote to the racing heart and quivering breath that arrive in my more anxious momentsOlivia PetterMon 24 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 06.22 ESTShareThe first time I started dancing at home was a happy accident. I’d just had a terse conversation with an ex, and my body was reacting in its usual way: racing heart, quivering breath and trembling fingers. I needed to calm down. Looking around for quick fixes in my flat – my bed, some stale chocolate digestives and a packet of cigarettes – I settled on the kitchen radio, which had been humming faintly in the background all morning.Tuned to BBC Radio 6 Music, it was playing a disco track I didn’t recognise. But the beat was steady and intermingled with the sounds of tambourines, synths and drums. I turned up the volume, and then my body was moving: limbs swinging, feet tapping, hips wiggling. I continued into the next song, leaning into the feeling and becoming more animated to the sounds of another upbeat 70s track, imagining myself on a crowded, sweaty dancefloor. It was all very silly. But by the third song, my anxiety had melted away. I was smiling. And I felt more like myself again.For me, anxiety has always manifested as an excess of energyTo be clear, I cannot dance. Not even a little bit. It’s a running joke among my friends, who have been ruthlessly mocking my moves for years. Unfortunately, the derision is deserved: I have no rhythm and my hips are so wooden that they cannot help but tell this very sad truth. Still, I’ve always enjoyed dancing and have persisted at weddings, festivals and parties. And since that day in my kitchen, I’ve realised it also calms me down.For me, anxiety has always manifested as an excess of energy. Depending on my underlying mood and where I’m at in my menstrual cycle, it can be triggered by anything, from a misunderstanding with a friend or an unnerving work email, to a lost lipstick or a “seen” and ignored Instagram DM. I have other crutches, but they either aren’t as healthy (sugar and cigarettes) or as accessible; exercise is great, but not if I have already worked out that day, and I would obviously never ask anyone for sex on demand.Dancing, though, is always available. And I’ve noticed that it works by taking my anxious energy and using it as fuel for movement. With the help of good music, that same frenetic feeling that makes my body shake with nerves can easily be transferred into a terrible dance move. If anything, the worse it is, the better. Because then I start laughing at myself.I’m not sure where the impulse first came from. But as a devoted Grey’s Anatomy fan, I suspect it has something to do with the show’s famous “dance it out” tradition, which saw the two female leads, Meredith and Cristina, regularly dancing together during times of turmoil.The one change that worked: I was burned out and stressed – then I found a steamy solutionRead moreThere are rules, though. First, the song needs to be unfamiliar. Otherwise, there will inevitably be an association or memory attached to it that will make it impossible to get out of my head. For obvious reasons, it also helps to be alone; I have yet to find a “dance it out” partner. For even more obvious reasons, it tends to work best at home. But wherever it happens, my little dancing trick has changed the game, because whenever those anxious feelings arise I know how to handle them. Or at the very least, how to get myself smiling again, which is a far more powerful tool than you might think.And if you happen to see a short brunette wriggling awkwardly on the tube, please do leave her in peace. She’s just dancing it out.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe one change that workedDanceAnxietyHealthFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is there a way we can use it to our advantage?Joel SnapeMon 24 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 04.02 ESTShareFascia, the connective tissue that holds together the body’s internal structure, really hasn’t spent all that long in the limelight. Anatomists have known about its existence since before the Hippocratic oath was a thing, but until the 1980s it was routinely tossed in the bin during human dissections, regarded as little more than the wrapping that gets in the way of studying everything else. Over the past few decades, though, our understanding of it has evolved and (arguably) overshot – now, there are plenty of personal trainers who will insist that you should be loosening it up with a foam roller, or even harnessing its magical elastic powers to jump higher and do more press-ups. But what’s itreallydoing – and is there a way you can actually take advantage of it?“The easiest way to describe fascia is to think about the structure of a tangerine,” says Natasha Kilian, a specialist in musculoskeletal physiotherapy at Pure Sports Medicine. “You’ve got the outer skin, and beneath that, the white pith that separates the segments and holds them together. Fascia works in a similar way: it’s a continuous, all-encompassing network that wraps around and connects everything in the body, from muscles and nerves to blood vessels and organs. It’s essentially the body’s internal wetsuit, keeping everything supported and integrated.” If you’ve ever carved a joint of meat, it’s the thin, silvery layer wrapped around the muscle, like clingfilm.Physically, it’s made up of collagen, though 70% of it is actually water – and it hydrates through compressive movement, which pumps fluid through the fascial layers, keeping them supple and gliding smoothly. It also contains nerve endings that allow it to sense movement, pressure and temperature – and can influence posture, movementand proprioception.“It’s constantly talking to the brain about what the body feels,” says Kilian. “It’s not a thin layer – it’s a massive, functional sensory organ system that holds us together.”Healthy fascia acts like a biological spring, recycling energy during movement and contributing to efficiency in running, jumping, and athletic power. This has led some movement coaches to suggest that you can harness its elasticity to be more explosive – “screwing” yourself into the ground to do more press-ups, say – but that’s not entirely true. “It’s not going to perform miracles for you or suddenly make you magically stronger,” says functional movement specialist and anatomist Julian Baker. “But if we keep it fluid and keep it moving, itwillimprove our quality of movement.”View image in fullscreenChanging your default typing-at-desk position from time to time can really help.Photograph: Ekaterina Goncharova/Getty ImagesThis, really, is the key. Fascia’s nature means that it responds to what we repeatedly do, locking us into that set of movements and making anything else a little bit trickier. “Our bodies are smart,” says Kilian. “When we repeat the same activity, the body adapts to make it easier. For most of us, that means hours at a desk, hunched over a keyboard. Over time, we stiffen into that posture. So if you work long days and play cricket or tennis on weekends, you might feel it when you bowl or serve – your fascia has tightened from keeping your arms forward all week.”The simplest way to start fixing this is to spend more time doing the sorts of movements you would otherwise do only occasionally. “I talk about it in terms of a circle of potential,” says Baker. “If I tell a group of people to raise their arms as far as they can, then take a breath and raise them higher, they’ll always go up another couple of inches – the reason being that we have an extended range of potential that we very rarely go into. That’s our circle, and as we get older, we stop moving, that circle gets smaller. As the circle gets smaller, our connective tissue starts to get smaller, and that starts to limit us in what we can do. If I’m 85 and I want to reach up and grab a cup off a shelf, it’s not necessary to have strong back muscles – I want a full range. Really, I don’t think there’s one range or one particular movement – the ultimate message is keep moving in as many different ways and ranges as possible.”But fascia isn’t immune to problems, and dealing with them can be a frustrating process. Many issues that can arise with fascia won’t be clear on, say, an MRI scan – which is one reason that deep-seated structural problems in the body can be difficult to diagnose.The zone zero secret: how ultra-low-stress exercise can change your lifeRead moreSo how do you start to fix it? Up until recently, many answers to this question revolved around the idea of rolling the sole of your foot on a golf ball, or lying down on your side to roll your iliotibial band (a tough strip of connective tissue that runs up the outside of your thigh, from knee to hip) on a big knobbly cylinder, in a process sometimes called self-myofascial release. But that may not actually be all that beneficial.“The current understanding is that you can’t truly ‘break up’ fascia in the way many people think,” says Kilian. “While rolling your foot can help by increasing blood flow and releasing tension, it’s important to look at the body as an integrated system. You need to consider the tension in your glutes, hamstrings, calves and back – not just the area where you feel pain. It’s the way all those muscles and fascial lines interact – or fail to – that leads to discomfort. In other words, don’t mistake the victim for the perpetrator.”Baker has a slightly different take on why rolling might still get results. “If you put your foam roller on the ground and get down and roll your thighs every day for 30 days, nothing is going to happen to your fascia. But the fact is, you’ve got down on to the floor and got back up again. And that movement, where you’re likely to be moving your body in ways you otherwise wouldn’t have done for weeks or months, is the thing that is going to make the difference.”View image in fullscreenThere’s nothing like a good stretch.Photograph: gerdtromm/Getty Images/RooM RFWhat does this mean for most people? Maybe that it’s worth trying rock climbing – Baker runs his own group for over-50s – or swimming, dancing or pilates, all of which move the body through uncommon ranges and types of rotation.But if that’s all a bit strenuous, it might just mean taking the time to move more naturally. “Think about how a cat or dog stretches – or even how we naturally yawn and move when we’re relaxed on holiday, stretching our arms out,” says Kilian. “The body instinctively knows which directions it needs to move in to release tension and free up restricted fascia. Even something as simple as a long, slow, diaphragmatic inhale during a stretch can help lengthen the fascia and encourage the whole system to move more freely.”There’s still a lot more research to be done: as noted, we’ve only just stopped throwing fascia away. But for now, just move as much, as often, and in as many different ways as you can.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I like to fill squares of pastry and fold them into little triangular puffs, but if you prefer more of a Cornish pasty look (*food writer cancelled for suggesting paneer is an appropriate pasty filling!*), by all means stamp out circles, fold into half-moons and crimp the edges.Spiced paneer puffs with quick-pickled carrot raitaPrep20 minCook25 minServes3-4225g block paneer2 spring onions, trimmed20g mint leavesZest of 1 lime,plus 15ml lime juice1 green chilli, deseeded if you wish1 heapedtsp flaky sea salt1tbsp self-raising flour320g roll puff pastry1egg, beatenFor the quick-pickled carrot raita½tsp fennel seeds½tsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed30ml white-wine vinegar½tsp flaky sea salt, crumbled2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped300g carrots, peeled, quartered lengthways and finely sliced150g natural yoghurtHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Tip the paneer, spring onions, mint leaves, lime zest and juice, green chilli and salt into a food processor, and blitz, scraping down the sides occasionally, until the mix resembles very fine couscous. Add the flour, and blitz again until the mix has broken down even more finely. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.Unroll the pastry and cut it into 12 equal squares. Divide the paneer mixture evenly between the pastry squares (just over a heaped tablespoon on each square should do it), then bring up two opposite ends of the pastry to make a triangle. Squeeze gently all around the edges to seal, then transfer to a lined baking sheet. Repeat until all the pastry triangles are sealed (you can sit them upright, like little dumplings, or on their sides like triangles). Brush the pastries with the beaten egg, then bake for 25 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.Meanwhile, toast the fennel and coriander seeds in a small dry frying pan, then put them in a large bowl with the vinegar and salt. Mix well, then stir in the spring onions and carrots. Leave to pickle until you’re ready to eat.Just before serving, stir the yoghurt through the quick-pickled carrots, and serve alongside the hot pastry puffs.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyCheeseBakingPastrySnacksSaladIndian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

But, first, for me one of life’s greatest pleasures is a bowl of perfectly cooked, slippery udon or soba in a shallow pool of something salty and vinegary, eaten alone on a brief but well-deserved lunch break. These noodles are a homage to the countless solo lunches I’ve had at a variety of wonderful Japanese restaurants.Brothy vinegar noodles with mushrooms and sesame (pictured top)Keep in mind that, while the brothy sauce (or saucy broth?) is designed to pool generously at the bottom of your bowl, this is certainly not a soup, and there shouldn’t be much of it left over to drink – only enough to generously dress your noodles. It’s intense in the best way, and hopefully there’s a bit left at the end to dip your lightly blanched greens into (only a suggestion, but a good one).Prep10 minCook30 minServes43tbsp olive oil675g mushrooms(oyster, chestnut, shiitake, maitake, etc), torn or cut into bite-sized piecesSea salt andblack pepper225g Chinese broccoli, or broccolini or baby pak choi, or other leafy greens of your choice, to serve (optional)225-280g dried udon or soba4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced120ml soy sauce, or tamari, plus extra to taste90ml white distilled vinegar, plus extra to taste1–2tbsp toasted sesame oil2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped or grated40g toasted sesame seeds(optional)25g garlic chives, orspring onions or chives, finely choppedPut the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot on a medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, season, then cook, stirring occasionally, until they’re evenly and nicely browned – 12-18 minutes. (Mushrooms tend to differ in how long they take to cook, so be patient and keep cooking if they aren’t browned by the 18-minute mark.)Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. If using the greens, quickly blanch them (for a minute and a half to two minutes for the thick-stemmed likes of Chinese broccoli or pak choi, about a minute for leafy greens such as kale). Lift out using tongs or a slotted spoon, and set aside (there’s no need for an ice bath).Add the noodles to the boiling water, and boil until cooked through (each type of noodle will vary, so follow the package instructions). Drain and rinse under cold water.Once the mushrooms are nicely browned and cooked through, add the garlic and stir to cook for a minute or two. Add the soy sauce, vinegar and 750ml water, bring to a simmer, then take off the heat. Add the sesame oil and ginger, taste the sauce and adjust with more salt, soy or vinegar as required.To serve, divide the noodles between four bowls, ladle some hot broth into each bowl and top with some of the mushrooms. Scatter the sesame seeds (if using) and chives over the top and serve with the greens alongside for dipping.Caramelised shallot pastaView image in fullscreenAlison Roman’s caramelised shallot pasta.The shallot paste can be made up to one month ahead, then stored, sealed and refrigeratedPrep10 minCook45 minServes460ml olive oil6 large shallots, peeled and very thinly sliced5 garlic cloves, peeled; 4 thinly sliced, 1 finely choppedSea salt andblack pepper1tsp chilli flakes, plus extra to serve60gtinned anchovy fillets(about 12), drained125-185g tomato puree(equivalent to 1 whole tube or tin)350-450g dried pasta, preferably a long, thin one such as bucatini or spaghetti1 handfulfresh parsley, tender leaves and stems finely choppedFlaky sea saltPut the oil in a large skillet or casserole on a medium-high heat. Add the shallots and sliced garlic, season and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes, until the shallots are completely soft and caramelised with golden-brown edges.Add the chilli flakes and anchovies (there’s no need to chop the latter because they will dissolve soon enough), then cook, stirring, to melt the anchovies into the shallots – about two minutes.Add the tomato puree, season and cook, stirring constantly to prevent any scorching, for about two minutes, until the tomato has started to cook in the oil a bit, caramelising at the edges and going from bright red to a deeper brick-red colour. Take off the heat and transfer roughly half the mixture to a sealable container, leaving the rest behind in the pan. (The contents of the container are your leftovers to be used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta, say, or smeared on to roast vegetables, or spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.)Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then cook the pasta until it’s very al dente (perhaps more al dente than usual). Save 480ml of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta. Transfer the pasta to the shallot pot (or, if you are using the leftover portion, to a hot skillet) and add 250ml of the reserved pasta water. Cook on a medium-high heat, swirling the skillet to coat each piece of pasta and using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any bits on the bottom, until the sauce is reduced and a little sticky, and perfectly coats each strand of pasta (add a splash or two more pasta water if you need it) – three to five minutes.Combine the parsley and the finely chopped garlic in a small bowl and season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide the pasta between bowls or transfer to one large serving bowl and top with the parsley-and-garlic mixture and a few more chilli flakes, if you like.Weeknight lamb ragu with anchovyView image in fullscreenAlison Roman’s weeknight lamb ragu with anchovy.This ragu is unapologetically lamb-forward. You could also use pork, beef or a mix, and it will turn out great – this recipe is really just a Trojan horse to inspire you to add anchovies or fish sauce to a quick ragu. These pantry staples deepen the flavours, and suggest a complexity that’s usually achieved only through time. Either ingredient is simultaneously virtually undetectable and paramount to success: barely anyone will notice they’re there, except to remark on how above-average fantastic this ragu is. The ragu can be made up to three days ahead, then stored, sealed and refrigerated, or up to two months ahead if frozen.Prep5 minCook50 minServes4-62tbsp olive oil1 medium yellow onion, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely choppedSea salt andblack pepperA pinch of chilli flakes(optional)2 anchovy fillets,or ½ tsp fish sauce2tbsp tomato puree450gmincedlamb2 x 400gtins crushed tomatoes350gdried pasta(noodles or tubes), to serve1 good hunkparmesan or pecorino, to serve1 small handful fresh marjoram, oregano or thyme leaves, to serve (optional)Put the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, season and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and softened – five to eight minutes. Add a pinch of chilli flakes (if using) and the anchovies, and cook for a minute or two to toast the chilli and melt the anchovies.Add the tomato puree and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, so it has a chance to stick to the bottom of the pot and caramelise a bit – two to three minutes.Add the lamb and season. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, stir until the fat starts to soften and the meat begins to break down. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the lamb begins to brown and sizzle in its own fat – eight to 10 minutesAdd the crushed tomatoes, stirring to scrape up any bits on the bottom of the pot. Half-fill the empty tomato tin with water, swirling to get any excess tomato that’s still hanging around in there, the pour into the sauce. Season again, then bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce is thick and insanely flavourful – 25–30 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until just before al dente. Reserve 250ml of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and put it back in the pot.To serve, toss the sauce into the pasta along with 120ml of the reserved pasta water, then cook on a medium heat until the pasta is perfectly cooked and nicely dressed – two to three minutes. Take off the heat, then divide the pasta between bowls and top with plenty of grated cheese. Scatter with marjoram, if you like, and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Something from Nothing, by Alison Roman, published by Quadrille at £27.

I was nearing the departure gate when an elderly woman fell down an escalator. I am a doctor and stopped to help. She had sustained a broken wrist, deep cuts and a worrying head injury and I had to stem the bleeding until staff and paramedics arrived.I asked for gate crew to be made aware that I was delayed by a medical emergency, but when I reached the gate 15 minutes before my flight departed, it had closed.I had to book the next available flight which was to Rome and wait for nearly six hours in the airport with my young baby. Despite this,Ryanairrefuses to waive the £100 transfer fee to rebook.FB, Haslemere, SurreyRyanair wants to charge a fortune to change our flightsRead moreYour sacrifice left you substantially out of pocket.You lost your car hire booking at Pescara and had to pay £211 to rebook at Rome airport. You also stumped up £127 for a hotel night in Rome before driving 150 miles to Pescara.I was confident that Ryanair would match your public spiritedness by refunding you the £100 fee as a goodwill gesture. I was naive. “It is each passenger’s responsibility to present at the boarding gate at least 30 mins before their scheduled departure time,” it tells me. “This passenger failed to present at the gate before it closed. Should this passenger have presented at the boarding gate desk before it closed, they would have boarded this flight alongside the 154 passengers who did present at the gate on time.”I asked the airline to check it had understood. It blanked me. In Ryanair’s world, it’s a passenger’s responsibility to bypass anyone in need, or take the hit.

One collector delves into the reasons the ordinary clothes of workers past live on in men’s wardrobes todayLuke TurnerMon 24 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 03.02 ESTShareWe’ll never know who designed much of the workwear worn by the labouring classes of yesteryear. But they might well be bemused that the ordinary garments they cut generously, to allow movement while operating a machine or driving a train, are now highly collectible and sought after – worn by menwho do little more than swivel on an office chair.If you’ve not noticed the prevalence of the dull tan of the Carhartt barn jacket or the triple-patch pocket of the chore coat, then perhaps you’ve been living in a cave with no signal to receive Instagram ads. Marks & Spencer is abundant with chore jackets and, in this year’s John Lewis Christmas advert, the dad has his suitably saccharine emotional moment wearing one, too.View image in fullscreenJackpot jacket … A chore coat from Carhartt WIP’s collaboration with Nicholas Daley.Photograph: Carhartt WIPThe popularity of these industrial-age garments, whether reproduction high fashion or high street, or the original vintage, shows no sign of fading. Men, old and young, with callused hands or tender fingers such as the ones currently nimbly dancing over my laptop keyboard, are all drawn to these simple yet expressive pieces. But why?I’m convinced that as well as it being relatively low cost and durable, workwear is popular because we modern men have become increasingly anxious about our physiques, especially as we age. Toxic expectations of body shape and size seem to be drifting over from discourse around the female body to us, and so much male fashion is now aimed at the slimmer, youthful figure; towards sportswear that shows off that you do sport, and the body that sport gives you. Workwear gives me a sense of mental comfort in the wobbly spread of my middle age, thanks to its tough canvases and twills that retain their structure despite softening with time, as well as the boxy, roomy cuts.But although workwear is ideal for the late-40s man (me), who thinks donning a navy blue down gilet is a sign you’ve given up, its grip extends to younger men’s wardrobes, too. In the workplace it would have clad teenage apprentice to near-retiree, and Tony Sylvester, author of new bookAn Informal Guide to Workwear, which charts how workwear staples went from mass-produced garments sold or given to industrial employees to 21st-century menswear staples, says that his introduction to workwear came when he was 16 in the late 1980s, when west coast rappers such as NWA wore chore coats. Today, a younger generation now often comes to it via that modern fashion phenomenon, the collaboration. Carhartt WIP, for instance, constantly reinterprets the look for younger consumers, most recently launching a collaboration with Nicholas Daley, inspired by the designer’s Jamaican and Scottish heritage.View image in fullscreenGo treestyle … Turner wearing a vintage French SNCF railway workers jacket from Levisons, Guernsey jumper, vintage French army surplus chinos and Dr Martens boots.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThere’s a striking diversity of style among the men who pivot their wardrobe around workwear. My favourite shop is Levisons in east London, where I’ve bought pieces including a 1950s French SNCF railway jacket in brown canvas, a Royal Navy blue shop coat, and most recently a tough black mac in rubberised cotton. Spend any time there and you’ll see that everyone combines workwear with modern or other vintage wear in wildly different ways. Sylvester says he “likes to mix up these codes”, pairing knackered Carhartt or French workwear trousers with fancy opera pumps. I wear my SNCF jacket with a boxy white tee in summer, a light-blue French work shirt in spring and autumn, and a Guernsey or submariner jumper in winter.One of the criticisms that can be thrown at workwear enthusiasts such as Sylvester and me is that we’re soft-handed ponces trying to appropriate the identity of the working-class men who originally wore the clothes. There’s a meme that, in varying forms, regularly does the rounds on social media: a workwear garment (a chore coat, overalls), and what it should have seen (a factory, a woodland) versus what it actually sees – usually, a queue for a fancy coffee shop or a craft beer brewery. “I’m always aware of that sense of stolen valour,” says Sylvester, although he points out that French artists wore farmers’ smocks while they painted, not only to keep their other clothes clean but also to project the idea that their labour in front of the canvas had equal worth as that expended behind a plough.View image in fullscreenCoat to self … Part of the range to be found at Levisons on Brick Lane, London.Photograph: LevisonsI must admit I find some of the finger-wagging around cultural appropriation wearying. Clothes, and the fabric they’re made of, have always moved up and down the class structure. Jeans are workwear in origin. It’s about motivation. I don’t love my brown canvas SNCF coat because I’m trying to identify with the bloke who originally wore it, but because it was fairly cheap and made of natural fibres by unionised labour long ago rather than in synthetic material by people working in dubious conditions today. I got married in a blue linen suit made by Norfolk’s Old Town, whose designs were based on clothes worn by labourers, because I knew I could wear it not just at the wedding, but to an office or the pub.The Royal Navy shop coat saw off baby vomit, and its large pockets held an emergency nappyObviously what we wear is all about projecting how we want to be perceived, but with workwear this can be nuanced. Sure, some men may wear ableu de travailbecause they want to persuade the world that their desk job in marketing is a valid creative labour, or Carhartt to show they’re rugged – good luck to them. If I interrogate my own motivations, I tend to avoid the blue chore jacket as being too obvious, I find jeans uncomfortable, and most American workwear too tainted with a “bro” masculinity that isn’t really me (I once tried on a pair of Red Wing boots and looked like a clown).As I age, I realise how workwear’s durability lends itself to our projection of identity. I used to float around different styles in my youth. In my early 20s my style was best described as “highly available twink”. But workwear is a statement of who I am now, that I’m ignoring current style and I disdain gym culture. It’s also an acceptance of where my body is now: as I crept over 40, my waistline expanded beyond 36in and I acquired man tits like Reeves and Mortimer’s characters Mulligan and O’Hare. Workwear saved me, and many men I know. It enables us to remain stylish as we age while also not having to worry about our waistlines and – worse – avoiding that nagging feeling we should be dressing younger than our age, which never ends well.View image in fullscreen‘Workwear saved me’ … Turner in Epping Forest wearing an Old Town Unityjacketandtrousers, from Labour and Wait.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBut workwear is also a projection that I am someone who above all appreciates value for money. At Labour and Wait, the traditional home goods shop that also sells new workwear, if customers ask why items that were once working-class staples are now, relatively speaking, expensive, manager Ben Langworthy (also a workwear collector) explains that “it’s a misnomer to think that back in the day people were buying the cheapest they could get; they bought the best they could afford, and repaired and kept it going for decades”. My SNCF jacket has outlived a Barbour, needing only one seam repair and a button resewing. The Royal Navy shop coat saw off baby vomit, and its large pockets held an emergency nappy (workwear is ideal dad apparel).View image in fullscreenTravel in style … French train driver sporting the fashion of the future.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesYet, however tough the construction, the supply of vintage workwear is inevitably limited and prices have risen “astronomically” in recent years, according to Sylvester. Small workwear manufacturers, such as Texan family firm Stan Ray, have been upping production to meet demand, and other brands have launched new ranges based on old designs: from Japan’s Bryceland’s, and Paris-based Anatomica, to Nottingham’s Universal Works and West Yorkshire’s HebTroCo. Sylvester praises the “unbroken heritage” of Yarmouth Oilskins, which still uses only natural fabrics in the same quayside factory it has occupied for decades. Sylvester’s own AWMS label is collaborating with Yarmouth Oilskins on a duffel jacket this winter – another potential piece to trouble the coat rack Rawlplugs. This is also at the heart of workwear’s appeal. We want to know who is making our clothes, and how.Sylvester sums up how many feel when he says, “I’m so fascinated by the second life of clothing.” The workplace of the late 19th to mid-20th century belongs to another world, but there’s something wonderful in how the ordinary clothes have more contemporary relevance than the hifalutin fashions of the upper classes, now ossified in museums. And in that, the understated resilience of workwear isn’t an appropriation, but instead a quiet revolution.Explore more on these topicsFashionMen's fashionMen's coats and jacketsVintage fashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The three angles at the intersection points are equal, 120°.The right answer. Total length is about 2.73km.Proving theoretically that this pattern is minimal requires advanced calculus. But we can find the answer more simply, using soap bubbles.If you make a plastic model of the puzzle (a sandwich where the “bread” is two pieces of transparent flat material and the “filling” is four short dowels of equal length, positioned at the corners of a square) and dunk it in soapy water, bubbles will form around the dowels displaying the answer. Here’s a video of how it works presented by James Grime.I love this problem because it is one of the most powerful illustrations of how Nature effortlessly solves optimization problems that might otherwise require a lot of hard thinking.I gave a hint saying that the pattern resembles a geometric shape that appears in the real world in a very familiar setting. If the angles at the intersection points are all 120°, we get hexagons – which is Nature’s answer to how to most efficiently store honey.

Globally, anestimated 150 million peoplerely on the water, arable land and access to trade networks they provide. But in Chad, such oases are disappearing fast.Withtwo-thirds of its territory consisting of desert, the landlocked central African country is themost vulnerable in the worldto climate breakdown. It ranks among the world’s hottest andtemperatures in Kanem province are rising almost twice as fastas the global average.Drone footage of homes in compounds in a desert with the odd tree dotted about; plots of cultivated soil, and a large oasis the size of a small lake surrounded by treesAn aerial view of the desert village of Kaou, in Chad’s Kanem province and an oasis on the edge of the desert town of Mao, known as the White City for the limestone used to build homes. The area’s farmers rely on the oasis to grow food but these vital sources of water are disappearing as temperatures get hotter and winds grow stronger, elders say. Video: Julie BourdinStanding in the scalding sand, Mahamat Souleymane Issa gestures at a thin strip of greenery stretching along a few hundred metres. “When I was a child, thiswadi[river valley] was very big,” he says.In the villages surrounding Kaou oasis, “everyone used to have livestock – cattle, camels, goats”, recalls the 51-year-old chief. “There were many trees and grass would grow in their shade. A lot has changed.”View image in fullscreenMahamat Ali, of SOSSahel, inspects a barrier of palm fronds designed to secure sand dunes that threaten to swamp the oasis of Nokou in Kanem provinceThe increasingly hot and dry climate has wiped out most of Kaou’s trees, local people say. Rolling sand dunes, pushed ever closer by stronger winds, now threaten to swamp what is left. “Without this wadi, we cannot live,” says Souleymane Issa.More than 500 families depend on Kaou’s oasis for their survival. The underground water reserves are a lifeline, and about 100 farmers scratch out a precarious existence growing crops and harvesting dates from the remaining palm trees.We started growing vegetables we’d never tasted before – fresh okra, fresh tomatoes that we could cook in a sauceHereta Abakar Issa, farmerA few hedges of palm fronds wedged in the dunes stand as a testament to the villagers’ efforts to protect the remaining oasis. In 2023, SOS Sahel, a nonprofit development organisation, helped the farmers build barricades to stabilise the dunes, and installed a solar-powered irrigation system to draw underground water more effectively. The organisation trained the villagers in farming techniques, gave them seeds and fenced off their gardens.“We started growing vegetables we’d never tasted before – fresh okra, fresh tomatoes that we could cook in a sauce,” says Hereta Abakar Issa, a 43-year-old mother of seven.On this hot day, she is one of about 30 villagers who have come to repair some barricades that have been knocked down by the wind. “Our wadi is threatened from all sides by the sand,” Abakar Issa says. She plants a sharp palm frond into the sand, then weaves the long leaves together to form a tight barrier over a metre high.Women use branches to create a fence in the sand. In the background trees dot a desert landscapeFarmers build barricades from palm fronds to secure the shifting dunes that threaten to swamp their oasis – their only source of water.

Already, sand slips through the gaps in the palms. “If the wadi disappears,” she says, “we’ll have to leave.”Most of the young men in the area have already left. Every year, pushed by harsher living conditions in the desert, thousands travel north to try their luck in thegoldfields of Chad’s Tibesti region, on the northern border with Libya.View image in fullscreenCamels graze on acacia leaves near Mao, in Kanem provinceView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA woman helps to make a barrier out of palm fronds to protect against the sand dunes; Farmers tend to their crops in an oasis in the desert in Barkadroussou, Chad. The oasis has benefitted from support by the NGO SOS Sahel, as part of its broad efforts to bolster the Great Green Wall Initiative. SOS Sahel helped farmers to stabilise the dunes that threaten to swamp the oasis, as well as installing a borehole and providing seeds and technical assistance“Up there, they get used as forced labour,” says Souleymane Issa, whose own son has made the journey. “There are many deaths. They come back sick and very weak.”‘I have searched and searched for help’: the Sudanese women left alone to live hand to mouth in Chad’s desert campsRead moreSeveral of Kaou’s young men returned to the village after SOS Sahel started, he says. Alongside its training and investments, the project was also a rare source of employment, albeit sporadic.But funding for the programme ran out after about six months, in early 2024. After waiting months for the project to restart, many returned to the goldmines.A similar initiative in the nearby oasis of Barkadroussou shows how successful such programmes can be. Here, a solar water pump installed by SOS Sahel in 2014 still supports more than 300 farmers – and, through them, about 3,000 villagers. Fields of onions, lettuce, beets and millet surround a lush forest of palm and banana trees, with a turquoise lake at its centre.Sitting in the cool shade at the edge of the gardens, Omar Issa watches as women harvest their crops.

For a while, he attended training sessions and took on a few odd jobs. But here, too, programmes stopped in 2023 when the NGO’s funding cycle came to an end.“If I don’t find anything to do in the wadi, I will have to return to the goldfields,” Issa says. And while he hopes his children never have to follow him to the north, he knows that with the oasis shrinking, they might not be able to stay much longer in Kaou.“If there is no work, there will be no choice,” he says. “They will have to go.”This article was developed with support from Journalismfund EuropeView image in fullscreenThe oasis in Barkadroussou, Kanem province.

A lot has gone on in academia but very few politicians or activists want to engage even with the basics. For instance, what sort of state would you want? Unitary? Federal?”In the book, neither author endorses unification or the status quo. Each writes two essays that strive for impartiality in laying out the case for a united Ireland and the case against, marshalling economic and social statistics, historical precedents and constitutional models.Arguments range over flags and symbols, taxes, health services, pensions, national debt responsibilities and the risk of loyalist violence. The goal is to inform and provoke discussion.“There’s huge interest in the subject but there hasn’t quite been a debate,” said O’Toole. “Debate implies an acceptance of the idea that there might be good arguments on both sides.”A referendum inNorthern Irelandwould also trigger one in the republic, where voters say they favour unification but reject paying higher taxes or adopting a new flag to reflect unionists’ British identity.“The Irish government does need to work out what the offer from Irish nationalism is beyond just saying: ‘We want a united Ireland and we love you’,” said O’Toole.McBride believes a referendum in his lifetime is likely and that it could happen abruptly. “You could have just a mad or a bad or a feckless secretary of state who says: ‘Let’s just do this and get it out of the way.’”Both nationalists and unionists have credible, legitimate arguments, he said. “Somebody will win here and somebody will ultimately lose but each side has got something to learn from the other’s arguments.”Westminster needed to join the debate, said O’Toole. “This is about your state. It’s a British question as much as it is an Irish question.”Explore more on these topicsGood Friday agreementIrelandNorthern IrelandEuropeBrexitSinn FéinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sadly, Solomon is used to such turmoil. He discusses hostility, hope and asylum hotelsMon 24 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 04.34 ESTShareEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, is at his home in London when I meet him. It’s the start of a gruesome week. The home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, has just announced that refugees could have their status revoked at any time if the country from which they fled is deemed safe; the pathway from being granted asylum to getting citizenship would increase to 20 years; AI would be used to establish a refugee’s age; and – a strikingly nasty idea – the jewellery of those arriving in the UK could be seized.While media commentators puzzled over whether this would be enough red meat forLabourto see off Reform, this must surely have been a new low for Solomon? “There’s been lots of terrible weeks,” he says. “So I’m used to it.” He looks neat, open and determined, and his kitchen is incredibly yellow and cheerful, which I put down to sheer effort of will to look on the bright side.“We thought Rwanda was the worst it had ever been,” he says. You remember Rwanda – former Conservative home secretaryPriti Patel’s wheeze, where no one arriving on a small boat would ever get the right to settle in the UK, a scheme which cost £700m and deported four people to east Africa, all of them voluntarily. Then Solomon and his team worked in the Rotherham hotel where people were almost burned alive by a far-right mob in 2024. “People inside were livestreaming it to our staff … so there have been some pretty low points. It’s difficult to say this is the worst it’s ever been.”View image in fullscreenAnti-migration protesters outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, August 2024.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesNevertheless, he concedes that to hear this week’s plans from a Labour government, which people working in the refugee and asylum sector had hopes for, makes it “more of a letdown, more of a disappointment”. He mentionsAlf Dubs’ radio appearance earlier this morning – the Labour peer who himself ran the Refugee Council in the early 90s, and came to Britain thanks to the Kindertransport, the series of rescue operations between 1938 and 1940 which brought mostly Jewish children to the UK to flee the Nazis. “He said this was grubby. And that’s what it is – grubby.” Especially so when Tommy Robinson applauded Mahmood’s plans. He also doesn’t believe it’s politically astute on Labour’s part. “I don’t think, from talking to pollsters and political scientists, that the ‘Nigel Farage is right, don’t vote for Nigel Farage’ strategy is going to work.”Solomon is a pluralist by instinct, never asking you to take his word for anything, always drawing in other voices, colleagues, friends, experts. He takes optimism as a professional duty. “One thing I say to staff is that you’ve got to remain hopeful. Otherwise, what’s the point? And you see hope in small ways. I was with a group of teenage boys last week – all have come here unaccompanied – and you just look at their faces and you see the bloodshot eyes, but they are desperately trying to learn English, they want to get on, and they’re still able to laugh. It’s moments like that you see the human hope that keeps you going, despite all the forces that are ranged against you.”Then he reaches for the Martin Luther King quote – that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice – and I say, you cannot seriously still think this? The moral universe doesn’t look like an arc, it looks like the electrocardiograph of a person having a heart attack, but Solomon absolutely will not budge on this point. “Ultimately, you’ve got to believe that things are not fixed for ever. Everyone who’s fought against any injustice will have faced huge adversity, moments of deep despondency.”View image in fullscreenPriti Patel in Kigali in April 2022, addressing the media after signing an ‘economic development partnership’ between the UK and Rwanda.Photograph: Muhizi Olivier/APRefusal to be discouraged is Solomon’s origin story, as it is the story of every one who has ever been, or was born to, a refugee. His mother grew up in apartheid South Africa. “The politics of apartheid were grim,” he says, briskly. She was a Muslim, the only woman in her family to go to university, and she worked as a social worker with Winnie Mandela in Soweto before her family decided life was fundamentally degraded by the “pecking order in South Africa. It went: white, Indian, coloured and then black African. It was a tricameral legislature. So they had the white legislature, they then had the Indian legislature, and then coloured representatives, and the blacks got nothing, completely disenfranchised.” So she came to the UK with her brother in the 60s, and met David Solomon, Enver’s dad, while they were both working for Camden social services. “My dad was born in Merseyside, on the Wirral. Jewish family, his forefathers had come at the turn of the previous century, fleeing the pogroms in eastern Europe.” Solomon grew up steeped in Judaism and Islam, celebrating the festivals of both, going to synagogue and to mosques.It was also a leftwing household. His dad stood as a Labour candidate in Stockport, where the family lived, in the 80s, where he got absolutely hammered by the Conservative candidate. “I remember knocking on doors for him when I was at primary school, I’ve got his old leaflet somewhere. It says: ‘David Solomon is a lecturer in social work at Manchester University and a proud member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.’” Solomon himself was a Labour party member for about a year when he went to university. He left in protest at its support for the Gulf war in 1991 and hasn’t been a member of a political party since (it sounds a little niche, given that Labour of course weren’t the party of government at the time, but it saved him having to leave a decade later, when so many others left).View image in fullscreenPeople thought to be migrants on board a small boat in Gravelines, France, earlier this month.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAAnyway, Solomon’s point is that there are values deeper than party affiliation. “My wife says that when she first met me, I was a leftwing international socialist firebrand, and now I’m more of a social democrat than she is.” His wife, who is Swedish, also works in the charity sector. “I say positive things about the royal family, the union jack – I’ve definitely travelled, politically. What does left and right mean any more? It’s about core values; I have a deep commitment to social justice.” It is something he believes he shares with a “decent majority” of the country, who he says believe “in multiculturalism and that it’s right to treat people with decency, humanity and dignity”.“That is why people were appalled by the Windrush scandal. That is why people were appalled when – in a unit where our staff work down in Dover for unaccompanied children and families – Robert Jenrickordered the cartoons to be painted over. Everyone was appalled by that.”He recalls how some focus groups were done around the time theRwandapolicy was proposed. Some of the Tory voters, he says, “hadn’t quite understood how it was supposed to work – they thought people would have their asylum claim heard here, and then if it was unsuccessful, be sent to Rwanda. When you explained to them, no, they’re not going to have their claim heard, they’re not going to get a fair hearing, these Tory voters went, ‘No, that’s not right’.”Part of the problem is the way mainstream politicians talk about refugees and asylum seekers – Keir Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, for example, springs to mind (althoughStarmer has now said he regrets it). “Some of the language you hear now about refugees, the BNP would have used a few decades ago, and everyone was aghast at it then. And this is where mainstream politics now is.”View image in fullscreenThe home secretary, Shabana Mahmood.Photograph: House of Commons/PASolomon is clear on the potential problems ofLabour’s new suite of policies– in particular reviewing a person’s refugee status every 30 months to determine if their home country is safe to return to, which will cost, estimates the Refugee Council,£872m over a decade. “They’re going to have to create a new bureaucracy to do this, at enormous cost,” he says.And how would it work, practically? For instance, “under the proposals, say I’ve got a daughter who’s studying for their GCSEs. They’ve settled in school, they’ve been here for 60 months, they’re a star student. They’re hoping to go and do A-levels, they want to become a teacher or a scientist. Then, they get a knock on the door, they’re told their home country is safe, and they have to go now. But all they want to do is get on with their life and contribute, have a good job and become a proud Briton. Are we going to say to them, ‘Sorry, we’ve decided you’re out. And even worse, we’re going to forcibly remove you, because if you say no, we’ll put you in detention, because we don’t want you to abscond.’ Is that who we are as a country? Is that what the majority of Britons want?”There is also the question of what happens to children who are born in the UK while their parents are in Mahmood’s 20-year limbo – will they be subject to immediate deportations to countries they’ve never been to? “What kind of system is this, where we have two categories of people?” Solomon asks.People don’t realise that refugees come from countries where the idea that you would sit at home and receive benefits off the state is deeply humiliating. It’s anathema to their upbringingInstead, Solomon says, the government should be focused on dealing with the huge backlog of asylum cases that has led to tens of thousands of people being forced to live in hotels while they await a decision. These hotels areastronomically expensive, with insultinglypoor living standards, and have become a focus for local anger andlegal challenge. “If there’s one thing this government could do to demonstrate competence and win the confidence of the electorate, it would be to stop talking about how illegal migration is dividing communities, and close hotels. There is still not a credible plan to do that.” The Refugee Council proposes granting limited leave to remain – subject to security checks – to people from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Sudan and Syria (nationalities that have a very high rate of being granted asylum), which would allow them to work until they are granted permanent leave to remain.The assumption that migrants are looking to claim benefits (created dually byTony Blair’s decisionthat asylum seekers shouldn’t be allowed to work, and subsequent tabloid castigation of refugees as workshy) has been agross mischaracterisation for years, and has become foundational to anti-immigrant narrative-building. “People don’t realise that refugees come from countries where the idea that you would sit at home and receive benefits off the state is deeply humiliating,” says Solomon. “It’s anathema to their upbringing, to their culture, to everything they’ve been told. They believe you go out, you graft, and you stand on your own two feet, and it’s deeply embarrassing for them to not be able to do that. Migrants come and they work hard. You can see that, the world over.”View image in fullscreen‘They’re just people, like you and me’ … Solomon at home.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianMore recently, a fundamentally racist narrative linking refugees with criminality, particularly sex crimes, has taken hold. “The asylum seekers and refugees who we work with and the refugees who work at the Refugee Council all feel othered, they feel they’ve been tarnished with this language: suggesting that they’re these terrible people, doing these terrible crimes. They’re just people, like you and me. They’re men, they’re women, they’re children, they just want to get on with their lives. If they’re young, they want to get an education; if they’re older, they just want to get a job.”The tinderbox atmosphere has flared up in dismaying events, Solomon says. “I heard an extraordinary story a few weeks ago from a councillor down in the south-west. A group of non-white men were gathering outside a building, and some local people assumed it was an asylum hotel and started protesting. It was student accommodation. The men were British students that just happened to be brown, like me. This is the consequence of political rhetoric.”The politics is now so dangerous that the Refugee Council has had to take security measures at its offices and at Solomon’s home – something the charity wouldn’t even have considered two years ago. Solomon is moving to another job in January, to Nacro, a criminal justice charity. Amid some neutral, commonsense thoughts about five years being long enough in any organisation – he took up this role in 2020 – is a palpable exhaustion. “It’s not just a tough job because of the issue: human beings who have had an incredibly tough time, in a hostile environment that has got more hostile. But it’s the intensity of it: it’s always in the headlines, it’s always coming at you. It’s always impacting on our staff, on our organisation. I don’t want to do the job feeling that I’m worn out and I’m just about hanging on.”It’s hardly Solomon’s first rodeo: he has been in the charity sector since the early 00s. Before that, he worked as a journalist at the BBC for 10 years but switched careers after becoming disenchanted with the era of 24-hour, bite-size news. He was working at a children’s charity just as the coalition government came in and brushed aside the state’s commitment to ending child poverty.“This really matters. It’s about who we are. It’s about how we interact with people on a daily basis. It’s about whether we’re prepared to see people as aliens, second-class citizens, or whether we’re people with a sense of shared humanity. Part of me does feel that it’s walking away from a cause which is so pivotal and matters so much to so many people’s lives. But lots of others will fight the good fight, and I’m going on to fight the good fight in another area.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The delegation requested his deportation so he could serve his remaining sentence in Nigeria.A source at the MoJ has confirmed the request was rejected. It is understood the UK government was concerned that Nigeria could offer no guarantees that Ekweremadu would continue his prison sentence after being deported.A government spokesperson said it could not comment on individual prisoners. They added: “Any prisoner transfer is at our discretion following a careful assessment of whether it would be in the interests of justice.”A source said: “The UK will not tolerate modern slavery and any offender will face the full force of UK law.”Beatrice Ekweremadu, who was sentenced to four years and six months, with half spent in custody, was released earlier this year and has since returned to Nigeria.In his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson said all three conspirators played a part in a “despicable trade”. He said: “The harvesting of human organs is a form of slavery. It treats human beings and their bodies as commodities to be bought and sold.”The judge described Ekweremadu as the “driving force” behind the organ-trafficking plot, and said his conviction represented “a very substantial fall from grace”.His Old Bailey trial exposedvulnerability and complacency in the UK health system to organ trafficking.In February 2022, the young man whom Ekweremadu trafficked to London was taken to a private renal unit at the Royal Free hospital in London. It was falsely claimed that man was Sonia’s cousin and had agreed to the £80,000 transplant.Despite bribing a medical secretary the attempted transplant by the Ekweremadus was rejected by the hospital in March 2022. But the medics did not report the incident to the police.The plot was discovered only when the victim, referred to as C in court, fled to the police in fear of his life because he believed he was being lined up by Obeta for another transplant in Nigeria.Obeta had himself received a kidney transplant at the Royal Free in July 2021 from another man allegedly trafficked from Nigeria. He was sentenced to 10 years, two-thirds of which must be served in prison.Nigeria’s request to deport Ekweremadu has been criticised in his home country, and raised questions about why the Abuja government has not tried to intervene over more than 230 other Nigerians imprisoned in the UK.Nigeria’s high commission in London has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A third hit the grizzly repeatedly with her crutches before it finally fled back into the woods.Eleven injured after grizzly bear attacks schoolchildren and teachers in CanadaRead moreThree children were taken to a hospital following the incident, including two with critical injuries. An adult was also flown to a hospital in Vancouver. Seven others were treated in the community.The province’s environment minister, Tamara Davidson, said the teachers “took great risk” when they intervened to protect children. “They were well prepared, and they were the true heroes.”Conservation officers say that given the size of the group, the attack was largely unprecedented in the region. But it has sent ripples of worry throughout 4 Mile, and put the outdoors-oriented residents on lockdown as officers search for the aggressive bear.Over the weekend, the province’s conservation service said it had scoured a large, cordoned-off area of the Bella Coola River valley for the female bear and her two cubs, but the rocky and densely forested landscape has offered up few clues.“This is, speaking from experience, probably the most dangerous thing that conservation officers do, especially dealing with family units with sows,” Sgt Jeff Tyre of the Conservation Officer Service, or COS, at a news conference Sunday.If possible, teams will live-trap bears and collect DNA samples to identify the likely attackers. But, as Tyre said: “The bears don’t necessarily cooperate.”The teams, working amid in freezing temperatures and under threat of snow, are also racing against the biological clocks of bears, who will soon begin hibernating as the deep cold sets in.Grizzly bears have coexisted alongside the Nuxalk nation for generations. But the area, dubbed the “gateway to the Great Bear Rainforest” in tourism campaigns, has seen increased numbers of grizzly bears in recent years that residents say have disrupted a delicate balance. Nuxalk leadership say both human action, such as logging, and the effects of climate change, including forest fires and droughts, have disrupted key food sources and displaced bears.Residents have reported seeing bears more commonly in their yards and experienced occasional break-ins.Tanyss Munro, who lives with her husband in the Bella Coola valley, told CityNews that she returned home last month to find their front door smashed in. Inside their house, the kitchen was destroyed and their fridge had been dragged to the yard. A metal trailer in their yard was also destroyed.“[The bears] had ripped off, and folded in half, the steel-clad door and gone in there and just demolished that,” she said. “They wrecked the furnace. We had just had it filled up with propane. And that was all gone… and just everything was smashed,” she said.The BC Wildlife Federation (BCWF) warned that Thursday’s attack, which conservation officers called “atypical”, reflects a broader trend in the province. The group, which advocates for hunters, said a decision to ban trophy hunting of grizzly bears in 2017 – a decision the group said was made “due to popular opinion, with no scientific rationale” – was partly to blame.“In the 10 years preceding the ban, calls to the [conservation officers] concerning grizzly conflicts ranged from 300 to 500 a year, peaking between April and November,” the group said. “Since the ban, calls about grizzly bears doubled, to nearly 1,000 a year.” But the group’s call to revive the trophy hunt has created fissures in the hunting community, reflecting the controversial nature of the hunt.Shooting of bear that swam to Canadian island frustrates First NationsRead more“The idea of hunting to manage bears, it’s an old way of thinking that we really need to change and examine. And First Nations communities, like the Nuxalk nation have shown there is a different approach. They don’t manage wildlife because it’s not something to manage. They’re stewards,’ said Nicholas Scapillati, head of the non-profit Grizzly Bear Foundation.Many of the more isolated First Nations communities in the region have bear education programs that reflect a more holistic way of interacting with grizzlies.“As we see a change in food sources and forest fires, things are fluctuating. Bears are on the move and moving around in different ways. And so we need to think differently than how we have for centuries in this province,” said Scapillati.“First Nations communities have been leaders in this area. And so not only do they need support for us now in this time with this rare attack, but they also need support on the plans they’ve shown us are needed to do what they’ve long known is possible: coexistence with bears.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the president’s new comment, made onTruth Social, hints that his hostility to Venezuela may also be based on an outlandish, implausible theory ruled to be false by a judge in 2023.Trump’s DoJ investigating unfounded claims Venezuela helped steal 2020 electionRead moreFox News paid$787m in 2023 to Dominion Votingto settle a lawsuit that was based in part on identical claims about Venezuela’s supposed role in the 2020 election.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s remarks.Trump’s post came two days after the Guardianreportedthat Trump’s Department of Justice has been extensively interviewing conspiracists who are pushing the idea that Venezuela controls voting companies and flips votes to the candidates it favors.The US attorney in Puerto Rico, W Stephen Muldrow, has repeatedly interviewedthe former CIA officer Gary Berntsen and Venezuelan expatriate Martin Rodil, who claim to have proof of the scheme and the two have also briefed a taskforce out of Tampa. Berntsen, and author Ralph Pezzullo, were also guests on the podcast of far-right media personality Lara Logan on Friday.Trump on Sunday reposted the Logan podcast segment, and wrote:“We must focus all of our energy and might on ELECTION FRAUD!!”Trump did not specifically mention Venezuela, but the podcast was a rehash of the allegations and was built around a self published book called Stolen Elections, which recounts the theory.The post came as Trump has sent extensive military resources, including a navy aircraft carrier, to the region.On Monday the administration ramped up pressure, designating the Venezuelan-based so-called Cartel de los Soles as aForeign Terrorist Organization. In July the treasury department had already named it a“specially designated global terrorist”.An indictment filed in 2020 alleged that the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, heads the reputed organization.“Who knows what the process is inside the White House,” said David M Rowe, a political science professor at Kenyon College who specializes in national security. “If it captures Trump’s attention, my understanding is it is part of the process. Trump needs to find justification in his own mind for war.”Rowe said that narcoterrorism claims about Venezuela have not resonated with Trump’s America First base, which has been reluctant to support overseas intervention. “As a kind of casus belli, a reason for war, narcoterrorism looks extremely weak. An attack on the American electoral system is stronger. If he can argue to the Maga movement that they did intervene in the US political system, it’s a stronger case for war,” he said.Berntsen, the ex-CIA officer promoting the theory, was asked by the Guardian on Monday about the president’s apparent affirmation of his theory, and replied: “The President knows this is NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY, he knows the truth, evidence in possession of DOJ.”A Venezuelan opposition figure who supports strong action against Maduro but is dismissive of the election claims told the Guardian on condition of anonymity that proponents of the conspiracy theory are trying to take advantage of access to the administration. “I think there is someone inside the White House that these people have access to. They might be overselling this crap and there are people who refuse to let go of the 2020 election conspiracy bullshit.”Explore more on these topicsUS elections 2020US politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It said the supposed cartel was “nonexistent” and called the US accusations “slander”.After the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, arrived in the Caribbean in mid-November, speculation intensified that US military chiefs were preparing to launch some kind of operation against land targets within Venezuela.Inan open letter, leftwing European politicians including the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Greece’s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and Labour MP Richard Burgon, warned of “the imminent threat of US military intervention in Venezuela”.“If the US launches a military intervention in Venezuela, it would mark the first interstate war by the United States in South America,” the group wrote, noting how past US military operations in Latin America linked to the “war on drugs” had “delivered not security but a torrent of bloodshed, dispossession, and destabilisation”.3:34'War on drugs' or political agitation? Assessing Trump's actions in Venezuela – video explainerEuropean governments have reportedly become so concerned about the prospect of future potentially illegal strikes in the region that France and the Netherlands had joined the UK in limiting intelligence sharing with Washington, AFP reported on Sunday.On Saturday, Reuters said four US officials had told its reporters Washington was poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations in the coming days. Two officials claimed the options under consideration included trying to overthrow Maduro, although the news agency emphasised that Trump had yet to make a decision. Last week, the US president signaled he was willing to talk to Maduro and expected to do so “in a not too distant future”.Amid growing tensions, at least half a dozen major airlines suspended or cancelled their flights in and out of Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week warned of “heightened military activity in or around Venezuela”.Those airlines included Portugal’s TAP, Spain’s Iberia, Colombia’s Avianca, Brazil’s Gol, the Latin American carrier Latam and Turkish Airlines. Venezuelan carriers continued to operate, as did Panama’s Copa Airlines.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career … Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.” Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.With hits including You Can Get It If You Really Want, I Can See Clearly Now and Wonderful World, Beautiful People, Cliff’s upbeat musical temperament brought him a large and longstanding fanbase. His lead acting role in 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come was also acclaimed, with the film seen as a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema.He is one of just a handful of musicians, alongside Bob Marley and others, to be awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit.Jamaican prime minister Andrew Holness was among those paying tribute to Cliff, calling him “a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world … Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul. His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.”View image in fullscreenJimmy Cliff signing autographs for The Harder They Come.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesCliff was born in Saint James, Jamaica in 1944, and his music career began in the early 1960s after he moved to the island’s capital Kingston and began collaborating with producer Leslie Kong. Kong’s family owned a record shop called Beverley’s and Cliff wrote a song namechecking it to help persuade Kong – who would go on to become key producer in reggae – to work with him.He had a number of local hits and was selected as a Jamaican representative at the World’s Fair expo in New York in 1964, but his career really took off later that decade after he signed to Island Records.He was initially marketed to a rock crowd – hence curios such as his cover of Whiter Shade of Pale – and found life in his new home of London alienating, later describing the city as “a bitch … I experienced racism in a manner I had never experienced before”. But the sparkling ska of 1969’s Wonderful World, Beautiful People proved to be his breakthrough UK hit, reaching No 6 in the charts.Its message of hope and unity carried with it a rebuke of the current state of the world (“cheating, backbiting, scandalising and hating”) and that blend of beautiful music and socially conscious lyrics became a core part of Cliff’s artistry. After writing Vietnam, a song pleading for the end to that war, Cliff later recalled: “The critics in London said, ‘Wow! How is he singing this kind of serious song and such a happy rhythm?’ And I said: Wow! I didn’t even realise I was doing that. I was just writing a song to a rhythm.”Cliff was back in the UK Top 10 in 1970 with a cover of Cat Stevens’s Wild World, before filming The Harder They Come in 1972, after the film’s director Perry Henzell intuited that he would make a good actor.View image in fullscreenCliff in the 1972 film The Harder They Come.Photograph: Ronald Grant ArchiveIts soundtrack album, with Cliff performances such as the title track and You Can Get It If You Really Want alongside others by Desmond Dekker, Toots & the Maytals and more, helped to bring reggae to a wider audience, especially in the US where the film was eventually released in 1973.The film’s gangster milieu was familiar to Cliff, as he recalled in the Observer in 2022: “When I came to Kingston I lived in areas that were gangster-infested, and to be quite honest, the only thing that stopped me from joining those gangs full-time was I didn’t know where I would bury my head if my family heard that I was in Kingston firing a gun.”Cliff continued to tour and release albums in the 1970s, and had high-profile appearances in the US such as a booking on Saturday Night Live. He took some time away from music in the mid-late 1970s, travelling to Africa to reconnect with his ancestral roots, and converting to Islam: the 1978 album Give Thankx was partly inspired by those travels.Bruce Springsteen championed his song Trapped by playing it on tour in the early 1980s, and a live version appeared on the massive-selling charity album We Are the World.View image in fullscreenCliff on stage at Porte de Pantin in Paris in 1982.Photograph: John van Hasselt/Corbis/Sygma/Getty ImagesIn 1994, he had a huge flush of new fame with his version of I Can See Clearly Now, which appeared on the soundtrack to the Jamaican bobsled drama film Cool Runnings: it returned him to the UK Top 40 for the first time since 1970, topped the French charts and was a hit elsewhere.Cliff collaborated with numerous other artists over the years from the Rolling Stones to Sting. More recently he worked with the lead singer of punk band Rancid, Tim Armstrong, on an EP and album, the latter winning a Grammy for best reggae album – one of two wins from seven nominations over the years.Cliff’s most recent album is 2022’s Refugees, made with Wyclef Jean, capping a discography of more than 30 studio albums.Despite the success of The Harder They Come, Cliff only occasionally returned to acting, most prominently with 1986’s Club Paradise, opposite Robin Williams, Rick Moranis and more.Explore more on these topicsJimmy CliffReggaePop and rockJamaicaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

None of the climbers have been publicly identified.Sgt Kevin McErlain told the Timaru Herald the pair had been connected by a rope when they fell near the summit of Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook.Five climbers and two guides killed in Nepal avalanche, say officialsRead moreThe authorities learned late on Monday night local time that four climbers needed help on the mountain, which is on New Zealand’s South Island. Two of the climbers were rescued by helicopter in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Walker said.They were uninjured. Searchers in two helicopters looked throughout the night for the other climbers, who were found dead hours later.Aoraki is 3,724 metres (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century. Dozens of those who died on the mountain have never been found.This includesthree men, two from the US and one from Canada, who were believed to have died on Aoraki in December 2024. The Americans – Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California – were certified alpine guides.The climbers were missing for five days before New Zealand authorities halted a search for them, saying discoveries of their belongings suggested the men had fallen to their deaths.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandMountaineeringAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood some of the men already transferred to Nauru are among those who are refugees.The Guardian haspreviously reported a partial transcript, which was corroborated by the full transcript read into Hansard by senators David Pocock and David Shoebridge late on Monday.The translation read into Hansard was not the Australian government’s document, but an independently sourced and verified translation obtained by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC).A translation of the Nauruan president’s remarks will stay suppressed for a decade – but secrecy in Australia’s offshore policy is nothing newRead moreThe Australian government has consistently resisted disclosure of its translation of the interview, including winning a non-publication order over its document in the federal court.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailResponding to a Senate order to produce the official translation, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, wrote that its publication would “prejudice Australia’s international relations … and our broader standing in the Pacific”.At least five members of the NZYQ cohort have been forcibly removed to Nauru and are being held at a regional processing centre on the Pacific island.Australian is legally obliged to protect refugees under the refugees convention, and cannot return them to their home country where they face a “well-founded fear of being persecuted”.Even if that return is made through a third country – such as Nauru – it is unlawful, known in international law as “chain refoulement”.Nauru is also a party to the convention.Adeang granted the interview in February, speaking in Nauruan to a government staff member, and explaining the new agreement Nauru had signed with Australia to accept members of the NZYQ cohort.The deal will see Australia pay Nauruup to $2.5bnover three decades.Adeang said those removed to Nauru by Australia would stay on the island for 30 years.“Unless of course, we, your government, find a way for them to move around, for example; they get to go home,” he said, according to the ASRC translation released on Monday.“The problem now is, Australia cannot return them home, these people are what you would refer to as stateless.“Their homelands do not want them and they do not have a way to go home. And if over time we find a way to return them home then of course they will not reach the 30 years, but the visa we are providing them to start is 30 years.”The Guardian understands none of the men sent to Nauru under the new agreement so far are stateless.Adeang repeatedly said – incorrectly – that members of the NZYQ cohort were not refugees.“To clarify, these people are not refugees. They are regular people but their background or their history is that they have been to jail.“These days, they are free to roam around Australia and while they are no longer under penalties but they are not of that place and despite Australia’s preference to send them home, they are unable to.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most have completed a jail term but cannot be returned to their home countries because they face persecution there. Some have lived in Australia for decades and have Australian-citizen partners and children.Shoebridge told the Senate Adeang’s claim that the NZYQ cohort were not refugees was “plainly wrong”.“Did the government tell them that? Did … our government mislead the Nauruan government? Do they adhere to what the Nauruan president said about these people not being refugees? None of them refugees?“And they’re probably also embarrassed by the fact that President Adeang has made it very clear he wants these people to return from the country they came from. We know that they have fled from persecution by and large.”Ogy Simic, head of advocacy at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said on Monday night the Australian government’s secrecy around its offshore program was “deeply alarming”.He said the secrecy and cover-ups eroded public trust, and abuse and corruption thrived in the opacity of the offshore regime.“The transcript reveals for the first time that Nauru plans to send people back to their countries of origin ‘if they find a way’, even though these are people Australia has not removed to their country of origin because they are refugees. This means the Australian government has effectively outsourced refoulement – paying another country to do what Australia legally cannot.”He said the Adeang interview – the release of which was resisted by the government – exposed a dangerous loophole.“Australia claims to be upholding international law while quietly paying for people to be returned to danger via third-party deals.”The legal director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Sanmati Verma, said the government had tried to hide “nearly every detail” of its agreement with Nauru.“Now we learn that the Nauruan government may not have any intention of holding up its end of this lamentable deal.”She said the forced removals to Nauru must be stopped, because the government could not guarantee people’s safety.“Our government is tearing people away from their lives, families and communities in Australia and exiling them to a place where they are clearly not welcome. Our government has known all along that it might be sending people to their deaths – through denial of the medical care they need to survive, or by forcing them back to the countries they fled as refugees.”The Guardian has sought comment from the Department of Home Affairs and the Nauruan government.Explore more on these topicsNauruAustralian immigration and asylumRefugeesAsia PacificMigrationAustralian politicsPacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Just 6% of NDIS service providers are registered.Laverty said the NDIA needed to “urgently correct the NDIS price formula to shift incentives away from the 94% of providers to stabilise the registered not-for-profits who are doing the majority of the more complex NDIS work for participants who need it.”Explore more on these topicsNational disability insurance schemeNDIS under pressureAustralian politicsBusinessDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Ukraine is pressing for Europe to be involved in the talks.The original 28-point US-Russian plan was drawn up last month byKirill Dmitriev, Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, and Trump’s representative Steve Witkoff. It calls on Ukraine to withdraw from cities it controls in the eastern Donbas region, limit the size of its army, and not join Nato.During negotiations on Sunday in Switzerland – led by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak – the plan was substantially revised. It now includes only 19 points. Kyiv and its European partners say the existing frontline has to be the starting point for territorial discussions.On Monday, Zelenskyy said: “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points, no longer 28, and many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework,” adding that sensitive issues were to be discussed with Trump.They say there can be no recognition of land seized byRussiamilitarily, and that Kyiv should make its own decisions on whether to join the EU and Nato – something the Kremlin wants to veto or impose conditions on. Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told the Financial Times such issues had been “placed in brackets” for Trump and Zelenskyy to decide upon later.Map of Ukraine showing areas controlled by Russian forces in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblastsRubio hailed Sunday’s talks as “very very positive”. Writing on Truth Social on Monday, Trump, who days earlier had accused Ukraine’s leadership of having “zero gratitude”, also struck a positive tone.“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!” he wrote.Ukraine’s delegation briefed Zelenskyy about the talks on Monday after returning to Kyiv from Geneva. They described the latest version of the plan as more realistic. Separately, Zelenskyy spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, and urged him to involve European countries in the process. Vance reportedly agreed.But in the clearest sign yet the original 28-point plan – widely seen as favourable to Moscow – still falls short of several key Kremlin demands, Putin’s top foreign policy aide on Monday said Moscow would seek to “rework” parts of it.“We were given some sort of draft … which will require further reworking,” said Yuri Ushakov, adding that “many provisions” of the plan appeared acceptable to Russia, but others would “require the most detailed discussions and review between the parties”.Underscoring the Kremlin’s hardline stance, Ushakov said Moscow would reject a European counter-proposal from the weekend, which, according to a copy seen by Reuters, changes the meaning and significance of key points concerning Nato membership and territory.“The European plan, at first glance … is completely unconstructive and does not work for us,” he said.The UK and EU were blind-sided last week when the original plan was leaked to US media. Thearmy secretary, Dan Driscoll– Vance’s friend and university classmate – was sent to Kyiv with a military delegation to brief Zelenskyy on its contents.Since then, European governments have sought to revise the document, which appears to have originally been written in Russian. EU leaders attending an EU-Africa summit in Angola welcomed a degree of progress, but said far more work remained to be done and insisted Europe must be fully involved and Russia must be present if talks were to advance substantively.The European Council president, António Costa, praised “a new momentum”, saying after talks on the sidelines of the summit that while issues remained, “the direction is positive”.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also called the “refined peace framework” agreed in Switzerland “a solid basis for moving forward”, but added: “Work remains to be done.”Von der Leyen said the core principles the EU would always insist on were that “Ukraine’s territory and sovereignty must be respected – only Ukraine, as a sovereign country, can make decisions regarding its armed forces”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said the talks were delicate because “nobody wants to put off the Americans and President Trump from having the US on our side in this process”.Tusk also stressed that any peace settlement needed to “strengthen, not weaken, our security” and must not “favour the aggressor”. Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said Russia “must be forced to the negotiating table” to see “aggression … never pays”.Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, said there was more work to do but progress was being made. A group of countries supporting Ukraine – the coalition of the willing – would discuss the issue in a video call on Tuesday, he said.The chairs of the parliamentary foreign affairs committees of 20 European countries, including France, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the UK, issued a rare joint statement saying just and lasting peace would not be achieved by “yielding to the aggressor” but must be “grounded in international law and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty”.On Monday,the White House pushed back against criticism, including from within the Republican party, that Trump is favouring Russia.“The idea that the US is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters.Zelenskyy is at his most vulnerable since the start of the war, after a corruption scandal led to two of his ministers being dismissed while Russia makes battlefield gains.Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, was hit by what officials said was a massive drone attack that killed four people on Sunday. With smoke rising from the rubble, one man was seen crouched and holding the hand of a dead person.“There was a family, there were children,” Ihor Klymenko, Red Cross commander of the emergency response team in Kharkiv, told Reuters. “I can’t tell you how, but the children are alive, thank God, the man is alive. The woman died, unfortunately.”Across the border, Russian air defences downed Ukrainian drones en route to Moscow, forcing three airports serving the capital to pause flights. A reported Ukrainian drone strike on Sunday knocked power out for thousands of residents near Moscow, a rare reversal of Russian attacks on energy targets that regularly cause power blackouts for millions of Ukrainians.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

European officials, meanwhile, were angered by his early speeches in which he accused them of “running from their voters” – who Vance said had anti-immigration and conservative positions close to those of Trump’s own constituency.But thenew peace dealpublished last week closely resembled his positions, and he has been one of the most forceful spokespeople for the deal in the administration while the US has been under fire for accepting a peace framework that largely resembles Vladimir Putin’s maximalist demands.In posts this weekend, Vance argued that a peace deal would have to produce a ceasefire that respected Ukrainian sovereignty, be acceptable to both sides, and prevent the war from restarting.“Every criticism of the peace framework the administration is working on either misunderstands the framework or misstates some critical reality on the ground,” Vance wrote. “There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand.”“Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land,” he added. “It might be made by smart people living in the real world.”It was also Vance who followed up on the presentation of the peace plan in a phone call with Zelenskyy. Trump had mainly tasked his team with bringing a signature on the peace deal before Thanksgiving this Thursday in the United States.That was a notably more full-throated endorsement of the plan than that given by the secretary of state and national security adviser,Marco Rubio, a more traditional hawk in the administration who has gone from a shaky stature inside the administration to more firm footing.Rubio was part of a US delegation that traveled to Geneva this weekend to meet with Ukrainian officials to help moderate the initial 28-point peace plan in order to make it more acceptable to leaders in Kyiv.Kirill Dmitriev: ‘ruthlessly ambitious’ Kremlin figure behind Ukraine planRead moreBut his initial response to the deal was lukewarm: “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,” Rubio wrote over the weekend before the conference. “And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.”In private, he was said to be much more doubtful of the plan. The Republican senator Mike Rounds said last week at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia that Rubio had called lawmakers to explain that the deal was just a preliminary offer from the Russians and not an initiative pushed by the administration.“Rubio did make a phone call to us this afternoon and I think he made it very clear to us that we are the recipients of a proposal that was delivered to one of our representatives,” said Rounds. “It is not our recommendation, it is not our peace plan.”Rubio moved quickly to fall in line. “The peace proposal was authored by the US,” he later wrote. “It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyJD VanceMarco RubioTrump administrationEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the children, surrounded by horses, donkeys and chickens, were homeschooled. Weekly trips to San Salvo, a town on the Adriatic coast with a population of 20,000, exposed them to the outside world.But the idyllic life came under scrutiny from local social services in September last year when the entire family was hospitalised after eating poisonous mushrooms picked from the woods.The authorities investigated further and found the family’s dwelling to be “dilapidated, in terrible hygienic conditions and lacking the necessary utilities”, a court document showed.Last week, the judge of a juvenile court in L’Aquila upheld a prosecutor’s claims that the children were suffering from “serious and harmful violations” of their rights owing to living off-grid, and ordered their removal. They were taken away by police on Thursday afternoon and taken to a church-run facility. Their mother is with them, although both parents have limited access to their children, according to their lawyer, Giovanni Angelucci.In its ruling, the juvenile court noted that “the family unit lives in housing hardship” and has “no social interaction, no fixed income”, while the home “has no toilet facilities” and “the children do not attend school”.As they awaited the court’s decision, Trevallion and Birmingham gave several interviews to the press, generating support from thousands who signed an online petition calling for the family to be kept together.Trevallion described the children’s removal as “a great heartbreak” that had caused them “shock”. “It was the worst night of my life,” he told the local news site,Il Centro, the day after the children were taken away, adding that in the care facility they were made to sleep in a separate room to their mother. “This is the hardest thing,” he added. “It’s a terrible situation.”He toldLa Repubblica: “We live outside of the system … this is what they’re accusing us of. They are ruining the life of a happy family.”Trevallion declined to speak further on Monday and Birmingham could not be reached for comment.Angelucci said the couple would appeal against the removal of their children, claiming that the judge’s report contained “falsehoods”, especially related to their schooling.The couple met while travelling in Bali and contemplated raising their family in Spain before settling inItaly. Trevallion told La Repubblica they would like to stay in the country but were also ready to move to Australia.The case has generated political controversy and a backlash against the juvenile court’s top judge, Cecilia Angrisano.Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, expressed “alarm” over the children being taken into care and instructed her justice minister, Carlo Nordio, to assess whether there were grounds to send inspectors. The deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, compared the case to a kidnapping.Italian magistrates often come under attack by Meloni’s government, and the ANM union on Monday warned against the “exploitation” of the case, saying the court’s decision was based on factors including the children’s safety, sanitary conditions and education.Chiara Saraceno, a well known Italian sociologist, said: “It is very difficult to understand what is happening there. But there is nothing wrong with wanting to provide an alternative education. The problem is how isolated these children were and how hygienic their [living] conditions were.”However, Saraceno questioned the focus of the social services on this particular case, when “so many impoverished children live in houses”. “In these cases, you have to wonder: where are the social workers?”Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It hasn’t needed to.The 28-point US-Russia peace proposal, leaked to the media last week, has thrown Washington, Kyiv and European capitals into disarray, creating precisely the conditions Vladimir Putin has long sought: a negotiating table sharply tilted in the Russian president’s favour, with Ukraine cornered into weighing terms it cannot accept andthe threat of losing its most important allyhanging over its head.Since Donald Trump’s return to power, both Putin andVolodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, have worked relentlessly to convince the US they are not the side resisting peace. For his part, the US president has oscillated wildly – blasting one side or the other with angry posts and threats.After theTrump-Putin summit in Alaska, which by most accounts left the US president dissatisfied, he briefly appeared to side more openly with Kyiv, accusing Russia of blocking peace. Significant US sanctions on Russian oil followed.But last week’s peace plan – largely drafted in Florida by the US property developer Steve Witkoff andKirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund – has upended that dynamic.While the exact inception of the plan – and Trump’s precise role in it – remains unclear, the US president is embracing it. On Sunday, he returned to portrayingUkraineas the obstacle to ending the war.The US president wrote on his Truth Social platform complaining that Kyiv’s leadership had “EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS”.Moscow, meanwhile, has remained strikingly quiet. For days, the foreign ministry feigned ignorance, insisting it knew nothing of any peace initiative, before Putin himself said late on Friday that the proposals “could form the basis of a final peace settlement”.The structure of the US negotiation process works to Russia’s advantage.Washington wants Kyiv to approve the plan before a US delegation travels to Moscow to finalise terms.The Kremlin believes any move by Zelenskyy to accept something close to the 28-point draft would trigger political turmoil in Ukraine – an outcome Moscow would welcome.And Putin knows Ukraine cannot simply abandon the talks: it remains reliant on US-supplied weapons and intelligence and could face a catastrophic winter if its central ally walked away.Even if Kyiv were to support the plan, Russian insiders and analysts expect Putin to demand further concessions.“The plan may be 70% acceptable, but the rest is something Putin will not agree to,” said Anton Barbashin, a visiting researcher at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “He will certainly say: Yes, let’s work on this – here are my amendments.”Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said the current proposal – which she described as clumsily drafted – leaves too much room for interpretation, making it the sort of document Putin would never sign.The proposal’s vague wording on Ukraine’s neutrality and Nato’s future expansion, she said, would demand concrete “documents, timelines and commitments – none of which appear in the draft”.According to Stanovaya, Putin is unlikely to retreat from his main goal of subjugating Ukraine and will instead push for a revised version of the current plan that more fully reflects Russia’s interests.But if diplomacy stalls, she said Putin would see “no problem with continuing the war” as the Kremlin believes Ukraine’s position will worsen over time – especially if Trump follows through on threats to halt US military aid.On Friday Putin stopped short of confirming he would sign the deal, in part, Stanovaya believes, because he is waiting to see how the apparent disagreements inside the US administration over the plan unfold.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, on Saturday stressed that the US “authored” the peace plan, after a Republican senator asserted that Rubio had distanced himself from the proposal and called it a Russian initiative.“The Kremlin is watching to see which faction inside the US administration prevails. It’s far too early for Moscow to celebrate,” Stanovaya said.Ukraine’s hope, as in past rounds of diplomacy, is that with its European allies it can reshape the proposal into something acceptable for Kyiv and persuade Trump to back that version.On Monday, the US and Ukraine produceda 19-point peace planthat is markedly more favourable to Kyiv, but deferred the most politically sensitive questions for later.Moscow is almost certain to reject the counter-proposal, returning the process to square one.With events moving quickly, Putin is likely to take a back seat for the moment, according to Fyodor Lukyanov, a foreign policy analyst close to the Kremlin.Lukyanov said Russia would maintain military pressure “at its current level” until Ukraine accepted the original 28-point plan, after which Moscow would be ready to move to detailed discussions.“The ball is on the other side,” Lukyanov added.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinRussiaUkraineUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Contractors working at the sites, backed by video accounts, said the US security guards fired live ammunition and stun grenades as desperate Palestinians scrambled for food.John Acree, a former senior official at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), said that GHF would transfer its work to the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), the new centre set up by the US in Israel to oversee the ceasefire and aid delivery in Gaza.“GHF has been in talks with CMCC and international organisations now for weeks about the way forward and it’s clear they will be adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted,” he said.The GHF had closed its distribution sites after the US-brokered ceasefire took effect in Gaza last month. All were in the part of Gaza that is under Israel’s control and so were inaccessible to Palestinians.In its statement, the GHF said it had delivered more than 187m meals directly to civilians living in Gaza, which it called “a record humanitarian operation that ensured food aid reached Palestinian families safely and without diversion to Hamas or other entities”.Acree said: “At a critical juncture, we are proud to have been the only aid operation that reliably and safely provided free meals directly to Palestinian people in Gaza, at scale and without diversion … We built a new model that worked, saved lives, and restored dignity to civilians in Gaza.”Acree’spredecessor resigned, saying it was “not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”.The US state department thanked GHF for its humanitarian work and its contribution to reaching a ceasefire in Gaza.Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the US state department, wrote on X: “GHF’s model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire. We thank them for all that they provided to Gazans.”A spokesperson for Hamas said the GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.“We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the [Israeli] government,” Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She listed a house she bought there as her home address on financial documents at the time.She later shared posts about the community on social media, including advertising youth programmes and subsidised housing for childcare workers.‘They have total impunity’: West Bank settler violence surges after Gaza ceasefireRead moreThe settlement, north of Ramallah, was built by Amana, a construction company hit with sanctions last year for supporting, promoting and inciting violence against Palestinians.“Amana has overseen the establishment of illegal outposts and provides funding and other economic resources for Israeli settlers involved in threatening and perpetrating acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank,” the UK said at the time.Ben-Yakov Phillips bought the house from previous residents, not directly from Amana, and the purchase was made before sanctions against the company were imposed.View image in fullscreenKerem Reim was retroactively authorised by the Israeli government in 2017 but remains illegal under international law.Photograph: JacobBut residents of Amana projects are charged a monthly fee by the company, itemised on a financial statement seen by the Guardian.“If you live there, you pay,” said Dror Etkes, the director of Kerem Navot, which researches settlements and land use in the West Bank.The size of any payment is not relevant when assessing a possible violation of UK law, said Sara Segneri, a specialist in sanctions law and partner at Confinium Strategies. “UK sanctions law does not have ade minimisexception. Any funds or economic resources would be considered a sanctions breach, no matter how small.”Ben-Yakov Phillips’s status as a property owner in Kerem Reim,revealed first by the National, should have raised serious questions for the UK embassy in Tel Aviv when the Amana sanctions were imposed, about security vetting and its own legal responsibilities under the law.Because she is not a British citizen, she is not directly subject to sanctions laws. But foreign citizens working at embassies abroad must comply with UK sanctions law to get security clearances.Candidates for an HR role that entails financial oversight and handling of sensitive personal data would usually require vetting.The British embassy in Peru is seeking applicants for a deputy head of corporate services position, the title Ben-Yakov Phillips uses on LinkedIn. The job ad notes that “the successful candidate will be subject to a security clearance”.The embassy itself may also be in breach of sanctions law if Ben-Yakov Phillips’s salary contributes to payment of Amana’s fees in Kerem Reim, Segneri said. “If I have a company and I am paying an employee knowing that that employee is then sending money to Vladimir Putin, that’s potentially a sanctions violation,” said Segneri. “If she is making payments to one of the settlements that is sanctioned then I think there could potentially be a violation [by the embassy].“I hope the embassy has [investigated], or is in the process of investigating, the moneys that they’re paying to this employee and whether she has funds that are then going to the settlements.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli flag flutters with an Israeli settlement in the West Bank visible in the background.Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/Reuters“It goes against the meaning and intent of the sanctions programmes if UK government employees around the world are allowed to disregard sanctions or potentially utilise their personal income from the UK government to pay sanctioned entities.”The UK government’s sanctions advice page notes: “Due diligence (research) includes not just checking the sanctions lists, but also examining an organisation’s ownership structure or an individual’s circle of contacts.”Kerem Reim was established as an outpost that violated both Israeli and international law. In 2017, it was authorised retroactively by the Israeli government, but remains illegal under international law.It is a selective community, where prospective residents have to be vetted by a committee for compatibility before they are allowed to move in. In the last election in 2022, more than 85% of voters from Kerem Reim backed the far-right party of Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who is himself under UK sanctions.Regardless of her individual legal position, the embassy should have been alert to the reputational, legal and policy risks of giving a senior role to someone who chose to move to an Amana settlement.The settlement is built on land the international community expects to form part of a future Palestinian state,which the UK recognised this year. The international court of justice (ICJ) last year ruled that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza was illegal, andordered the country to end it as rapidly as possible.View image in fullscreenIn the last election in 2022, more than 85% of voters from Kerem Reim backed the far-right party of Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/ReutersFundraisers warn of ‘catastrophic’ drop in donations to Gaza since ceasefireRead moreProfPhilippe SandsKC, a member of Palestine’s legal team for the case at the ICJ concerning Israel’s occupation and a professor of law at University College London, said: “I would have thought the government will have taken steps to ensure that neither it nor any of its employees is in violation of any UK sanctions or its obligations under international law. Otherwise it will be at risk of the charge that it is complicit in any violation of the law.”Palestinian citizens of Israel employed by the embassy would be unlikely to feel comfortable taking HR issues to a manager whose home was built by a company under UK sanctions for supporting violent extremism, and whose community overwhelmingly backs a politician sanctioned for violent extremism.The Guardian put a series of questions to the Foreign Office about a potential breach of sanctions, international law and its due diligence with respect to employee activities but it refused to comment.The Guardian also attempted to reach Ben-Yakov Phillipsfor comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi said on X.Often called Bollywood’s “He-Man” in reference to his muscular physique, handsome looks and rugged charm, Dharmendra was known for his versatility in roles that spanned genres, from comedy and action to emotional dramas and, later, a focus on character roles.View image in fullscreenCrowds gather around cars leaving Dharmendra’s funeral in Mumbai on Monday.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAHe was particularly loved for his role as in the 1975 Indian western, Sholay, where he and another popular actor, Amitabh Bachchan, played a pair of lovable, small time criminals, in what is still one of Bollywood’s most beloved on-screen friendships.Dharmendra came from a simple, agrarian background. He was born in a village in rural Punjab and his father was a schoolteacher. His break into film came in 1960 when he won a film talent contest and went alone to Mumbai, the heart of Indian cinema.With his oft-remarked upon good looks, he soon established himself as the go-to romantic hero of Bollywood. He made his break with Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere in 1960, and was known to inspire fervour among his many devoted fans.Dharmendra starred in more than 300 films and also dabbled in politics, becoming an MP for the ruling Bharatiya Janata party from 2004 to 2009. He continued to act throughout his term and was rarely seen in parliament.View image in fullscreenFans in Mumbai mourn the news of Dharmendra’s death.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAHis off-screen life was also a source of endless fascination and his family became something of a Bollywood dynasty. Dharmendra had four children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur, two of whom became Bollywood stars. But his electric on-screen chemistry with the actor Hema Malini resulted in his leaving Kaur and marrying Malini in 1980. They had two daughters, one of whom also became a Bollywood actor.In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian honour, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema.He continued to act well into his late 80s, even as his health began to decline. His final feature, Ikkis, is due to be released in cinemas next month.Explore more on these topicsBollywoodIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It is due to write to the health secretary later this week, the Telegraph reported.Sunak, who is leading a cross-party alliance of 125 MPs, met Streeting on Monday evening to hand him an open letter urging the government to introduce tests so men at the highest risk,including Black men, men with a family history of prostate, breast or ovarian cancer, and those carrying the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are “no longer left behind”.David Cameron reveals prostate cancer diagnosis and calls for targeted screeningRead moreThe letter says: “Our current opportunistic PSA [prostate-specific antigen]testing systemis unstructured, inefficient and unfair – a postcode lottery where some men succeed because they know to ask or can pay privately, while others are turned away despite repeated requests.“Yet the data hide what cannot be modelled: eroded trust among communities who feel abandoned. Black men,already at higher risk, often believe the system fails them. Families bear devastating emotional and financial burdens from late-stage disease – costs absent from formal modelling but among the most compelling reasons to act.“We now have the tools to deliver screening safely and effectively, yet the system is frozen waiting for next-generation trial data.“Waiting would entrench inequality and allow preventable deaths. Evidence is strong enough to act now. Perfection must not be the enemy of progress.”The push comes a day afterDavid Cameron disclosed he was treated for prostate cancer.He called for a targeted screening programme.Cameron, 59, told the Times: “You always hope for the best. You have a high PSA score – that’s probably nothing.“You have an MRI scan with a few black marks on it. You think, ‘Ah, that’s probably OK.’ But when the biopsy comes back, and it says you have got prostate cancer.“You always dread hearing those words. And then literally as they’re coming out of the doctor’s mouth you’re thinking: ‘Oh, no, he’s going to say it. He’s going to say it. Oh God, he said it.’”Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, with about 55,000 new cases every year.There is no screening programme for the form of the disease in the UK because of concerns about the accuracy of PSA tests.A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last monthsuggestedprostate cancer screening could reduce deaths by 13%.Researchers found that one death from prostate cancer was prevented for every 456 men who were invited for screening and that one death from prostate cancer was averted for every 12 men in whom prostate cancer was diagnosed.Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerHealthNHSRishi SunakWes StreetingDavid CameronnewsShareReuse this content"

She was 111.Her grandson Ike Howard said on Monday that she died surrounded by family at a Tulsa hospital. Sustained by a strong faith, she raised three children, worked as a welder in a shipyard during the second world war and spent decades caring for families as a housekeeper.Tulsa’s mayor,Monroe Nichols, said the city was mourning her loss. “Mother Fletcher endured more than anyone should, yet she spent her life lighting a path forward with purpose,” he said in a statement.‘Let the world know’: elderly survivors of the Tulsa race massacre push for justiceRead moreShe was seven years old when the two-day attack began on Tulsa’sGreenwood districton 31 May 1921 after a local newspaper published a sensationalized report about a Black man accused of assaulting a white woman. As a white mob grew outside the courthouse, Black Tulsans with guns who hoped to prevent the man’s lynching began showing up. White residents responded with overwhelming force. Hundreds of people were killed and homes were burned and looted, leaving about 35 city blocks decimated in the prosperous community known asBlack Wall Street.“I could never forget the charred remains of our once-thriving community, the smoke billowing in the air, and the terror-stricken faces of my neighbors,” she wrote in her 2023 memoir,Don’t Let Them Bury My Story.As her family left in a horse-drawn buggy, her eyes burned from the smoke and ash, she wrote. She described seeing piles of bodies in the streets and watching as a white man shot a Black man in the head, then fired toward her family.View image in fullscreenIn this 1921 image provided by the Library of Congress, smoke billows over Tulsa, Oklahoma, during the Tulsa race massacre, one of the worst single acts of violence against Black people in US history.Photograph: Alvin C Krupnick Co/APShe told the Associated Press in aninterviewthe year her memoir was published that fear of reprisals influenced her years of near-silence about the massacre. She wrote the book with Howard, her grandson, who said he had to persuade her to tell her story.“We don’t want history to repeat itself so we do need to educate people about what happened and try to get people to understand why you need to be made whole, why you need to be repaired,” Howard told the AP in 2024. “The generational wealth that was lost, the home, all the belongings, everything was lost in one night.”The attack wentlargely unrememberedfor decades.

The Oklahoma supreme courtdismissedit in June 2024, saying their grievances did not fall within the scope of the state’s public nuisance statute.“For as long as we remain in this lifetime, we will continue to shine a light on one of the darkest days in American history,” Fletcher and Randle said in a statement at the time. Van Ellis had died a year earlier, aged 102.A justice department review, launched under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act andreleasedin January 2025, outlined the massacre’s scope and impact. It concluded that federal prosecution may have been possible a century ago, but there was no longer an avenue to bring a criminal case.The city has been looking for ways to help descendants of the massacre’s victims without giving direct cash payments.

It was an oasis for Black people during segregation, she wrote in her memoir. Her family had a nice home, she said, and the community had everything from doctors to grocery stores to restaurants and banks.Forced to flee during the massacre, her family became nomadic, living out of a tent as they worked in the fields as sharecroppers. She didn’t finish school beyond the fourth grade.At the age of 16, she returned to Tulsa, where she got a job cleaning and creating window displays in a department store, she wrote in her memoir.

She had another son, James Edward Ford, and a daughter, Debra Stein Ford, from other relationships.She worked for decades as a housekeeper, doing everything in those homes from cooking to cleaning to caring for children, Howard said.

Manhattan federal court judge Paul Engelmayer wrote that the government’s request to unseal “implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine lode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are not that”.Still, Clayton’s request comes soon after he was assigned to investigate Epstein’s relationship to prominent Democrats and four months after Maurene Comey, one of the lead prosecutors on the cases against Epstein and Maxwell, was fired soon before deputy attorney general Todd Blanche travelled to Florida to interview Maxwell.Asked last week how that the New York Epstein-Democrat investigation could affect the release of Epstein files in the government’s possession, Attorney General Pam Bondi said: “We’re not going to say anything else on that because now it is a pending investigation in the southern district of New York.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpUS politicsGhislaine MaxwellnewsShareReuse this content"

Sad to see,”wrotefar-right activist Laura Loomer, one of Trump’s most fervent online backers.She returned to the theme several times. “I had to drink a bottle of ginger ale today after seeing Mamdani in the Oval Office because it physically nauseates me seeing Islamic jihadists infiltrate our government and continue to get a pass to promote Islamic jihad and anti-American values with zero push back,” Loomerwrote.In Friday’s news conference, Trump retreated from his previous all-out opposition, forecasting that Mamdani “can do a very good job” as mayor, despite having previously threatened to withhold funds from New York for electing him.Loomer seized on that to predict that theRepublicanswould suffer catastrophic defeats at next year’s congressional elections and in the 2028 presidential election.“The Democrats will have a landslide in the midterms after today. Mamdani is the face of the Democrat party,” shewrote. “How will the GOP campaign ahead of 2026 if Mamdani and his policies are now considered rational and good for New York?”Elise Stefanik, a member of Congress who is running to be New York state governor next year, had a similar reaction.“We all want NYC to succeed,” shewrote. “But we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one. If he walks like a jihadist. If he talks like a jihadist. If he campaigns like a jihadist. If he supports jihadists – he’s a jihadist.”Inna Vernikov, a Republican New York city councillor,wrotethat she was “disappointed” that Trump had “legitimized” Mamdani.“We should never KOSHER a Marxist with Jihadist aligned views,” she posted. “Did we forget that@ZohranKMamdaniwants to cease [sic] the means of production, disproportionately tax white neighborhoods, & eliminate the anti-terror unit? Did we forget that he refused to condemn ‘globalize the intifada,’ refused to condemn Hamas.?”Benny Johnson, a pro-Trump influencer, seemed to implicitly condemn the president’s approach by highlighting a hardball question posed by fellow activist, Jack Posobiec, who asked Mamdani if he was planning “race-based property taxes” on white people.“This is how it’s done@JackPosobiec,” hewrote.But not all Trump supporters were downcast.Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist who has praised Mamdani’s skills and depicted him as a political threat, suggested Trump was using political subtlety.“He’s going to boost Mr Mamdani, whose policies will crater the city,” Bannon said in a discussion with Posobiec on his War Room podcast. “Trump will let him collapse because he’s a Marxist jihadist.”Some Mamdani supporters seemed as disorientated as Trump backers by the show of harmony.Jumaane Williams, New York’s public advocate and a Democrat, called the meeting “pretty shocking”.“My belief is that it would have went well, just knowing who our mayor is. But I don’t think anyone could have expected this,” he toldSpectrum News NY1.“I think the proof is in the pudding. But we may have staved off what was [an] inevitability in just a few weeks. And so the longer we can stave off harmful things to our city, the better.”Bill de Blasio, a former Democratic mayor of New York who endorsed Mamdani’s candidacy, said the meeting reflected his own meetings with Trump in the White House.“I think Trump has actually a lot of respect for Mamdani. As they say, game respects game,” he told CNN. “I had this same exact experience. I went to meet with Trump 10 days after the 2016 election. What I learned is, if you engage Trump and you show him you’re not afraid, he is actually willing to do some give and take.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpZohran MamdaniRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Documents reveal new detailsJeremy Barrin WashingtonMon 24 Nov 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 15.46 ESTShareNew revelations about the tense relationship betweenFox NewsandDonald Trumpin the fall of 2020 have emerged in a trove of thousands ofcourt documentsreleased on Sunday as part of a massive defamation lawsuit filed against the network by voting technology company Smartmatic.One exchange showed thatLachlan Murdoch, the chief executive of Fox News parent company Fox Corp, told star anchor Sean Hannity in a 1 October 2020 text chain that Trump could not appear on Fox again if he attacked the network.“Sean, sorry, but the president is not coming back on air if he uses it to attack us,” Murdoch wrote to a group that also included his father, Rupert, and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott. “It is the same rule we have with the other side. This is a golden rule,” signing the message with “Thx L.” (In a 1 October 2020 interviewwith Hannity,Trump said Foxwas “a much different place than it used to be”.)Hannity’s response to Murdoch’s message was redacted. The situation got worse in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, when many Fox News supportersturned againstthe network, including Trump himself, leading to something of anexistential crisisat the long-dominant channel.Ignorance is bliss: rightwing media largely keeps quiet on Trump-Epstein sagaRead moreIn a separate correspondence after the November 2020 presidential election, after many Trump supporters had grown angry at Fox Newsover its callof the state of Arizona for Joe Biden, Hannity acknowledged the anger from the president’s side. “Trump people hate Fox,” he wrote to a producer. “Hate hate hate.”WhileFoxpublicly stood behind its Arizona call in the face of internal and external blowback, according to a 6 November 2020 email from Scott, Lachlan Murdoch said that Fox should consider reversing its call of the state of Arizona for Biden if his margin fell below 1% of the vote. “I’m not recommending we do that at this time,” Scott said.The documents released on Sunday are copies of the exhibits that were cited in previous filings between the parties. They include both longer versions of previously cited conversations and many new internal text messages and email exchanges that have not previously been made public.In a previously unreported 23 November 2020 email to his son,Rupert Murdochsuggested they chat about the viewer backlash against Fox News. “Getting killed in audience numbers,” he wrote. “All day long. We have to keep our nerve but worth a discussion. Won’t hurt subscriber revenue, but will soon cut into [advertisements].” Lachlan Murdoch wrote that he would call his father the following morning. “Agree re FNC,” he wrote. “Keeping me awake at night.”In another previously unreported 21 January 2021 email to his son Lachlan, Rupert wrote that he was “still getting criticism for [Fox News Channel]. Saying leading voices encouraged stolen election bullshit and pushed Jan 6 rally.” In the same thread, Murdoch talked about ousting business network host Lou Dobbs. “Just take him off the air and negotiate later,” he wrote. Dobbs’s show was cancelled the following month.The elder Murdoch also talked about hiring former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, saying that it’s “hard to attack a Black woman”.The documents released on Sunday also included a version of Smartmatic’s deposition of Rupert Murdoch. When asked by a Smartmatic lawyer whether he took any steps “to make sure that hosts with shows on Fox News Media did not endorse claims about the 2020 election being stolen,” Rupert Murdoch responded: “No. No.”“I was very happy [with] the way Fox News was handling it,” Rupert Murdoch said of the network’s post-election coverage.Rupert Murdoch also acknowledged that Fox News made a decision to “pivot” after the election by “moving away from our support of Trump”. But he said it was difficult to do so. “Our very large audience tended to be Trump supporters,” he said. “We didn’t want to upset them totally. That, we did before. They’d been attacking us.”Murdoch also affirmed that he believed Trump’s claims of a stolen election contributed to the January 6US Capitol attack– though he denied it was a “riot” and said it was “intended to be just be a rally outside the Capitol”.In his own deposition, Lachlan Murdoch said he didn’t think Fox News did anything to “endorse” claims of election fraud made by Trump’s supporters. He also re-affirmed the journalistic value of covering the president’s election fraud claims. “I can’t imagine a more newsworthy story than the sitting president of the United States calling into question the election results,” he said, according a transcript of his deposition.“We did not make the allegations against Smartmatic. The president and his lawyers and associates made the allegations against Smartmatic,” Lachlan Murdoch said. “We reported those allegations, which I believe were incredibly newsworthy. So we did not make an apology for reporting the sitting president’s allegations about a voting system.”Smartmatic was indicted by the Department of Justice last month as part of an investigation into bribery in the Philippines. The company denies the charges, calling the indictment “targeted, political, and unjust”.Kristen Bell and Brian Cox among actors shocked they’re attached to Fox News podcastRead moreFox News has strenuously denied Smartmatic’s claims and said the company has vastly overstated its value.“The evidence shows that Smartmatic’s business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump’s lawyers on Fox News and that Smartmatic grossly inflated its damage claims to generate headlines and chill free speech,” a Fox News spokesperson said. “Now, in the aftermath of Smartmatic being criminally charged with bribery in the Philippines and the Government’s motion to include evidence of Smartmatic’s business dealings in Venezuela and Los Angeles County, we are eager and ready to continue defending our press freedoms.”Fox had petitioned the judge in the case to delay the trial, pending the criminal case against Smartmatic, but on Monday that effort was denied.“Today’s decision is an important victory for Smartmatic as we progress in our efforts to hold Fox accountable for its lies,” a Smartmatic spokesperson said. “The court made clear that Fox’s attempts to delay accountability won’t work, and its day of reckoning is coming.”Both parties are tentatively scheduled to argue their case for summary judgement next month.Explore more on these topicsFox NewsRupert MurdochLachlan MurdochFoxUS television industryDonald TrumpSteve BannonnewsShareReuse this content"

But holiday prices are volatile, economists sayMon 24 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 06.02 ESTShareIf you feel like the price ofThanksgivingthis year is more expensive to gobble up, you’re not alone. Amid widening concerns about therising cost of living, pollsshowconsumers are increasingly worried about inflation.Economists say the picture for holiday food prices this year is more mixed – prices are volatile and depend largely on how families shop around for their feast.Havingdismissedinflation fears,Donald Trumpappears to havepivotedto address an issue that in large part ended Joe Biden’s presidency. And, over the last few weeks, Trump has pointed to Walmart’s Thanksgiving promotion as proof that groceries are becoming cheaper. The chainannouncedin October that, with promotions, a Thanksgiving meal for 10 will cost under $4 a person.“Grocery prices are way down,” Trumpsaidduring a speech earlier this month. “This is the greatest, their greatest.”Americans are feeling the pain of the affordability crisis: ‘There’s not any wiggle room’Read moreIn apress release, the White House said that the Thanksgiving promotions are “proof that under President Trump’s leadership, America is winning the war on high prices”.But the story aroundThanksgivingfood prices is much more complicated. Every family’s Thanksgiving table is a little different, and economists say a shopper’s experience depends on their in-store strategy.“The cost of a Thanksgiving meal is really going to depend on what you put in your basket and also where you’re going to shop,” said David Ortega, a food economist and professor at Michigan State University. “For some people, it may be cheaper than last year. For others, they may get sticker shock.”Different reports show a mixed plate of prices. A Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institutereportshowed that a standard Thanksgiving menu can be 2% to 3% cheaper, depending on a shopper’s strategy, especially if shoppers stick with store-brand items.But a differentanalysisof Thanksgiving prices conducted by Groundwork Collaborative, the Century Foundation and the American Federation of Teachers found that Thanksgiving food prices will be nearly 10% higher across the board this year, particularly if shoppers stick with name-brand items.A bar chart showing that the cost of Thanksgiving staples is up nearly 10% from 2024The mixed view on pricing comes from the complicated factors that go into how stores price their offerings around Thanksgiving.Shoppers have a lot of power during the biggest food-centered holiday in the United States. Grocery store chains compete with each other to offer the best deals to get more customers through their doors. Their promotions often focus on the centerpiece of Thanksgiving: the turkey.US data agency cancels October inflation report as Fed considers whether to cut ratesRead moreWhile wholesale prices for the big birdshavejumped, turkey prices are expected to be on par or even lower than last year. That is because Thanksgiving turkeys are what economists call “loss leaders” – products that companies take losses on to get consumers through the door to buy everything else on their list.“The idea is if times are tough, consumers are looking to budget and save money. They’re worrying about the cost of food and the cost of holidays,” said Ricky Volpe, a professor of agricultural economics at California Polytechnic State University.“There’s no better way to advertise and market low prices and affordability than to set a really, really low price on whole turkeys and put it in your digital ads, to paint it in the windows, to put it in your print circulars, and to put big, colorful tags in the meat section saying turkey is $0.99 a pound.”So it’s no surprise thatWalmart, the largest US grocery retailer, wants to get in on the promotional spree. Since 2022, the superstore chain has put together a “carefully curated basket” of food that covers a Thanksgiving meal, from cranberry sauce to stuffing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there are caveats: the basket that Walmart put together is different than last year’s. It’s smaller and has more Walmart-brand items.A comparative graphic showing the difference in Walmart Thanksgiving meal items from 2024 to 2025The quiet changes to the company’s Thanksgiving basket reflects how food prices have beenshifting over the last year, particularly because of Trump’s50% tariffson steel and aluminum imports. Walmart swapped out a can of Ocean Spray’s jellied cranberry sauce with a 12oz bag of fresh cranberries. The meal also includes one fewer (aluminum) can of Campbell’s cream of mushroom soup.This is in line with the Groundwork Collaborative’s analysis, which noted muchhigher pricesfor aluminum products. A can of cranberry sauce is up over 22% while canned creamed corn is up 21%. A roll of Reynolds Wrap heavy-duty aluminum foil is up 40%.Trump’s ‘affordability’ efforts are a mess of absurdity and magical thinking | Steven GreenhouseRead morePackaging is just one element of the supply chain. Even though Trumpreversed tariffson certain food imports such as beef, tomatoes, coffees and bananas, the high tariffs on steel and aluminum are expected to have a larger impact on food prices in the future.“Think about how many major pieces of capital equipment will need to be replaced throughout the food supply. We’re talking about literally thousands of tractors, threshers, grinders, millers and industrial knives, trucks and tractors, you name it – all the way from the farm to the warehouse to retail. Every single one requires tons of steel, usually imported steel,” Volpe said.“We probably haven’t seen much of that yet because a lot of food companies are trying to ride out the storm and hope that these tariffs will pass, and then they can make their capital investments.”So while consumers may eventually get relief from Trump’s recent tariff adjustment, it’s unclear how much prices will fully cool. Different food industries have also been affected by climate-related events in addition to tariffs. Droughts have affected the cattle supply, which have made beef prices go up. Disease can affect crops including leafy greens andorangesused to make orange juice.But for the turkey-centered holiday, promotions will be as high as they ever were. The question that remains is what the prices will look like once the last crumbs of pumpkin pie are eaten.“What people are really attuned to and what they’re reacting to is the cumulative effects of inflation. We’ve seen price increases over the past few years.Foodprices are more than 25% higher [than five years ago], and this has been top of mind for many consumers,” Ortega said. “There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty at the moment.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpUS politicsThanksgivingWalmartTrump tariffsTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

One document noted Meta, which ownsFacebookand Instagram, earns $3.5bn in revenue from “higher risk” scam ads every six months. Other documents stated that Meta’s anti-fraud rules did not appear to apply to many ads that regulators and the company’s own staff believed “violated the spirit” of its rules against scam advertising.In response to the Reuters report, Meta said it had reduced user reports of scams by 58% over the last 18 months.The Hawley-Blumenthal letter “makes claims that are exaggerated and wrong”, a Meta spokesman, Andy Stone, said. “We aggressively fight fraud and scams because people on our platforms don’t want this content, legitimate advertisers don’t want it and we don’t want it either.”Hawley, a Republican, and Blumenthal, a Democrat, expressed skepticism about Meta’s efforts to combat illicit advertising. They pointed to the company’s “ad library”, a publicly accessible database of advertising that appears on Meta’s social-media platforms.“Even a short review of Meta’s Ad Library at the time of this letter shows clearly identifiable advertisements for illicit gambling, payment scams, crypto scams, AI deepfake sex services, and fake offers of federal benefits,” they wrote.The senators cited Reuters reporting that Meta itself estimated its platforms were involved in a third of all scams in the US, and went on to note that the FTC estimates Americans lost $158.3bn to scams last year.“Scams have been allowed to take over Facebook and Instagram as Meta has drastically cut its safety staff, including for FTC mandated reviews, even as it dumps unimaginable sums into its generative AI projects.“Blumenthal and Hawley expressed particular concern about fake ads purporting to represent the US government or political figures. They cited an example of a bogus ad that claimed Donald Trump was offering $1,000 to recipients of food assistance.“While Meta has been warned about advertisement deepfakes impersonating politicians, it still continues to run fraudulent clips,” their letter states. “The beneficiaries of these scams are often cybercrime groups based in China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and the Philippines.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS politicsUS SenateFacebookAdvertisingMetanewsShareReuse this content"

They left in ruin and debtExpecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their contactsNiamh RoweMon 24 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 16.18 ESTShareNorthwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant, ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most Admired Companies by the magazine,describesits financial advisers as “expert listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after goal”.It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent graduates themselves.In the corridors of US colleges and business schools, Northwestern recruiters push the dream of a blue chip career in finance. Posters appear with slogans like: The Career You Want at a Company You’ll Love. Recruiters in polo shirts sit at tables asking students if they would like to be financial advisers. Job ads for these positions, posted on sites like LinkedIn, describe “performance-based pay” and “uncapped earnings for the entrepreneurial”, phrases that shimmer with vague promises of potential wealth.When Jeremy Biar, a senior at Texas A&M University, spotted one of these booths, one with a big laminated placard that read Northwestern Mutual,he was relieved. He had yet to organise a summer internship and was glad when the recruiters began courting him.After expressing his interest, Jeremy attended an event organised by Northwestern at a nearby Hilton hotel. Inside a carpeted conference room, 50 or so students huddled around cocktail tables, nibbling hors doeuvres, lining up for headshots. Speakers extolled the joys of being a financial adviser at such a coveted firm.“They get you into the funnel of ‘let me sell you the dream,’” Jeremy says.But when it came to the interview for his internship, the questions felt more like a fraternity recruitment. How big was his family? What did his parents do? Where did he go to high school? He was sent away with “market information surveys” to complete. The worksheets, seen bythe Guardian, required Jeremy to interview 10 friends or family members about their finances – listing their names, occupations, phone numbers, and asking each of them to refer him to 10 more people he could contact about their financial planning.It all struck Jeremy as odd, was that how blue-chip financial services firms operated? He wasn’t sure, it was his first-ever job interview. So he completed the surveys and was offered a spot interning at Northwestern’s office in College Station, Texas, with 20 or so other students.View image in fullscreenAn undated photo of a Northwestern Mutual office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Photograph: AlamyOn his first day, dressed in a navy blue suit and tie, he felt “hopeful and full of vision”.The training began immediately, but there were no crash courses in mutual funds or market trends. Instead, the new recruits were told to take out their phones, open their contacts, and upload at least 200 names into company software.Then start calling.The goal: 40 dials a day, documents seen by the Guardian show. Friends, cousins, ex-roommates, teammates, anyone who might answer. Jeremy was told to leave 20 missed calls at a time so it looked “urgent”. When someone finally picked up, there was a script to follow: a cheerful announcement of his new role, followed by an invitation to meet and discuss their financial future.If the person on the phone agrees to meet, their financials are input into Northwestern’ssoftware, which spits out a financial plan. Invariably, it will recommend the most expensive life insurance product, known as “whole life”, according to internal documents and interviews with workers. A more senior adviser typically joins the call and gets half the commission. Reps have quotas for these meetings, according to 14 sources, and an internal document from the New York office, that requests five new bookings per week.I don’t believe they’re recruiting people to succeed in a careerDavid*The Guardian spoke with 21 current and former Northwestern workers (plus five who interviewed to be and didn’t end up taking the role) across nine states, who told strikingly similar stories.Recruitment, they said, is a decoy for harvesting contacts. Reps are not being groomed as future financial advisers, they claim, but pushed to sell life insurance to friends and family.One graduate, George, recalls selling a life insurance policy to his teenage brother – then being scolded for not making it pricier. Sophomore Kyle* says he was urged to buy a policy himself just to meet quota. Max, a college junior, bought one, too – hoping it would boost his chances of winning a trip to New York. Another, Sarah*, drained her own savings to keep afloat as a rep for four months after college, long enough to sell a whole life insurance policy to her sister. Graduate Megan* was asked daily if she had sold to her parents yet. Refusing to, she would be asked in weekly meetings: do you not care about helping people?“I felt gaslit,” she says, describing the culture as “cultlike”.“I don’t believe they’re recruiting people to succeed in a career,” says David*, a Northwestern adviser of 15 years. He thinks they are instead using young students and graduates to get new sales leads: “It’s gathering immense data and not paying for it.”Northwestern’s talk of big earnings is what draws reps in. The top quartile earn nearly $200,000 annually during their first three years, their job ads claim.But despite Northwestern’s six-figure promises in their job ads, in reality, most reps earn little before dropping out, often leaving loved ones stuck with insurance policies they do not need.Clint came across an ad while at business school in Michigan, where money had become a “toxic” obsession, with such influencers as Grant Cardone and Andrew Tate glamorizing passive income over a traditional salary. Against that backdrop Northwestern’s promise of hard work and high salaries felt like self-actualization.“I was excited at first. I felt like there was a potential career in personal finance in front of me,” says Clint. “But the rose-tinted glasses quickly came off.”A Northwestern spokesperson told the Guardian: “Our profession isn’t always easy, as it requires a tremendous amount of hard work, grit and perseverance. Understandably, it isn’t for everyone.” But, for those with “vision, drive and an entrepreneurial spirit” it can pay off. Reps receive “award-winning training” and 94% say the internship “helped them grow personally and professionally”, according to an internal survey.Whether the recruits were misled or simply naive is open to debate. But there is also real concern for potential clients of Northwestern, the ones promised financial advice from “expert listeners” on the company’s website.View image in fullscreenJeremy Biar poses for a portrait on 6 August 2025, in Houston, Texas.Photograph: Antranik Tavitian/The GuardianShould the largest life insurer in the US be sending students and recent graduates to sell complex financial products like they were boxes of Girl Scout cookies?Jeremy, the Texas A&M graduate, stuck with his internship despite being asked to harass his friends and family. But over the course of the internship, the office grew quieter. Without warning, interns stopped coming in. After one month, about 80% had dropped out, says Jeremy. Those left standing would simply chalk it up to the others’ inability to “make it” as an adviser.Even as numbers dwindle, Northwestern flames rivalry to keep reps dialling. “It felt like the survival of the fittest,” says Jeremy. At weekly meetings, rooms erupt with heckles, as a leaderboard ranks reps by policies sold, meetings booked and calls made. “Public shamings,” David calls them.Those who failed to hit quota look dejected, recalls former adviser Cole*, who worked at Northwestern for four years. With their eyes turned to the table, they would commit to trying harder next week, he says. The top performers were rewarded with trips, dinners and baseball tickets, he adds. Reps were also pressed to “prove conviction” by buying policies themselves, four sources said.Jeremy rapidly established himself as his class’s alpha. He wasn’t squeamish about hounding his contacts. He wasn’t earning anything close to a living wage, but his dogged approach meant hewasable to sell life insurance to seven college friends – including one $6,000-a-year plan. And that put him in a league of his own.By the end of the internship, he was the only one left standing and accepted an invitation to stay on as a full-time rep after graduation.But surviving Northwestern came at a price.You really have to choose your Northwestern career over the friendships that you used to haveJeremy Biar“You’re not making any money and you can’t afford to live. You’re either racking up debt, or you’re living with parents,” he says. “It’s easy to get pretty desperate, pretty quickly.”Financial precarity coupled with a fierce sales culture left Jeremy feeling shameless. Every interaction a friend had with him carried the risk of a sales pitch. Friday night plans became less frequent. People at his church avoided eye contact. “Most of your friends end up blocking your number,” he says.Finding himself at the margins, Jeremy dug deeper into his echo chamber. “Trust the training and direction of Northwestern,” was his mantra. Topping the leaderboard became his north star; dial, book, sell, refer and it would all work out, he told himself.“You turn into a stoic human being. You really have to choose your Northwestern career over the friendships that you used to have.”The golden goose of life insuranceWhat exactly do Northwestern want young guns like Jeremy to sell? While working as a Northwestern looks similar to a lot of insurance sales gigs, the product reps are particularly complex: whole life insurance.Whole life insurance offers lifelong coverage with fixed premiums (monthly payments). Policyholders also pay into a cash pot that generates tax-free interest (like a traditional investment account). This makes whole life policies expensive – you are paying for the policy and the pot. Monthly payments are about $440 for a healthy 30-year-old, according to industry averages.But annual returns on the cash value are underwhelming. An investment in the S&P 500 in 1990 will have grown about 3,700% while a Northwestern policy would have yielded just 44% over the same period (based on its current dividend rate of 5.5%). So, a stock market investment will have grown about 85 times more than the cash value in a whole life policy. Inflation since 1990is around 146%so the Northwestern investment would have lost value in real terms.Worse, it’s easy to lose money on these products. A Northwestern policy viewed by the Guardianshows it takes 16 years before the cash pot is greater than the premiums paid. Cancel before then, and you will net a loss.“Whole life is not terrible for everybody; it’s just terrible for mostly everybody,” says Clark Howard, a bestselling personal finance expert.One adviser, Ben*, who has been with the company for a decade, says whole life accounts for about 80% of Northwestern’s premiums, citing internal data.View image in fullscreenA logo sign on the Northwestern Mutual Tower, headquarters of Northwestern Mutual in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 22 June 2018.Photograph: Kristoffer Tripplaar/AlamyInsurers stand to make a lot of money from these policies because cancellation rates are high. Astudyby the American Economic Review found that a quarter of policies lapse within three years, reaching 40% within a decade. In those cases, the insurer owes no death benefit and has already invested the premiums. Should a customer keep the policy for life, the death benefit is substantially smaller than traditional, fixed-term life insurance.“I despise the life insurance industry,” says Howard.For agents, whole life pays a juicy first-year commission: typically 100% of the annual premium. Except, at Northwestern, reps only receive about half of this, with the rest paid out over a decade. Plus, if a customer cancels within that year, reps must pay back the commission, regardless of whether they still work there. For Jeremy, it was a high school friend. When they backed out, he had to pay $1,400 back to Northwestern. “It can screw a lot of students because the attrition rate is insane,” says Clint.The reps we spoke with claimed that the only part of financial planning they had learned about was insurance sales. A two-week training schedule from a New York office, seen by the Guardian,shows just one 30-minute session on “securities”.Twenty sources said they were told to always recommend whole life insurance. Training materials seen by the Guardian tell them to make whole life the “foundation of every plan”. This includes step-by-step pitches, one urging a hypothetical prospective client called “Briana” to commit $600 a month despite her debt and lack of dependents.“[Young kids] will believe everything they hear in training, specifically how whole life insurance is a good fit for everyone,” says former rep Steve*. “They’ll repeat it and try to sell it to everyone and anyone that they have a relationship with.” It felt like “brainwashing tactics for the young and naive”, he says.It was really painful to know that the small amount of money I was saving, I’d lostMichael DenningThey are also taught to pull on heartstrings with “personal death claim experiences”.This summer, intern Katie* was encouraged to talk about her father: a Northwestern policyholder who died a few years ago. The office director took particular interest in her, she says, and offered her a leadership role in college recruitment.“Maybe so that I could spew my own experience and try to get more people involved,” she says. “I felt a little used.”What did this focus on whole life insurance feel like for the people on the other end of the phone? At 23, Michael Denning was persuaded to buy a whole life policy from a frat friend, despite barely making ends meet at the time. “I really trusted him as a person, and so I agreed to do that,” Michael says. But a year on, he was struggling to afford the premiums, so sought out a qualified financial adviser. The advice: get out sooner rather than later. He lost about $2,400 in total.“It was really painful to know that the small amount of money I was saving, I’d lost,” he says. He has had no contact with his friend since, but holds no resentment. “I don’t believe he had any idea what he was doing.”Jeremy says ex-reps often feel shame about pushing these policies. Friends stop replying, convinced they were misled. “They’ll have close friends that won’t respond due to Northwestern coaching,” he says.One reason Northwestern might push for whole life more than its rivals, is because it is a mutual company – customers own it, instead of external shareholders. This means policyholders receive a dividend in the form of an interest rate. Guaranteeing this dividend – and growing it – is a big reason why it boasts top ratings from credit agencies. These scores and its dividend are at the heart of Northwesternbrandingitself, “the strongest company in the industry”.Whole life policies are great for growing the dividend because Northwestern can invest the cash component. Almost 90% of this year’sdividendwill be generated via whole life.In 2004, regulatorsfinedNorthwestern $1m after a trainer portrayed whole life “in an unbalanced and inappropriate way” for years without discipline. The reps the Guardian spoke to all worked at Northwestern in the years following this fine.“We believe that life insurance provides the foundation for a comprehensive financial plan. That does not mean we recommend it to every client,” a Northwestern spokesperson said.‘Insurance runs the show’It may seem like Northwestern is pushing wide-eyed students to engage in a business model that feels predatory, but in the eye of the law, it’s legal.This is partly because of the very careful way Northwestern combines its two main businesses: insurance and financial advice. Financial deregulation towards the end of the 20th century saw insurers and investment firmsoverlaptheir services. In 2000, the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company rebranded as “Northwestern Mutual”, and agents became “financial advisers”.Yet, insurance premiums still generate more than 60% of revenue. Adviser David estimates a quarter of Northwestern’s 8,000 advisers run viable financial planning businesses – the rest rely on insurance, dropping out in their first five years.“Insurance runs the show. Everything else is a facade,” says former adviser Cole. “Their commercials and recruitment process pitch financial planning like crazy, but everything internally is based on insurance, and anyone who says otherwise is lying through their teeth.”Yet reps often do not mention insurance when they call people up, presenting themselves as advisers. They say things like “I’d like to show you the type of work I do to help people achieve their goals,” and “I work with a lot of accountants and investment firms,” according to a script seen bythe Guardian.Northwestern can refer to its agents as “advisers” because it’s a marketing term that anyone can adopt; the title does not have a single legal definition in the US. But to actually sell investing advice requires certain securities licences, which legally mandate advisers to act in their client’s best interests, known as “fiduciary duty”.Only a fraction of Northwestern’s 8,000 “advisers” actually hold these licenses, filings show. Less than a third are licensed investment advisers, and onlyone in fiveholds the gold standard certified financial planner (CFP) credential.One small office listed eight staff: there are four advisers, but only two are licensed to sell investment advice. The rest are reps billed as planners, but are only qualified to sell insurance.View image in fullscreenA Northwestern Mutual location in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 2018.Photograph: Serhii Chrucky/AlamyBy referring to its contractors as “advisers,” when a client meets with a Northwestern rep, it seems as if they are credentialed to make a financial plan that will calculate the best route to retirement. In reality, they are an insurance agent making a sale.Northwestern provided a list of the licenses reps must obtain in order to use the title adviser – but regulatory filings suggest many fall short.But what if the client does get matched with one of the qualified advisers?I decided to book a call with a Northwestern adviser to find out and did not reveal I was a journalist. His email signature contained the letters “CFP” – the gold standard of certification. I could not have hoped for a better match.“Late 20s,” I said down the phone. “No dependents. Hovering just above the median New York City salary. A four-figure purse of savings which I’d like to grow.” By our second call, my financial plan flashed on the screen. Its “top recommendations” were a Roth IRA, an investment account and whole life. The last would charge an annual premium of $1,476. “I usually recommend it for our young clients,” he said.There is no circumstance when a twentysomething without kids or a spouse should buy a whole life policyClark HowardOne page of the plan shows a bar graph denoting increasing degrees of retirement planning. The first three bars are grey. The final one throws whole life into the mix, and turns blue. “100% need covered,” it read.James Dahle, author of the the White Coat Investor, a blog dedicated to helping doctors with their finances, considers the advice to be “financial malpractice”, having reviewed the graph.“There is no circumstance when a twentysomething without kids or a spouse should buy a whole life policy,” adds Howard.Howard says that if no one depends on my income, there is little need for a fast payout should I die. Plus, for a young person with limited savings but no financial obligations, any money leftover after paying into a Roth IRA should go into an investment account buying indexes.But the person on the other end of the phone was not under legal obligation to act in my best interests, despite the call being about financial advice. “There’s really zero chance that the average person is going to read through a 60-page packet and pick out where I am selling to them and where I’m acting for them,” says Brendan, a certified adviser who formerly interviewed at Northwestern. “We’re being completely compliant, but it’s problematic.”Selling students a dreamNorthwestern is not the only life insurer that has remarketed itself as financial planning. Nor is it the only one where agents are encouraged to tap their contacts for sales, and burn out fast.What distinguishes Northwestern, sources say, is how aggressively it recruits students and graduates, and how the job is presented as a pathway to becoming a financial adviser.New leads are the lifeblood of life insurance – especially whole life, which has high cancellation rates. Northwestern must keep finding more people to buy something that is hard to sell. The companywants to recruit5,000 reps and advisers this year, knowing that most will not stay long.Northwestern says about half of full-time reps drop out in year one. However, 19 sources estimated that the majority exit before then, including three advisers who said turnover was upwards of 90%.In the same way that Northwestern benefits from potential customers’ understandable confusion about the difference between insurance and financial planning, it also benefits from confusion among potential employees and interns.I have a real problem with the way that they market themselves to college students. I find it predatoryLuke WonnacottThere are more than 900 job ads currently listed on LinkedIn to work at Northwestern as a rep, which are headed as “Financial Advisor”. They gloss over insurance: of the 400-word job description in one ad, the word “insurance” appears once. Of the 250 Northwestern subsidiaries listed on student job site Handshake, less than a third are listed as insurance companies.Many life insurers use titles like “Financial Professional” to recruit agents, but the quantity of these ads on job boards are a fraction of Northwestern’s.Finding life insurance agents willing to cough up their network is not easy. Northwestern knows this. That is where college students – hungry to break into a competitive field – come in. They provide access to college-educated parents, relatives and friends who would otherwise put the phone down.The thinking is: “Let me get a bunch of people that went to this relatively prestigious university, and let me meet the wealthiest people that [they] know,” says Jeremy.“I have a real problem with the way that they market themselves to college students. I find it predatory,” says Luke Wonnacott, who applied for the internship after passing a booth in the business school of Brigham Young University in the hopes of becoming a financial adviser. Yet when he was handed the surveys requesting contact details of his network at his interview, alarm bells went off. He did not come back.View image in fullscreenLuke Wonnacott poses for a portrait at Orem Community Park in Orem, Utah, on 12 August 2025.Photograph: Niki Chan Wylie/The GuardianLuke and Jeremy both say they would not have spoken with recruiters if they knew it was insurance sales. The students attending Northwestern’s swanky recruitment dinners are all thinking, “I want to be a prestigious financial adviser,” says Jeremy. “That’s the pool of people they’re recruiting.”Northwestern recruiters also dangle six-figure salaries.Megan received a “revenue projection” during her interview, seen by the Guardian. It forecasts annual earnings of $120,000 in year one, age 24, climbing to $1m by age 32.David says his office claims average earnings of $750,000. But internal sales data, seen by the Guardian, show the top 3% of advisers in his office have collected two-thirds of this year’s premiums, as of August.“The number of people in their first five years earning a living wage is close to zero,” says David. Jeremy estimates he made $5.50 an hour, below Texas’s minimum wage at the time.When a Northwestern rep sells a policy, about half of the commission is paid out over the next decade – only if they continue to work for Northwestern. However, during their first year, reps partake in a system called “joint work”, where a more senior adviser joins their meetings to help close a deal, who they split the commission with. This is common practice in the life insurance industry but it means that Northwestern reps often see just over 25% during the first year. If reps leave, their residual commissions are absorbed by the corporate home office.These contracts are designed “to incentivize people to fail”, says Ben.During Clint’s Zoom interview, when a girl asked about the pay structure, one of the financial planners told her to “think of it like a pyramid”, he says.“What we advertise is representative of the average earnings for financial advisers who meet the expectations of the career,” a Northwestern spokesperson said. First year average earnings are $61,000 but “premiums do not represent the full picture of compensation” as reps can also earn “allowances and bonuses”, they continued.However, this figure only includes contractors who have been full-time for a consecutive calendar year (January – December), thus excluding those who may have worked partial years and those who began the year as interns.One office’s internal sales data shows that the average earnings during the first eight months of this year, among reps hired since 2024, was $20,000. Most reps we spoke to said they received a sign-up stipend of up to $2,000 – conditional on sharing contacts and booking meetings – and $1,000 for every 10 policies sold.Intern Kyle says the company’s commitment to “entrepreneurial spirit” has kept him dialing, despite making less than half of Arizona’s minimum wage. His parents moved to the US from Mexico without college degrees. They instilled in him the importance of getting an education to achieve something – learn a skill, perfect it, build a brand, but most importantly, make money. He chose finance because it sounded prestigious.“I know it’s hard work, but I’m going to continue pushing it,” says Kyle. “I can make this work out.”Becoming a Northwestern success story requires grit and charisma, reps are told. In reality, many advisers struggle to run profitable businesses, so they sign “leadership contracts” after a few years. This means earning bonuses off the sales of reps they recruit.Ben says it is often nicknamed “the darkside” among advisers. Or as David calls it: “a deal with the devil”.‘Wolves in sheep’s clothing’There is no sign Northwestern is reconsidering its business model. But some lawmakers are trying to force them to.This blurred identity – financial planner or insurance agent? – is at the core of what experts call the industry’s “two-hat syndrome”. Advisers must act in clients’ best interests when selling investments, but that duty vanishes when selling insurance. “People think they’ve hired a fiduciary, when that’s only partially true,” says personal finance expert Howard. “That’s a terrible problem.”Without stronger oversight, regulators say clients remain vulnerable. Northwestern and its affiliates have faced at least 41regulatory actions, settling all but two of them, coughing up more than $19.5m.The industry has fought to keep it that way. Since 1998, insurers have spent nearly $4bn lobbying, according toOpenSecrets. Northwestern alone spentalmost$3m last year. “They have the best lobbyists in the world,” says Georgetown professor James Angel. “They’ve forestalled federal regulation for a century.”Even reps are expected to support lobbying efforts. They receive a minute-by-minute template for how to lobby their local legislator to keep life insurance tax-deferred, internal documents show. Some describe being auto-enrolled into donations for an insurance trade group without consent, according to two sources from different states, and emails seen by the Guardian.The Department of Labor last year finalized aruleexpanding fiduciary duty to cover anyone giving retirement advice for a fee, but it has stalled amid lawsuits from trade groups. The labor department has sought multiple extensions from the court this year, as it decides whether to continue defending the rule.They have the best lobbyists in the world ... They’ve forestalled federal regulation for a centuryJames AngelCorey Frayer, director of investor protection at the consumer federation of America, says it’s “plausible” that the agency will drop it, as courts have “shifted dramatically to the right”, this year when it comes to financial deregulation.For now, the main legal challenges to Northwestern come from their customers.Susan*, a twentysomething with no kids, was contacted by a rep after someone referred her. In their meetings, the rep “aggressively” pushed whole life, she says. “I’m always looking out for your best interest, and please remember, I’m a fiduciary,” she recalls him saying.In under five years, she paid about $100,000 into insurance she later felt she was unsuitable for. Once the premiums became unaffordable, she lodged a complaint. It took her six months to recover the money.“I feel terrible that people’s lives are ruined by this, people who don’t have a support system and a lot of money,” she says. “These people are wolves in sheep’s clothing.”As a new college year begins, Northwestern offices welcome a new class of interns. But the former interns the Guardianspoke to would recommend interested students think twice.Jeremy, once the last intern standing, eventually broke too. He had sold more than 50 policies to clients which he knew often did not serve their best interest. Guilt caught up with him. Just over a year after that hopeful spring morning, he quit. He spent the next couple of years working in his church’s ministry. After slowly rebuilding trust with his community, he eventually opened his own planning practice. He estimates whatever he earned at Northwestern, the company will have since made tenfold.“You’re not going to be able to financially afford a career at Northwestern,” he says, “but also emotionally, you might not be able to afford it either.”*Use of a pseudonymExplore more on these topicsInsurance industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Towards the end Joshua Zirzkee twice directed headers that forced Jordan Pickford into flying saves but these were rare moments of potency from United. Yet again Amorim’s team were disjointed and if they are to threaten a Champions League place the head coach has much more fixing to do.If you cannot beat an opponent reduced in numbers for so long – or at least, not lose – then how can any pretensions of being contenders be taken seriously?United’s 19 goals for and 18 conceded faced off against Everton’s 12 and 13 respectively, so the hope was that this might be a thriller if not a festival of finishing. Twelve months on from his debut,a 1-1 draw at Ipswich, Amorim’s anniversary team showed six survivors – Bruno Fernandes, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo, Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt and Casemiro – as Benjamin Sesko’s knee injury gave Zirkzee a first start of the season.Moyes’s headline selection was Séamus Coleman, 37, whose last league start was in May. His welcome back was to be left a slouch by Diallo’s trickery along the left.United, too, were left facing goal when Iliman Ndiaye ran in behind along the right. His cross removed Senne Lammens from the picture but the goalkeeper was relieved to see Leny Yoro head clear.View image in fullscreenKiernan Dewsbury-Hall scores Everton’s goal after creating space to shoot.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesAnother fluid move from Moyes’s men ended with Dewsbury-Hall finding Ndiaye, who this time shot and blazed wide. Coleman’s night was ended inside 10 minutes by a problem that took him straight down the tunnel; Jake O’Brien replaced the captain.Then came bedlam fromEvertonas Gueye pressed the self-destruct button. Bryan Mbeumo burst into the area, lost the ball and, after Fernandes’s effort went wide, Gueye approached Keane, who pushed him away. One pitter-pat slap of his teammate’s cheek later and the referee, Tony Harrington, produced the red card for violent conduct, and off went the defensive midfielder, to his blushes, and the watching Stretford End’s glee. Comically, Pickford had to restrain him from having another pop at the towering Keane. Moyes later confessed to “quite liking his players fighting”.United had 77 minutes left to take advantage of their extra man, but from a corner moments later still allowed the bright Ndiaye to break downfield before Diallo, scrambling back, intervened.United were fragmented, Fernandes’s ball hoofed towards Patrick Dorgu as emblematic as Dewsbury-Hall’s opener. The Everton midfielder received in acres of space, shrugged off a sleepwalking Fernandes, made a mug of Yoro and fired a rocket past Lammens high into the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a sign of their conviction-deficit.View image in fullscreenIt was a bitterly disappointing evening for the hosts.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesDiallo’s footwork created a sight of Pickford’s goal, but the Ivorian’s attempt dribbled wide. At the break, a long-range shot from Fernandes that had Pickford airborne to save was the closest United had come to an equaliser.Amorim replaced Mazraoui with Mason Mount for the second half, Diallo going to right wing-back and the substitute taking his role. United’s possession count was roughly twice Everton’s but the quality of the display was low. Mount’s shot, blocked by James Tarkowski, and his aimless header, plus a loose Casemiro attempt, indicated those in red were at least near Everton’s goal.On 57 minutes Amorim took off Casemiro, who had been booked, for Kobbie Mainoo and Dorgu for Dalot, continuing to try to right his listing ship. At last, things got better. Mbeumo and Zirkzee combined for the former to shoot, then Mount bounced the ball marginally wide. On the sidelines, Amorim kept pointing to his temples in a “keep your cool” gesture.Yet Mbeumo’s skewered attempt and Fernandes firing over – more than once – suggested the message was not heard.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He could do with the same intensity in his retirement projectsOliver ConnollyMon 24 Nov 2025 03.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 08.42 ESTShareTom Brady played for 23 NFL seasons with a single, maniacal goal: to become the greatest quarterback who ever lived. He achieved it. Now, in retirement, Brady has dabbled in everything. Hecalls games for Fox. He’sbuilding chimneys in Birmingham. He’sflogged crypto. He’s spreadingAmerica’s Game to Riyadh. He has a thriving YouTube account. Hecloned his dog. Brady’s post-playing portfolio has been diverse, or aimless, depending on your perspective.Side hustles are one thing. But running a pro franchise is not a part-time job. Along with his other roles, Brady is also the de facto football czar of the Raiders, the most hapless team in the league.The Raiders dropped to 2–9 on Sunday after beingwaxed 24-10by the Browns. The Raiders didn’t just lose; they were embarrassed by a bad team with a quarterback making his first NFL start. The Raiders’ offense averaged 2.9 yards a play before garbage time in the fourth quarter. Geno Smith was sacked 10 times and was pressured 46 times, a single-game high for any team this season. On defense, Las Vegas gifted up chunk plays to a Cleveland offense that has been dysfunctional for most of the season. Any way you slice it, it was a beatdown. At least Brady didn’t have to watch. The architect of the latest Vegas mess was sitting in Dallas on the Fox broadcast for Eagles-Cowboys.In fairness to Brady, he has only spent one season leading the team’s football decisions, becoming a minority owner of the franchise in 2024. But he was responsible for every major decision last offseason, and all of them have backfired. Those moves have left the Raiders as the most unwatchable and directionless franchise in the league.This wasn’t supposed to be a multi-year rebuild. The Raiders didn’t hire 74-year-old Pete Carroll, one of only three coaches to win both a Super Bowl and a college national championship, to oversee a long slog back up the standings. He was supposed to return the team to relevance and then hand them off with a solid foundation in place. Instead, Carroll is staring at the possibility of being one-and-done in Vegas, and the Raiders are looking atanotherreboot.This isn’t all Brady’s fault, of course. Mark Davis is still the majority owner. Davis has churned through coaches and front-office heads at a speed that would make even the Jets blush. The Raiders are on their seventh coach and fifth general manager in 15 years, a turnover rate that has erased any coherent long-term vision. Still, it’s Brady’s fingerprints that are all overthisiteration of the Raiders. “This is the Tom Brady show,” NFL Insider Tom Pelisserosaidlast offseason. “He’s been integrally involved,” Carroll said of Brady at his introductory news conference in January. “This is his opportunity to put his stamp on a franchise.”NFL roundup: Cowboys roar back to stun Eagles as Sanders wins first Browns startRead moreBrady made the key hires and set the Raiders on this rudderless course. He hired John Spytek, his college buddy and colleague in Tampa, to serve as general manager. He greenlit a roster plan to Carroll’s preference, including trading a third-round pick for Smith and drafting a running back No 6 overall despite having a bottom-tier offensive line. He lured Chip Kelly away from the college ranks, making him the highest-paid offensive coordinator in the league, beforehe was firedafter Sunday’s loss to the Browns. And he signed off on handing a flaky offensive line – the bedrock for that coordinator and running back – toCarroll’s son.It’s been a disaster. Last season’s Raiders were a four-win team, but they were scrappy and competitive. This year’s Raiders are a confused mess. Carroll has installed an outdated defensive philosophy, Smith looks washed and the Raiders’ offensive line has submarined any hopes for Ashton Jeanty and the run game. If nothing else, Caroll was supposed to bring energy. But the Raiders were lifeless on Sunday, counting down the plays to the end of the game.The contrast with Cleveland was stark. Things are always bleak with the Browns, but there are embers of hope. Myles Garrett, now just five sacks away from theNFLsingle-season record, leads a formidable defense. And there is optimism around the stellar-looking rookie class that includes two potential stars – Quinshon Judkins at running back and Carson Schwesinger at linebacke. There is also Shedeur Sanders, who may not be The Answer at quarterback, but who is An Answer in the short-term.Granted, it was the Raiders’ defense, but Sanders showed that the stage was not too big for him. With a full week to prepare, he was solid, taking what the defense gave him and showing flashes of creativity. Sanders became the first Browns rookie quarterback to win his first start since 1995.Sanders and the rest of the Browns’ rookie class represent promise. That’s a mirror the Raiders don’t want to look into. Good organizations understand their position in the ecosystem: you’re either a contender, a frisky playoff team, or rebuilding. Vegas entered 2025 believing they were a couple of moves away from respectability. Despite the overwhelming evidence otherwise, they haven’t pivoted midstream. Like Cleveland, Vegas should be throwing out rookies to find out what they have for the future. But only two rookies have seen real playing time. There hasreportedlyalready been tension between the coaching staff and the front office regarding the lack of action for two rookie offensive linemen, despite the o-line being a sieve. Rookie receivers Jack Bech and Dont’e Thornton Jr have combined for nine catches in 11 games, despite the lack of spark in the passing game. Carroll continues to roll out grizzled vets on defense over rookies in need of reps.What is the path forward? Will Carroll be back or Spytek or Smith? And who actually makes those decisions, Brady or Davis? How can a team operate when its most powerful decision-maker logs in occasionally, signs off franchise-altering moves, and then vanishes on side quests?It’s going to be a struggle for the Raiders to improve – and they are in a division stacked with perennial playoff contenders. Meanwhile, other rebuilders have paths. The Jets are stocked with future draft picks. The Titans and Giants have promising young quarterbacks. The Raiders have nothing. No core. No quarterback. No identity. No plan.The only thing more dangerous than being bad in the NFL is not knowing you’re bad. The Raiders don’t know where they are, what they are building, or who will call the shots in the offseason.Tom Brady once mastered football through ruthless focus. The Raiders could use more than an hour of it.MVP of the weekJahmyr Gibbs, RB, Detroit Lions.The Lions survived a bananas game from Jameis Winston, as they beat the Giants 34-27 in overtime to improve to 7-4 on the season. The Giants exposed cracks throughout the Lions’ roster, but Gibbs dragged Detroit out the mud. Gibbs finished with 264 scrimmage yards and three touchdowns on just 26 touches, includinga 69-yard game-sealing score.View image in fullscreenJahmyr Gibbs was the difference between the Lions and Giants on Sunday.Photograph: Rey Del Rio/APNo one in the league moves quite like Gibbs. If you’re putting together a list of the NFL’s best pound-for-pound players, he’s right there with Garrett, Micah Parsons and Bijan Robinson. Of all the league’s backs, he may be the most complete. He can run routes like a receiver and thump between the tackles, is an explosive one-cut-and-go back and then is electric with the ball in his hands. Gibbs added to his hold over the league’s fanciest speed metrics with his overtime run, clocking in at 22.17 mph, the fourth-fastest speed of any ball carrier this season and his third time cracking 22 mph. Gibbs is now responsible for three of the four quickest plays of the season. There is juice, and there is Jahmyr Gibbs juice.Video of the weekHoly Prescott! There goes Dak rolling into the endzone to tie up the game against the Eagles after the Cowboys had trailed 21-0. The Cowboys went on to win 24-21.DAK PRESCOTT FRONT FLIPJAKE FERGUSON BLOCKWE HAVE A TIE GAMEpic.twitter.com/ql7g8m8a1D— FergSZN (@FergSZN)November 24, 2025The Eagles jumped out to a commanding lead until their offense, once again, ground to a halt. Prescott took advantage, throwing for 354 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. Those yards pushed him past Tony Romo as the franchise’s all-time leader in passing yards.Prescott takes a lot of flak for Dallas’s postseason failings, but for a fourth-round pick who played in a gimmicky, college offense, to surpass Romo and Troy Aikman as the Cowboys’ passing leader is incredible. Prescott may not dine at the same table as Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen, but he isn’t far behind the league’s best. Without him this season, the Cowboys would not be 5-5-1 with a chance to make the playoffs.Stat of the week105.TJ Watt climbed another rung up the all-time sacks ladder with the 105th of his career (he is now ranked 26th). The sack moved him past his soon-to-be Hall of Fame brother, JJ Watt in the record books. And JJ just so happened to be on the call in his new role as a CBS analyst. “This is preposterous,” JJ said. “I’m gonna put the pads back on.”The Watts are the only brothers to each record 100 or more career sacks since the stat became official, according to ESPN. “If he’s gonna pass my record, that’s one hell of a way to do it,” Watt said. “Good for you, TJ.”Elsewhere around the leagueWhy not a second stat of the week? Because this one is almost unfathomable. With 167 receiving yards against the Titans, Jaxon Smith-Njigba broke the Seahawks franchise record for receiving yards in a season. A reminder: we’re only in Week 12! And the Seahawks have already had a bye! In 11 games, Smith-Njigba has posted 80 catches for 1,313 yards and seven touchdowns. That’s more yards than DK Metcalf had in a 17-game year or Hall of Famer Steve Largent could muster in a Seahawks season. Smith-Njigba is also the only player in NFL history with 75-plus receiving yards in each of his team’s first 11 games. From a dependable player a year ago, Smith-Njigba has become the most dynamic, effective receiver in the game.View image in fullscreenJaxon Smith-Njigba had another huge day for the Seahawks.Photograph: Johnnie Izquierdo/Getty ImagesYou have to give Giants interim coach Mike Kafka credit. He took the Lions to the wall on the road, forcing overtime against a team that hasn’t lost back-to-back games since 2022. Kafka was treated to the full Jameis Winston experience. The quarterback lobbed bombs all over the field, throwing for 366 yards, two touchdowns andcatchinga touchdown on what might wind up being the mostabsurd play of the season. Winston didn’t just snag a trick play. He caught a throwback pass in the redzone and shook off a defender at the 10-yard line before walking in for the score. Kafka accepted what all interim coaches should: he’s here for a good time, not a long time. Kafka called plays like a wild man, allowed Winston to be his chaotic self and went for the jugular at the end of the game when he could have turtled up. The Giants lost, but Kafka bolstered his coaching cache.This season’s MVP is Matthew Stafford’s to lose. He threw three touchdowns in the Rams’ dominant 34-7 win over the Buccaneers on Sunday Night Football, and now has 30 for the season along with just two interceptions – and the two picks came back in September. There was concern for the Bucs as Baker Mayfield left with a sprained left shoulder injury in the first-half.He will undergo an MRI on Mondayand was replaced by Teddy Bridgewater, who hasn’t started a game since the 2022 season.What should the Vikings do with JJ McCarthy? Minnesota were hammered 23-6 by Green Bay, and the Packers could have won by a lot more. The Vikings’ second-year quarterback was frazzled – again – in a road game. He struggled to get snaps off, sacked himself on a botched snap, missed open throws and completed as many passes to his own coaching staff on the sideline as he did to his teammates in the first quarter. McCarthy was pressured on over 50% of his dropbacks, and most of those were due to his refusal to get rid of the ball. It’s hard for any team to function when their quarterback has a sundial for his internal clock. By the end of the game, McCarthy had completed 12 of his 19 pass attempts for 87 yards, with two gnarly interceptions. His advanced stat line wasbordering on Zach Wilson-ian. Coming off an extended injury in what is effectively his rookie season, sitting McCarthy for a few weeks would be in his and the franchise’s long-term interests.Explore more on these topicsNFLLas Vegas RaidersCleveland BrownsUS sportsTom BradyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.McLaren apologise to Norris, Piastri and fans for Las Vegas Grand Prix disqualificationRead moreIt is exactly the sort of proximity to set nerves jangling unnecessarily with two meetings remaining and 58 points up for grabs. Norris still holds the cards, but a single slip, an error, an unwanted contact, a mechanical failure or even another technical infringement and Verstappen could be breathing down his neck in an all or nothing season finale in Abu Dhabi.Such a prospect was unthinkable when he was 104 points behind Piastriafter the Dutch GPon the final day of August. But for the miscalculation, Norris would have gone into the next round in Qatar with a 30-point lead over Piastri and 42 over Verstappen.There were, asMcLarenargued, mitigating circumstances, albeit nothing that would change the decision. Teams want to run their cars as close to the ground as possible for aerodynamic efficiency and will push the limits. How they set up their car for this depends on the type of circuit, its speed, its surface, whether it is bumpy and how the car subsequently behaves on it. This process of learning continues as the weekend goes on until the setup is finalised before qualifying.View image in fullscreenLando Norris would have a 30-point lead over Oscar Piastri and 42 on Max Verstappen but for the error with his car.Photograph: Eric Gay/APIn Las Vegas, during second practice, vital time was lost to two stoppages and the usual race simulations were not completed, affecting information invaluable to setting up the ride height. The final practice session was wet, when cars behave aerodynamically differently to the dry, not least in not creating nearly as much downforce.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All of this added up to excessive wear and a double disqualification.They were aware, it appears, of how close they were to the edge. Late in the race, Norris was instructed to adopt a lift‑and‑coast approach to his driving, ie coming off the throttle before the end of the straights. At the time it was assumed there was a need for saving fuel, but it seems it was to minimise wear to the skid block, which the team knew to be on the limit.Norris alluded to this in the statement McLaren issued, stating the race management in the final phase of the race was because of “issues on our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified”.All of which raises awkward questions as to why McLaren got it wrong when no other team who were in the same circumstances did. This is doubly the case, given they have such a strong car and were still in such a strong position in the drivers’ championship. Had it occurred early in the season, there would have been plenty of time to rectify it. The timing was terrible, with their need to push a margin of error far less urgent than, say, for Verstappen and Red Bull, given the Dutchman was trying to claw back a 49-point deficit.Norris can still close this out. Outscoring both his rivals by two points in Doha, where 33 are on offer during the Saturday sprint race and Sunday grand prix, would seal it there. Quite how safe he and his team are feeling after this egregious fumble in Las Vegas is another question altogether.Explore more on these topicsMcLarenLando NorrisFormula One 2025Oscar PiastriFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Brazil winger did not even take kindly to being nicknamed Messinho – “Little Messi” – earlier in his career. He called the nickname “disruptive” and made clear that he had no interest in trying to be someone else. “I don’t like comparisons,” the 18-year-old told ESPN Brasil last year. “For those who don’t know how to deal with it, it’s quite disruptive. Me being Estêvão is very good.”Chelsea no doubt agree. After all, opposition defenders aside, who could possibly complain about Estêvão just being Estêvão? Not for nothing is he widely tipped to win the Ballon d’Or one day. The teenager’s talent is outrageous, his start to life in England has been better than expected and, although the obvious risk with heaping too much praise on a young prospect is that it makes them take their eye off the ball, it is telling that those who know Estêvão say one of the qualities that set him apart is his character.Frank can afford to lose at PSG but sense of foreboding now clings to SpursRead moreEnzo Maresca, Chelsea’s head coach, does not worry about the Brazilian losing focus. For Chelsea, the concern is more about protecting Estêvão from burnout as he adjusts to the physicality of the Premier League. He has made only seven starts in all competitions since his £52m move from Palmeiras last summer and goes into his first meeting with Lamine Yamal knowing there is much to prove before he can be held in the same regard as Barcelona’s 18-year-old winger.For all that Estêvão dislikes being compared to other players, the similarities with Lamine Yamal are striking. Both are left-footed, both play on the right and both love nothing more than taking a full-back to the cleaners. Both are devastating when they cut inside to deliver inswinging crosses or whip shots towards the far corner, but neither can be accused of being predictable. Estêvão, for instance, was at his creative best when he came on during Chelsea’s win against Wolves this month, driving down the outside and using his right foot to cut the ball back for João Pedro to score. Itwas an electrifying cameo.Chelsea have fallen hard for Estêvão. The fans love him and Stamford Bridge erupted when he scored his first league goal in dramatic circumstances, sliding in at the far post to bag astoppage-time winner against Liverpoollast month. This is clearly a player with an eye for the spectacular, which is why Maresca may trust him to start when Barcelona visit in the Champions League on Tuesday night.View image in fullscreenEstêvão was Chelsea’s stoppage time hero when he popped up to score the winner against Liverpool.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesDo not expect Estêvão, who has four goals for Chelsea so far, to be overawed. He is already a starter for Brazil – he scored twice for his country during this month’s international break – and would be making his 100th appearance at club level if he plays against Barça.However, it is worth remembering that Estêvão has not had as much exposure to elite competition as Lamine Yamal, despite being three months older than the Spaniard. Chelsea have not been in a rush. They agreed their deal with Palmeiras in May 2024 but allowed Estêvão to stay with the Brazilian club for another year and represent them at the Club World Cup last summer, meaning much of his football has been played in South America, where the competition is fierce but still not as demanding as in Europe.Lamine Yamal, by contrast, has been competing at the very top since the start. He turned 17 a day before he helpedSpain to beat England in the Euro 2024 final, played a starring role in Barcelona winning La Liga last season and finished second to Ousmane Dembélé in the Ballon d’Or this year.“Both of them are very special players,” said Marc Cucurella, who plays with Estêvão at club level and Lamine Yamal for Spain. “They always want the ball. The only difference is that Lamine has been playing in Europe for maybe two or three seasons and Estêvão arrived this season – but he’s doing really well. If he continues improving he can be at Lamine’s level.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The dribbles are more inventive, more bewitching, and there are times when his crosses and passing defy logic. Chelsea, though, see Estêvão developing into a playmaker capable of operating as a No 10 and will also note that there have been questions about Lamine Yamal’s behaviour away from the pitch this season. Cucurella touched on that, saying there may have been hints of the Barça star “perhaps being a little more distracted”.There was, of course, controversy around Lamine Yamal withdrawing from the Spain squad this month. Injuries have taken a toll. A groin problem has troubled Lamine Yamal, although he looked back to his best when he produced two assists during Barcelona’s 4-0 win against Athletic Bilbao last Saturday.It falls to Cucurella to keep his international teammate quiet on Tuesday night. It is a tall order but Chelsea will back themselves. Barcelona are brilliant in attack but they give up chances anddrew 3-3 with Club Bruggein their previous Champions League game. Maresca, who said Cole Palmer is back in training as he recovers from a broken toe, will think about how to target the Spanish side’s high line.Making use of Estêvão’s wizardry on the right is one way to go. Chelsea will back him to outshine Lamine Yamal. The background checks were thorough when they were scouting him. They loved his talent but they also loved the youngster’s family. Estêvão, the son of a pastor, has been brought up well. It is why he does not care too much about measuring himself against others.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaBarcelonafeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least not yetRead moreGuardiola said: “I apologised. I feel embarrassed, ashamed, when I see it. I don’t like it. I apologised after one second to the cameraman. I am who I am.After 1,000 gamesI’m not a perfect person, I make huge mistakes.“What is for sure, I defend any team and my club. The reason why I want to defend my team and my club is because from my experience to win the Premier League we have to do 100 points, 98 points, otherwise we don’t win it.”City are third and trail the leaders, Arsenal, by seven points after their fourth league defeat of the season. “Losing four games out of 12 we have to improve a lot,” Guardiola said. “Mathematically, it’s possible to win everything.”Asked if this meant the ­quadruple was a realistic aim he said: “You are an experienced journalist, did you hear my talk about the ­quadruple in December when we won the ­quadruple? No.”Regarding his confrontation with Guimarães Guardiola said: “We have known Bruno for many years and every time after the game, even at the Etihad [Stadium], we talk in the tunnel or wherever.“Our paths always cross and I always have a good relationship with him. I love it. I’m an emotional guy, I love to talk and move my hands and my arms and everything.”Guardiola would not be concerned if an opposition manager spoke to his players immediately after a game. “As long as you talk with respect like I always have done, it’s not a problem,” he said, before ­referencing Barrott. “The referee was involved for 95 minutes, 98 minutes, he was involved. My God, he was involved.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of Billups’ co-defendants are also charged with running an illegal gambling business and engaging in an extortion conspiracy.Billups’s attorney, Chris Heywood, has said his client is a “man of integrity” and denies the charges.“To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his Hall of Fame legacy, his reputation and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game,” Heywood said after Billups appeared in federal court in Portland, Oregon, when prosecutors first announced the indictment on 23 October.Billups wore a dark gray suit during Monday’s brief arraignment and spoke only to answer the judge’s yes or no questions. He has been free on bond since his initial court appearance in Oregon.Billups was arguably the most prominent nameamong more than 30 chargedin last month’s sprawling federal takedown of illegal gambling operations linked to professional sports. The other defendants were also expected to appear in the Brooklyn court for Monday’s proceedings, in which the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers will probably discuss next steps in the case.The NBA jumped into bed with gambling. Now the league is getting its dueRead moreProsecutors say the 49-year-old Denver native, who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame last year, was involved in a scheme to rig mafia-backed illegal poker games in Manhattan, Las Vegas, Miami and the Hamptons.FormerNBAplayer and assistant coach Damon Jones was also arrested in the alleged scheme, which prosecutors say utilized a range of sophisticated technology that allowed the gambling to be rigged, such as altered card-shuffling machines, hidden cameras in poker chip trays, special sunglasses and even X-ray equipment built into the table to read cards.Jones was also chargedalong with Miami Heat guard Terry Rozierin a separate scheme at the same time that allowed gamblers to exploit insider information about players to win bets on NBA games.Prosecutors say the poker scheme Billups was involved in defrauded victims of an estimated $7m, starting in at least 2019. They say he served as a celebrity “face card” who could draw wealthy, unsuspecting players to the games. Prosecutors said during one game, the scheme’s organizers exchanged messages saying one of the victims “acted like he wanted Chauncey to have his money” because he was “starstruck.”Prosecutors say Billups, who earned about $106m from his playing days, received a portion of the profits from the scheme. After one rigged game in October 2020, for example, they say he was wired $50,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he is perhaps most beloved in Detroit, where he earned the nickname “Mr Big Shot” for his knack for making clutch plays.Billups was named the NBA Finals MVP during the Pistons’ title run in 2004 and had his No 1 jersey retired by the team. After retiring in 2014, Billups embarked on a career as a TV analyst before pivoting to coaching.He was hired as Portland’s coach in 2021 and signed a multiyear extension with the Trail Blazers earlier this year after the team missed out on the playoffs for the fourth straight season in 2024. Billups previously served as an assistant coach on the Los Angeles Clippers. After his arrest, he was placed on unpaid leave and the Trail Blazers named assistant coach and former NBA player Tiago Splitter as interim coach.Explore more on these topicsNBAGamblingMafiaBasketballPortland Trail BlazersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the Cowboys’ first game at AT&T Stadium since the death of defensive end Marshawn Kneeland.The Eagles (8-3) are still in good shape to be the first repeat winners in the NFC East since they won four in a row from 2001-04, but the offense reverted to the form that has frustrated AJ Brown after the star receiver had a big hand in the 21-0 lead early in the second quarter. Philadelphia lost with a lead of at least 21 points for the first time since 1999, when Arizona beat the Eagles 25-24. It was the first win for Dallas when trailing by three touchdowns since the Cowboys beat the Rams 34-31 in 2014.Indianapolis Colts 20-23 Kansas City Chiefs (OT)Patrick Mahomes threw for a season-high 352 yards, Kareem Hunt ran for 104 yards and a touchdown, and Harrison Butker’s fifth field goal of the game gave the Kansas City Chiefs a come-from-behind overtime victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Rashee Rice had eight catches for 141 yards, including two crucial ones on the Chiefs’ tying touchdown drive in regulation and another in overtime, after Kansas City (6-5) had forced the high-powered Colts (8-3) to punt on a fourth consecutive three-and-out. Butker ended the game with a 27-yard field goal with just under two minutes left in overtime, keeping the Chiefs’ playoff hopes alive.New York Giants 27–34 Detroit Lions (OT)The Detroit Lions (7-4) avoided losing consecutive games for the first time in more than three years. Jahmyr Gibbs ran for a 69-yard touchdown on the first snap of overtime after Jake Bates matched a career high with a 59-yard field goal in the final minute of regulation, lifting the Lions to victory. New York (2-10) had a chance to extend the game, but turned the ball over on downs at the Detroit 31 when Aidan Hutchinson sacked Jameis Winston. The Lions entered the game out of the playoff picture and trailed by double digits multiple times. Gibbs had a career-high 264 yards from scrimmage and three scores.Cleveland Browns 24–10 Las Vegas RaidersIn his first careerNFLstart, highly publicized rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders did just enough to push the Cleveland Browns (3-8) to their first road win of the season with a victory over the Las Vegas Raiders (2-9). Sanders mostly stayed out of trouble in his debut, completing 11 of 20 for 209 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The 23-year-old threw his first career touchdown pass with 8:18 remaining in the fourth quarter, connecting with running back Dylan Sampson on a screen pass that Sampson promptly ran 66 yards into the end zone. The star of the show throughout Sunday’s game, however, was Cleveland’s defensive front. The Browns tallied 10 sacks, completely stifling a Raiders offense that has struggled to find a rhythm all season.Tampa Bay Buccaneers 7-34 Los Angeles RamsThe Los Angeles Rams (9-2) remain the No 1 seed in the NFC after a comfortable win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday Night Football. MVP favorite Matthew Stafford had another superb game, throwing for 273 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions. The Bucs lost their third game in a row and their 6-5 record puts them in a tie with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the NFC South. There was a scare for Tampa Bay as Baker Mayfieldsprained his shoulderin the first half and was replaced by Teddy Bridgewater. Mayfield will have an MRI on Monday.Pittsburgh Steelers 28–31 Chicago BearsCaleb Williams and the Chicago Bears didn’t have to face their old nemesis Aaron Rodgers, who missed the game with a broken wrist, to come away with a win. The longtime Packers QB has a 25-5 career record against the Bears. Williams threw for three touchdowns and the Bears beat the Steelers. Chicago won for the eighth time in nine games to improve to 8-3. After rallying in the final two minutes the previous three weeks, the Bears held onto a late lead this time. The Steelers fell to 6-5 and into a first-place tie with Baltimore in the AFC North.The NFL says Jameis Winston is a ‘national treasure’. The NFL is very wrong | Melissa JacobsRead moreNew England Patriots 26–20 Cincinnati BengalsDrake Maye passed for 294 yards an the AFC-leading New England Patriots (10-2) extended their winning streak to nine, defeating the Cincinnati Bengals (8-3). Hunter Henry had a career-high 115 yards receiving. The Patriots rallied from a 10-0 deficit in the second quarter. Andy Borregales kicked a 52-yard field goal to give New England the lead with 1:51 remaining. Cincinnati’s Joe Flacco drives to the Patriots 26 but failed on a fourth-down pass. The Bengals have lost eight of nine since Joe Burrow’s injury. Burrow is expected to return on Thanksgiving against Baltimore.Seattle Seahawks 30–24 Tennessee TitansSam Darnold threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns and the Seattle Seahawks (8-3) beat the Tennessee Titans (1-10) for their fifth win in six games. Darnold bounced back with a clean game after being picked off four times last week. The Seahawks also held on to the first wildcard spot in the NFC playoff chase. Rookie Cam Ward tried to rally the Titans. He found Chimere Dike with a one-yard TD pass with 43 seconds left, giving the NFL’s worst-scoring team a season high in points and one final chance. The Titans touched the onside kick too soon and Seattle finished off the win.New York Jets 10-23 Baltimore RavensDerrick Henry scored two third-quarter touchdowns,and the Baltimore Ravens recovered from a sleepy first half to beat the New York Jets for their fifth straight victory. Baltimore have gone from 1-5 to 6-5, but this was not a particularly convincing performance. Lamar Jackson went 13 of 23 for 153 yards and did not look as mobile as usual after dealing with knee and ankle issues recently. Henry was held to 64 yards on 21 carries. Tyrod Taylor started in place of the benched Justin Fields and threw for 222 yards with a touchdown and had a late interception for the Jets (2-9).Jacksonville Jaguars 27–24 Arizona Cardinals (OT)Trevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes, Cam Little kicked a 52-yard field goal in overtime and the Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4) overcame a turnover-filled performance to beat the Arizona Cardinals (3-8). Jacksonville got the ball first in overtime and after a promising drive stalled, Little made a 52-yarder with 7:46 left. He set an NFL record with a 68-yard field goal earlier this season. Arizona had a chance to tie or win, but Jacoby Brissett’s fourth-down heave to Xavier Weaver fell incomplete. The Cardinals elected to go for it instead of attempting a 60-yard field goal. Jacksonville have won three of their last four. Arizona has lost eight of nine.Minnesota Vikings 6-23 Green Bay PackersEmanuel Wilson rushed for a career-high 107 yards and two touchdowns in his first career start and the Green Bay Packers (7-3-1) defeated the Minnesota Vikings (4-7). Green Bay’s Micah Parsons and Devonte Wyatt each had two sacks. The Vikings totaled four net yards and three turnovers in the second half. Wilson had two one-yard touchdown runs while filling in for the injured Josh Jacobs. His 28 carries and 107 yards rushing represented the highest single-game totals by any Packers running back this season.Atlanta Falcons 24–10 New Orleans SaintsKirk Cousins passed for two touchdowns and the visiting Atlanta Falcons ended a five-game losing streak by defeating the New Orleans Saints. Cousins completed 16 of 23 passes for 199 yards for the Falcons (4-7) as he filled in for Michael Penix Jr, who suffered a season-ending knee injury last week. Tyler Shough passed for 243 of the 293 total yards for the Saints (2-9), who did not score an offensive touchdown.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

At least not yetEberechi Eze’s hat-trick and Manchester City’s loss to Newcastle means Arsenal are in control of their own destinySign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 24 Nov 2025 10.40 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 14.34 ESTShareSo it turns out those who had already handed the title to Arsenal were right after all.It’s absurd, of course, to start handing out the title in November but a feature of modern football is how obsessed it becomes so early with title races. It’s perhaps a legacy of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp rivalry’s peak, when being champion meant amassing more than 95 points. It made sense then to scan the track far ahead for any potential hurdles because there were so few. But less than a third of the way through this season, Manchester City, who remain probably the biggest danger to Arsenal, have already dropped as many points as they did in the entirety of 2017-18, their 100-point campaign.Arsenal 4-1 Tottenham: player ratings from the north London derbyRead moreIt’s perhaps also because Arsenal’s yearning for a title is so great, having failed to win one since 2004. In that, they were perhaps unfortunate that their first serious post-Arsène Wenger title challenge came in 2022-23 when perceptions were distorted by the winter World Cup. When the league resumed they were seven points clear at the top of the table and it felt like a run-in, even though there was still more than half a season to play. That contributed to an emotionally fraught atmosphere that seemed in part to lie behind the weird collapses against Liverpool and West Ham in games they had been dominating, and the loss of their lead.The longer the run-in, which in football is almost entirely a psychological state, the more it favours the pursuer. The biggest threat to Arsenal this season, perhaps, is that awareness of the prize and how close it may be induces a needless and debilitating anxiety. Yet the fact remains that this was an extremely good weekend for them. It’s not just that Arsenalwon the north London derbywith such ease, it’s thatManchester CityandLiverpoolslipped up again and look incapable of applying the sort of pressure that might unnerve Mikel Arteta’s side.Thelate concession of an equaliserat Sunderland two weeks ago had brought the first check on Arsenal’s optimism, particularly when it was followed byCity’s demolition of Liverpool. Given how good Arsenal had been, how inconsistent City had seemed, the fact that the gap was only four points seemed a rebuke to the narrative that had been building that Arsenal might be starting to run away with it. After City’s defeat at Newcastle, that gap is back up to seven points, which feels far more representative. Arsenal have been much better than City. Approaching a third of the way through the season they have been much better than everybody.With Bayern to come on Wednesday in the Champions League and then Chelsea next Sunday, this could have been a challenging week. The draw at Sunderland had ended their run of 10 straight wins. Gabriel, one of their most important players, was out with an adductor injury (and will probably be for at least the next couple of weeks). Had they somehow lost to a Spurs side who have been much better away than at home under Thomas Frank, they could conceivably have lost the lead in thePremier Leagueto Chelsea next Sunday, while playing a team they have lost to 5-1 three times since they last beat them in between.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spurs may argue with some legitimacy that Eberechi Eze’s first goal should have been ruled out for offside (the regulation on what it is to be interfering with a goalkeeper is another than has only been confused by attempts to define it more precisely) but equally this was a game in which they were very fortunate to get away with a three-goal defeat: Arsenal hammered them.After a season dominated by talk of Arsenal’s set-piece excellence, this was a game won by their brilliance in open play, first by Mikel Merino’s deft pass to Leandro Trossard, and then by Eze’s blend of power, grace and trickery. If the absence of Gabriel was noticed, it was only perhaps in the fact that they didn’t score from a set play; Piero Hincapié fitted in perfectly alongside William Saliba in central defence. Spurs, it’s true, presented very little threat, but the match confirmed the notion that Arsenal have put together, by some distance, the deepest and most coherent squad in the Premier League.Can anything stop them? Of course. There are still 26 games to play. Misfortune can happen, doubts can set in. Football history is littered with unlikelydei ex machinafrom scandal to injuryto dodgy lasagne. But nothing that’s been seen in the Premier League this season so far can stop them. Liverpool, surely, are gone now, too far adrift and too scrambled in their own minds. Perhaps Chelsea or City could put together a run that might make this a contest, but Arsenal look remorseless. They don’t let in goals and they can score from open play or set pieces.

After Gueye’s red card, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s 29th-minute strike proved the winner as United lost for a first time in the competition at home after an opponent was reduced to 10 men.Everton brush off bizarre Gueye red card to beat lethargic Manchester UnitedRead moreGueye’s marching orders came after he approached Keane, was pushed away, and then slapped the defender on the cheek, causing the referee, Tony Harrington, to send him off for violent conduct. Gueye later apologised to his teammates.Moyes said: “I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn’t do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.“If nothing happened [no red card], I don’t think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised. I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it. I was told that [by] the rules of the game that if you slap your own player, you could be in trouble.“I’m disappointed we got the sending off. But we’ve all been footballers, we get angry with our teammates. He’s apologised for the sending off, he’s praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised.”Defeat ended United’s five-game unbeaten run.Ruben Amorim­echoed Moyes’s sentiment. The head coach said: “Fighting is not a bad thing. Fighting doesn’t mean that they don’t like each other. Fighting is that you lose the ball [so] I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was how I felt when I watched. And I don’t agree with the sending off.”United remain on 18 points, two behind Crystal Palace in fifth place, which may again be enough to seal a Champions League place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Quite apart from the official warnings about rampant pickpocketing, street crime and potential football‑related violence, their phones seem full of concerned messages from families and friends.Those oft-repeated exhortations to variously “take care”, “watch yourself” and “stay safe” in a city listed regularly among Europe’s most dangerous could, in a different context, easily apply to Eddie Howe’s team.Harvey Barnes double helps Newcastle derail Manchester City revivalRead moreAlthough Newcastle arrived in the south of France on Monday fresh from their restorative 2-1 homePremier League win against Manchester Cityon Saturday, and having beaten Union Saint-Gilloise, Benfica and Athletic Bilbao in the Champions League, their sole away victory since early April came in Brussels at Union SG.Not that Howe was overly keen to discuss the psychological aspect of this travel sickness. “TheChampions Leagueis different to Premier League games,” said a manager whose team are sixth in the European table, with nine points from a possible 12 and automatic progression to the knockout phase almost within touching distance. “I don’t know if you can compare them.”Perhaps not, but he and Newcastle’s players will, intriguingly, renew acquaintance here with a raft of faces familiar from past English encounters. If the Marseille manager, Roberto De Zerbi, once of Brighton, needs no introduction, nor does Mason Greenwood.The former Manchester United and England forward departed the UK last year under awell‑documented cloud. He had faced charges, which he denied, of attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault, but the Crown Prosecution Serviceannounced in February 2023that the case had been discontinued. Greenwood is Ligue 1’s leading scorer in an attack also featuring the Arsenal old boy Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang.“Greenwood is a very clever attacker from the wide right for Marseille,” Howe said. “He’s not just a goalscorer, he’s also a goal creator. They use him in a clever way – he does his most dangerous work when he drifts infield. He combines well with the players around him and he’s got a lovely left foot. We’ll have to defend well down that side of the pitch. I’d say it’s a big area for Marseille to attack.”Meanwhile Aubameyang’s penalty-area reflexes still look razor sharp. “We’ve said that, having watched Marseille a lot in the buildup to the game, Aubameyang’s as good as ever,” Howe said.“That’s a big compliment to him at 36. He’s very athletic, still running in behind, still stretching backlines, still getting away from defenders when he’s in those one-v-one situations and a lethal finisher as well. His goal record here has been very good. He’s another player we have to control well.”View image in fullscreen‘Greenwood is a very clever attacker for Marseille,’ Howe said. ‘They use him in a clever way – he does his most dangerous work when he drifts infield.’Photograph: Sébastien Nogier/EPADe Zerbi’s midfield includes the England midfielder Angel Gomes, who played alongside Greenwood at Manchester United’s academy, and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, formerly of Southampton and Tottenham.Further back are the former Burnley defender CJ Egan-Riley and De Zerbi’s captain, the Argentina centre-half Leonardo Balerdi. Howe gave serious consideration to signing Balerdi in the summer, before buying the hugely impressive Malick Thiaw from Milan.Although Marseille’s form in the Champions League has been mixed and their hopes of reaching the knockout phase for the first time since 2011-12 remain in the balance, De Zerbi’s side sit second in Ligue 1, two points adrift of the leaders, Paris Saint-Germain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is part of the punishment that Marseille, who were also heavily fined, received after their supporters threw flares and projectiles at Atalanta fans and used lasers during a recent 1-0 home Champions League defeat.In late September fears of violence prompted France’s interior ministry to bar Ajax fans from the Stade Vélodrome before the Dutch side’s 4-0 defeat. Although Newcastle supporters were permitted to travel they are subject to strict policing that includes a ban on wearing club colours and avoiding the city’s popular Old Port area.If those supporters may, for once, benefit from turning anonymous, Howe hopes his players will display what he believes are their true colours. “Lack of consistency has been a problem,” he said. “We’ve played well in one-off games but we’re looking to recapture the feeling you have when you know you are going to perform well.“We had that for a long time but, for the first time since I’ve been Newcastle manager, we don’t know how we’re going to play. We have to build our confidence to be able to do that and these games will be the acid test for us. Marseille will be really tough but we think we can rise to the challenge.“We have a lot of questions we have to answer of ourselves over the next two games – here at Marseille and at Everton on Saturday.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweMarseilleChampions LeagueEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ll decide tomorrow if he starts or not. But I’m happy to have him in our team.“I followed him his whole career, I was impressed with his quality, what he’s doing in the box in front of the opponent’s goal. He has shown it in Barcelona. Also for him this change to live in another culture, with fantastic people, nice weather, it’s amazing. We can see now he’s also smiling a lot. If he can enjoy the atmosphere we have it’s also very good.”Barcelona are aboveChelseaon goal difference after taking seven points from their first four games in the league phase. The Spanish champions have travelled to London without Pedri but have been boosted by the Brazil winger Raphinha returning to fitness.Much of the focus is on whether Estêvão Willian, Chelsea’s 18-year-old Brazilian winger, can outshine Lamine Yamal. Marc Cucurella knows Lamine Yamal well and joked that he has been preparing for the task of marking his international teammate by upping the intensity on the training ground. “I tell Estêvão to put shin pads on in training,” the Chelsea left-back said.Chelsea will be without Cole Palmer, who is wearing a protective bootafter breaking a toe in an accident at home last week. The playmaker is back in training but Enzo Maresca said that Palmer is unlikely to be fit to face Arsenal on Sunday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even in the best of times, nobody would have expected much from Tottenham there. With two wins and two draws from four matches they can afford to lose this one.Arsenal’s Premier League dominance is not under threat. At least not yetRead morePlainly, a heavy defeat would be less than ideal given Spurs have been bad more often than good since the end of September after anencouraging start to Frank’s tenure. He and the players will see an opportunity to take steps, whether big or small, towards what they believe is their true level. They will remember how they pushed PSG all the way in the Uefa Super Cup at the start of the season, losing on penalties.What is casting the long shadows and sending chills everywhere, is the home game against Fulham on Saturday. Teams are supposed to prefer playing on their own turf, but it is a long way from looking like the case for Spurs, certainly in the Premier League, the competition that matters the most in the boardroom, the one that dictates the manager’s job security.It was not Frank’s fault that he inherited a squad that had won two, drawn three and lost nine of the previous 14 home league games under Ange Postecoglou. It is on him that he has failed to drive any discernible improvement. His record reads: W1 D2 L3.The low point came in the1-0 defeat against Chelseaat the beginning of November when the players were booed off. They were creatively bankrupt, their expected goals of 0.05 the lowest of any team in the league this season. It was 0.07 at Arsenal, the second-lowest.There would be more well‑documented boos from the stands in the next home league gameagainst Manchester United a week later; for Richarlison when he played a loose pass, for Frank when he substituted Xavi Simons. After a wild finale, it ended 2-2.Between times, there was the4-0 Champions League win there against Copenhagenand an episode that went largely under the radar but feels instructive, an emblem of the Temple of Grumbling. When the Tottenham substitute Dane Scarlett won a stoppage-time penalty, the South Stand wanted him to take it. Instead, Richarlison grabbed the ball in his trademark elbows-out style. He was the designated taker so why not?Boos for Richarlison came from the South Stand. Did it affect him as he went through his mental preparations? It is unclear. But he did miss. It mattered not, because the game was long since over. It was, nevertheless, extraordinary.View image in fullscreenFrank was asked if he had seen enough fight in his team. ‘In those duels we didn’t win enough,’ he said. ‘If that’s a lack of fight … we just didn’t do it well enough.’Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThe Fulham game will be Tottenham’s first at home since United and, at this distance, it is one that Frank desperately needs to win. At the very least, he needs a performance, something in attacking terms, because too often his team have failed to fire. In the1-0 home defeat against Bournemouthat the end of August, they recorded an xG of 0.19.It must be noted that Frank has been without the injured Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison all season and Dominic Solanke for pretty much all of it. He has tried every combination of his other attacking players, the impression being that he is groping for, and failing to find, the right blend.Mohammed Kudus (who has been generally bright), Brennan Johnson, Simons, Wilson Odobert, Mathys Tel and Randal Kolo Muani have five league goals between them. Richarlison has five himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eberechi Eze scored a fairytale hat‑trick and might have had four or five. What made it so bad for Frank was the optics of his switch to a 5-4-1 formation. When he went back to 4-3-3 for the second half, his team were 2-0 down.Brilliant Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thump Spurs to extend lead in title raceRead moreOnly once previously had Frank started with a back five – against PSG in the Super Cup, which he described as a “special operation”, a move necessitated partly by having had only six weeks to work with the players. If the Spurs support are going to see their team lose, they would prefer it if they threw a few punches.As an aside, Frank’s decision to drop Pedro Porro for the second time was a huge call. The full-back is an extremely popular member of the dressing room.The lack of creativity, the absence of options on the ball, felt like the biggest problem. To Frank, it was not so. As he picked over the wreckage, he had more urgent worries. The lack of aggression – in the duels and the press. The inability to get close to Arsenal’s players. The failure to force turnovers high up.Frank was asked whether he had seen enough fight in his team. “We were 100% too far from them in these duels we wanted to create or getting pressure, getting close,” he said. “In those duels, we didn’t win enough of them. If that’s a lack of fight, a lack of whatever it is … we just didn’t do it well enough.”It was a typically honest answer, but utterly damning. The Spurs manager has his work cut out to spark a reaction from his players.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankParis Saint-GermainChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Under the arrangement, priority for any loans will be given to developing nations.Extortionate tickets and matches moved at Trump’s whim: are you ready for the ‘greatest World Cup ever’? | Marina HydeRead moreIn a statement Fifa said that the new partnership would seek to “support national governments in designing, financing, and building modern multi-sport venues”.The Fifa president,Gianni Infantino, said the funding was needed to build the kind of stadiums that would enable countries to stage Fifa-approved tournaments. “Many of our Fifa member associations need additional support for the infrastructure necessary to host competitions,” he said. “This agreement is a crucial step in ensuring our Fifa member associations have the facilities to make football truly global.”The arrangement is only the latest addition to a burgeoning relationship between Fifa and Saudi Arabia. The Gulf state will host the men’s World Cup in 2034, while its state-owned oil company, Aramco, became a “major worldwide partner” of Fifa last year in a four-year arrangement.The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), meanwhile, was an official partner at this summer’s Club World Cup, while its spin-off company, Surj Sport Investment, bought a $1bn stake in the streamer Dazn after it had itself paid $1bn to acquire the exclusive global rights to the Club World Cup. Last week, when a Saudi delegation visited Washington for meetings with the US president, Donald Trump, Infantino was part of the group that accompanied Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House.Fifa is a not-for-profit organisation and, in a recent letter to the Guardian, its director of media, Bryan Swanson said: “The revenue [Fifa] generates is reinvested to fuel the growth of football – men, women, youth – throughout Fifa’s 211 member associations globally. Fifa already distributes millions of dollars of its funds to its member associations each year under the Fifa Forward programme. This money is largely used to cover the running costs of associations and for developing participation at a national level, however, and it is understood that a different scale of funding was deemed necessary for the development of stadiums, and national stadiums in particular.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reasons for the ridicule were plentiful: the increasingly morose press conferences that led to Nuno Espírito Santo’s dismissal; the infamous Morgan Gibbs-White “hostage video”, where he assured viewers he was being treated well while looking scared in the shadow of an angry Greek man; and the brief, inevitably hilarious reign of managerial shoegazer, Ange Postecoglou. Forest seemed determined to corner the market in amusing, memeable content, long before Scotland offered a different, more heartwarming source of material last week.Given the amount of ridicule their beloved club endured earlier in the campaign, Forest fans could be forgiven for expecting that, now the team have finally found their footing, the sound of folk tittering at their expense would be replaced by an appreciative hum of well-deserved praise. Alas, as is invariably the case when an exalted team of odds-on favourites are humbled by supposedly inferior opposition, almost all of the post-match analysis has focused on the myriad shortcomings of the losers, rather than anything commendable the team who embarrassed them might have achieved. In the two days sinceForest thumped Liverpool at Anfield, Football Daily has heard no end of understandable chatter about the reigning champions’lack of form, fight andleadershipas they slumped to their sixth defeat in seven league games but very little in the way of plaudits for the impressive manner in which Nottingham Forest dealt the latest hammer blow to a title defence that already looks bludgeoned well beyond any chance of repair.“I told the players: ‘We’re not passing it, we are going long, because Liverpool were going to press the life out of you’ – which is exactly what they did at the start,” said Sean Dyche, of the nuanced approach he took to a game most people expected his side to lose despite Liverpool’s current woes. “We dealt with that quite well and we mixed it tactically, which is credit to the players.” Despite Forest losing just one match out of five since Big Ange left the club, Dyche refused to get carried away with his side’s emphatic win over Liverpool and insisted the performance was just another “small step” in the process of coaching the Ange out of Forest’s players and reminding them of the basics they were so good at before the arrival of a flamin’ Australian whose famously high line and all-out attacking style could scarcely have been less suited to the strengths of this Forest team. “Every manager has a different style and I have mine,” said Dyche. “I’ve been doing this a long time in the Premier League, I know the stats, the facts and the analysis of games but what you need is a team.” And that is how they play, mate.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Michael Butler at 8pm GMT for red-hot updates on Manchester United 2-2 Everton.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I apologise.

Eder Sarabia had just watched his side, runners-up insegundalast season, score as many in one night as Madrid had allowed in five; seen a team who hadn’t won since September and a club who hadn’t beaten Madrid since the 1970s get a 2-2 draw against league leaders who had only dropped points twice; and witnessed his men match a monster with a budget 19 times bigger, subs more expensive than all of Elche’s players ever, and a left-back whose cost could cover his entire club for a year. But was he happy?European football: Jude Bellingham snatches late draw for Real Madrid at ElcheRead more“No,” Sarabia replied. “No, I’m not happy. I’m not happy at all. I just told the players that I’m pissed off. And now that I have had a look at the plays, I’m even more pissed off.”Because after a result like this the usual headline says “Elche hold Madrid” but Elche hadn’theldMadrid at all, Sarabia’s sense of injustice not limited to the officials. Instead, they had let it slip. Twice they had led; twice Xabi Alonso’s side had equalised, both of them scrappy, scrambled finishes from dead balls. The first, via a corner on 78 minutes, had been assisted by Jude Bellingham’s arm and scored by Dean Huijsen. The second from a free-kick that wasn’t a foul in the first place, blown as Elche were breaking in search of a third, had seen Vinícius run into Iñaki Peña, the ball escape across the line, Kylian Mbappé pull it back and Bellingham score in the 87th minute, while the goalkeeper, unable to react, was left lying there with a bloody nose.Cotton wedged in his nostril, Peña initially said it was just one of those things afterwards, part of the game, but his coach insisted he would change his mind when he saw the replay, which pretty much guaranteed that he would do exactly that, the story a little different by the time the goalkeeper turned up in the press room. As for Sarabia, he was furious: the foul was “absolutely clear,absolutelyclear … and that’s what VAR is for,” he said. Which was when he stopped and said something more important: “I don’t want to talk about the referee; I want to talk about the great game from my team.”To which of course the obvious response here is: “Yeah, good luck with that one” what with just about everyone more interested in controversy and crisis, in Alonso’s team and not his. But Sarabia was right, and actually: let’s.When Alonso was asked for an explanation he said “football”, and Elche played all of it. Madrid were dreadful, it is true, but they were superb, the tone set by Álvaro Núñez dribbling out from his own goal-line after 10 minutes and seen in Peña nonchalantly curling a pass beyond Vinícius, feeling none of the nerves fans do. It was there in the high press that gave Rafa Mir the first of two brilliant chances, both saved by Thibaut Courtois, and the bravery that underlined everything they did. It was there in André Silva alone in the area, another opportunity lost, and at the half-time whistle going at 0-0 with Elche feeling they could have been a couple up – even if they could have been a couple down too, Peña making two saves from Mbappé. And it was certainly there in the final whistle going at 2-2, history made a little unhappily.View image in fullscreenElche’s Eder Sarabia was left wanting more after the final whistle.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was there in them reacting to Madrid’s substitutions – Fede Valverde, Vinícius and Eduardo Camavinga – and the first equaliser on 77 minutes not by building a wall and defending desperately but keeping the ball. Going back for more too, Álvaro Rodríguez running at the defence, turning Raúl Asencio left and right and beating Courtois from 20 yards. Above all, it had been shown in the opening goal: 22 passes, the second-longest goalscoring sequence this season and the longest against Madrid in almost a decade, concluded with a gorgeous back-heel from Germán Valera and Aleix Feibas nudging in. “An extraordinary goal; how we played out, created overloads, applied pause, set it up and finished,” in Sarabia’s words, it was a portrait of Elche’s play, and that was the point. This was no one-off; it was everything they are supposed to be. Which isn’t the way a newly promoted team are supposed to be.Sarabia was Quique Setién’s assistantat Las Palmas,Real Betisandmost famously at Barcelona, where his bullishness wasn’t always well received. The son of former Athletic Club striker Manu Sarabia – he and Alonso’s fathers played against each other back in 1979 – Eder had run the fruit counter at the supermarket, studied the music and engineering, is a cycling obsessive who rides everywhere and reachedterceraas a player for Arenas de Getxo and SD Leioa. But he always knew he wanted to be a coach. He also knew how he wanted to coach, what he wanted his team to be like. And that was like this.It didn’t matter thathe was at Andorrain Segunda B or at Elche insegunda, his team was going to play. Having won promotion at Elche, as he had at Andorra, they were going to play inprimeratoo. In the simplest terms, the way Sarabia puts it the idea is: “When we haven’t got the ball we want it back and when we have we want to know what for.”When Elche secured promotion, Sarabia started watching top-flight teams, attention trained particularly on those they could learn from: Girona, Rayo, Celta, Barcelona. One of the conclusions, that the quality of players was precisely the reason why some first division teams were not as well worked; one of the others was while most sides change when they go up, motivated by fear, there was no need. In a phrase: ‘“I need to be defensive now’… sod that.” He asked players what they were afraid of – don’t ignore those doubts, address them – and set about convincing them they were good too, that they would be given the tools.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told targets they would enjoy this. There’s something primal in that: no one parks the bus on the playground. One signing said he was unsure about joining a team fighting relegation. You won’t be, the coach said. Another had watched Elche insegundaand liked them but assumed: you won’t play like that inprimera, to which the coach said: yes we will. “I think it’s going to be a nice year,” he told people. He listened too: he says he’s quite not the extremist he once was.In total, Elche spent less than €7m and sold for twice that. Only Levante and Sevilla have lower salary limits, and Sevilla’s is a special case. When they signed strikers Rodríguez, Mir and Silva (a player Madrid this weekendmistook for Diogo Jota’s brother), Sarabia had his “cracks”. They scored two, one and one last season; they have four, four and two already this.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAlavés 0-1 Celta Vigo, Barcelona 4-1 Athletic Bilbao, Betis 1-1 Girona, Elche 2-2 Real Madrid, Getafe 0-1 Atlético Madrid, Osasuna 1-3 Real Sociedad, Oviedo 0-0 Rayo Vallecano, Valencia 1-0 Levante, Villarreal 2-1 MallorcaMondayEspanyol v Sevilla (8pm GMT)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A coach who hascalled out his own playersfor diving and time-wasting,denounced everyday sexism in sport, and wore a Beatles T-shirt to Espanyol, last year Sarabia claimed Elche were “a global role model”, a team whose fans “don’t just come to see their team win but to enjoy what we’re doing”, and mostly got mocked for it. A touch presumptuous perhaps, but he reached week eight of his debut season inprimeraunbeaten. No team lasted longer. Elche, candidates for relegation, had climbed to a Champions League place. Sarabia received the manager of the month award from his father.No, it didn’t last – or course it didn’t – but they are just two points off a European slot and they’re doing it their way. Oviedo and Levante, the other promoted clubs, are bottom and second-bottom. No one has had more of the ball. No player has won possession in the opposition’s half more than Affengruber or run further than Feibas. When they lost at Barcelona they “won” possession; now on Sunday they scored two and might have scored five against Madrid, securing a draw that felt a little like loss. Yes, Madrid were dire, but Elche were exceptional, only this isn’t so exceptional and it didn’t sound crazy to those who had been watching.“Leaving with a bitter taste when you’ve taken a point off the leader is admirable,” Peña insisted, being pissed off something to be proud of. “We get two goals in set pieces and it makes me a little bit angry,” Affengruber said. “ A point against Real Madrid is good but if you see the game you feel a bit frustrated. We played amazing football. If you follow us this season you’ve seen that we try to do this at every stadium, and this is what makes us a little bit special. It sounds a little crazy, but this is what it is.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid1316322Barcelona1321313Villarreal1315294Atletico Madrid1314285Real Betis136216Espanyol120187Getafe13-3178Athletic Bilbao13-5179Sevilla12-11610Real Sociedad13-11611Elche13-11612Celta Vigo13-21613Rayo Vallecano13-21614Alaves13-11515Valencia13-91316Mallorca13-71217Osasuna13-61118Girona13-131119Levante13-8920Oviedo13-139Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Rugby Football Union is also expected to provide any other relevant video captured of the incident.England edge over line for autumn clean sweep but Argentina fume over Curry scuffleRead moreIn an extraordinary press conference after England’s 27-23 victory on Sunday, Contepomi described Curry as a “bully” and accused the flanker of shoving him in the tunnel and telling him to “fuck off”. Contepomi also claimed Curry had “broken” the knee of Juan Cruz Mallía with a “reckless” tackle in the 75th minute – the incident that sparked the post-match bad blood.The Argentina head coach said “there are probably cameras there” and the Six Nations will wait to review the footage provided by England and assess their statement before determining whether further action is warranted. On Monday, Argentina also confirmed that Mallía has suffered a “traumatic” torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee as a result of Curry’s tackle.View image in fullscreenArgentina’s head coach, Felipe Contepomi, said Curry gave him ‘a push, a hit here on the chest’ after the match.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty ImagesArgentina players were incensed with Curry – who was only penalised for the tackle – and surrounded him on the pitch after the match. The bad feeling spilled over into the tunnel with Contepomi saying: “It is part of [Curry’s] nature to bully people. But he came off in the tunnel and he gave me a little smack. I’m 48. [It was] not a smack, a push, a hit here on the chest. So maybe it is his nature, I don’t know. Probably those are the guys we are rewarding and we praise. Maybe that’s where we want rugby to go, I don’t know.“How old is he, 27? He is strong and I am 48 and he comes and just shoves me. Luckily, there are probably cameras there … Richard Hill was there so you can ask him.“I was standing there [in the tunnel] and he was coming and wanted to say hi to one of our coaches but we said no because we were upset. He was reckless and broke our player’s knee. I know it is rugby, but if we don’t look after each other in rugby, it could be dangerous.“He was coming [into the tunnel] and [we] said: ‘Mate, you broke his knee,’ and he said: ‘Fuck off,’ and pushed me like that. Maybe that is the way he is, I don’t know him. I am not happy with the situation. After breaking someone’s knee, you need to be at least humble enough and respectful to say: ‘Sorry I did something wrong,’ but he went the opposite [way].“Maybe it is his way of being a bully. If we want bullies in this game, good on them.

His character is impeccable. He’s a fantastic team man, a very respectful guy. I think Tom Curry’s character is unquestionable.“I’m unaware of what happened in the tunnel, but post-game, on the pitch, emotions are always flying high.

The 37-year-old Swede, who appeared poised to take charge at Swansea until Boro’s hijacking of that mooted deal, will aim to reinforce a reputation as one of Europe’s brightest emerging coaches.After securing two consecutive second-place finishes in Sweden’s top tier atHammarby, Hellberg has become something of a hot property and is tasked with leading second-placed Boro back into the Premier League.‘No miracles’: Philippe Clement gets instant view of size of task at NorwichRead moreThey have paid about £250,000 to extract Hellberg from his contract and hope he can continue the job started by Rob Edwards. He had impressed immensely after his summer arrival, but the former Luton manager’sleft for Wolvesthis month.Hellberg began coaching in his country’s seventh tier after a modest playing career as a midfielder in Sweden’s lower divisions and swiftly proved a promotion specialist before taking charge at Hammarby two years ago.He will not take charge until after Tuesday’s game at home to theChampionshipleaders, Coventry, with Adi Viveash having another game as the interim manager before staying as part of the coaching staff.Hellberg told theclub’s website: “A lot of things make Boro the perfect choice for me. The way they play and want to play, together with the crowd, suits me and how I want to work. I want us to play quick and aggressive football, and to try to win the ball as quickly as possible if we don’t have it. I want us to be quick on goal and create a lot of chances.”Swansea have announced Vítor Matos as their head coach on a contract to 2029.

The pair have been the target of intense supporter anger after a disastrous start to the season.Rangerswon one of their first eight league games and suffered seven consecutive European defeats after a much-criticised summer recruitment drive.Although domestic form has improved sinceDanny Röhl replaced Russell Martin as manager last month, Rangers’ American owners,who took over in May, have acted decisively. The chair, Andrew Cavenagh, and vice-chair Parag Marathe are now leading the search for new incumbents “that align with the vision for the next chapter”.Scottish Premiership: Celtic close gap after Hearts held by Dundee UnitedRead more“Responsible change is measured and steady,” Cavenagh said. “Our first priority has been to improve the sporting performance and that led to our decision to part ways with Russell Martin and bring in Danny Rohl. Danny has now started the process of improving the on-pitch performance and that has given us the chance to focus on other parts of the club.“Patrick and Kev are both skilled executives and have delivered a lot for the club in their time with it. We’ve now had six months since we became part of Rangers to assess the club’s needs as well as to get to know Patrick and Kev a bit more. Simply put, when we think about what we need in both CEO and sporting director today, it’s different than who we think Patrick and Kev are.View image in fullscreenKevin Thelwell (left) and Patrick Stewart have lost their jobs at Rangers.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA“I will not throw dirt on either of them. I think very highly of them both on personal and professional levels. It’s just the reality that the club needs different things today than it did six months ago. We’ve already started the hiring process and hope to have appointments soon, but we will prioritise quality and fit over speed.”Stewart has held his role at Rangers for a year, while Thelwell’s appointment in April was sanctioned by the American owners shortly before their takeover was completed. The latter’s short spell at Ibrox is largely defined by the decision to appoint Martin, who proved to be Rangers’ shortest-serving permanent manager in history when he wassacked in October after 17 games in charge.Explore more on these topicsRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

It was felt the ground’s slow pitch would not prepare the players adequately before the traditional bounce of the Gabba.Although the head coach, Brendon McCullum, did then offer individuals the chance to divert to Canberra after the defeat in Perth, only three fringe players took up the offer.With the fast-forward nature of the first Test opening up an 11-day gap before the second, McCullum has opted to book additional training days at the Gabba, including evening sessions under lights. England fly to Brisbane on Wednesday, with these extended preparations starting on Saturday.In some ways, the harrowing nature of the first Test – including collapses in both innings – meant England would be damned either way. Switch to Canberra and it would probably be framed as panic; stick to their guns – a belief in tailored training and keeping the squad together – and it becomes casual.Michael Vaughan, the former England captain, told BBC Test Match Special: “It’s amateurish if they don’t go and play now. What harm is playing two days of cricket with a pink ball under lights? It’s not being old-school to suggest that a pink ball is different to a red ball.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So you’d have to drive around the coast. But I did look at it.”None of the Test team will divert to Canberrafor the two‑day pink‑ball match against the Prime Minister’s XI that starts on Saturday. Wood, a precious asset only just back from knee surgery in March, will be kept in cotton wool, but the batters, who were given the option to play, will instead have extra time at the Gabba. Only Jacob Bethell, Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts of the touring party will play in the floodlit fixture.The result and the nature of the defeat at Perth Stadium have left a good number of the 9,000 England supporters who made the tripangered and triggeredby a fair degree of ridicule in the Australian media. In the immediate aftermath, the mood inside the England dressing room was just as bleak.View image in fullscreenJoe Root and Mark Wood reflect England’s dejection after their side’s collapse on day two of the Ashes opener against Australia in Perth.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/Reuters“When you first get back in, it’s not that bit where you start evaluating,” Wood said. “Shellshocked is the right word. Some lads choose to sit down, some lads start packing their kit. I sat down for five minutes. It looks like you’re gazing [into space], but you’re just thinking. When Ben Stokes gets back [from media duties], we sit in a circle at the end of the dressing room.“But there’s nothing I can say that will make it sound better. If I say we’re quite level, people aren’t going to be happy with that. If I say it’s really emotional then people will say: ‘Why can’t you be level and go on to the next game?’ What I can say is we speak honestly together. Everyone is open.“I feel we know this is one of five [Tests]. There has to be a reflection of what has gone on, but also to know that we did some good things and we take those into the next game. We have been hit hard in round one, but we have more rounds to throw some back.”Given the nature of the batting – including a collapse offour for 11 after lunch on day twowhen leading by 105 runs and appearing to be in charge – those good things almost exclusively refer to day one and a bowling performance that rolled Australia for 132 all out in 45.2 overs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Allende did extremely well to receive the throw, then turn his body quickly to elude a defender and spot Messi in space near the penalty arc. Messi kept the ball moving right to left with a layoff into the path of Silvetti, who dispatched an excellent curling finish beyond Celentano and inside the far post.Allende added his brace in the 62nd and 74th minutes, both on transition opportunities. Messi took the ball off Evander on the first to create the break, and the final through ball on both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Technology companies are complicit in this abuse and have made creating and sharing abusive material as simple as clicking a button, and they have to act now to stop it.”She urged victims of deepfakes to report any images to the police. Hammond said: “This is a serious crime, and we will support you. No one should suffer in silence or shame.”Creating non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes is a criminal offence under the new Data Act.The report, by the crime and justice consultancy Crest Advisory, found that 7% of respondents had been depicted in a sexual or intimate deepfake. Of these, only 51% had reported it to the police. Among those who told no one, the most commonly cited reasons were embarrassment and uncertainty that the offence would be treated seriously.The data also suggested that men under 45 were likely to find it acceptable to create and share deepfakes. This group was also more likely to view pornography online and agree with misogynistic views, and feel positively towards AI. But the report said this association of age and gender with such views was weak and it called for further research to explore this apparent association.One in 20 of the respondents admitted they had created deepfakes in the past. More than one in 10 said they would create one in the future. And two-thirds of respondents said they had seen, or might have seen, a deepfake.The report’s author, Callyane Desroches, head of policy and strategy at Crest Advisory, warned that the creation of deepfakes was “becoming increasingly normalised as the technology to make them becomes cheaper and more accessible”.She added: “While some deepfake content may seem harmless, the vast majority of video content is sexualised – and women are overwhelmingly the targets.“We are deeply concerned about what our research has highlighted – that there is a cohort of young men who actively watch pornography and hold views that align with misogyny who see no harm in viewing, creating and sharing sexual deepfakes of people without their consent.”Cally Jane Beech, an activist who campaigns for better protection for victims of deepfake abuse, said: “We live in very worrying times, the futures of our daughters (and sons) are at stake if we don’t start to take decisive action in the digital space soon.She added: “We are looking at a whole generation of kids who grew up with no safeguards, laws or rules in place about this, and are now seeing the dark ripple effect of that freedom.“Stopping this starts at home. Education and open conversation need to be reinforced every day if we ever stand a chance of stamping this out.”Explore more on these topicsDeepfakeViolence against women and girlsPoliceArtificial intelligence (AI)WomennewsShareReuse this content"

They warn of “deeper structural failures” beyond that data breach.TheAfghan data breachwas a particularly serious leak of information relating to individual Afghans who worked with British forces before the Taliban seized control of the country in August 2021. Those who discovered their names had been disclosed say it has put their lives at risk.“Data breaches expose individuals to serious danger and are liable of disrupting government and business continuity,” the letter states. “However, in a recent public hearing hosted by your committee, Commissioner John Edwards has shown unwillingness to reconsider his approach to data protection enforcement, even in face of the most serious data breach that has ever occurred in the UK.”The signatories cite other serious data breaches including those affecting victims of the Windrush scandal.But they say the ICO has applied its “public sector approach” in these cases and either issued reprimands – written notices that lack the force of law – or significantly lowered the monetary penalties it awarded.“The ICO decision not to pursue any formal action against the MoD despite their repeated failures was extraordinary, as was its failure to record its decision making. The picture that emerges is one where the ICO public sector approach lacks deterrence, and fails to drive the adoption of good data management across government and public bodies.”“The handling of the Afghan data breach is not an isolated case; many are being let down by the ICO and its numerous failures to use corrective powers.”The letter warns that alongside the shift away from enforcement in the public sector, statistics contained in thelatest ICO reportshow that private sector enforcement is also becoming rarer as organisations are diverting resources away from compliance and responsible data practices, knowing that the ICO is not going to pursue the matter.“Parliament has given the ICO considerable powers not to politely hope for the best, but to enforce compliance with legally binding orders. As we heard from the public hearing you hosted, the ICO chose not to use these powers to address the Afghan data breach.“Unfortunately, the Afghan data breach is not an isolated incident, but the symptom of deeper structural failures which are emerging in the way the ICO operates.”The letter concludes: “Change appears to be unlikely unless the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee uses their oversight powers and steps in.”A spokesperson for the ICO said: “We have a range of regulatory powers and tools to choose from when responding to systemic issues in a given sector or industry.“We respect the important role civil society plays in scrutinising our choices and will value the opportunity to discuss our approach during our next regular engagement. We also welcome our opportunities to account for our work when speaking to and appearing before the DSIT select committee.”Explore more on these topicsData protectionInformation commissionerUK civil libertiesnewsShareReuse this content"

As such, they catch existing puns well but that doesn’t mean they truly understand them,” he said.“We were able to consistently fool LLMs by modifying existing puns, removing the double meaning that made the original pun. In these cases, models associate these sentences with previous puns, and make up all sort of reasons to justify they are a pun. Ultimately, we found their understanding of puns is an illusion.”The team concluded that when faced with unfamiliar wordplay, the LLMs’ success rate in distinguishing puns from sentences without a pun can drop to 20%.Another pun tested was: “Old LLMs never die, they just lose their attention.” When attention was changed to “ukulele”, the LLM still perceived it as a pun on the basis that “ukulele” sounded a bit like “you-kill-LLM”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yuletide now seems to start roughly when Strictly does, and Black Friday kicked off around Halloween, judging by the landfill of exclamation-marked emails weighing down my inbox.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Black Friday is a devil worth dancing with if you want to save money on products you’ve had your eye on – and it can pay to start dancing now. Some of the Filter’s favourite items are already floating around at prices clearly designed to make them sell out fast. Other deals won’t land until the big day itself on 28 November, or even until the daftly named Cyber Monday (1 December).As ever, we’d encourage you not to buy anything unless you really need it and have the budget to do so – readour advice on how to shop smartly.We’ll keep this page updated over the next few days with more genuine Black Friday bargains on the Filter’s favourites, from Anker battery packs to KidiZoom cameras via the espresso machine you loved more than any other product this year.How we selected these deals (and excluded others)The key toshopping smarton Black Friday, Cyber Monday or any discount event is to know what you want – and we’re here to help you target the good stuff. We’ve tested thousands of products at the Filter in 2025 and warmly recommended hundreds of them, including many that have genuinely good Black Friday discounts.Instead of listing price cuts on all the products we’ve featured, we’ve focused on the things you’ve liked the most this year, and looked for deals that undercut their long-term average prices by a significant amount. Ideally, their Black Friday price will be their lowest of the year.We don’t take retailers at their word on discount size, either. Amazon may say it’s “70%” off the RRP, but we study the price history of every item using independent tools such asthe Camelizerto find out how generous a discount really is. If an item’s price has been all over the place in 2025, we’ll give the average price below instead of a “was …” price, so you can judge how good a deal it is.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best early Black Friday deals on the Filter’s favourite productsBest toys and games dealsFamily board game that isn’t MonopolyView image in fullscreenAzul tile laying game, £25.49 (avg £31.42)£25.49 at AmazonThe Filter team recommended this pattern-building game as an “addictive”Father’s Day gift“guaranteed to be a hit”, but it’s far too good to leave to just the dads. It’s mercifully quick to learn and suitable for tweens and up, so you and your Christmas visitors can have a bout underway faster than you can say “read the instructions”. This is the first time its price has dropped much below £30 since 2023.Family card gameView image in fullscreenDobble original, £6.99 (avg £9.16)£6.99 at AmazonRace to find the matching images in this popular observation game – one of our top tips forkeeping kids entertained on long train journeys. You can mix things up with games-within-games such as “hot potato” and “catch them all”, and it’s versatile enough to suit any number of players from two to eight. This deal isn’t quite the 50% off that Amazon claims (its average price on the site is under £10), but this is its lowest price of 2025.EA Sports FC 26View image in fullscreenEA Sports FC 26 for PS5, from £34.99 (was £69.99)£34.99 at PlayStation Store£37.99 at AmazonEA’s FC 26 was released to great fanfare in September, and it’s proved to be one of Amazon’s best Black Friday sellers so far. As Ben Wilson explains in his four-starreview, this versatile game is a sim offline and a whole other beast online, where it’s purely an esport with shots and goals prioritised over defending. Unusually, Amazon is beaten to the lowest price on this one – by the PlayStation store, no less.The best tech dealsSilk sleep headphonesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianSnoozeband Silk, £84 (was £99)£84 at SnoozebandBlock out the world and drift off to whatever music, podcast or white noise you choose with this comfy silk sleep mask that incorporates flat Bluetooth speakers for pairing with your phone. It impressed our writer Jane Hoskyn in her mission to findsleep aidsthat actually work, but she found it a little pricey – so this discount is very welcome, and makes the Snoozeband an even betterChristmas giftidea.Running watch with SpotifyView image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 165 Music smartwatch, £208.05 (was £289)£208.05 at AmazonOne of our favouritefitness techgadgets, Garmin’s GPS smartwatch can’t run amarathonfor you, but it sure can help ease the pain with its pace-tracking tools, offline Spotify support and 19-hour battery life. Amazon outdoes its rivals with this early deal on the aqua green edition of the watch, now at its lowest price ever.Professional DJ headphonesView image in fullscreenAiAiAi Audio TMA-2 DJ headphones, £124.94 (was £159)£124.94 at AmazonMany headphones claim to be pro or DJ-level, but this modular set is a favourite withactual DJs. DJ and producerSophie Lloydtold the Filter’s Kate Hutchinson that she loves the sound quality, size and durability of these phones, adding that their modular design means “you can buy a new lead or earpieces separately, which is essential when you’re using them all the time”. This Black deal takes them to their lowest price of 2025.Portable Bluetooth speakerView image in fullscreenBose SoundLink Flex 2nd gen, £108.95 (was £149.95)£108.95 at John Lewis£108.95 at AmazonThis fab portable speaker boasts 12-hour battery life, durability and a range of swish colours, making it a must-have foruniversity lifeand beyond. It’s a superb piece of kit for the price, with excellent sound quality, nine-metre Bluetooth connectivity and smart TV support.The best home dealsHeated fleece throwView image in fullscreenSilentnight luxury heated throw, from £36 (was £45)£36 at Boots£36.25 at AmazonOne of Amazon’s best sellers this Black Friday but 25p cheaper at Boots, Silentnight’s toasty fleece blanket was one of the lighter and thinner options in ourbest heated throwsroundup. That makes this 120 x 160cm throw ideal for wrapping around yourself (and no-one else) on the sofa as the evenings grow ever colder.Smart baby monitorView image in fullscreenOwlet Dream Sock, from £199 (was £299)£199.99 at John Lewis£199 at AmazonOwlet’s feature-packed smartphone-compatible baby monitor was one of the favouritebaby productswhen we spoke to parents last year. If you’d rather not give your £199 to Amazon, John Lewis is only 99p more.The best combination steam cleanerView image in fullscreenVax Steam Fresh Total Home mop, from £84 (was £160)£84 at Amazon£84.99 at CurrysEmerging from Stuart Andrews’best steam cleanerstest as the “best combination cleaner”, Vax’s versatile mop proved easy and effective to use on multiple surfaces and tight corners. The handheld bit detaches easily from the body then slots back in when needed, and you get an array of brushes, scrapers, pads and nozzles. This dirt-blitzing package has dropped more than 40% at Currys and Amazon.Smart wake-up and reading lightView image in fullscreenPhilips SmartSleep sleep and wake-up light, £139.99 (avg £179.61)£139.99 at Philips£139.99 at AmazonWhen testing products for his guide to thebest sunrise alarm clocks, our writer Pete Wise was struck by how well this one worked as a reading light. “Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful,” wrote Pete, who also liked the range of alarm sounds and audio input option. He found it a little too expensive, however – and it’s still north of £100, but somewhat less so.The best heated clothes airerView image in fullscreenDry:Soon Deluxe heated airer, £159.99 (was £199.99)£159.99 at Lakeland£159.99 at AmazonA heated airer dries your clothes fast enough to avoid the dreaded stink of slow-dried laundry, and without the cost or noise of a tumble dryer. Lakeland’s three-tier heated airer – the top performer in ourheated airerstest – has proved enduringly popular with the Filter’s readers, and is now at its lowest price ever. Lakeland has also dropped the price of theairer with coverto £195.98 for Black Friday.The best hybrid mattressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOtty Original Hybrid double, £627.75 with code THEFILTER7 (was £647.99)£627.75 at OttyThe most comfortable and supportive foam-and-springs hybrid of all themattresseswe’ve tested, the Otty already came at an impressive price of £647.99 for a double, but the Filter’s exclusive code gives you a small but perfectly welcome additional 7% off for Black Friday. For a deeper dive into this cosy mattress, read ourOtty Original Hybrid review(spoiler: it gets five stars). Otty is now bundling two ofour favourite pillow(usually £69.99 each) in with each mattress order, too.Simba Pro hybrid mattressView image in fullscreenSimba Hybrid Pro king size, £948.27 (was £1,299)£948.27 at SimbaMattress “discounts” may seem to be a 24/7/365 thing, but UK watchdogs have given companies short shrift over money-off claims that aren’t all they seem. We’ve certainly noticed Simba playing by the rules lately, and its current 30%-off sale is the first we’ve seen in months. The excellentSimba Hybrid Pro, another of ourbest mattresses, is now hundreds of pounds cheaper in all sizes, from single (now £599.25) to super king (now £1,091.22).Wool mattress topperView image in fullscreenWoolroom Deluxe wool topper (double), from £148.74 (was £174.99)£148.74 at Amazon£165.74 at the WoolroomThe sustainably sourced wool in Woolroom’s bedding is a hypoallergenic temperature regulator, helping to keep you warm in winter and cool on hotter nights. The company’s deluxemattress topperadds a touch of softness to a too-hard mattress, and is one of the easiest toppers we tested to move and store. Woolroom’s 35% isn’t quite as big a discount as Amazon’s, but it applies to everything on its site, including duvets, mattresses and linens.Powerful pressure washerView image in fullscreenBosch UniversalAquatak 135 high pressure washer, £135 (was £209)£135 at Currys£135 at AmazonBlitz the gunk from your patio, decking, gutters and any flat surface you find yourself unable to resist pointing the nozzle at. Our writer Andy Shaw found the UniversalAquatak to be the most powerful of all thepressure washershe tested, and he thought its price was reasonable too. It’s now even cheaper for Black Friday, although not quite its lowest price of 2025 – it was briefly (very briefly) under £120 for Prime Day.Shark vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenShark PowerDetect vacuum, £314 (was £549)£314 at Shark£314 at AmazonA vacuum cleaner that empties itself? Yes please, said our writer Andy Shaw in his roundup of thebest cordless vacuum cleaners– and you agreed, making Shark’s ingenious and powerful cordless cleaner one of your favourite products of the year. Vacuums that look after themselves don’t come cheap, and it’s great to see this one heavily discounted at Shark’s own website as well as at Amazon.The best robot vacuum cleanerView image in fullscreenEufy X10 Pro Omni, £499 (was £579)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The Eufy X10 was named “best overall” by Stuart Andrews in his guide to thebest robot vacuums, and it’s already one of the fastest-selling items in Amazon’s Black Friday sale. Its price cut isn’t quite the 38% Amazon suggests, because it cost £579 throughout 2025, but this is still a legitimately good deal.Damp-destroying dehumidifierView image in fullscreenProBreeze dehumidifier, from £151.99 (was £189.99)£159.49 at ProBreezeThis “workhorse”, which “extracted moisture powerfully” in ourbest dehumidifierstest, has tumbled to its lowest price of the year (except for a few days in May, because no one buys dehumidifiers in May). If the recent cold snap gave you the condensation blues, here’s your chance to snap up the ProBreeze for a chunk below its average Amazon price of just over £180.Cuddly heated throwView image in fullscreenBeurer HD150 heated throw, £79.99 (was £84.99)£79.99 at AmazonBeurer’s “soft and sumptuous” fleece blanket was crowned “best throw overall” in our guide to thebest electric blanketsthanks to its ability to get toasty fast without using much energy. A fiver off is not a massive discount, but this is its cheapest recent price on Amazon, where it normally costs £84.99 – and other retailers still want over £100 for it. We’ll bring you any non-Amazon deals that emerge in the coming days.Google video doorbellView image in fullscreenGoogle Nest doorbell, from £119.98 (was £179.99)£119.98 at Amazon£129 at CurrysSort the cold-callers from the welcome visitors when they’re still metres away from your front door, with this outstanding battery-powered doorbell that crashes to its lowest price since Black Friday 2023. Andy Shaw named it thebest video doorbelloverall, but lamented that you also have to fork out for aNest Aware subscriptionat £80 a year to save recordings.Budget electric blanketView image in fullscreenSlumberdown Sleepy Nights electric blanket, king size, from £30.59(was £45.99)£30.59 at Amazon£34.20 at SlumberdownThis Slumberdown Sleepy Nights performed admirably in Emily Peck’s test ofthe best electric blankets, heating quickly to a temperature that was comfortable to keep our reviewer warm through the night. It also has elasticated fitted straps to make fitment easy, and comes in a variety of sizes to suit your bed size. It’s the king-size one that’s been discounted.Subscription-free video doorbellView image in fullscreenEufy Security doorbell E340, £74.99 (avg £151.29)£74.99 at AmazonLots of video doorbells and home surveillance systems come with a recurring subscription to access some of their features, which you may wish to avoid. If so, then the Eufy Video Doorbell E340 was Andy Shaw’s pick in his testing of thebest video doorbellsout there. He liked the E340 precisely because of its dual camera setup to make keeping an eye on parcels a breeze, plus the onboard storage to stick it to cloud storage. Reliability of movement detection needed some work, though. At £74.99 from Amazon, it’s also at its lowest price ever this Black Friday from the big online retailer.The best kitchen dealsNinja assisted barista coffee machineView image in fullscreenNinja Cafe Luxe ES601UK, from £439 (was £549)£439 at Amazon£449.99 at CurrysHaving cornered the market in air fryers, Ninja now has its eye on all your kitchen needs, starting with your morning coffee – however you take it, from cold brew to latte. The “sublime espresso”, “ingenious milk frother” and Barista Assist feature of the Ninja Luxe impressed our writer Sasha Muller enough to win it a place in thebest espresso machinesandbest coffee machines, where Sasha noted that “you get a lot for your money” even at full price.Great value kettleView image in fullscreenKenwood Ripple Kettle, from £27 (was £39.99)£27 at Currys£27 at John Lewis£29 at AmazonThe best budget kettle in Rachel’sbest kettlestest, the handsome Kenwood looks more expensive than even its RRP suggests, and impresses with a wide pouring spout, single-cup boil and two water windows. Currys has the best Black Friday deal so far, with the white edition dropping to a bargain £27. At John Lewis it’s £28 for white or eggshell blue, while the Amazon deal is for midnight black.Guinness draught pourerView image in fullscreenGuinness Nitrosurge device, £19.99 (was £30)£19.99 at AmazonThis curious-looking device is a widget on steroids. It brings the nitro beer effect to your Guinness at home, enabling you to pour the black stuff in two-part draught style, just like any good bartender. It’s a brilliantChristmas giftidea, now with a third wiped off its price … so, sincere apologies if you bought it last week when we first recommended it. Note you’ll need to buy specialNitrosurge Guinnesstoo, but that’s also in the Black Friday sale, at £16.50 for a pack of 10 one-pint cans.Versatile espresso makerView image in fullscreenDe’Longhi Stilosa espresso machine, £84.55 (was £89)£84.55 at AmazonThe promise of “ludicrously tasty” espresso and “perfect microfoam for silky cappuccinos and flat whites” proved so irresistible that this was one of the Filter recommendations you loved most in 2025. Our writer Sasha Muller was already wowed by its affordability in hisespresso machinestest, and it’s rarely discounted at all, so we’re not too sad to see it drop just a few pounds for Black Friday.Capsule coffee machineView image in fullscreenPhilips L’or Barista Sublime, from £45 (avg £69.40)£45 at John Lewis£47.99 at AmazonThe price of this sleek machine has bounced between £105 and about £60 since 2023, only ever dipping to £45 for Black Friday each year. Its compatibility, compactness and coffee impressed the Filter’s cuppa connoisseur, Sasha Muller, enough to be named “best capsule machine” in his bid to find thebest coffee machines.Ninja air fryerView image in fullscreenNinja Double Stack XL, £188 (was £269.99)£188 at Ninja£188 at AmazonIf you’re still holding out on buying an air fryer, here’s a rare chance to grab a big-name, big-capacity Ninja without the big price tag. Not quite so big, anyway. Rachel Ogden named the Double Stack XL “best compact air fryer” in her guide to thebest air fryers, but with its 9.5lL capacity and four cooking levels, this thing can cook alot. Still not cheap, but far below its average price of £229.The best blenderView image in fullscreenBraun PowerBlend 9,£140 (was £199)£140 at Amazon£140 at AOYou can spend about £500 on a premium blender, but this superb model from Braun costs below £200 even at full price – something ourbest blenderstester, Rachel Ogden, could hardly believe when she named it “best overall”. Hold on to your smoothie, Rachel, because it’s now less than £150, and not just at Amazon.Tefal air fryerView image in fullscreenTefal Easy Fry Dual XXL, from £119(was £199.99)£119 at Argos£119.99 at AmazonTefal is known mostly for its ActiFry tech, so when Rachel Ogden crowned the Tefal Easy Fry Dual XXL as thebest air fryer, it made sense. She found it to be a sublime all-rounder in her testing, handling both chips and frozen food very well. With an 11-litre capacity, it’s also Tefal’s largest dual zone air fryer, making it handy for cooking a lot of food for larger families when you need to.The bestkettle we’ve testedView image in fullscreenBosch Skykettle, £64.99 (avg £85.38)£64.99 at John Lewis£64.99 at AmazonCrowned overall winner in Rachel Ogden’s missions to find thebest kettles, this Bosch beauty now comes at a price offer you can’t refuse – and not just from Amazon. “A brilliant blend of robust form and function” wrote Rachel of this fashionably industrial-looking kettle, whose features include a low minimum boil (300ml), keep-warm setting and touch controls. Now its lowest price ever, in white or black.The best personal care appliance dealsSunrise alarm clockView image in fullscreenLumie Sunrise Alarm, from £29.99 (was £49)£29.99 at Amazon£37.49 at BootsOne of your favourite Filter recommendations of the year, this gentlesunrise alarm clockwill wake you up with kittens purring, birdsong, gently brightening light – or a plain old alarm sound if you prefer. It’s been around for a few years and saw a price hike in 2022 (cost-of-waking-up crisis?) before settling at just under £50 from most retailers, so this is a deal worth grabbing.Water flosserView image in fullscreenWaterpik Ultra Professional, from £59.99 (was £91)£59.99 at Amazon£73 at CurrysBlast the gunk from your gums without having to grapple with floss. The Waterpik Ultra is a countertop model so it takes up more space than the cordless type, but this gives it more versatility and saw it score top marks with ourwater flossertester Alan Martin. If you’d rather avoid Amazon, you can find it discounted by other retailers, albeit not by as much.The best IPL deviceView image in fullscreenPhilips Lumea 9900 BRI951/01, £377.99 (avg £501.33)£377.99 at AmazonIPL (intense pulsed light) hair remover devices promise to banish stubbly regrowth without the pain of waxing and epilation – at a price. The Philips Lumea 9900, Lise Smith’s pick forbest IPL deviceoverall, has cost as much as £599.99 for much of the year, and occasional discounts rarely go below £450. Amazon’s current price shaves more than £40 off any other Black Friday deal we’ve found for this version, which comes with four attachments.The best beauty dealsA bargain beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenW7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar, £16.95 (was £19.95)£16.95 at AmazonAdvent calendars are a Christmas staple, and we’ve seen lots of brands try to put a different spin on them in the past – beauty Advent calendars are some of the most prominent. This W7 Beauty Blast calendar provides excellent value for money at a deal-busting £16.95 from Amazon, especially as it provides genuinely useful products for most folks. The likes of the eyeshadows, primers, lip balms and such are travel-size, but apart from that, Sarah Matthews had little cause for complaint in her ranking of thebest beauty Advent calendars.For more:The best Black Friday beauty dealsBig savings – or big regrets?

EU leaders must help Kyiv resist the bullyingMon 24 Nov 2025 13.37 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 14.01 ESTShareThere was a grim familiarity to the unveiling of Donald Trump’s latest peaceproposalsfor Ukraine last week. As in August, when the US president invited Vladimir Putin to a summit inAlaska, Kyiv and its European allies were excluded from discussions that ended up echoing Kremlin talking points. Yet again, Mr Trump publiclyscoldedVolodymyr Zelenskyy for not being more grateful for his ongoing mediation efforts. And as in the summer, Mr Zelenskyy and blindsided European leaders strove to stay polite while scrambling to limit the damage.The salvage operation appears to have been relatively successful, following Sunday’smeetingin Geneva between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and a Ukrainian delegation. The 28-point plan reportedly drafted by Mr Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser, Kirill Dmitriev, was in effect a repackaging of Mr Putin’s maximalist demands. A deal premised on the handing over of new territory in the Donbas region to Russia, restrictions on Ukraine’s sovereignty, and drastic limits on the size of its future army, could never be acceptable to Kyiv. Mr Rubio,suggestinga more “refined” framework was now being developed, seemed to at least acknowledge this fundamental difficulty.As the usual stream of self-regardingblusterand bombast emanates from the White House, it is impossible to know whether a negotiating endgame is truly at hand. But certain principles bear restating as a starting point for meaningful talks. Future European security, and the basic principles of international law, demand that Mr Putin’s brutal aggression is not simply rubber-stamped and rewarded, and that Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence is prioritised. To Kyiv’s persistent disadvantage, Mr Trump’s administration likes to position itself as a neutral broker between unequal warring parties. In response, European countries must insist on a proactive role in forthcoming peace negotiations, and try to exert some moral leverage.Europe, after all, is now bearing the bulk of the cost of Ukraine’s continued resistance. It can use its influence and collective weight to furnish Mr Zelenskyy with the negotiating cards which Mr Trump has previouslyassertedthat he lacks. If the EU can belatedly reachagreementon a €140bn “reparations loan” to Kyiv, underwritten by frozen Russian assets, Mr Putin’s apparent judgment that he can outlast Ukrainian resistance may begin to look questionable. A combination of arms and financial support, and greater economic pressure on Russia, are needed to alter calculations in the Kremlin and genuinely bring Mr Putin to the negotiating table.This, rather than attempting to bully Mr Zelenskyy into a form of capitulation, is the path to achieving a just and sustainable peace. As Ukraine’s president wearilyrestatedat the weekend: “The crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war, and it is Russia, and only Russia, that has been refusing to end it.”There are already signs that the Kremlin is preparing to reject modifications to Mr Witkoff’s Putin-friendly plan. Yet whether through naivety, a crude notion of realpolitik or a greedy desire to open up Russian markets, Mr Trump and his aides seem repeatedly minded to lobby for peace on Moscow’s terms. Searching for a moral compass in the White House is a futile exercise. Europe’s leaders need to start trying to shape some facts on the ground.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

European and Ukrainian negotiators have been attempting to “rework” the28-point peace planthat the president put forward last week into onemore favourableto Ukraine. Trump keeps signalling that he is willing to compromise, but his original plan put Ukraine in a very tough starting position, handing Vladimir Putin concessions that Russia has so far failed to gain on the battlefield.It is true Russia has made recent advances – especiallyaround Pokrovskand Myrnohrad in Donetsk province, and in parts of Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine lacks the troops and firepower to retake all the territory lost since 2022, let alone Crimea. But the Ukrainian army isn’t about to unravel, and neither is Putin close to fulfilling hisoriginal objective: conquering the four Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia fully controlsonly Luhansk. This war could drag on until the summer. By then, Putin’s forces will have fought Ukraine for as long as Stalin’s fought Nazi Germany.Ukraine’s shortages are well known: too few soldiers to hold an 800-mile contact line and inadequate air defences after Trump severely cut direct US military assistance. Europe’sstepped-up supporthasn’t compensated. What is remarkable, given Ukraine’s disadvantages, is the scale of Russia’s losses:more than 1 millioncasualties according to the UK Ministry of Defence, nearly150,000confirmed dead, and more than23,000pieces of equipment destroyed or damaged. Ukrainian deep strikes on Russian refineries –at least 17by mid-November – have caused fuel shortages,long linesat petrol stations,panic buying, higher prices,rationingand a cut inrefining capacityby up to a fifth.Ukraine makes significant changes to US ‘peace plan’, sources sayRead moreIt is in this context that Trump unveiled his peace plan – an early Christmas present for Putin. It was negotiated byKirill Dmitriev, a Putin confidant and CEO of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, and on the US side by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, seems to have played a minimal role.Witkoff and Kushner may be shrewd business negotiators, but they have scant diplomatic experience and even less knowledge of Ukraine. (Witkoff hasrecited Kremlin talking pointsafter meeting Putin.) Their influence stems largely from personal ties to Trump. Pitting them against someone like Dmitriev virtually guaranteed a deal tilted toward Russia. A few examples illustrate the imbalance:Ukraine– not Russia – is required to cap its armed forces at 600,000. Russia faces no comparable constraints.Ukraine must amend its constitution to drop its commitment to joining Nato.Russia had long expressed concerns about Nato expansion; President Boris Yeltsinobjectedin the mid-1990s, well before Putin took the helm. But acknowledging Russia’s concerns is different from claiming Ukraine’s Nato membership was imminent in 2022. Between Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit – where it vaguely promisedeventual membership– and the invasion, Ukraine made no concrete progress toward accession. Had Nato truly wanted Ukraine in, it could have moved swiftly, as it did withFinland and Sweden.And that’s only the beginning. Trump’s plan recognises Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de-facto Russian – granting Putin parts of Donetsk he hasn’t captured. It freezes battle lines, allowingRussiato retain territory seized in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The plan doesn’t give Putin everything, but it gives him enough to claim victory.What does Russia concede? Virtually nothing. The plan does say frozen Russian assets will help rebuild Ukraine, but Moscow was never going to recover that money anyway.Meanwhile, Russia receives further rewards: readmission to the G8; reintegration into the global economy; negotiations toward a staged lifting of sanctions; and cooperation with the US on energy, infrastructure, AI and rare earths. The plan also demands Ukrainian de-Nazification, validating Russia’s absurd narrative that Ukraine is riddled with Nazis – something any visitor can see is false.Despite Russia’s ongoing war crimes –atrocitiesin Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka;forced relocationsto Russia of children; repeated strikes on apartment buildings, most recently in the western city ofTernopil; andabuse, torture, and executionof Ukrainian prisoners of war – the plan grants the Kremlin full immunity from prosecution, negating international criminal court warrants for Putin and his top officials.None of this should be surprising. Trump has been open about his admiration for Putin. He has been disdainful toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has even blamed Zelenskyy forstarting the war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that hardly justifies forcing Ukraine to accept a one-sided deal crafted without its participation – and accompanied by an ultimatum of mere days.Other supporters of the plan insist, as Trump has, that it’s time to end the blood-letting, even as Israel’sstrikes in Gaza continueduring the ceasefire underwritten by Trump. Some who rightly criticise Israel’s conduct seem oddly indifferent to Russia’s war crimes.Trump certainly has the authority to halt weapons deliveries to Ukraine – his decision to do so was another boon for Putin. But he has gone far further. By concocting a plan that may as well have been written in the Kremlin and excluding Ukraine from negotiations, he hasn’t just put his thumb on the scale. He’s put his hand on it. That’s morally indefensible and strategically myopic.There is some positive news. After reports that Rubio told members of Congress the 28-point plan was produced by Russia, heheld talkswith Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s closest adviser, to rework it based on Ukraine’s reactions–although Rubio has denied this. TrumpaccusedUkraine of ingratitude but added that the plan was “not my final offer” and that his deadline could be extended. If the upshot of all this is that Trump’s proposal doesn’t fly, that will be a good thing – above all for Ukraine.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaDonald TrumpEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story.Young men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise.An entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world. Meanwhile, the Democratic party failed to imagine a political future that included these young men. In Democrats’ parlance, anyone who took one step in that direction was hopelessly lost, unable to see the beautiful egalitarian future that we could create together.There is a fine line here. I am not arguing for the redemption, welcome, or whitewashing of the people who have peddled this bleak reality. But we can and should build a political coalition that includes this generation, that doesn’t leave them out in the cold, only to find a home in the most bleak fringes of a political movement that tells them that a lust for control over other people, especially women, is the only way to find meaning.On the left, we tell ourselves the story of our own vaunted sympathy, and yet we assign only blame to the young men who do something similar, looking for community and only finding it among the most opportunistic and dangerous political movements. We have done little to welcome them in.And while Democrats had solid policies and economic plans,Republicans, backed by an army of digital content, were able to take the mantle of running on the economy and framing the left as cultural warriors out of touch with the majority of Americans.But the good news is that this month’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City show Democrats have learned a lesson.The three marquee campaigns of this year were all remarkably similar, despite coming from different parts of the ideological spectrum. Their messaging was relentlessly focused on affordability – how expensive and difficult life has become for the working and middle-class people of their communities. Their solutions covered a wide ideological range, but the focus remained the same.Most young men, like most trans people and Black people and immigrants and everyone else, are dealing with housing that has skyrocketed in price, especially compared with our parents’ generations. Instead of having one career in our lifetimes, we now have to continually seek new jobs. Living independently as an adult is much more expensive and complicated now than it has been. These affordability campaigns gave young men something to do about those pressures rather than ceding that frustration to the most cynical actors.Undoubtedly this conversation is easier to have whenDonald Trumpis taking three steps every day to dismantle the economy. There’s a real sense that the economy is getting worse. That it’s more difficult to pay bills and keep food on the table, especially when Republicans are, quite literally, ensuring that 42 million people cannot afford to keep food on their table by refusing to fund Snap during their government shutdown.Republicans got distracted, trying to defend Trump and also trying to repeat his playbook of tying Democrats to the culture war of the moment. But without Trump’s singular ability to control a media narrative, Republicans with far less political talent and capital floundered, making themselves look weak and silly in the process.The political miracle is that this ruthless focus on affordability and cost of living may have brought in many of those same young men who had followed Trump a year ago. In Virginia and New Jersey, men under 30 broke for their new Democratic governors, with about six in 10 supporting Spanberger,according to the AP. In New York, young men went for Zohran Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo by a margin of nearly 40 points, according to aTufts Circle analysis.It turns out that these young men are not completely lost to us. We just failed to imagine a reality where they could be in our camp.Affordability broke through amid the longest government shutdown in US history, as consumer prices were rising ever higher thanks in part to Trump’s tariffs. For all of his bluster, eventually the economic reality becomes an unavoidable political crisis for anyone not far gone in his cult of personality who has to pay their bills.Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Mamdani in New York City showed us that the frustration that every working and middle-class person feels could be directed into a political coalition that sees marginalized people as people also affected by the greed and corruption that has made life unaffordable for so many.Young men, like everyone else, are looking for a politics that can make life a little better. Democrats are finally figuring out how to offer them that chance.Cory Alpert is a PhD researcher at the University of Melbourne looking at the impact of AI on democracy.

Now Trump is bringing it to VenezuelaDaniel MendiolaAfter decades of terrorizing civilians in the name of fighting terror, the White House is trying to do it with even less oversightMon 24 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 11.49 ESTShareFor the last two months, USforces have amassedoutside Venezuela and carried out a series oflethal strikesoncivilian boats. The Trump White House has ordered these actions in the name of fighting “narco-terrorists” – a label apparently applicable to anyone suspected of participating in drug trafficking near Latin American coastlines.More than 80 peoplehave already been killed in these pre-emptive strikes, and war hawks are calling for expanded military action to depose the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.Watching this play out, I am reminded of a passage from the geographer Stuart Elden’s award-winning 2009 book,Terror and Territory. In discussing how to study the “war on terror”, Elden observed that it did not make sense to study terrorism as something unique to non-state actors.“States clearly operate in ways that terrify,” Elden said. “The terrorism of non-state actors is a very small proportion of terrorism taken as a whole, with states having killed far more than those who oppose them.”A large body of research supports this claim.Researchers with Brown University’sCosts of Warproject, for example, have found that US-led interventions in the “war on terror” from 2001 to 2023 killed over400,000 civiliansin direct war violence. They also show evidence that when considering indirect deaths – for example, people in war zones dying from treatable medical conditions after clean water or medical infrastructure was destroyed – death toll estimates rise to at least3.5m. Moreover, even beyond direct war zones, a recent study in theLancetfound that sanctions during the same period were also extremely deadly, causing as many as500,000 excess deaths per yearfrom 2010 to 2021.We have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terrorIn short, we have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror. This is well known, and yet the Trump White House is reinvigorating the “war on terror” anyway. Still more, it is trying to do it witheven lessoversight on the president’s license to kill than has been exercised in the past.While on the surface Trump’s second term has been characterized by a disorienting barrage of executive orders and culture war polemics, the administration has in fact been running a cohesiveauthoritarian playbookaimed at conferring near limitless powers to the presidency. These concerted efforts have played out in numerous policy arenas fromimmigration, tohigher education, toeconomics, to even determiningwho is a citizen.Consistent with this pattern, Trump is asserting the same unchecked authority over the violent capacities of theUS military.AsI have written previously, a key tactic of the Trump White House has been eviscerating the oversight of the courts, making it impossible to impede the executive branch from continuing to break the law, even when it gets caught red-handed. However, another frequent strategy – perhaps less visible, though equally anathema to a system of limited government – has been to simply sidestep oversight by asserting that, even when law in theory places limits on presidential power, the exercise of this power is still “unquestioned”; according to this thinking, the executive branch apparently has the prerogative to interpret what those limits are.Of course, in a serious constitutional system, this would be preposterous. In practice, there would be no limits to presidential powers, rendering the constitution moot. Nonetheless, this is exactly the type of power that Trump is assertingover the military, both at home and abroad.Thecourt caserelated to Trump’s efforts to suppress protests in Chicago using troops sheds critical light on how this strategy works. Federal law allows a president to deploy troops domestically if there is a “rebellion” that is making it impossible to “execute the laws of the United States”. Accordingly, some lower court judges have reasonably blocked the deployment of troops, finding that the administration has been unable to prove that these conditions were met. Just look at the facts: protests had on averageonly been about 50people at a time, and they have clearly not made law enforcement impossible since ICE – the federal agency being protested – has vastly increased arrests during this time.True to form, however, Trump’s lawyers have argued that these details are irrelevant. In their view, there is actually no need to prove a rebellion is happening because thepresident has theauthority to define rebellionanyway. In other words, the law might impose limits on how the president can use the military, but the president gets to decide what those limits are.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhile lower courts have so far prevented this nakedly authoritarian legal theory from taking hold, the argument itself is still massively consequential: first, because an extremely Trump-friendly supreme court will hear the case soon and could very well endorse these claims; and second, because this isessentially the same logicthat the Trump administration has used to justify killing civilians off the Latin American coast. Indeed, just as the Trump administration is asserting the exclusive right to define “rebellion” regardless of the facts on the ground – thus eliminating any real limits on the power to deploy troops domestically – the Trump White House is similarly asserting the unencumbered right to define “terrorist”, along with the corresponding right to take deadly action withvirtually no outside oversight.In public statements, Trump has defended treating drug smugglers as terrorists by citing the harm done by drug overdoses, in effect suggesting that drug traffickers are directly killing US citizens. Ignoring the fact thatVenezuela doesn’t produce fentanyl, the main driver ofoverdoses in the US, Trump has even gone so far as to float the mathematically impossible claim that each boat strikehas saved 25,000 lives. Of course, officials have provided zero public evidence that the boats attacked were carrying drugs at all, much less tried to explain how blowing up boats would have any impact at all on drug abuse in the US.But again, why would they? The whole point of the argument is that such facts don’t matter because Trump simply has the unchecked authority to use lethal force. In fact, thejustice department has suggestedthat officials do not even have to publicly list which foreign organizations are classified as killable terrorists, much less provide evidence to support this designation.Ultimately, Trump’s actions in and aroundVenezuelaare best understood as a new phase in the “war on terror” – an ongoing tragedy that has already had deadly consequences for millions – though now with evenfewerguardrails. The bottom line: Venezuela is not just some chess piece in an abstract game of geopolitics, and we are doing a disservice to humanity if we let war hawks in government and media spin it this way. We are talking about real people, and as very recent history shows, countless lives are at stake.Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS militaryOpinionDonald TrumpVenezuelaTrump administrationUS politicsCaribbeanAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

The image was vivid: flames, tortured souls and a cartoonish devil with a pitchfork.Now that I’m an adult, I know better. Hell is actually a parentWhatsAppgroup.The parent WhatsApp group – known colloquially as Satan’s Slack channel – is one of those parenting surprises no one warns you about. People tell you about the sleepless nights, the lost identity and the toys that reproduce overnight. But no one says:“You’ll one day discuss nits with 30 adults as though global peace depends on it.”What began as a simple way to share school updates has mutated into a relentless stream of chatter. There are simply too many messages. You wake up to messages, you go to sleep to messages, you duck into a meeting and come back to 64 unread notes about sunscreen. Linda has posted the same information seven times because she doesn’t trust anyone to read it. Which, to be fair, is accurate.When I was growing up my parents got information the old-fashioned way: crumpled notes in backpacks and gossip at pickup. They weren’t part of a digital micro-community of helicopter-adjacent strangers debating uniform policy. They didn’t refresh their phones at 9.38pm to discover that it’s going to be Harmony Day and every child needs to wear “something representing their heritage”.No moaning about the teachers and definitely no nudes! How to survive the school WhatsApp groupRead moreMy parents didn’t live in constant communication with other parents. They weren’t expected to be this connected, worrying about real-time reminders. And maybe, I’m going out on a limb here, that distance was healthy.I don’t say this lightly … I thinkWhatsAppis ruining parenting.I don’t think it’s evil, per se. In fact, it’s one of my favourite apps for keeping in touch with friends abroad. But the problem is: it’salways on. School parenting used to happen at drop-off, pickup and during homework battles at the dinner table. Now it happens first thing in the morning in bed, 11 minutes later in the bathroom and while sprinting through Kmart before school to find a T-shirt that screams “my child is Cuban-Italian”.There’s no off switch. Go offline for an hour and suddenly everyone else knows that swimming starts this week, not next, that the assembly has been moved (again), and that Sharon’s selling year 1 tea towels for charity and you were supposed to submit your child’s portrait last Tuesday.These groups are built for people who are permanently available and find deep meaning in the phrase “quick reminder”. They are not built for me. Or anyone with boundaries. Or a child.Here’s the hypocrisy of it all: we limit our kids’ screen time, tell them to be present and post quotes about how “childhood is a short season” to our 600 Instagram followers. Then we feel pressured to check our WhatsApp 16 times a day, watching the theatre of parenting confusion unfold in real time.And it is theatre. The WhatsApp group act is part coordination, part performance. Every “thanks for the reminder” is less about gratitude and more about signalling: “I’m a good parent too, I swear.” Even if I forgot the bake sale once. Or twice. Fine, three times.I’m worried it’s making us all a bit dumber. Because if the information lives in the group, we stop paying real attention. We rely on the collective brain, on someone else (probably Linda) to notice, remind and repost. It’s the parenting equivalent of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Maybe things would be simpler if our only option was talking to people in public.The worst part? I’ve become complicit. I can’t quit. Somewhere along the way, I volunteered to be the WhatsApp rep for my daughter’s class. I haven’t slept properly since.I used to worry about my heart health. Now I worry I’ll die suddenly and come back as the eternal moderator of every year 2 WhatsApp group, trapped forever between reminding people about permission slips and guilt-tripping them about class fundraisers.‘A giant parenting group’: how online comedians are making a living by laughing about the chaos of kidsRead moreAll I want is a note in the backpack or a quick chat at pickup. I’m craving an actual conversation with a teacher instead of ignoring her because I’ve already checked WhatsApp four times between leaving my car and getting to the gate.I want a little space back. A crack in the digital noise. I miss the quiet confidence of not knowing everything all the time. The small mystery of what happens to my kids between drop-off and pickup. The trust that things will be fine, even if I’m not across every single message.Maybe that’s the real lesson of modern parenting? Not to be more connected but to remember that it’s OK to step back.

President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to kickstart a democratic “resurgence”, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, haswarnedof an “axis” of autocratic states targeting liberal democracy in Europe. Havingpromisedto “fight” for what she calls European “values”, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has just announced a new“democracy shield”and aCentre for Democratic Resilienceto prevent foreign interference and deal with external threats. I keep hoping for similar scrutiny of democratic backsliding within the EU – but so far it has not happened.Foreign interference, disinformation and the creepingilliberalism of Hungary, Polandand Slovakia deserve attention. But lost in this fretting is a more inconvenient truth: within Europe’s “mature” democracies, there is a steady corrosion of the rule of law, a degradation of political discourse and the normalisation of racism, xenophobia and discrimination.Growing up in a country where democracy was fragile and frequently interrupted, I learned early that the issue is not merely about elections. It is about the quality of governance and of politicians. It depends on protecting human rights and dignity, ensuring social justice, respecting minorities – and minority views – and creating a genuine sense of belonging for all citizens.That is why I am troubled when EU governments and political elites undermine the rule of law, constrain free speech, normalise police violence and ignore signs that racism and xenophobia have seeped into public life. Across the bloc, the demonisation of racialised refugees and migrants has become common. Ironically, even as they champion democratic renewal, Merz, Macron and von der Leyen are chipping away at the very values they claim to defend.When Merzurged journaliststo “ask your daughters” about why Germany’s changing “cityscape” threatens their security, he did more thaninfantilise German women. He activated toxic colonial and orientalist tropes of Black and brown men as violent, hypersexual, uncivilised aggressors, as bodies to be policed, controlled and deported. Though he lateracknowledgedmigrants’ economic contributions, the damage was done. Merz moved Germany’sOverton windowon what is considered acceptable in political discourse, thereby giving more oxygen to the far right.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz and Ursula von der Leyen at the G20 summit, Johannesburg, 22 November 2025.Photograph: Michael Kappeler Pool/Shutterstock/dts News Agency GermanyIn France, too, Macron’s legacy will be marked not only by his attempts at liberal reforms but by hislegitimisation of far-right narratives. By echoing Marine Le Pen’s rhetoric on national identity, Islam and migration, Macron has normalised what was once unsayable for centrists. The far-right National Rally now stands as a respectable government-in-waiting precisely because the so-called liberal centre helped embed its ideas in the mainstream.A similar dynamic is playing out within EU institutions. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni may have set the shameful example byoutsourcingthe processing of asylum seekers to Albania, but it is the European Commission that hasincorporated deportationas a legitimate policy tool in the EU’s new migration pact – and von der Leyen who keeps signingmigration-deterrencedeals with regimes such as those in Tunisia and Egypt that areaccusedof abuse and torture.Israel’s genocide in Gaza has laid bare the many ways in whichthe EU is in violationof its own norms and principles, as well as in flagrant breach of its obligations underinternational lawto prevent and punish genocide. In Germany, police forces have beencondemned by UN expertsfor criminalising and suppressinglegitimate Palestinian solidarityactivism. In Belgium, the use of teargas, batons and water cannon against peaceful protesters outside the European parliamentprompted callsfor an investigation from Amnesty International. EU institutions are quick to condemn state violence in other parts of the world, but are silent when it occurs within their own borders.After every European election, we reassure ourselves that the “centre is holding”. The reality is that whether in national governments or in the European parliament, far-right parties areincreasingly shapingthe European agenda. The conservative European People’s party has grown ever-more comfortable forming majorities with far-right groups, especially on environmental policy. Politicians across Europe are adopting far-right talking points on migration and Muslims. The excuse is always that this is being done to contain the hardliners, even thoughstudies consistently showthat such mimicry amplifies and normalises extremism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spain’s Pedro Sánchez has shown moral clarity on Gaza and adopted a national migration policy which isrooted in dignityand solidarity. In the Netherlands, Rob Jetten of the centre-left D66, expected to lead a new coalition, ran on a platform of hope rather than hate and spoke out against Israel’s genocide. The UK Green party’s Zack Polanski and Ireland’s new president Catherine Connolly are helping to revive a progressive political discourse in their countries. And across the Atlantic, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, a proud son of immigrants and unapologetic advocate for justice, housing and solidarity, has demonstrated that democracy’s vitality depends on moral courage and inclusive coalitions – and that racial and religious identity can be a source of pride.European leaders should take note that, even as the EU arms itself with a “democracy shield”, strengthening democratic resilience is not only about fighting external threats, adversaries and disinformation. It is also about building inclusive democracy at home, dismantling racism, ensuring equality and creating a sense of belonging for all European citizens.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

Well, that’s according to American journalist Helen Andrews, who popularised this thesisin a speechto the National Conservatism conference in Washington DC.The idea is that too many women in the workplace, and in positions of power, has led to the dominance of stereotypical feminine values, to the detriment of everyone. Girly things like conflict resolution rather than manly plain speaking, fussy HR departments, or a lack of healthy aggressive competition, have all created an imbalance in the workplace and in the world, suppressing stereotypical masculine values. Andrews fears for her sons and their future in the feminised world that she believes threatens us all.The thesis makes two fundamental errors. First, stereotypes attached to femininity don’t represent all women, any more than stereotypes about masculinity define all men. Second, nobody needs a feminised world, whatever that nonsense even means, but we all need a feminist world. There’s a big difference.For centuries, it was policy to keep women out of education and most professions, although women have, of course, always worked – in agriculture, in factories, or in service to rich people. Much of this was not in the formal economy, it was cash in hand. Work like childcare, washing or sewing was done at home, rather than in the public sphere. Yet work has always been gendered as masculine, because formal, paid employment outside the home has been seen as the preserve of men. So work comes to define masculinity, and therefore men, being viewed as core to men’s identity.It is not only conservatives making these kinds of arguments. Scott Galloway, an American academic and author of a much-discussed new book, Notes on Being a Man, hassummarised masculinitythus: “getting up at fucking six in the morning and going to work and doing shitty work such that you can protect your family economically”. In his book, he links falling wages and unemployment rates with a crisis in masculinity, and in men’s sense of identity. While he doesn’t argue for women’s removal from the workplace, he does frame these issues – that affect everyone, across the labour market – as male concerns.The real problem facing men is that, like femininity, masculinity is still defined by backward stereotypes about what men should be. These stereotypes – including visible signifiers of financial success, respect and seniority in the workplace and public sphere – have always been put out of reach for many men, and perhaps now for most. A new report,The State of UK Men, from Beyond Equality, revealed that 88% of the men surveyed believed that being a man means providing financially for your family – and just over half felt it was more important that men, rather than women, were the breadwinners. However, 40% reported that their income was not enough to meet their daily needs, and more than half constantly worried about their financial future.View image in fullscreenScott Galloway during Vox Media’s Pivot Tour event at Sydney Goldstein Theatre, San Francisco, 13 November 2025.Photograph: Kimberly White/Getty Images for Vox MediaWomen face these same economic challenges. The same survey found that equal numbers of men and women lack any sense of purpose or meaning in their life. The gender pay gap in the UK is around13% across all employeesand women are still more likely than men to be in part-time work, traditionally lower paid. Women are also more likely to be heads of households and raising children; they are what charities such as the Women’s Budget Group call the main “shock absorbers” of poverty.The violence of poverty affects everyone, yet society responds with peculiar sympathy and grief when men face barriers to success in the arenas we have picked out to define their worth. This is what I call the masculinity burden. Attacks on men’s income, employment or job security are viewed not only as challenging in a human way, as they would be for anyone, but doubly challenging because they are portrayed as attacks on, and affronts to, masculinity itself. From this perspective, it is not that 50% of theexperiences of precarity– women’s – are not seen; it’s that they are just not seen as being as bad for women, because women don’t carry this extra burden of masculinity.The gendered effects of life experiences, such as redundancy or low pay, are clearly real. The State of UK Men finds that work and stable finances are still very much classed as the measure of men’s worth, leading to failure feeling like an existential threat. This is the pain and shame of not meeting gendered expectations.Womenare no strangers to this either, in the ceaseless pressure of beauty standards attached to femininity, the presumption of motherhood and judgments about mothering, or in status being attached to male partners. The expectations can be different, but it’s the gendered rules that are the problem, rigging the game for us all, setting us up for failure in one area or another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is what men say they want, too: one of the many positives from the report is that 83% of men believe in sharing housework and care with their partner, and 80% want practical support to help fathers be more present in family life. These policies would help everyone – not just at work, but out in the world, because all of us have human needs to give and receive love and care in our families and communities. If you want to call that feminised, then so be it.

But a group of nations led by Colombia and the Netherlands offer hopeGenevieve Guenther is the founding director of End Climate SilenceMon 24 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 11.05 ESTShareThe 30th conference of the parties (Cop30), the annual climate summit of all nations party to the UNFCCC,just ended. Stakeholders are out in the media trying spin the outcome as a win. Simon Stiell, climate change executive secretary for the UN is, for instance,praisingCop30for showing that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking, keeping humanity in the fight for a liveable planet”. But let us be clear. The conference was a failure. Its outcome,the decision textknown as the Global Mutirão or Global Collective Effort, is, in essence, a form of climate denial.In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC)determined that the worldhad already developed, or planned to develop, too much fossil fuel to be able to halt global heating at 2C. It acknowledged that the capital assets built up around fossil fuels must be stranded – that is to say, abandoned and not used – if warming was to be limited to 2C. But the Cop30 decision text ignores all this. Indeed, it never even mentions fossil fuels.This failure is all the more bitter because Cop30 had initially sent out so many hopeful signals that it would finally tackle the “transitioning away from fossil fuels”pledge from Cop28. Speaking ahead of the conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said thatthe world needs“roadmaps that will enable humankind, in a fair and planned manner, to overcome its dependence on fossil fuels”.Lula’s call was backed by about90 other nations. “This is a global coalition, with global north and global south countries coming together and saying with one voice: this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet,” said the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.After a press conference where20 ministers and climate envoys demandedthat the proposed language on the roadmap in the first draft text be “strengthened” and adopted, the EUcirculated its own proposalfor incorporating the roadmap in the final text.By Friday, the number of countries supporting the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout rose to 89. Yet any reference to it disappeared from the second draft that dropped on the same day. Thanks toCop30, the fossil fuel era will simply continue.It seems clear that the petrostates, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, fought against fossil fuel phaseout and won. If they feel the phaseout is an existential threat to their economies and their sovereignty, perhaps they should consider how the climate crisis is rendering the Middle East uninhabitable. The very week of Cop30, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced that Tehran, Iran’s capital city of 16 million,would need to be abandonedand re-established elsewhere, because, after years of climate-fuelled drought, its water has finally run out.Surely these states are being supported in their fossil-fuel authoritarianism by Donald Trump, who is the president of the world’s largest producer of fossil fuels and who calls the climate crisis a “con job”. Even though the US was officially absent from the negotiations, Trump’salliance with Saudi Arabia, and seeming affinity for Russia, underwrites their ability to advance their own energy interests.Yet would this power be as great if the world’s “climate leaders” had more courage? It is remarkable that at the very moment the EU was supposedly fighting to include a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout in the Cop decision, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, wastelling a press conferenceat the G20 that “we are not fighting fossil fuels, we are fighting theemissionsfrom fossil fuels.” Not only does this statement directly undermine her own negotiators’ positions, it is in itself nonsensical – akin to saying “we are not giving up eating ice-cream, we are giving up absorbing the calories from that ice-cream.”More to the point, von der Leyen’s language echoed nearly verbatim the words of Osama Faqeeha, deputy environment minister for Saudi Arabia, whotold a journalistasking about the Cop30 roadmap that “the issue is the emissions, it’s not the fuel”. It has long beenthe position of the Saudisthat the world could continue to use fossil fuels and simply remove the economy’s 600m metric tonnes of annual carbon-dioxide emissions with carbon-dioxide removal. But this is nothing more than fossil-fuel propaganda.For one thing, the amount of CO2 that can be stored safely undergroundis limited. That the president of the commission repeats such nonsense reveals why attempts like Cop30 repeatedly fail: so-called climate leaders in fact evince deep ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels, ultimately unifying global climate politics around the lie that we can keep using fossil fuels and still deal with the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Isn’t China becoming the world’s first electrostate, stepping into the role of global climate leader with the US embracing fossil authoritarianism? Well, China seems to be ambivalent too, at least for now. Chinadid not block the texton the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout, but neither did it fight to make sure it was included. Despite its dominance in solar, wind and electric vehicles, China acts less as a climate leader and more as an “all of the above” energy powerhouse, devoted first and foremost to its own economic development.One bright spot of Cop30 is that Colombia and the Netherlands, backed by 22 nations, willindependently advance a roadmapto fossil fuel phaseout, beginning with a conferencein April 2026. This conference could be a gamechanger. UN rules require all Cop decision texts to be approved unanimously, giving the petrostates veto power over global climate politics. The creation of a fossil-fuel roadmap outside the Cop process may establish a trading bloc that could begin to sanction nations – and banks – that refuse to wind down fossil fuels.Such a bloc will have no power if its leaders are not forced to resolve their ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels. And that’s where you and I come in. All of us must do our part and subject world leaders to extreme and relentless public pressure. The challenge of stranding potentially trillions of dollars in fossil capital and rebuilding the world is enormous. Of course, global leaders and officials will take the easier, cowardly road if they can get away with it. As we cross the 1.5C threshold into uncharted climatic territory, we must make them fight wholeheartedly for fossil fuel phaseout. In the end, it is up to us to create a global politics that will finally save the world for our children.Genevieve Guenther is the founding director of End Climate Silence, and the author of The Language of Climate PoliticsExplore more on these topicsCop30OpinionFossil fuelsClimate crisisRussiaSaudi ArabiaEuropean UnionEnergycommentShareReuse this content"

I think a pretty clear picture of the man emergesMon 24 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 14.03 ESTShareWhen I see theallegations of racismagainst Nigel Farage from his schooldays, I can’t say I am greatly surprised. There are those who believe that the Reform UK leader’s persona must have been developed to win over working-class voters, or the “red wall”. I know that it is quite in keeping with the sentiments expressed by plenty of young men in elite institutions like English public schools – the kind of men who run the world.Farage was educated at Dulwich college from 1975 to 1982; there, fellow students have told the Guardian, he allegedly used racist insults about fellow pupils and sang a song with the lyrics “Gas ’em all”. I attended Eton a couple of decades later, but the attitudes of some of the people I encountered there were not very different. One pupil, having fallen out with me over some perceived slight, boasted thathis great-grandfather was a slave driver. A Jewish friend who was there with me at the same time told me how common it was to hear “Jew” or “rabbi” being used to describe anyone who was thought to be mean with their money. When I later saw Old Etonian Boris Johnsonreferring to black peopleas “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”, I thought back to the peers of mine who would erupt into rants filled with racist stereotypes whenever they saw the West Indies cricket team on the TV.But there is another reason I am not surprised when I read about Farage’s alleged teenage behaviour. As grim as these stories are, just look at the damage that Faragehas gone on to do as an adult, and the company he hasgone on to keep. If you were looking in the school yearbook, wondering “where are they now?”, then under his entry you would want to add: “He inspired the country on a tide of xenophobia to leave the EU, a decision that most of the countryeither regrets or outright hates, and afterwards went abroad to get a standing ovation from the German far right”. What has truly changed since Farage’s schooldays is the society around him. We will get back to that in a moment.For now, though, I am thinking about school. I don’t know what Farage was like when he was a teenager, but – in my own regrettable experience, and as I am reliably informed – the majority of people who expressed racist worldviews at school and university have not moved away from those opinions with age. If anything, they have become significantly more extreme in their outlook, viewing the era of Trump and Musk with relish.And why wouldn’t they? Not only have several of my former classmates retreated behind their walls and gates, they are now fuelled by the various algorithms that send a never-ending stream of loathing to their smartphones. Just as a mosquito requires stagnant pools of water in which to thrive, so their stagnant social circles provide the perfect breeding ground for increasingly toxic strands of bigotry. I was recently at a university reunion and it was striking to see one man, who has somehow gone on to scale even greater heights of racial prejudice than in his student days, surrounded as if he were a returning hero. Most disappointing was to see an old and close friend voice deep and growing enthusiasm for the politics of Johnson.Almost as disappointing was to hear of Farage’s visit to my old school and to hear that, in the words of one onlooker,Eton boys had cheeredFarage’s “worst comments on migrants and Covid”, and had subjected visiting girls to “racial slurs” and “misogynistic comments”. When I saw this quote, my sympathies went immediately to the students of migrant heritage in that environment, especially the visibly foreign ones. The college said it had apologised “unreservedly” for the “totally unacceptable” behaviour, but it is difficult to understand what other outcome they expected. This is what Farage does; this is his skill. When it comes to stoking hatred, Farage is what is referred to in the football world – a world that, for shameless political gain, he is nowpretending to understand– as a generational talent. He is a Pied Piper, leading his followers to a future that – for now, at least –they find absolutely exhilarating.Where, though, is his vision of immigration leading the UK? To answer that we can look tothe actionsof senior members of the current government, who have already bent their policies to his will. The mood they have created is so sour that, as reported by the Guardian, “record numbers of overseas-trained doctorsare quitting the UK, leaving the NHS at risk of huge gaps in its workforce, with hostility towards migrants blamed for the exodus.” For the longest time, the approach by European politicians such as Farage has been “if you don’t like it, then leave”. It should be no surprise that, increasingly, the response is “with pleasure”.We return, now, to how the society around Farage has changed. We have long had a media culture that prefers its political shows to bepopulated by entertainersrather than experts, and that trend has accelerated in recent years. We are also now in an era when, every single day, the richest personin modern history– who, according to The New Yorker, is responsible through aid cuts for the deaths ofhundreds of thousands of human beings– wakes up and amplifies themost extreme far-right contentfrom the biggest communication platform the world has known, a platform he solely owns. In the UK, the soaring economic inequalities – supercharged by Brexit – have led to such scarcity that many voters areturning against those arrivingin the country, blaming them for trying to steal more of a shrinking pie.Of course, it is in Farage’s interests to stop people from focusing on who is actually using the bulk of resources, because the greediest consumers are some of his funders and friends. Farage’s ultimate message is simple:open borders for the super-rich, closed borders for everyone else. It’s not quite as catchy a slogan as “take back control”, but, as the reality of his true position becomes clearer, it may just take flight. If that does happen, then we will be able to say that the adults in the UK are finally taking Farage as seriously as several of his classmates always have.Musa Okwonga is an author and football podcaster based in BerlinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The two are inseparable: her story justifies the crackdown. It moralises the crackdown. And it silences criticism of the crackdown. Sold as an origin story from within an immigrant and racialised experience, the purpose is to imbue her politics with sacred authenticity – the credibility of the first person. It is clever and effective. It is cynical and disgraceful.“I am the child of immigrants” is how Mahmood now starts her fable. Immigrants who came here legally. She goes on to tell us that immigration is tearing this country apart, and proposes policies that mean UK-born children, who have known no life anywhere else,will be deported. As she launches policies that willleave refugees homelessand without support, tear families apart, punish those legally in the country for claiming any benefits and make settlement and security a long and arduous process,Mahmood declares: “this is a moral mission for me”.A test of logic for sure, but the story can help. You see, after being accused of “stoking division” with “immoderate language”, Mahmood says “unfortunately, I am the one who is regularly called a ‘fucking Paki’ and told to ‘go back home’.” Sheknows –better than virtue-signalling white people – what the trenches actually look like. And so she must protect immigrants by hurting them. In her telling, racism and xenophobia seem not themselves objectively bad things that must be combatted, but a natural outcome that occurs when too many rights are given to immigrants and asylum seekers. If only they had fewer rights, then people wouldn’t hate them so muchand we would hit some golden ratio where everyone will be happier. Because immigration perception and immigration reality are famously aligned things.Credulous observers will quiver in the face of her personal conviction. Whatever you think of her politics, you’ve got to see that she means it. Because how can she not? She is brown and the daughter of immigrants! Let me break it to you gently: it is entirely possible for people of colour and the descendants of immigrants to be disingenuous and use their identities as excuses for their terrible politics. The former Conservative home secretary Suella Bravermandedicated her maiden speechin parliament to her father and mother, both immigrants. And yet, she later said “I would love to be having a front page of the Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda. That’s my dream, it’s an obsession”.Mahmood is not a novelty, just an addition to the ranks of Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Priti Patel and even Rishi Sunak, who in various forms used their identities to dictate what the correct immigration and race politics should be, because they’ve been there. Mahmood is just the firstLabourpolitician to do so. Her contribution reveals two things. One is mundane, the other is structural. First, there is nothing unusual or new about immigrants creating different, lower classes of immigrants and then separating themselves from them: legal v illegal; working and housed v needing benefits; assimilated v ghettoised. But here is the structural part: being a politician of immigrant background is a powerful thing in a country utterly banjaxed by immigration discourse.This is a sort of late-stage identity politics. A way in which the victim narrative so condemned by critics of “wokeness” remains holy and unquestionable when it is used for a purpose that isn’t equality. It’s using identity as a way to elevate and uphold stories that can be wielded in the service of authority, not to challenge it.It takes a prodigious amount of stupidity or ignorance not to see that the home secretary provides that important service, at a time when the nation is riven by racism and xenophobia. Reform UK is ascendant, and the Labour government is trying to outflank the right while trying not to look enormously racist and xenophobic while doing so. Enter Mahmood to reassure you that it is, in fact, a sort of kindness to force children on to planes andeye up itemsthat are not of “sentimental value” so that asylum seekers can contribute to their costs. Enter Mahmood to collapse all sorts of categories together, in one instance saying division is caused by asylum seekers, in anothersaying it is causedby the high recent rate of net immigration, expanding the numbers of people that need to be slapped with harsher conditions so they don’t force the public to become racist.And it also requires a very short memory to believe that Mahmood is acting out of evangelist conviction, rather than convenience when, not too long ago, she supported ageneral amnesty for undocumented workerswho have been living in the UK for 10 years, and in 2020called on the Tory governmentto halt a deportation flight. She nowvows to fight“vexatious last-minute claims” that “frustrate” removals.But to show you the allure of being an anti-immigration immigrant, this will not be seen as a cynical reversal but, as the Spectator puts it,as a conversion–a final seeing of the light. And who cares about the embarrassing optics of it all, when the reward is Mahmood’s admission into the ranks of the contenders, the players? Much has been written, since her two-story debut, of the “new hardwoman of British politics”, theproponent of “Mahmoodism”, a devout outsider driven by conviction politics, thenext prime minister. Michael Gove is barely able tocontain his excitementat the minister he considers “far and away the most impressive person in the Labour government”.There is a sort of gamified glee to it all. The contrast between the pain Mahmood is about to inflict on some of the most vulnerable and desperate – exemplified by the flippant “sorry, we’re closing!” imagery thataccompanied her announcementthat asylum hotels will be shuttered – and the excitement she has triggered in the political discourse, tells its own story. Mahmood is here to provide the answer, to absolve. To free the country from its anxieties about immigration and race. To turn away from the hard work of confronting the economic failure, cultural capitulation and cowardice that has enabled the rise of the far right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This requires a rapid phase-out. It’s physicsSun 23 Nov 2025 20.44 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Nov 2025 22.10 ESTShareWith another set of global climate talks behind us, the Australian government faces some tricky tasks before it takes over negotiations at the next round of talks next year in Turkey.Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, did not deliver the bold fossil fuel phase-out roadmap we needed, but it did nudge the system forward with more scrutiny of fossil fuel producers.And despite the weakness of the outcome, one can gain some important comfort by the fact that Bélem – and the G20 in Johannesburg at the weekend – both solidly endorsed the Paris agreement, its central goal of keeping warming to 1.5C and the importance of net zero emissions.Cop30 agreed that an “ambition accelerator” will be needed to fill the gap between what governments are planning (projected to warm the world by 2.6C) and the agreed guardrails of the Paris agreement: a limit of 1.5C.It also, crucially, began the momentum for developing a roadmap for a just transition away from fossil fuels, with more than 80 countries – including Australia – signing the“Belém declaration”on a transition away from fossil fuels.While this declaration didn’t get support from the whole conference, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has promised to move forward on its implementation during the course of this year, until he hands over toCop31in Turkey.And there, Australia,under its deal with Turkey, will take over that momentum.Australia fiddles with fossil gas while the country swelters in record heat. It doesn’t make sense | Bill HareRead moreBut there are significant questions as to whether the government will be able – or more importantly willing – to move this momentum for a fossil fuel phase-out forward.This is especially so given that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, hasjust doubled downon his patently false claim that gas is needed for the energy transition.The International Energy Agencyreleased its annual reportin the first week of Cop30. Its net zero emissions pathway confirms our concerns about Australian gas. The IEA’s new net zero scenario clearly states there is no need for new long-lead oil and gas projects, or coalmines.It says fossil gas use needs to reduce quickly to 40% below today’s levels by 2035. Importantly, it also warns that a massive glut of liquefied natural gas supply is developing, a glut that is consistent with the IEA’s current policy scenario that would warm the world by 3C by 2100.Gas is not needed to replace coal, andis not doing soacross Asia – the destination for the vast majority of Australian fossil gas exports.Add to this the leaked Deloitte draft report to the Western Australian governmentthat warnedAustralia’s gas export bonanza to Asia would crowd out renewables and lock in CO2emissions for years to come.Yet yesterday theprime minister was still dancing around this question, saying Australia’s gas would be needed as a backup to renewables but also that this “firming” would not require any new gas fields and should see the government move toward a phase-out of the massive export program it has approved all the way to 2070.The truth is that much less gas is going to be needed to “firm” renewables, as grid-scale battery technologies take over the market.In the next breath Albanese confirmed that his government would continue to allow new gas fields to go ahead, just as he allowed the massive North West Shelf development go ahead to 2070.These two statements are in direct contradiction with each other and do not bode well for the prospect of his government moving forward a global agreement that aims to get the world to transition away from fossil fuels.The IEA has also confirmed that carbon capture and storage is not the magic bullet Australia claims it is to deal with fossil gas emissions. Indeedour work showsthat if Asian countries – and Australia – continue with expansion plans for deploying CCS, they could add an extra 25bn tonnes of CO2emissions to the atmosphere by 2050.There are many in Australia’s political scene who ask, what does all of this have to do with us?For those who love Australia’s bush, forests, coral reefs, marine life and ecosystems, I would say nearly everything. Because all of this depends on keeping warming to 1.5C.This month we’ve also seen reports emerge of massive coral mortality at Ningaloo reef, caused by climate change-fuelled marine heatwaves. This reef and others like it are finished unless we can get fossil fuels phased out quickly and achieve net zero CO2in the next 25 years or so.It’s physics. Getting to net zero CO2globally means we can halt global warming.And getting to net zero CO2means rapidly phasing out fossil fuels. There’s simply no other way.Net zero is an insidious loophole that distracts from the scientific imperative to eliminate fossil fuels | Joëlle GergisRead moreAustralia cannot continue to develop and expand fossil fuel exports and pretend it’s going to be a renewable superpower supporting a 1.5C limit.These contradictions will come into sharp focus over the next year and they are likely to get increasingly dangerous for the Albanese government as people wake up to the climate catastrophe unfolding around them, while watching their government fumble on the world stage.Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the chief executive of Climate AnalyticsExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseGreenhouse gas emissionsCop30Cop31Global climate talkscommentShareReuse this content"

What this masterpiece reveals about the rogue geniusIn three thrilling works by Caravaggio, the same boy’s face crops up. As one – the astonishing Victorious Cupid – arrives in Britain, we ask: who was this anarchic model and muse?Jonathan JonesMon 24 Nov 2025 10.49 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 13.33 ESTShareThe boy howls as his head is held down, a huge thumb pressing into his cheek as his father’s mighty hand holds him by the neck. This is The Sacrifice of Isaac and I am looking at it in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, feeling distressed by howCaravaggiohas so chillingly rendered the face of this suffering child from the biblical tale. It looks as if Abraham, who has been told by God to kill his son, could break his neck with just one twist. Yet Abraham’s preferred method is with the silvery grey knife he holds in his other hand, ready to slit Isaac’s throat. One thing’s for certain – whoever posed as Isaac for this astonishing work was a great actor. There is not just dread, shock and pleading in his darkened eyes but also grief that a guardian could betray him so utterly.Standing in front of the painting, I know this is a real face, an accurate record of a young model, because the same boy – recognisable by his tousled hair and almost black eyes – appears in two other paintings by Caravaggio. In each, that richly expressive face steals the show. In John the Baptist, he looks mischievously out of the shadows while cuddling a ram. In Victorious Cupid, he grins with a hardness learned on Rome’s streets, his black feathery wings demonic, a naked kid running riot in a well-to-do house.He took a familiar biblical story and made it so fresh and raw that its horrors seemed to happen in front of youVictorious Cupid, which goes on show this weekat the Wallace Collection in London, is the most embarrassing masterpiece ever painted. You feel totally thrown looking at it. Cupid, the god of love whose arrows fill people with often painful desire, is depicted as a very real, brightly lit nude, straddling toppled-over objects that include stringed instruments, a music manuscript, plate armour and an architect’s T-square. This pile of stuff resembles, deliberately, the mathematical and architectural gear scattered across the floor in Albrecht Dürer’s engraving Melencolia I – except here, the melancholic mess is caused by this grinning Cupid and the mayhem he can unleash.View image in fullscreenShock, dread and pleading … Caravaggio’s The Sacrifice of Isaac.Illustration: Heritage Images/Getty Images“Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, / And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind,” wrote Shakespeare, just before this was painted in around 1601. But Caravaggio’s Cupid is not blind. He looks right at you. That face – ironic and ruddy-cheeked, staring with brazen confidence as he struts naked – is the same one that screams in terror in The Sacrifice of Isaac.When Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio painted his three images of the same funny-looking kid in Rome at the start of the 17th century, he was the most acclaimed religious artist in a city enflamed by Catholic revival. The Sacrifice of Isaac shows why he was in demand to decorate churches: he could take a biblical story that had been depicted many times before and make it so fresh, so raw and visceral that the horror seemed to be happening right in front of you.Yet there was another side to Caravaggio, apparent as soon as he arrived in Rome in the winter that ended 1592, as a painter in his early 20s with no teacher or patron in the city, just skill and audacity. Most of the paintings with which he caught the holy city’s eye were anything but holy. What may be the very earliest hangs in London’s National Gallery. A youth opens his crimson lips in a yell of pain: while reaching out his filthy fingers for a cherry, he has instead been attacked. Boy Bitten By a Lizard is sensuality amid squalor: you can see Caravaggio’s dismal chamber reflected in the murky waters of the glass vase.View image in fullscreenWilderness or bedroom? … Caravaggio’s John the Baptist (Youth With a Ram).Illustration: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThe boy wears a pink flower in his hair – a symbol of the sex trade in Renaissance art. Venetian artists such as Titian and Palma Vecchio portrayed courtesans holding flowers and, in a work destroyed in the second world war but known through photographs, Caravaggio portrayed a famous female courtesan, Fillide Melandroni, holding a posy to her chest. The message of all these floral signifiers is clear: sex for sale.What are we to make of Caravaggio’s sensual depictions of boys – and of one boy in particular? It is a question that has divided his interpreters ever since he achieved mega-fame in the 1980s. The complex historical reality is that the artist was neither the queer hero that, for example, Derek Jarman put on screen inhis 1986 film Caravaggio, nor so completely pious that, as some art historians improbably claim, his Boy With a Basket of Fruit is actually a portrait of Jesus.His early paintings do make explicit sexual suggestions, or even offers. It’s as if Caravaggio, then a penniless young painter, identified with Rome’s sex workers, selling himself to survive. In the Uffizi, with this thought in mind, I turn to another early work, the 1596 masterpiece Bacchus, in which the god of wine stares coolly at you as he starts to undo the black ribbon of his robe.A few years after Bacchus, what could have driven Caravaggio to paint Victorious Cupid for the art collector Vincenzo Giustiniani, when he was finally becoming almost respectable with prestigious church commissions? This unholy pagan god resurrects the sexual provocations of his early works but in a more intense, uneasy way. Half a century later, its secret seemed obvious: it was a portrait of Caravaggio’s lover. The British traveller Richard Symonds saw Victorious Cupid in about 1649 and was told its subject has “the body & face of [Caravaggio’s] owne boy or servant that laid with him”. The name of this boy was Cecco.The painter had been dead for about 40 years when Symonds heard this. Similar tales had circulated about Italian artists in the past. It was claimed the sculptor Donatello was obsessively in love with an apprentice, which makes sense if you have ever seen his nude bronze David. But was the story just a way of rationalising the suggestiveness of Donatello’s statue? Giorgio Vasari, the painter and historian, even gossips that Leonardo da Vinci “took for his assistant the Milanese Salaì, who was most comely in grace and beauty, having fine locks curling in ringlets, in which Leonardo greatly delighted”.View image in fullscreenFloral signal … Boy Bitten by a Lizard.Illustration: DEA/G Nimatallah/De Agostini/Getty ImagesWas Caravaggio’s Cecco a fable? No – for, as we have seen, the boy in this painting was the painter’s regular model in the early 1600s, which fits with him being on hand in the artist’s home, as pupil and servant. In all three paintings, he has incredible presence and individuality – performing, you might almost say, for the camera, but in reality for his master. And in two of the paintings, he is stark naked.The most intimate, though, is John the Baptist. As John embraces a ram with curly horns, he sits on a red blanket cushioned with white pillows and comfy fur, his body raked by light that catches his legs and shoulders while his penis is in the shadows, though still visible. It’s meant to be a wilderness but feels more like a bedroom, one that he looks out from relaxed, not in the least embarrassed. Meanwhile, the ram gazes at him, dotes on him. Could this lovestruck face be Caravaggio portraying himself as the horned, devilish beast?That would certainly fit with how Caravaggio’s enemy, the artist Giovanni Baglione, saw him. In 1602, this much less talented rival painted Sacred and Profane Love, a riposte to Victorious Cupid, setting himself up as the Christian antithesis to Caravaggio’s satanic excesses. Baglione depicts the angel of sacred love stepping between a red-fleshed devil with Caravaggio’s features and his “catamite”. The angelic saviour looks lovingly down on the youth while the Caravaggio-faced demon rages at being denied the object of his lust. It’s a vicious parody of Victorious Cupid that makes a dangerous accusation: Caravaggio is a sodomite and his Cupid is his victim.Caravaggio hit back. He and his friend, the artist Orazio Gentileschi, posted rude poems about Baglione in the streets of Rome, accusing him – justifiably – of being a lousy painter. Baglione in turn accused them of libel and took them to court. In his testimony, Gentileschi mentioned that Caravaggio had recently visited his house to borrow a pair of strap-on wings, presumably the ones Victorious Cupid wears.View image in fullscreenA riposte … Caravaggio is depicted as a raging demon in Sacred and Profane Love by Baglione Giovanni.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty ImagesCaravaggio lost the case and was dogged by more charges for violent crimes, until he had to flee Rome after killing a man in 1606. But his untamed genius inspired an artistic movement across the continent. His radical, brutal style, stark use of light, and tough everyday stories caught the imaginations of young artists across Europe, from Orazio’s daughter Artemisia Gentileschi to Georges de la Tour, Diego Velázquez and the Caravaggisti of Utrecht. And, of course, there was Cecco del Caravaggio, as he became known.Whatever else Caravaggio did to Cecco – we will obviously never know – he trained him as a painter. Symonds refers to the model for Cupid as an artist in his own right: “Checco del Caravaggio tis calld among the painters”. Cecco’s Interior With a Young Man Holding a Recorder, in Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum, incorporates a skilful array of objects, including fruit and musical instruments, very much in Caaravaggio’s mode. Even more Caravaggesque is a vessel containing water in which we see distorted reflections, echoing Boy Bitten By a Lizard.View image in fullscreenA haunting, haunted face … Caravaggio put his own features on to the severed head in David with the Head of Goliath.Photograph: incamerastock/AlamyDo we need to know about the private lives of artists? Vasari thought so. For some experts on baroque art, the idea that Caravaggio went around Catholic Rome flaunting his sinful life is unbelievable – yet his paintings do exactly that. What we can’t do is call him gay or queer in any comfortable sense. The past is another country and they desired differently there. The latest serious historical studies of sex relations between males in early modern Italy show that, despite the proscriptions of church and court, there was a lot of it going on.The historian Michael Rocke has found that, during a 70-year period of the 15th century, 13,000 men in Florence – a city with a population of 40,000 – were accused of sodomy. And those who were convicted usually got off with a fine, often “offending” again. But the convention was that mature men desired younger males: Leonardo with Salaì, Caravaggio with Cecco. As Caravaggio’s English contemporary Christopher Marlowe is reported to have said: “They that love not Tobacco and Boys are fools.” This strange, disturbing country of the past is what Caravaggio shoves in your face.Even in that world, Caravaggio was close to the edge and it is there that his art thrives, on a sword-edge of danger. He exhibits his “boy” Cecco in ways that openly defied the church and was called out for this by Baglione. Caravaggio is like Satan, says Baglione’s riposte to his Cupid: he is sin personified.Four hundred years on, we might make more sense of the incredible painting that is coming to the Wallace Collection if we simply use that old word, sin. Caravaggio’s paintings shudder and provoke with sin – the supposedly sinful pleasures of sweet grapes, red wine and sex. He came to see himself as a great sinner. And he was: a murderer who spent his last years on the run, trying to atone with his art.His quest for redemption, by painting altarpieces in southern Italy, plunged him into self-scrutinising reveries. He painted his own face on to the severed head of Goliath, held up by the boy David. It is a haunting, haunted face: Caravaggio imagines himself punished even after death, his eyelids slumped, his mouth open, as his head is held up by the young avenger. For his sins.Caravaggio’s Victorious Cupid is atthe Wallace Collection, London, from 26 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designCaravaggioPaintingExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An itinerant ambassador who introduced the music and culture of his island to audiences across the world at a time when reggae was largely unknown, he was a pioneer with a distinctive high tenor voice whose themes of civil and human rights resonated with many.The stirring optimism of his orchestratedWonderful World, Beautiful Peoplespent 13 weeks in the British singles charts in 1969, peaking at No 6, and his causticVietnam, in the same year, was a favourite of Bob Dylan’s that inspired Paul Simon to later record Mother and Child Reunion in Jamaica with the same backing band, after Dylan made him aware of it.But perhaps his most famous song wasMany Rivers to Cross, also from 1969, which he wrote about the frustrations of trying to make it in the music business. Although it never commanded a high chart position, the song became a well-recognised anthem, and was rerecorded by many artists, including John Lennon,Percy Sledge,Cher,Joe Cockerand UB40.Cliff’s other great claim to fame was his portrayal of Ivan inPerry Henzell’s groundbreaking 1972 feature film,The Harder They Come, which brought aspects of his own story into cinematic focus through improvised dialogue based on his life experiences.View image in fullscreenJimmy Cliff in the groundbreaking film The Harder They Come, 1972.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockHe contributed four songs to the soundtrack, including his enduringly popular compositionYou Can Get It If You Really Want, which reached No 2 in the UK singles chart; the title track,The Harder They Come;and the soulfulSitting in Limbo. The Harder They Come was the only song specifically written for the soundtrack; everything else had been recorded before the film was conceived.He was born James Chambers in Adelphi, an impoverished hillside community in the district of Somerton, near Montego Bay inJamaica, where his father, Lilbert, was a tailor, farmer and community leader and his mother, Christine – who was a Maroon descended from escaped slaves – was a domestic worker.Following the failure of his parents’ marriage, he and his older brother, Victor, were raised by their father, a Pentecostal Christian, in a two-roomed shack that was destroyed by Hurricane Charlie in 1951, forcing young Jimmy to live for a time with his aunt and grandmother on a nearby farm.At Somerton All Age school his intelligence was noted by his teacher Robertha White (mother of the future film director Lennie Little-White), who recommended that he enrol at Kingston Technical high school to study electronics. Jimmy moved to the capital in the late 1950s to begin the course, lodging with a cousin, and was soon participating in talent contests, using the stage name of Jimmy Cliff.Moving to the home of a family friend who lived in a tenement in western Kingston, Cliff made his first recording, Daisy Got Me Crazy, for the local sound system proprietor Count Boysie, but the song was never released.His debut single,I’m Sorry, was issued by another sound system owner, Sir Cavalier, on his Hi Tone label in Jamaica and Blue Beat in the UK to little effect, but Cliff nonetheless abandoned his studies to concentrate on music, and he convinced the entrepreneur Leslie Kong to begin producing some of his records in 1961. The following year he scored his first hit for Kong with a ska love song calledHurricane Hattie, which made him a household name in Jamaica.View image in fullscreenJimmy Cliff in the late 1960s.Photograph: K & K Ulf Kruger /RedfernsCliff’s appearance at the World’s Fair in New York in 1963 brought him to the attention of the Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, who took him to London two years later to market him as a soul singer, backed by future members of Mott the Hoople. His debut album, Hard Road to Travel (1967), made little impact, but Cliff’scover of the pop song Waterfall, by the British rock band Nirvana, made him a well-known figure in Brazil after he entered a song competition in Rio, and he stayed on in the country.Revitalised, he returned to Jamaica in 1969 to cut Wonderful World, Beautiful People, Vietnam, and acover of Cat Stevens’ Wild Worldthat also reached the British Top 10. With his career on the rise, Cliff then became the star of The Harder They Come, playing an impoverished country boy trying to make it as a singer in Kingston.But although the film broke box office records in Jamaica in 1972 and would become a cult classic, it took its time to earn a profit, and feeling that his career was stagnating, Cliff left Island for EMI.The fresh start proved to be difficult, not just because his membership of theNation of Islamhad begun to alienate some fans, but also because Blackwell had signed the Wailers to market Bob Marley as a rebel outlaw modelled on Cliff’s film character. As a result, Cliff found himself in Marley’s shadow, despite the strength of his EMI albums such as Unlimited (1973), House of Exile (1974) and Follow My Mind (1975).However, Cliff’s reggae slant, incorporating non-Jamaican musical elements, found an audience inAfrica, leading to performances in Nigeria in 1974 and a tour of west Africa three years later, where his meeting with Sheik Mourtada Mbaké, spiritual leader of the Baye Fall Mourides order of Sufism in Senegal, inspired Cliff to embrace a more traditional form of Islam.The self-produced album Give Thankx (1978) was a strong roots reggae recording, and the more commercial I Am the Living (1980) arrived just before his controversial performance in Soweto, to a multiracial audience of 55,000, despite an anti-apartheid ban.He then returned toBrazil, collaborating with the singer Gilberto Gil. Once back in Jamaica he staged a free concert for 20,000 people in his home patch of Somerton, which became the platform for the documentary film Bongo Man (1982), which revealed (notwithstanding his commitment to Islam) the enduring impact of Rastafari consciousness on his worldview.Cliff signed to Columbia in 1982 for the album Special, featuring the Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and then a working partnership with Kool and the Gang’sRonald Bell(Khalis Bayyan) yielded some of his most commercially successful material, including the album The Power and the Glory (1983), with its hit singleReggae Night, co-written with La Toya Jackson, and Cliff Hanger, which won a Grammy in 1985.

We wanted to make a science fiction movie inspired by Dr Strangelove and 2001. We had no money but we did have enormous ambition. Dan co-wrote it, and he was also its production designer and editor, and he acted in the movie, playing Sergeant Pinback.We started off with some money from my parents, shooting on 16mm. It was a very long process of shooting a scene, then pausing to raise money to shoot the next. Dan and I built the sets with help from college friends, and students also acted as cast and crew. The voice of the computer in Dark Star was Barbara “Cookie” Knapp, the wife of our cameraman.The ice vapour was made with kerosene mist – which is not something you want to breathe“Dirty Space” was a choice we made because we thought that, knowing human beings, the kind of sterility you saw in science fiction such as 2001 wasn’t going to happen. Also, of course, it was cheaper. The spaceship was designed by Ron Cobb, a friend of Dan’s. The whole premise, of a spaceship in deep space bombing unstable planets, didn’t really make sense – the film was always humorous.By the summer of 1972 we had 45 minutes of footage, and we shopped it around and got the money to make it into a full-length feature film. We went looking for a distributor and Jack Harris, who’d produced The Blob, took it on. He was looking for a space movie, but there were certain things he wanted included – a bunch of cliches, such as a meteor storm. We needed distribution, so we did it. I wrote the soundtrack, as well as the music for the song Benson Arizona, whichplays over the opening and closing credits. The lyrics were written by Bill Taylor, the special effects technician.The extra footage shot to make it feature-length included the scenes withthe alien. By that point, we were full into comedy. We’d been using a beachball to represent a planet – it had a couple of bathroom plungers stuck to the bottom – and one day I saw it being carried by a crew member. I thought it looked so ridiculous that we should try something similar for the alien! Nick Castle, who played the alien, gave it a lot of character. He later carried on the tradition by playingThe Shape in Halloween.Brian Narelle, played Lieutenant DoolittleFilming was supposed to take a month but ended up happening at intervals over three years. The first scene we shot was in a closet in a student building – I don’t think the spaceship’s control room set had been finished. There was a women’s group holding a meeting in the next room; the noise they were making made things difficult for us and we were annoying them. Coincidentally, George Roy Hill was filming the swimming pool scene forSlaughterhouse-Fivein the gymnasium over the street.The buttons in the control room were upside-down plastic ice cube trays, and my space suit had an inverted plastic dish-drying rack stuck to it. When I was wearing the helmet, I had to act without oxygen. After each line, O’Bannon would rip the helmet off, taking my ears with it, and walk me outside for some cool air.In the scene in which the crew members are relaxing, Cal Kuniholm, who played Boiler, improvised the trick where he stabs a knife back and forth between his spread-out fingers. He accidentally skewered a finger for real, but didn’t flinch or break character. As soon as Carpenter yelled, “Cut!” he went, “Shit! Goddam!” You don’t hear the sound of the stab in the film, but I can still hear it in my head. Watching Dark Star now, I turn away when that happens.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t give me any of that intelligent life crap, just find me something I can blow up’ … from left, Dan O’Bannon, Cal Kuniholm and Brian Narelle.Photograph: Ronald GrantAlthough Doolittle makes a couple of trips to talk to Sgt Talby in the ship’s observation dome, each side of the conversation was filmed at different times – I was really talking to a light on a stand. I didn’t actually meet Dre Pahich, who played Talby, until the premiere. His voice in the film is actually John’s. John voiced the deceased commander, too, when Doolittle visits him in the freezer for advice. The ice vapour down there was made with kerosene mist, which is not something you want to breathe. Between takes, I had a wet cloth over my face and was trying not to slip and break my ass.Dark Star opened in 45 theatres: a movie starring nobody anyone knew, that people didn’t understand was a comedy. Dan O’Bannon left a screening where 12 curious people walked in and didn’t know what they were looking at. He said: “Fuck ’em. If I can’t make them laugh, I’ll scare the shit out of them.” And that was the seed for his screenplay forAlien.A few years later, at San Diego Comic Con, I was introduced to Ray Bradbury. I was thrilled to meet this literary legend, but when Bradbury heard I was representing Dark Star he really let me have it, claiming it had ripped off ideas from his writing. He was wearing these Coke bottle glasses and I felt like an insect being burned under a magnifying glass.John Carpenter on horror classic The Thing: ‘It was an enormous failure and I got fired’Read moreDoolittle’s character – and the entire film – is summarised by one line: “Don’t give me any of that intelligent life crap, just find me something I can blow up.” Right now, that’s an attitude that feels even more disturbing. Doolittle’s lack of success when trying topersuade the bomb not to explodeis also not a monument to our chances of victory over AI. The film has things to say about today that it couldn’t say in 1974.The 4K restoration of Dark Star is out now on UHD and Blu-RayExplore more on these topicsScience fiction and fantasy filmsHow we madeJohn CarpenterComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gemma’s norks are “in agony”, her lactation-based woes exacerbated by sleep deprivation and the fact that her insufferable berk of a mother is currently stuffing the spare room with statement cushions and endless unasked-for reflections on her butcher boyfriend’s cleaver. “It’s been three months now,” says Gemma, fixing Rita with a thousand-nappy stare. “It’s hell.”There is much of this sort of thing in Danielle Ward’s Daddy Issues, the second series of which arrives amid celestial parps of jubilation and the assurance that everything will be OK … ish. Eventually. (Hopefully). Currently, however, all is not tickety-boo in Stockport. To the joys of single motherhood Gemma must now add mum Davina (previously Susan Lynch but now played, with no little glee, by Jill Halfpenny), who has invited her current squeeze, “the sausage man”, back to her daughter’s flat. (“He turned up with a massive pack of chops, Gemma. I weren’t gonna say no.”)Davina operates within a mushroom cloud of delusion. Every utterance is delivered with nose aloft and glitzy bosom directed ceiling-wards, in the manner of Jane McDonald sharing an anecdote about her tights with a Channel 5 camera crew. Davina’s contributions to the household include bitching about baby Sadie’s nappies and making passive-aggressive comments about Gemma’s weight. “My cousin was eight stone just one month after giving birth,” she informs Gemma, sweetly. “Mum,” replies Gemma with fathomless patience. “She was in a coma.”Brilliantly acerbic though the first series of Daddy Issues was, you sensed it never felt entirely at ease with itself. It was too broad-brushed in some places and slack-trousered in others. At times it bore the baby giraffe gait of a new comedy struggling to find its knees, never mind its feet. But oh, the second series. Not only has it found its feet, it has Deep Heated its knees and – if we can toss another tortured idiom into the ball pit – hit the ground sprinting. Much of this is down to David Morrissey as Gemma’s dad Malcolm, a perpetually deflating travel-mattress of a man, forever panicking as another puncture springs up while he’s still struggling to apply sticking plasters to the previous seven. Having been booted out of Gemma’s flat at the end of the first series, Malcolm has returned to the dilapidated bedsit of his terminally divorced friend (and “emotional support dickhead”) Derek. And galvanised by his newfound responsibilities as a grandfather, he has made himself useful by installing a flap in the bedsit’s boarded-up front door. “It’s like a cat flap,” he explains. “But for fellas.”Here, amid the incessant rat-tat-tat of sublime one-liners, is a comedy with enormous affection for its characters. For all their buffoonery, these are complex and believable souls. Not that its softer bits are ever mawkish, mind. Nor is there ever the sense that its trickier themes (fractured families, young motherhood) are being shoehorned in to Generate Debate® or to #make_u_think. Instead, it’s all folded in together: love, regret, fear, daftness, joy, boredom, urinary tract infections and any other number of everyday messes, because, well, that’s life innit. And so, when the ever-eager Malcolm brings Gemma toast in bed and promises to help out “for ever” with Sadie, we leave on a shot of Gemma’s childlike face flitting, as it so often does, between gratitude, guilt and the knowledge that there is no easy way out of the situation in which she is now wedged.Similarly, when Derek (a character whose seething misogyny would have been dialled down in lesser comedies) threatens in episode two to embark on a redemption arc, any actual progress is swiftly extinguished with a damp tea-towel. In Daddy Issues the irredeemable remain irredeemable, their hopelessness allowing the marginally less hopeless to huddle closer together and reassure themselves of their moral superiority. Before calling the guilty party a dickhead, obviously.“Might as well come back, then,” says Gemma to Malcolm, ushering him, and us, into a future lined with love, doubt and cat flaps for fellas. Join her? Really, you’d be a dickhead not to.Daddy Issues series two aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyAimee Lou WoodComedyParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

And yet, just as he is about to kneel in anguish on the Oval Office carpet, he is apparently perking up at the thought of one more mighty challenge.He can revive the Rush Hour movie franchise!Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of Paramount Skydance – which, earlier this year, as Paramount Global,settled a lawsuit with Trumpnot dissimilar to the one he’s recently threatened the BBC with – hasreportedly been leant on by thecommander in chief to revive the affectionately remembered Rush Hour films – the knockabout buddy cop adventures starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.A fourth Rush Hour film is reportedly a central part of Trump’s second-term project – a dream of reintroducing some old-fashioned masculinity into Hollywood culture and it would moreover create some employment for that unlovely Tinseltown hombre who directed the first three Rush Hour films – Brett Ratner.Ratner wasaccused of sexual assault in 2017, allegations which he denied. But, with privileged access, has nowdirected a $40m documentaryabout Melania Trump – the kind of film that can only be described as “soft-hitting”.Does the world really need or want Rush Hour 4? If it did, surely we would have it by now? Market forces in the brutally commercial Darwinian jungle of franchise cinema would have created Rush Hour 4. Or at the very least rebooted it for streaming TV with a younger cast and maybe David Harbour as the glowering police chief.The idea of the Rush Hour series is a quirky odd-couple pairing of two cops: Chris Tucker’s James Carter from the LAPD and Jackie Chan’s Yan Naing Lee from the Hong Kong Police Force. They both get to play “fish out of water” comedy – the water being each other’s culture – with some very broad and arguably problematic sexual comedy. And, of course, there are plenty of fights, with Tucker giving us some all-American punch-ups and Chan busting out some uproarious martial arts moves.It’s all very undemanding, stereotypical stuff and Donald absolutely loves it. Could it be that Rush Hour 4 will feature one of his wooden cameos, or something more? Or it could be that the president is – like Arnold Schwarzenegger – starting to envision a post-political return to the glamorous world of show business. Perhaps he will wish to produce as well as star.But there is another possibility. Recently, Trump played host to New York’s Democratic socialist mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani; the meeting that many thought could only end in the kind of tongue-lashing that the president notoriously gave Volodymyr Zelenskyy on their first encounter. But no. It was all smiles. A very unexpected bromance seemed to be in the offing. Could it be that Trump likes the idea of Rush Hour because it’s so … inclusive? A black guy and an Asian guy united under the American banner. Has Mamdani finally softened Trump’s worldview? If so, and if Rush Hour 4 is the result, well, it could have been worse.Explore more on these topicsFilmDonald TrumpJackie ChanUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Did Super Hans ever make it to Macedonia to open his moped rental business?Mark Hawksley, 46, WisconsinGreen Wing (2004-2007)View image in fullscreen‘The coolest, funniest comedy ever’ … Green Wing.Photograph: Channel 4Green Wing is the coolest, funniest comedy I’ve ever seen, with so many new ideas. Please can we have another series – and one without the “sad” part that crept into the latter third? I loved the visual and physical comedy pioneered in Green Wing – at least, I hadn’t seen it before – for example, the cart-wheeling through the glass corridors, slow and fast-motion, dancing and walking – by Joanna Clore from HR especially. It was also the first comedy I had seen with such a great mix of well drawn characters. It was just very, very funny and without being too cringey. I haven’t listened to the new audio version … but then where’s all the visual fun in that?Uli Sattler, 59, ManchesterSapphire & Steel (1979-1982)Sapphire & Steel was grownup TV for kids. It scared the pants off me, but I was hooked. I would even go out on a limb and say I preferred it to Doctor Who! It starred David McCallum and Joanna Lumley, who were brilliant. Obviously, we have lost David, but Joanna would still be great in it, and we could bring in some other elements to keep it new. Just a great opportunity for some intelligent spookiness. I am a film-making lecturer, and a few years ago one of our students started a campaign to bring it back, but it came to nothing.Ian Crook, Garstang, LancashireDeadwood (2004-2006)View image in fullscreenAl Swearengen himself! … Ian McShane in Deadwood.Photograph: Warrick Page/HBODeadwood was just the best thing on TV at the time. My husband and I had embarked on an odyssey from London home to Scotland, and were gutting and rebuilding a stone cottage in Argyll, so all the building and mud in this western was relatable. There was no streaming back then so my husband (no longer extant) and I waited agog for each new episode. The story was well written and multilayered. It was easy to be interested in and want to follow the characters. I think my favourite was Seth Bullock but there were so many – Trixie, Seth’s sidekick, Al Swearengen himself. As I haven’t seen the final film I’m not qualified to say where next. There were so many good actors playing so well in a set which reeked of dirt and difficulty.Judith Witts, 79, EdinburghFoyle’s War (2002-2015)Foyle’s War is the finest historical detective drama ever. Although it isn’t possible to revive it, as the writer-creator, Anthony Horowitz, has moved on to other projects and the lead actor, Michael Kitchen, has retired, the programme was robbed of the opportunity to tell more stories of the second world war home front by meddling, wrong-headed executives who cancelled and re-commissioned it twice. Fans have long speculated on the possibility of a prequel, as per Endeavour and Morse, exploring young Foyle’s great war experience and his interrupted early police career.Lesley Johnson, Vancouver, BC, CanadaTop Gear (2002-2022)View image in fullscreen‘It’s needed now!’ Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond on Top Gear.Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./AlamyTop Gear, with EVs and alternative fuel cars. I loved the trio of Jeremy, James and Richard, but I think a modernTop Gearshould be almost like the pre-00s version, with a focus on news and reviews. But I would also include the big adventures as once-per-series specials. For presenters, I would choose Jack Scarlett from Everything Electric, paired with Alex from Autoalex on YouTube and Richard’s daughter, Izzy Hammond. Automotive journalism is needed now as the car industry is facing its biggest changes in a generation – from EVs to alternative fuels to hydrogen. If we had education on TV, attitudes to net zero and transport based on net zero might change.Luci Bassindale, 21, NewcastleFirefly (2002-2003)View image in fullscreen‘Let’s see them in middle age!’ … Gina Torres in Firefly.Photograph: Fox Network/Sportsphoto/AllstarFirefly was probably the best sci-fi show ever produced for the small screen, and a good movie too. It was a brilliant realisation of cowboys and Indians in space with an excellent cast of actors all showing their good and bad sides – some very bad. Their interactions could be cutting, but it was obvious that they were friends who would willingly die for each other. It would be very interesting to see the characters in middle age.Kevin Brown, 73,Ynys Môn (Anglesey), WalesThe Peripheral (2022)I’d like to see The Peripheralreturn, as anything involving William Gibson is always going to be fascinating, and while I love the book, the TV series was taking things in an interesting new direction. I liked the world-building too; the collapsed and civil-war racked “post-jackpot” US seems far more prescient today than when series one was broadcast, as does a London run by kleptocrats. When it comes to characters, I really liked Chloë Grace Moretz’s Flynne Fisher; she is sorely underused these days and deserves meaty roles like this. However, Alexandra Billings’ magnetically scary Inspector Lowbeer stole the show from the moment she arrived, late in series one, and I really wanted to see how the character would develop.Ian Simmons, Southend-on-SeaThis Life (1996-1997)This Life really captured the post-uni life, trying to forge a path. It had a tight script, strong characters and great acting. Since This Life aired, there are so many other things that would have to be considered – the size of student loans, shrinking job markets, the growth of AI, social media toxicity, how the drinking culture changed – phew, where do you stop? But post-university life is still a rich, fertile ground for storylines. They could introduce a new set of actors, giving opportunities to even more diverse characters – although it would be good to see if Egg managed to get a Michelin star.Jeanette, LondonExplore more on these topicsTelevisionPeep ShowTop GearTV streamingChannel 4Television industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then a few minutes later, you’re squinting, adjusting your lighting or playing around with TV settings – it’s a night-time scene and you’re unable to make out what’s going on. Prompting the question: ‘When did everything on screen get so dark?’This question isn’t new, gaining traction after a few incredibly poorly lit battle scenes in the final season of Game of Thrones, with articles and posts popping up begging explanation,one Reddit user commenting: “If you need an article to defend that not being able to see shit is a stylistic choice, maybe the stylistic choice should be reconsidered.”Film critic and journalist Barry Levitt feels strongly on the subject. “If you walk outside on a warm day, you’ll find infinitely more colour than you would in a contemporary blockbuster.”Wicked forever: the enduring appeal of The Wizard Of OzRead moreLast year’s biggest film Wicked received widespread critique for the way it felt on screen,even being compared to a TV advert. It’s harder still, to refrain from critique when The Wizard of Oz, a film oftencredited with changing film colouringforever, serves as the first in this cinematic universe.This month’s much-anticipated sequel Wicked: For Good has been similarly criticised. In his review for the New Yorker, Justin Changasked: “Why is everything in this movie, for all its lavishly gilded, emerald-studded set design, either too dim or too bright – so blindingly backlit that Oz seems to be under perpetual thermonuclear attack, or so murky that you could scarcely tell a monkey from a Munchkin?”Technicolor, used in The Wizard of Oz, enabled extremely vibrant colours to be captured through a specialised camera splitting the light that enters into blue, green and red light. These beams were sent to separate strips of black and white film, with post-production combining these into the larger than life, deeply saturated colours we’re familiar with. But itsexpense and complexityspelled its own doom as technology moved on.View image in fullscreenJudy Garland and Ray Bolger in The Wizard of Oz.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./Alamy“The prevalence of flat monotone images in film and TV today is due in part to changes in camera technology and a lack of careful colour grading work.” saysLaura Hillard, lecturer in cinematography at the University of Salford.Modern digital cameras capture what it sees in a more realistic way without the stylistic saturation and texture that was inevitable with film.Somecredit The Lord of the Rings for marking a turning point in visual effects, with grading and editing utilised to naturally integrate these as realistically as possible. And many of us will recall from the pre-digital time, 1991’s The Addams Family was one of many films able to portray dark, gloomy environments and moods without any struggle to understand what’s happening on screen.“What I’m noticing these days, if we call it a trend (though I prefer to think of it as a specific stylistic direction), is a move towards lower contrast, softer highlights, more muted colour palettes, and a less visible lighting style,” saysHootan Haghshenas, a digital colourist with credits including 2016’s The Salesman. “And even though it can appear effortless, there’s usually a huge amount of work behind achieving this kind of naturalistic look, just as much as in more traditional, stylised lighting.”He adds: “There is sometimes a misconception that darker images are purely a cost-saving strategy in lighting or production design. That can occasionally play a part, but it’s not necessarily true.” Haghshenas believes “we’re simply in an era where film-makers have far more control and freedom over the final image than ever before.”It’s not simply down to technology though.Jon Constantinou, a producer and director, explains that the visuals of a film can be a battle between “abstraction and immersion”. With abstraction being something “very obvious that you are watching a depiction of something on the screen which you have to use your imagination to relate to, it oftentimes takes a little minute to get into it but then you’re along for the ride” and immersion being a “trend that kicked up at the dawn of digital, typically involves a combination of wider angle camera lenses, with the cameras being placed closer to the action”intending to make you feel like you’re there, experiencing this reality on screen.Constantinou speculates an immersive approach was taken to Wicked, to ground you in the same experience as Glinda and Elphaba – confirmed inan interviewwith director Jon M Chu. “I think what we wanted to do was immerse people into Oz, to make it a real place,” he said.“There’s a strong creative preference at play. Many film-makers want a visual world that feels grounded, atmospheric and emotionally truthful. Darker images can add tension, intimacy and realism,” echoes Haghshenas.View image in fullscreenMia Goth and Oscar Isaac in Frankenstein.Photograph: Ken Woroner/NetflixIt’s not just Wicked experiencing visual criticism, Frankenstein’s lighting seemed inconsistent with the intended gothic tones, with many believing itfelt like a video game, unlike Nosferatu, another gothic creature horror that enthralled with itsmasterful use of lighting and darker tones.Decider’s reviewof Frankenstein recognised “that signature Netflix flatness in its lighting and focus, a lack of contrast that makes the surfaces stick together across each focal length. Few elements on-screen feel real and tangible, and for a film about blood and sinew, that’s a problem.”“That signature Netflix flatness” has become a more commented on problem with the streamer’s increased dominance in Hollywood. Vice dived into this topic three years ago, finding that Netflix had restrictive lists of approved cameras and wished all content to be shot in 4K UHD, ready for when 4K TVs became the norm in home. Though similar to the jump from digital to film, compressing 4K data into something watchable on the average TV set also results in something uncanny and not at all lifelike. Not much has changed since then – last yearEsquiredevoted a takedown to the streamer’s “bizarre visual language”.Meanwhile many series and films have fallen short in trying to capture darkness with criticism aimed at Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, The Handmaid’s Tale and The Batman.Our at-home television technology has rapidly been advancing (even if it’s maybe not advancing at Netflix’s schedule), and has also affected how visuals are interpreted on screen. Haghshenas recognises that we can now “see and appreciate the subtle texture that would have been lost a decade ago. So film-makers now have a real incentive to craft detailed, tactile images, knowing the display technology can support those nuances.” Even if immersion is what is aimed for, it can be lost when viewers want to fiddle with settings and lighting at home.“Lighting challenges have always existed, regardless of the aesthetic trends of the time,” says Haghshenas. It’s hard to predict future trends on screen – we saw the 3D come and go, meanwhile immersion seems to be hitting new heights with the Las Vegas Sphere hosting anAI enhanced version of The Wizard of Oz, claiming that it “transports audiences, making them feel like they have stepped inside the film”.The response to Chu’s use of colour in Wicked: For Good has been mixed. Levitt recognises that while it “has more colour than most, it’s still weirdly muted” while Den of Geek’s David Crowbelievesthe issues of lighting and colour are “more glaring” in the sequel. Maybe it’s bad timing – a colourful universe has its biggest expansion in an exceedingly colourless time in cinema.Explore more on these topicsWicked: For GoodWickedFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anyone who’s been listening to the music for at least that long can list myriad reasons why that’s now the case: all the beats sound the same, all the artists are industry plants, all the lyrics are barely intelligible etc.For hip-hop forefather Abiodun Oyewole, though, it boils down to this: “We embraced ‘party and bullshit’, my brother.”Fifty-seven years ago, on what would have been Malcolm X’s 43rd birthday, Oyewole cliqued up with two young poets at a writers’ workshop in East Harlem’s Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) to form what would become the Last Poets, a collective of bard revolutionaries. They outfitted themselves in African prints, performed over the beat of a congo drum and advocated for populism in their verses. The group has had many configurations over the years, but Oyewole, Jalal Mansur Nuriddin and Umar Bin Hassan abide as the standout members. The trio is all over the band’s self-titled first album – which was released in 1970 and peaked at No 29 on the Billboard 200. Their follow-up album, This Is Madness, made them ripe targets for J Edgar Hoover’s Cointelpro campaign against the emerging figures the then-FBI directordeemed politically subversive. Notably, Oyewole could not contribute to that album because he had been incarcerated for an attempted robbery of a Ku Klux Klan headquarters, serving two and a half years of a three-year sentence. (He was trying to raise bail for activists who had been arrested for striking back at the Klan.)Though dubbed “jazz poetry” at the time, the Last Poets’ tight rhythms, insurgent message and prevailing emphasis on Black consciousness would lay the foundation (along with fellow beatniks Gary Byrd and Gil Scott-Heron) for hip-hop music. Everyone from Melle Mel to KRS One to Common has paid some kind of homage to the Last Poets in their work. Oyewole’s “party and bullshit” line, which came from the song When the Revolution Comes on the Last Poets’ first album, would become the title and hook for the Notorious BIG’sdebut single. Black comedians pay tribute to the Last Poets too with every one of theirspoken word slam parodies.Late last year, the Last Poets released an 11th studio album, Africanism, without Nuriddin (who died from cancer in 2018) that takes the some of group’s most resonant poems and sets them to the Afrobeat stylings of the late, great Tony Allen – the genre pioneer who came to prominence directing Fela Kuti’s band. “I’m blown away by the fact that Umar and I both said things that are extremely relevant today,” Oyewole says. “It’s so weird that these problems continue to exist.”At age 77, Oyewole remains as attuned to the big issues as ever. With Bin Hassan, also 77, looking on (his speech has been somewhat limited after he suffered a pair of strokes in the last few years), Oyewole let his opinions fly over the course of our hourlong interview.OnZohran Mamdani, a former wannabe emcee turned Democratic socialist, sweeping to victory in New York City’s mayoral election, Oyewole says: “This is all in divine order.”On the escalation of political violence in Nigeria, a thorny issue Nicki Minajclumsily waded intoduring a surprise recent appearance at the UN, Oyewole says: “We need to recognize that we are one and the same people, Africaandthe diaspora, and make that union a lot tighter.”View image in fullscreenUmar Bin Hassan and Abiodun Oyewole.Photograph: Last PoetsOn the fall ofKanye West, who is featured with Oyewole on the Common song The Corner: “Kanye got hooked on the bitches brew. He got stuck, strung out. I don’t know if you’ve seen Sinners, but Kanye West has been bitten.”After Martin Luther King’s assassination in 1968, Oyewole says, “I wanted to become a serial killer.” In fact, some of those bitter feelings bubble back to the surface when Oyewole segues to the topic ofCharlie Kirk’s death and rightwing efforts to recast Kirk as a civil rights martyr. “It’s embarrassing to have all the flags flying half mast in honor of a racist,” he says, “of someone who insulted every Black woman when he said Maxine Waters, Michelle Obama and Ketanji Brown Jackson weren’t smart. It’s embarrassing that Black people would say: ‘Well, I feel sorry for him.’ There’s nothing to feel sorry for.”Oyewole credits Last Poets co-founder David Nelson for challenging him to express that rage in couplets instead. Earlier this month, while performing on the Soul Train cruise with a lineup that also included the Isley Brothers, Oyewole told guitarist Ernie Isley that their hit song It’s Your Thing inspired the first poem he ever wrote, What’s Your Thing, Brother? – a greeting that Oyewole heard often in the 1960s among activist-minded Black New Yorkers trying to suss out one another’s political bents.You better get a thing before you lose everything,the poem goes.View image in fullscreenAbiodun Oyewole and Umar Bin Hassan.Photograph: Johnny Nunez/Getty ImagesThe Last Poets’ grounding in Black pride and political purpose became heirlooms that were carried forward in the hip-hopmovement –that critical last word intended as much to rally listeners to the dancefloor as join them in common cause against political oppression. It’s a conjoining of ideals that began in earnest with Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s breakout The Message, which sets the story of the Bronx’s 1980s-era crime and dereliction to synth rhythms and breakbeats. Over the decades, rap’s practitioners have dutifully upheld the Black American oral tradition of fighting the power and passing down knowledge of self while also serving up plenty of dancefloor hits. Even Biggie followed up Party & Bullshit on his debut album withThings Done Changed, a reflection on the harsh realities of his Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn community.But Oyewole doesn’t hear that same range of awareness or sense of urgency in hip-hop that is being pushed by the music industry today. “Our music has always been a reflection of our living,” he says, “but we’re dying spiritually.” To underscore his point, he references to an early poem of Bin Hassan’s that was revived for Africanism calledNiggers Are Scared of Revolution– a flash of recognition that perked up his bandmate. “I was a shoeshine boy, going to bars and everything,” Bin Hassan says, “listening to people talk about who they are, from gang members to masters of the world. I had to take the language.”The Last Poets: the hip-hop forefathers who gave black America its voiceRead moreThe poem was meant to be a criticism on the N-word’s repurposing into a term of endearment – but that message backfired as hip-hop effectively sold its soul to secure its prime position in pop culture. “They even changed the feature character from cat to dog,” Oyewole says. “Back in the day when I was growing up, it was: ‘Man, that cat can play the piano’ or ‘That’s a cool cat.’ But now it’s: ‘Yo dog, that’s mydawg… ’“No, I amnotyour dog.”Hip-hop’s outsized role in making the language of Black disparagement more palatable, Oyewole further argues, has only made it easier for Donald Trump (whom he calls “the Taco Man”) and his white supremacist acolytes in government to deny Black excellence in their policy-driven attacks against critical race theory and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion). Nevertheless, Oyewole is confident and remains hopeful that those efforts will backfire too, and that the Last Poets’ mission of returning the power to the people will ultimately win out.“In times of great chaos, there’s opportunity,” he says. “The Taco Man and his efforts to ban books and erase our history? All he’s really doing, in a weird way, is promoting us. But he doesn’t realize that because he’s not smart.”Explore more on these topicsHip-hopRapPoetryinterviewsShareReuse this content"

After a loving evening – where we knew she was on her way – surrounded by children, grandchildren and pizza, she told us all to fuck off so she could go to sleep. And then she never woke up.

Lucky old heaven getting such a dazzling newcomer.”Born June Flewett in London in 1927, she was evacuated as a young teenager to Oxford and eventually employed as a housekeeper at the Kilns, the house Lewis shared with his brother, Warnie, and adoptive mother and possible partner Janie Moore.Speaking to the Daily Telegraph in 2005, she recalled knowing her first meeting with Lewis was “something momentous” and confessed to a “schoolgirl crush” on him.“He looked like a ruddy-cheeked farmer: heavy jowls, stick, tweeds, big shoes, labrador, tall – well, tall to me. I thought he was wonderful.”View image in fullscreenJill, Clement and Emma in 1987.Photograph: Today/ShutterstockIn a letter to Flewett’s mother in 1945, two years after her daughter began living with them, Lewis wrote: “I have never really met anything like her unselfishness and patience and kindness and shall feel deeply in her debt as long as I live.”She recalled the enormous cupboard on the landing at the Kilns, thought to be the original wardrobe into which the brave and curious Lucy – the youngest and kindest of four children who comes as an evacuee to stay with a professor during the war – climbs to discover Narnia in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Lewis sent her the book –which he dedicated to his goddaughter, Lucy– after publication, but she wasn’t aware of her direct involvement in it until after his death, when Douglas Gresham, the son of Joy, the American academic Lewis married in 1956, wrote to her saying: “I suppose you know you are the prototype for Lucy.”Lewis had paid for her scholarship to Rada, which she deferred for two years until she was 18, to better care for the writer and Moore when she was laid low through ill-health.After graduating, she adopted the stage name Jill Raymond and progressed quickly to the West End, where she starred opposite the likes of Michael Redgrave and won roles in TV shows such as Torchy, the Battery Boy.View image in fullscreenIn 1954 when Clement was still a celebrity chef.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesIn 1950 she married the then-chef Clement Freud, the grandson ofSigmund Freud, with whom she had five children, including Emma, who became a scriptwriter, and Matthew, the PR executive and head of Freud Communications.In the 1970s, her husband became a Liberal MP and his wife helped in canvass, while also taking part in radio shows.

There’s the famous portrait of the king himself – puffy, phallic and cruel, looking more like a murderer than a monarch. But there is also ascetic Thomas More, hiding his cruel streak behind fine bones, and sly yet thuggish Thomas Cromwell, with those shifty eyes and the beginnings of a double chin. “Hans the Painter” did the wives too – an appropriately sketchy drawing of Anne Boleyn, a saintly portrait of Jane Seymour who died after giving birth to Henry’s heir, and a pin-up version of Anne of Cleves.It was this last portrait that caused an international incident in 1539 when Holbein was sent by Henry to the Low Countries to check whether Anne was pretty enough to be his next wife. Based on Holbein’s portrait, Henry committed to the marriage in absentia, only to be horrified when the actual Anne arrived on the Kentish coast, looking “nothing so fair as she hath been reported”. The union lasted six months.In this magnificent book, the first scholarly biography of Holbein in more than 100 years, art historian Elizabeth Goldring characterises the Cleves affair as a “debacle” but also points out that it was a rare misstep for Holbein, whose portraits generally struck contemporaries as uncannily lifelike. And even though today we have no way of judging their verisimilitude, there is no mistaking their essential vitality: you would swear Holbein’s people are blinking and breathing before you, ready to reach out and shake your hand.Consider his early pictures of the Dutch humanist Erasmus, commissioned in 1523 when both men were living in Basel. The middle-aged scholar’s deeply etched face manages to convey both generic qualities of intellectual rigour and benign humanism while remaining utterly individual, with a wide, curving mouth and deep-set eyes. And there is a certain cheeky humour in evidence, too. In the background of the portrait now hanging in the National Gallery is a Latin tag, presumably by Erasmus (Holbein had only a rudimentary education), which calls attention to the artist’s juvenile cockiness: “I am Johannes Holbein, whom it is easier to denigrate than to emulate.”View image in fullscreenJane Seymour by Hans Holbein (1536).Photograph: PAINTING/AlamyIt was Erasmus who was responsible for getting Holbein to Britain in 1526, when he wrote a letter recommending the young man to his friend Thomas More. More, who was on his way to becoming lord chancellor, quickly commissioned a series of portraits. Holbein presciently rendered the saintly More as saturnine, with the beginnings of cruelty about his mouth. Here was a man who was simultaneously devoted to God while busily installing a set of stocks at his Chelsea home with which to torture heretics. The fact that More famously opposed Henry’s attempts to obtain a divorce and marry Anne Boleyn may explain why the portrait that now hangs in the Frick Collection in New York has two large, centuries-old vertical splits. Boleyn was reputedly so angry with her nemesis that she dragged Holbein’s painting – the next best thing to More himself – from the wall and flung it on the ground.All that lay in the future, though. After the portraits, Holbein busied himself with painting the large More clan as the epitome of a happy Christian household. Well-dressed women dominate this canvas, with More’s clever daughters and female wards consulting their prayer books while Alice, his second wife, wears an ostentatious crucifix. This mood of prosperous devotion is in startling contrast to a picture Holbein did on his return to Basel the following year. Portrait of the Artist’s Family shows a red-eyed, bone-tired Elsbeth Holbein looking like a soiled Madonna with her two peaky children. Having been left behind to function as a single mother and workshop supervisor while her husband was getting famous in England, Frau Holbein can hardly be blamed for not bothering to disguise her exhaustion and resentment.His great achievement was to bring before us living, breathing men and womenThe chronology of Holbein’s life is complicated and opaque, but Goldring does a good job of keeping things on track without pretending to absolute certainty. It appears that Holbein didn’t stay in Basel very long once the city had become a religious war zone, with Protestant activists creating a bonfire out of Catholic vanities. Instead, he returned to the Henrician court, this time permanently, leaving Elsbeth to fend for herself. To add insult to injury, he seems to have taken up with a woman in London, fathering another two children.Returning to England was, however, no guarantee of political safety. Thomas More would soon be executed for refusing to recognise Henry as the supreme head of the new Church of England, and it says a great deal for Holbein’s survival skills that he did not go down with his erstwhile patron. Instead, on this second and final trip, he shrewdly pivoted towards the new man Thomas Cromwell and the new queen, Anne Boleyn.For Anne’s coronation in 1533 Holbein built an extraordinary triumphal arch out of papier-mache painted to look like marble. (Goldring reminds us that, like all Renaissance artists, “Maister Hans” could turn his hand to anything.). It would take another five years, though, before he finally got what he had been angling for – a place on the royal payroll and the title of “King’s Painter”. What sealed the deal was a series of huge murals undertaken for the Palace of Whitehall. It was here that Holbein’s iconic rendering of Henry first appeared, the one that is recognised around the world today.View image in fullscreenHolbein’s portrait of Henry VIII from 1540.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesBarrel-chested and bulked out with padded shoulders and an enormous codpiece, Holbein’s Henry stands glittering and thuggish, ready to take on all-comers. According to a slightly later source, to be in the presence of this Whitehall Henry was to feel annihilated, which was exactly the intended effect – since the real flesh-and-blood Henry was in a far more parlous state. A recent jousting accident had left him with ferocious headaches and a leg so putrid that you could smell him coming. It was hard not to feel pity.All of which is ironic, given that there was no artist better than Holbein at confronting the brute realities of ailing flesh. Fifteen years earlier, he had painted The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb, a grotesque rendering of Jesus’s decomposing corpse. In this lifesize image, the mouth and eyes hang open, the skin is already going green and the fingers have begun to stiffen with rigor mortis. More than 400 years later, Fyodor Dostoevsky would find the painting so disturbing that his wife insisted on dragging him away, terrified that it would trigger an epileptic seizure. Nonetheless, Holbein’s visceral painting made its way – almost as a character in its own right – into The Idiot (1869).In her introduction, Goldring seems wary of characterising her extraordinary book as a biography. This is doubtless because of a long-held scholarly suspicion of treating works of art as if they are mere anecdotes culled from an artist’s life, rather than autonomous creative objects. But in the case of Hans Holbein it is impossible to see how one could do otherwise than plunge into a world of rich and vital lived experience. His great achievement was to bring before us the living, breathing men and women who plotted, suffered, contrived and triumphed through the most terrifying decades of English history. And it is Goldring’s achievement to show us the process by which this magic happened.Holbein: Renaissance Master by Elizabeth Goldring is published by Paul Mellon Centre (£40).

Really? Think!You must pull yourself together, moon.You say you remember things.What can you remember?It’s embarrassing. You think you’re all right.Only yesterday you put rice crispies in the fridge.What’s going to happen next?If your hand trembles, sit on it. Wipe your mouth.Skittering about. When did you have a decent job?Your voice is like a nervous cough.You must pull yourself togetherAnd shut the door if you can’t sing in tune.Your eyes look like two catacombsAnd make me think of furnished rooms.We’ve heard enough of Grandad’s work in Leeds.Your eyes look like abandoned creeds.Miles Burrows, born in Leicester in 1936, published his first collection with Cape when he was around 30. In the succeeding decades he worked in various countries and practised medicine before his more subversive vocation was celebrated by Carcanet’s 2017 publication ofWaiting for the Nightingale. It was followed by a Collected Poems, Take us the Little Foxes, in 2021.This week’s poem, Missing You, is from Burrows’ latest volume,Slow Puncture. It’s related to one of the new poems in the Collected, Remonstrating with the Moon, expanded now with additional “characters” and a focus on the sheer savagery of western social attitudes towards ageing. Like much of Burrows’ work, and important to the pleasure of engaging with it, it presents readers with a bizarre but far from unreal theatrical scene, and insists we stage it in our own imaginations.Missing You seems to gather together a family conference on “what to do” about a very senior relative, who is imagined, cruelly and comically, both as moon and person. As the lights go up, one character whispers resonantly to another “Did you know the moon was so old / It might have to go into a home?” The moon-person, on-stage (it’s fun to imagine the costume and the antics), represents non-personhood, and may be assumed not to overhear these words. As the poem’s title suggests, there is a “you” who is “missing”, as well as a “you” that is missed.In the second couplet I imagine a second voice, raised in corroboration with the first, only to expose an ignorance of lunar fact. The moon-person is imagined to be “edging nearer / The way old people do.” The actual moon, however, is yearly increasing its distance from planet Earth. I’d go further in the dramatisation, and suggest the moon-person is given a speaking part in the next two couplets, tossing random facts together, as if remembering some important information from its specialism, lighting. Art, science and one of the moons of Saturn,Enceladus, are illuminated briefly in cheery non sequiturs.Missing You is a macrocosm of one of Burrows’ favourite devices: the joke and its dismantling. Moon-person’s listed failings include the innocent moon-habit of “Peering into people’s bedrooms” and the harmless practice of storing “rice crispies” in the fridge. But the fun dissipates, and there’s a steadily hardening impatience and anger. This phase of the poem could be expressed as a Greek chorus of unanimous disapproval.The intensifying re-characterisation takes apart the Romantic, or romantically decadent, moons of poetry. This moon is increasingly recognisable as an ageing human body, marked by forgetfulness, hand-tremor, the habit of “skittering about”, the voice “like a nervous cough”. Polite concealment is urgently required. The moon-person in the meantime has begun singing horribly, intending to drown out the repeated commands to “pull yourself together”. It may have begun to feel strangely liberated by the fragmentation of its identity, and the limitless antisocial possibilities revealed.Its face at the end of the poem reminded me faintly of Sylvia Plath’s moon imagery inThe Moon and the Yew Tree. Burrows redoubles the bone-cold bleakness, an effect produced from the similes themselves, and the reiteration of the end-rhymes: “Your eyes look like two catacombs / And make me think of furnished rooms”. “Catacombs” and “furnished rooms” evoke mismatch and connection between echoing hollowness and stifling clutter; both suggest extremes of isolation and human invisibility. Most of us, if we’re like the middle-class characters in Burrows’ satire, will leave furnished rooms behind us when we die.Not all humour has yet drained away. The first line of the last couplet is funny, because “Grandad’s work in Leeds” still cooperates with the oddity of a moon that’s also a person – one proud, it seems, of its working-class roots. But the return in the final line to eyes “like abandoned creeds” is frankly grim. It seems to echo the reference to the Spanish civil war (line eight), which, according to the adjusted calendar of Enceladus, the speaker had decided would be happening about now: “Tonight we have the Spanish Civil War”. The relatives are making war on the moon-person, but they’re moon-people too, their dreams and creeds ephemeral, betrayed by the unavoidable negligence of dying.If Missing You plunges at times into fury and gloom, Slow Puncture is a happy reminder of what a rare satirical and self-mocking talent Burrows deploys. He can be heard inimitably introducing himself andreading from his Collected Poems here.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The actor died in hospital in Palm Springs, California, his friend the photographer Michael Childers announced on social media. No cause of death was given.Udo Kier: ‘I was so weak from eating only salad leaves to play Dracula I was in a wheelchair’Read moreKnown for his piercing stare, Kier frequently played villains, monsters and creeps; he portrayed vampires and Nazis multiple times. He acted in films, television, music videos and video games, and was sometimes labelled a character actor for his consistently memorable turns across European cinema and Hollywood. “I like horror films,” he once said, “because if you play small or guest parts in movies, it is better to be evil and scare people than be the guy who works in the post office and goes home to his wife and children. Audiences will remember you more.”View image in fullscreenKier in 1974’s Blood for Dracula, also titled Andy Warhol’s Dracula, directed by Paul Morrissey.Photograph: Warhol/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockKier was born Udo Kierspe in Germany in 1944; just hours after he was born the hospital was bombed and he had to be rescued from the ruins of the maternity ward with his mother. His childhood in postwar Germany was “horrible”, hetold the Guardian in 2002: “My father was already married with three children when I was born, and my mother didn’t know. So we grew up poor. We had no hot water until I was 17.”As a teenager Kier worked in a factory in order to make enough money to “get out of that misery I was born into”; at 16 he befriended future film director Fassbinder, then 15, while drinking in a working-class bar in Cologne. When he moved to London to study English he was discovered in a coffee shop. “I liked the attention, so I became an actor,” he once said. His breakout role was in the 1970 horror Mark of the Devil.Kier often described his career as being shaped by chance. He sat on a plane next to Andy Warhol’s director Paul Morrissey, who cast him as Frankenstein in 1973’s Flesh for Frankenstein, then Dracula in 1974’s Blood for Dracula. He reunited with his friend Fassbinder and appeared in his films The Stationmaster’s Wife, Lola, The Third Generation and Lili Marleen, as well as his miniseries Berlin Alexanderplatz.View image in fullscreenKier in 1996.Photograph: Ronald Siemoneit/Sygma/Getty ImagesIn the 80s, he met the young provocative Danish film-maker Von Trier, who cast him in his 1987 TV production of Medea and started a collaboration that spanned decades. Kier,who was also godfather to Von Trier’s son, appeared in the director’s projects Epidemic, Europa, The Kingdom, Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark, Dogville, Melancholia and Nymphomaniac: Vol. II.Van Sant, who loved Kier’s performances in Frankenstein and Dracula, offered him his first American role in 1991 film My Own Private Idaho.Madonna, a fan of My Own Private Idaho, cast Kier as her swinging husband in her 1992 book Sex, then in her music videos for Erotica and Deeper and Deeper. Kier also appeared in music videos for Supertramp, Korn and Eve.Through the 1990s Kier went on to play small but memorable roles in many Hollywood films including Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Johnny Mnemonic,Armageddon, End of Days, and Blade.Later in life, Kier appeared in S Craig Zahler’s films Brawl in Cell Block 99 and Dragged Across Concrete, and was the leading man in the 2022 comedySwan Song, playing a haughty retired hairdresser who escapes a care home to do the hair and makeup of a deceased former client.Of his prolific career, he once said, “100 movies are bad, 50 movies you can see with a glass of wine and 50 movies are good.”Kier’s final film was the political thriller The Secret Agent, in which he played a Jewish Holocaust survivor caught in the final years of the Brazilian military dictatorship. He will also appear in OD, the upcoming horror video game by Japanese auteur Hideo Kojima and producer Jordan Peele.Explore more on these topicsFilmGermanyEuropeLars von TrierMadonnaGus Van SantRainer Werner FassbindernewsShareReuse this content"

Dita Parlo and Jean Dasté play the newlyweds getting awkwardly accustomed to married life in close quarters, and their love story shapes the film. But it’s their bargemate, the uncouth Père Jules, played by Michel Simon, who steals the show: a well-travelled sailor speckled with tattoos, standing guard over a cabinet of risque and macabre curiosities, whose cabin teems with cats every bit as unruly as he is.The Swiss actor Michel Simon was one of the most distinctive presences in 20th-century French cinema: a soft-faced, gravelly voiced clown capable of tremendous pathos, and true chaos. Charlie Chaplin called him “the greatest actor in the world”. He worked with the best European directors on some timeless films. As well as acting for Vigo, he played the timid man transformed by his affair with a sex worker in La Chienne (1931) and the incorrigible tramp in Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932) for Jean Renoir. He worked with Marcel Carné in films such as Le Quai des Brumes (1938), with Carl Theodor Dreyer in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), with René Clair, Marcel L’Herbier, Julien Duvivier, GW Pabst … even John Frankenheimer in The Train (1964). “When Michel Simon plays a part,” said Truffaut, “we penetrate the core of the human heart.” He spent five decades working in the cinema, starting out in the silents, and received his highest accolade, the Berlinale’s Best Actor award in 1967, for his role as an antisemitic peasant befriending a young Jewish boy during the war in The Two of Us (Claude Berri). Reviewing that movie, Renata Adler called Simon “an enormous old genius … the general impression is that of an immense, thoughtful, warm-hearted and aquatic geological formation”.View image in fullscreenShow stealing … Simon in L’Atalante.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyThis rock-hewn genius was also well known as an eccentric of the most endearing order. Simon was an animal lover and anti-vivisectionist. Père Jules’s pets in L’Atalante were rescued alley cats, and Simon adopted the kitten that curls up in the phonograph horn. But that was just one of his many animal companions. He lived in a house surrounded by forest, with his menagerie of pets: cats, dogs and birds but mostly monkeys, for whom Simon built a network of wire tunnels, allowing them free access to the whole house, which was cluttered with his esoteric collections including a hefty stash of pornography. The monkeys were Simon’s “best friends”, and he talked about his deep grief over the death of his beloved chimpanzee Zaza, who had been his companion for 20 years. He claimed that she killed herself when he had to leave for an extended period. Simon fully believed that his monkeys were morally superior to humans, and were the roles to be reversed “there isn’t a single monkey that could cut up a human being”.View image in fullscreenRock-hewn genius … Simon in John Frankenheimer’s The Train.Photograph: AlamyStrong words from the son of a sausage-maker. Simon was born in 1895 in Geneva. His family moved to Montmartre, Paris, and before he was conscripted into the Swiss Army in 1914, Simon worked as a boxing instructor, and in a cabaret show, as a comic, magician and acrobat, among other gigs. He was right at home in the city’s seedy, criminal demimonde. Out of the army, he began his acting career on the Paris stage, where he had his breakout success in 1929. Simon had a minor role as Clo-Clo, the heroine’s brother, in Marcel Achard’s play Jean de la Lune, but stole the show every night – and he played the part again on film two years later. Simon had already embarked on his film career in 1924, but it was the talkies that made him famous, because his husky voice matched his doughy face and stolid physique – meaning he was as expressive verbally as he was with physical comedy.On screen, he had an immediate charisma, which lent itself well to playing eccentric types such as Boudu the tramp. It was a role that Renoir wrote for Simon, to bring out what the film-maker identified as his complex, nonconformist nature. The film is a social satire, in which a well-heeled bookseller rescues a vagrant who has thrown himself into the Seine, and brings him into his genteel family home. The bookseller adopts the waif, but Boudu violently resists all his attempts to transform him into a polite, clean-shaven bourgeois, to put it mildly. Critics and audiences were outraged, and it was a long time before the film was acclaimed as a classic.Simon, who had a rebellious streak of his own and knew what it was to be out of favour, took the role in L’Atalante partly out of solidarity with Vigo, whose previous film, Zéro de Conduite, had been banned inFrancefor its attack on the school system. Simon’s growling, stomping Jules seems to embody aggression, but he softens winningly when we see him caring for his feline brood or enjoying the kind attentions of Parlo’s Juliette. Jules is only aligned with anarchy, not malice – and he ultimately becomes heroic. He’s funny, too, of course. Who can forget the sight of Jules, enacting both sides of a wrestling bout, crouching and flipping on the roof of the barge? Or stripped to the chest with a cigarette perched in his navel, so that the face inked on his stomach turns into a living portrait?View image in fullscreenCharles Granval and Simon in Boudu Saved From Drowning.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamySimon’s characters often have this flavour of the strange and unexpected, of roughness transformed suddenly into charm. He died in 1975, basking in the second fame brought by his career-reviving role in The Two of Us. He was 80, an elder statesman of the French cinema. To his colleagues on set, Simon appeared to be an instinctive actor, who hated doing retakes, but his apparent spontaneity was the fruit of diligent preparation. He simply didn’t need a second take. “I live a scene as a moment,” he said. “And once it’s dead, God himself could not revive it.”Jean Vigo’s L’Atalante, Zéro de Conduite, Taris and À Propos de Nice will be released as a boxset in 4K UHD in DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmFranceL'AtalantefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi said on X.Often called Bollywood’s “He-Man” in reference to his muscular physique, handsome looks and rugged charm, Dharmendra was known for his versatility in roles that spanned genres, from comedy and action to emotional dramas and, later, a focus on character roles.View image in fullscreenCrowds gather around cars leaving Dharmendra’s funeral in Mumbai on Monday.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAHe was particularly loved for his role as in the 1975 Indian western, Sholay, where he and another popular actor, Amitabh Bachchan, played a pair of lovable, small time criminals, in what is still one of Bollywood’s most beloved on-screen friendships.Dharmendra came from a simple, agrarian background. He was born in a village in rural Punjab and his father was a schoolteacher. His break into film came in 1960 when he won a film talent contest and went alone to Mumbai, the heart of Indian cinema.With his oft-remarked upon good looks, he soon established himself as the go-to romantic hero of Bollywood. He made his break with Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere in 1960, and was known to inspire fervour among his many devoted fans.Dharmendra starred in more than 300 films and also dabbled in politics, becoming an MP for the ruling Bharatiya Janata party from 2004 to 2009. He continued to act throughout his term and was rarely seen in parliament.View image in fullscreenFans in Mumbai mourn the news of Dharmendra’s death.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAHis off-screen life was also a source of endless fascination and his family became something of a Bollywood dynasty. Dharmendra had four children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur, two of whom became Bollywood stars. But his electric on-screen chemistry with the actor Hema Malini resulted in his leaving Kaur and marrying Malini in 1980. They had two daughters, one of whom also became a Bollywood actor.In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian honour, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema.He continued to act well into his late 80s, even as his health began to decline. His final feature, Ikkis, is due to be released in cinemas next month.Explore more on these topicsBollywoodIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the Fairy Godfather has the hots for the dameAnya RyanMon 24 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 04.15 ESTShareThis is not your bog-standard Jack and the Beanstalk. In Sonia Jalaly’s version, the story has been picked up and dropped into a school in Hammersmith, run by the meat-loving monster Fleshcreep (John Partridge, who wears a salami-printed suit). There’s no giant either; just a colossus computer system hidden in the sky, built to wipe children’s brains of all their imagination.It’s all good fun and games, but at times you long for a little familiarity. Still, with the truly wonderful Fairy Godfather (Jade Hackett) at the front and centre of this production, it would take a real Scrooge not to be taken in by all the festivity. Hackett combines wizardry with wisdom to serve up one of the most commanding turns I’ve ever seen on a panto stage.Directed by Nicholai La Barrie, the production fizzes with cheery spark. There’s a fiery love story between Momma Trott and the Fairy Godfather; they’re drawn together like magnets every time they lock eyes on stage. What’s not here are the political jokes that have characterised Lyric pantos of years gone by. Apart from a single reference to theColdplay CCTV cheating saga(very well done), it doesn’t feel particularly topical either.View image in fullscreenNervous character … Joey James as Jack.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSo, La Barrie leans fully into the sparkle of it all. The pop hits come thick and fast, with choreography by Kayla Lomas-Kirton sending the stage into a disco ball frenzy. Jack, played by Joey James, is a nervous little thing and hides behind a sock puppet (used to varying degrees of success) that sits on his arm. His sister Jill (a brilliantly sassy Sienna Widd) has a no-nonsense attitude and refuses to be intimidated by evil Fleshcreep’s threats. When her mum and brother finally enter the giant’s kingdom after climbing a beanstalk made of socks to rescue her, she is totally unfazed by the whole thing.Sam Harrison’s dame might not have the flair of others who have gone before her. But, with Partridge at the helm, this is a properly sinister Christmas hit. Even the audience fear him – proper fee-fi-fo fun.At Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrePanto seasonChildren's theatreLyric HammersmithComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)PuppetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

But writing for the Bard is the best of all, he saysMon 24 Nov 2025 05.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 07.56 ESTShareThree years back, Matt Maltese was in a casual co-writing session with some friends. Out of it came a song called Magnolias, a stripped back piano ballad about imagining his own funeral. “I didn’t think anything of it,” he says. “And then two years later, we heard some quite bizarre whispers thatRosalíahad somehow heard it.” It was true: six months ago, Maltese was sent the Spanish pop star’s demo of the song. He tried not to get too excited, even when, a few weeks back, a blurred-out photo of a Rosalía album tracklisting appeared online. “On the WhatsApp group we were like: I think that says Magnolias!”Magnolias ended up as the final track on Rosalía’s new operatic masterpiece, Lux: one of the most talked-about albums of the year, currently sitting in the UK Top 5. Maltese first heard the finished song the day the album came out, when he’d got back to London from a US tour. “I took a long jet-lagged walk and listened to the whole album to contextualise it. It’s extraordinary.” On Magnolias, Rosalía changed some words, he says, “and dramatised it incredibly. It’s exquisite. It’s a gift from someone, somewhere, that it fell into her lap.” It’s all anyone has wanted to talk to him about since. “I’ve had a lot of follow backs on Instagram,” he smiles.The 30-year-old British-Canadian has quietly become a successful and influential figure. Across six solo albums since 2018, Maltese’s indie-pop balladry mixes a modern type of male sensitivity with the wry humour of his hero, Leonard Cohen. Aided by a viral TikTok moment, he has six million monthly listeners on Spotify and over 1bn streams combined; his latest album Hers, a lush distillation of longing and desire, was his first to chart.It’s won him A-list fans in Sabrina Carpenter, Doja Cat, Frank Ocean, Laufey and BTS’s V, and made him a songwriter in demand. Maltese has written for and with artists such as Celeste, Joy Crookes, Jamie T and Tom Misch – even the Bard himself. Last year, Maltese wrote music for a Royal Shakespeare Company productionof Twelfth Nightin Stratford-upon-Avon. Next month it comesto the Barbican in London, where we meet by its lakeside terrace on an unseasonably warm afternoon. “Co-writing with Shakespeare,” he smiles. “That’s probably the best one, right?”Growing up in Reading to Canadian parents, Maltese moved to London in his teens, falling into the “great community” of the burgeoning south London scene centred on the Brixton Windmill pub. But among alternative post-punk bands such as Goat Girl, Shame and Sorry, he was very much the odd one out. “I was like, I’m the soppiest one here. They’re ‘fuck the world’ and I’m like, ‘ah, but the world is such a nice thing’.”In 2015 he signed to Atlantic Records off the back of promising Soundcloud demos. “They told me I was the voice of a generation.” But that didn’t save him when 2018 debut album Bad Contestant didn’t perform to Atlantic’s expectations. He was an ill fit for the major label system, he says: “As a snobbish 19-year-old, I said no to a lot of things.” He was once asked to cover John Lennon’s Happy Xmas (War is Over) for a BBC Christmas trailer. “And I insisted that I would only do it if I could record it in a minor key.” He starts laughing. “It was atrocious.” It never got used, and he was subsequently dropped. “But I needed that blow. I wasn’t treating it enough like a job.”He looked at what was left of his £50,000 advance. “I worked out I had eight months before I’d have to quit music and get a job.” So he hibernated in his bedroom, sore from Atlantic’s rejection and “some messy personal relationship stuff”, and worked on songs. “That period was good for me because it made me comfortable in my own skin. It really made me write songs even more from the heart.” His independently released 2019 second album Krystal started a “positive spiral”.View image in fullscreenMatt Maltese performing in October at Fox Theater in Oakland, California.Photograph: Steve Jennings/Getty ImagesHis career really took off in 2021 when his 2017 track As the World Caves In, an apocalyptic ballad that imagined Donald Trump and Theresa May spending the last night on earth together, blew up on TikTok. Charli xcx and Shawn Mendes posted about it; on one “ridiculous day” it was the second most streamed song worldwide by a British artist behind Dua Lipa. After Atlantic, it was vindication, to a point. “They are making all the money from it,” he smiles ruefully: around £20,000 a week at the song’s height.But it brought him a whole new fanbase. “It used to be divorced dads and students.” Now, he has screaming fans in the 18-23 age range. “Especially in America,” he says, where he’s just headlined the 5,900 capacity Greek theatre in Los Angeles. “But it’s so funny to self-identify that I’ve become a TikTok person. I think that skewed a lot of people’s impressions.”Maltese’s real passion is the craft of songwriting. “I didn’t come out the womb with a mic on.” Hence his embrace of the co-writing sideline. Sometimes within a group – Magnolias was written in that session with Danny Casio, Sophie May and Daniel Wilson – but often intimately with the artist themselves.‘It’s impossible not to have contradictions in a contradictory world’: Catalan pop visionary Rosalía on critics, crisis and being ‘hot for God’Read moreHe has a particularly close relationship with the chart-topping jazz-pop singerCeleste. “She’s great at disrupting the norm.” Once, uninspired by the expensive studio environment, she took him to a grotty rehearsal space. “It was January and it was freezing, a big dark room with no heating. We wrote there for a week.” They ended up with three songs for Celeste’s wonderful new album Woman of Faces – destined for the Top 10 this week – and the standalone track Everyday.Joy Crookes is another artist Maltese is close to: after 2021’s Skin, he co-wrote Crookes’ 2025 single Mathematics. When he heard the finished track, he was amazed that UK rap legend Kano had added a guest verse. “I am a white boy from Reading; to have a credit with Kano is just insanity.” Even after Rosalía, Maltese is still getting used to his growing imprint on pop. “I don’t necessarily feel like I’m hugely culturally relevant. I’m just someone obsessed with songwriters from the 70s. I feel very lucky that people care.”Matt Maltese is on tour, playing SWG3, Glasgow, Wed; O2 Ritz, Manchester, Thu; and Roundhouse, London, FriExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockRosalíaCelesteRoyal Shakespeare CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the first five minutes, we’ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titansBring Me the Horizon, who they supported last year. Opener Specter is enough to justify this step up: an anthemic recent single as atmospheric as the dry ice crawling around frontman Noah Sebastian.Although tonight’s set list is rooted in metal, it showcases the band’s ambitions towards other genres, incorporating elements of industrial, electronica and drum’n’bass. This fluid approach is anchored by Sebastian’s supremely adaptable vocals, which switch from croon to scream to whisper, even deftly mimicking the flow of metal princess Poppy during their collaborative single VAN. Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance. The band’s willingness to lean into zeitgeisty pop sounds is key to their mainstream appeal: The Death of Peace of Mind is reminiscent of the gloomy R&B of the Weeknd, by way of Bring Me the Horizon – all falsetto and moody beats with heavy metal drops.View image in fullscreenPulling out the stops … Bad Omens’s stage show.Photograph: PR IMAGEThis unabashedly big sound and anthemic songwriting is well suited to arenas – but Bad Omens themselves are not, at least not yet. They’re more like consummate professionals playing a good reproduction of what’s already on record; it might be big-venue nerves, or how spread out they are, but there’s a lack of connection on stage, like a star and his backing band rather than a group with chemistry. And a reluctant star at that: when Sebastian asks the audience if they’re having fun, he doesn’t seem to be having that much of it himself.AtAlexandra Palace, London, 26 November;then touring.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Peter Wollny, the musicologist behind last week’s “world sensational” revelation oftwo previously unknown worksby Johann Sebastian Bach, had a funny feeling when he chanced upon two intriguing sheets of music in a dusty library in 1992.His equivalent of the Columbo turn, from mere hunch to unravelling a secret, would take up half his life.Wollny, now 65 and the director of Leipzig’s Bach archive, was a graduate student at Harvard University when his PhD research took him to the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels, where he came across two unattributed scores from the 18th century.Two long-lost organ pieces by JS Bach performed for first time in 300 yearsRead more“I have to confess that I didn’t even think these were works by Bach at the time,” Wollny said this week, days after the two pieces – Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178 and Chaconne in G minor BWV 1179 – were performed at Leipzig’s St Thomas church for the first time.“The handwriting of the score just fascinated me, and I had this vague feeling that these bits of paper could be interesting some day. So I made photocopies and created a file that I dragged around with me for 30 years.”Despite having dedicated his life to researching the life and music of the greatest composers of the baroque era, he said he did not seriously dare consider that the works could be by the man himself until about two or three years ago.Born in Issum in North Rhine-Westphalia, Wollny studied musicology, art history and German studies at the University of Cologne before embarking on his Harvard PhD, on the music of Bach’s eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. He joined the Bach archive in Leipzig as a researcher after gaining his doctorate in 1993 and has been its director since 2014.1:01Chaconne in D Minor: two long-lost organ pieces by Bach performed for first time in 300 yearsHis colleague and co-researcher Bernd Koska said: “Peter Wollny is someone who tends to weigh things up in his mind very thoroughly before he reaches a conclusion. That’s the way he works.”To the eyes of a trained musicologist, the two works were unusual from the outset. Both are chaconnes, originally a form of Spanish dance that became stylised into its own musical art form around the year 1700. Their distinguishing feature is a short bass line that is repeated throughout the work, known as an ostinato.In almost all chaconnes for organ from the same period, each ostinato bass motif has a set length of six, seven or eight bars – never longer, never shorter. Yet in the Chaconne in D Minor that Wollny had found in Brussels, the composer had set off with a seven-bar ostinato bass and then decided to stretch the same motif to eight bars, then 12 and then 16.The anonymous composer had made other bold choices, such as repeating the bass melody in a higher register with a one-bar delay, creating a canon. They had also turned the ostinato bass into a four-part fugue, a musical tool used to weave a single theme into the broader musical tapestry.View image in fullscreenA page from the manuscript of Bach’s Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178.Photograph: Royal Library of Belgium/AFP/Getty ImagesWollny describes these idiosyncratic touches as the musical equivalent ofhapaxlegomena– words that only appear once in a body of text. “These works didn’t fit into the scheme of mainstream composition around the year 1703 at all,” he said.The only other known composition from this early period to use similarly bold techniques was Bach’s Passacaglia in C Minor BWV 582.In-depth study of Bach, who was famous for incorporating elements that function like mathematical riddles and puzzles into his music, has a notoriety for yielding obsessions. There are sinister Bach maniacs in Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniac films and in novels of the recent Nobel laureate László Krasznahorkai. In the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter chews off a prison guard’s face to the strains of the Goldberg Variations.“If you listen to a lot of Bach, he becomes a part of you,” said John Butt, a professor of music at Glasgow University. “Throughout history there have been a lot of musicologists who believed they had a more personal relationship with his works than everybody else.”As a result, attempts to authenticate or date works by Bach on the basis of the musical stylistics alone had a patchy track record, he said. “There have been a lot of red faces.”Wollny, however, had another special skill that helped his research. “I want to be careful how it put this,” he said. “But it could be the case that I have a talent for recognising handwriting features.”After discovering the two anonymous works in Brussels, he felt an “inner duty” to identify their author, spending several hours studying the unique traits of the lines on paper. “You start by studying the treble and bass clef, because they contain a lot of individuality,” he said.He noticed that the person who had written the documents had a unique way of drawing the C clef at the start of a staff, with a line at the bottom that curled backwards in a manner not dissimilar to the C clef in Bach’s musical notations. “It’s fairly complicated, you need about 10 strokes to get it right,” Wollny said.View image in fullscreenA detail of Bach’s Wedding Quodlibet, showing his distinctive C clef in the top left.Photograph: The Bach Archive Leipzig/Manfred Gorke CollectionHaving already studied Bach’s handwriting in depth, however, he knew that the two Brussels scores couldn’t have been written by the composer personally. Before the widespread and affordable use of mechanical reproduction, composers commonly had students who copied their works – either for the practical purpose of dissemination or, if the composer was already famous, to sell copies for commercial gain.If a doctor makes a mistake it’s not such a big deal. But if I make an error it will sit in books for hundreds of yearsPeter WollnyIn Bach’s case, these “copyists” or their parents would have paid the composer to work for him rather than vice versa – often transcribing his original manuscripts in German organ tablature into scores with notes – to learn through the act of transcription.Over the years, Wollny found 20 more documents that matched the handwriting of the original document in archives in Leipzig, Berlin and Winterthur, in Switzerland, covering the years 1705 to 1715. If the two chaconnes only had words on the title pages, others came with lyrics and introductory texts. “A profile started to emerge. I developed an idea of the copyist’s professional duties and interests,” Wollny said.View image in fullscreenA statue of Bach outside St Thomas church in Leipzig.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianBut he still didn’t have the name. He erroneously assumed for years that the score had been written by a cousin of Bach. In 2012, however, Wollny’s colleague Koska discovered a 1727 letter in which a certain Salomon Günther John applied for a job as organist at a church in Schleiz, Thuringia.Not only did the handwriting match that of the documents in Wollny’s file but the letter also stated that John had learned his instrument under an organist in Arnstadt, the small town where Bach had taken his first job as an organ teacher. “Suddenly, things started to click together,” Koska said.What if the two works were composed by the young student rather than his more famous teacher? The researchers discounted this theory because there were too many small mistakes in the notation, such as incorrect octave layers.Still, Wollny wasn’t 100% sure. “I asked myself: do I only see Bach behind this music because I want to, or is it really true? If a doctor makes a mistake it’s not such a big deal. But as a musicologist, if I make an error it will sit in books in libraries for hundreds of years.”By chance, the final piece of the puzzle emerged from the archives in 2023. A court document written by John dated 1716 from a feudal estate in Oppurg, Thuringia, lost during the second world war and now cleaned up and made publicly accessible, matched the handwriting of the Brussels chaconnes with absolute certainty.Wollny says he doesn’t remember how he celebrated the breakthrough. “I am not someone to punch the air in delight. I just sat there with a grin and contentedly turned the pages,” he said.“Perhaps artificial intelligence means that what I spent 35 years on will in the future be done in a couple of days or hours. Maybe it will be easier and give us even more certainty. But that’s OK.”A picture caption on this article was amended on 24 November 2025. An image of the manuscript of Bach’s Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178 incorrectly said it was of G minor BWV 1179.Explore more on these topicsJS BachClassical musicGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Liz Johnson Artur relives how she photographed the anything-goes spirit of this DIY oasisCharlotte JansenMon 24 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Nov 2025 09.39 ESTShareFor more than three decades, Liz Johnson Artur has photographed “the people I’m with” – a characteristically modest expression that belies the radiance, intimacy and unshowy brilliance of her pictures, an extraordinary archive numbering thousands of images that celebrate beauty, resilience, community and resistance. Intimate and alive, her photographs – often shot on the fly, in streets, nightclubs and living rooms – pull you right into the moment, just before it disappears for good.PDA, the photographer’s latest book, celebrates a bygoneLondonunderground music scene. PDA was a popular queer club night that ran monthly in a Hackney basement from 2011 to 2021. The abbreviation PDA did not stand for a single phrase, apparently. Rather, the founders playfully suggested it could stand for many things, including Public Display of Affection, Please Don’t Ask, and even Pretty Dick Available.A lot went on in front of – and behind – the DJ booth!The club night’s fluidity and inclusivity were some of the things that enraptured Johnson Artur. “I used to take pictures in a queer club in Brixton in the 1990s. Then it was very separate, men and women. There was mixing – but this was a very different vibe.” While she’s “never been a clubber”, she became a regular at PDA. “There was a lot going on in front of and behind the DJ booth! PDA embraced everyone. They didn’t have a door policy. I was 30 years older than everyone there, but it was beautiful watching them take their space.”View image in fullscreen‘The pictures seem to jump to the sound of a bassline’ … dancers captured in PDA.Photograph: Liz Johnson Artur/BierkeIn black and white and colour pictures taken over several years attending PDA events, Johnson Artur, now 61, captures party-goers flexing their thigh-high boots, bodies glossy with sweat on the dancefloor, cigarettes, smiles and Schweppes. The pictures at times seem to jump to the sound of a bassline.It’s not the first time she has photographed people partying. Why does Johnson Artur love photographing music events so much? “They do something to people,” she says, speaking on the phone as she walks around Brixton on a Monday morning. “They can let go. It’s the most generous art form we have, because it needs us. It lives from how we react to it – and you can feel it’s yours and no one can take that away from you.”I guess I almost developed aunty feelings – we’d all come back and have food at my placeThe book also reflects Johnson Artur’s abiding interest in self-fashioning and self-expression in temporary, DIY and unconventional spaces. She attributes this curiosity in strangers’ lives to the four-day train journeys she would take as a child with her mother, from Germany back to the Soviet Union. “You would spend 24 hours with strangers in a small compartment,” she says, “and you have to get on – you start out being suspicious of each other, but in Russian culture, you put food on the table and you share, and you start talking.”Sharing these small spaces with strangers informed the way she works with her subjects. “I photograph people because each person has a story. I can’t tell it verbally, but I can make a point about human existence – we’re told we’re all different, but the stories, when you hear them, are often quite familiar.”Johnson Artur’s own story reflects a time in the 1960s when African students were sent to study in eastern Europe – which is how her Ghanaian dad met her Russian mother. Johnson Artur was born in Bulgaria and spoke Russian at home, later moving to Germany, where she was raised by her mother. “It’s who I am. I don’t know any different – everyone has their roots, and I don’t see mine as special. My work is not about black this, that, or the other. It’s about wanting to be yourself.”View image in fullscreen‘We have a wonderful time, then suddenly it’s over’ … one of the stars of PDA.Photograph: Liz Johnson Artur/BierkeThey lived for a time as illegal immigrants. As Johnson Artur wasn’t able to go to school, she spent a lot of time on the streets while her mother was at work. She got her first camera in the mid-1980s, when film was prohibitively expensive. “I never had the money to shoot like crazy. If I had five rolls, I had to stretch them to get the pictures I wanted. I couldn’t afford to mess up. I had to focus and learn to work with my tools in whatever situation I found myself in. It’s important to me not to take pictures I consider bad. That’s my German upbringing. Every picture in the archive counts.”In 1991, Johnson Artur moved to London. She studied at the Royal College of Art – and dived into the city’s music scene. “I suddenly experienced music in a totally different way. It was part of your life. Witnessing those places where you could express yourself, where you could make something out of nothing and have agency. People were making clubs in whatever room they could just for a few months. But it’s changing. You can’t do that now. It’s becoming harder to have any space. That’s a very painful thing.”One of the recurring figures in the PDA pictures is Carrie Stacks, the night’s co-founder DJ and nightlife icon. They appear at the decks, but also at home, getting ready, doing their makeup. These more intimate, daytime images give a sense of a close-knit community beyond the club. “I don’t look at it as a club book,” says Johnson Artur. “It is always about looking at people. It’s about how they create spaces to be safe with each other.” The book moves through photographs reflecting the rhythm and energy of a night, from posturing in lavish outfits on arrival at the club, to moments of high intensity, hands-in-air abandon, when the dancefloor is packed and chaotic with limbs and people embrace.View image in fullscreenShowing out: dancers in their finery.Photograph: Liz Johnson Artur/ BierkeIt’s a mix of striking, posed portraits of the club’s attractive young crowd, in which Johnson Artur’s subjects look directly back at her, often wearing little more than some sequins, heels and sunglasses, and moments of unchoreographed candour, in which the photographer and her camera are devoured in the fervour of the action: right next to the DJ booth as someone grabs the mic, or as two people share laughter or a kiss. It’s irrepressibly joyful to look at, an account that pays homage to a time and place but also captures timeless notions of desire, freedom and escape.Strutting into the club in their finery, her subjects emanate a confidence that belies the hostility they often face outside. “Not just on the street but also at home, where many people have big issues being who they are, in their own communities.”The book is the result of a careful and close collaboration with some of the PDA organisers. Was that difficult for a photographer with such stringent standards? “I’m used to holding on to pictures, deciding what goes where based on the quality – and I had to let go of that. It’s an interesting process. You can’t collaborate and only get what you want. You have to open up.”PDA also charts Johnson Artur’s evolving role in the community. “I guess I almost developed aunty feelings,” she says. As soon as her daughter was old enough, she started to take her along too. “We’d all come back and have food at my place. It wasn’t just nightlife. We really enjoyed each other’s company.” That mutual feeling of respect and trust, she says, comes through in the pictures. “When people see you and they trust you, they give. That’s the beauty I get.”A typical PDA night went on until 6am, and the last picture in the book depicts a reveller back outside in the early hours, making their way home again. Shot from behind and from afar, the figure flashes bright white against the darkness of the empty street, the soft focus reminiscent of the bleary-eyed vision after a long night out. It’s also a reminder that nothing lasts for ever. “That’s how we exist as humans,” says Johnson Artur. “We have a wonderful time, then suddenly it’s over.” PDA is a testament to that. “We’re only here for a minute,” she adds. “Let’s enjoy it.”PDA by Liz Johnson Artur is published today by BierkeExplore more on these topicsPhotographyLondonLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It looks as though it should be cleaned up, but it won’t be. The rind is not rubbish discarded by a careless visitor: it’s a perfect resin cast made by Armanious.Placed carefully around the gallery are resin recreations of other items more commonly seen in bins: a group of melted candles, blobs of Blu-Tack, crumbly chunks of polystyrene. These might seem unlikely subjects for an exhibition, but Armanious is one of several artists who have turned their eye to trash in recent years. Gavin Turk, Ai Weiwei, Susan Collis and Glen Hayward, among others, all go to similarly painstaking – and often expensive – lengths to recreate items that most people would not look twice at. Trompe l’œil sculptures of rubbish have been exhibited in museums around the world and fetched high prices at galleries and auctions. In October, a pile of sixgarbage bags cast in bronze by Turksold for £82,550 (roughly AU$167,000) at Sotheby’s in London.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningView image in fullscreenVisitors looks at a sculpture by British artist Gavin Turk, titled American Bag, in the grounds of Chatsworth House, England, in 2015Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesAn understandable reaction to Armanious’s shrivelled peel or Turk’s pricey bin bags is: are they a joke? Partly. They are undeniably playful, the artistic equivalent of“is it cake?”, the trend of bakers crafting lifelike replicas of everyday objects out of sponge and icing that swept TikTok, then reality TV.Gavin Turk: art’s king of trash on plastic, protest, prison and canning his peeRead moreArmanious’s creations are the latest in a long line of artworks connected to rubbish. Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque began incorporating scraps of wastepaper into their paintings in 1912. Five years later, Marcel Duchamp famously exhibited a porcelain urinal, an item manufactured to dispose of waste, as art. Ever since, artists have incorporated actual junk into their work to prompt reflection on which objects we value, and why.Creating the illusion of litter, however, is a largely 21st-century phenomenon and artists are pursuing it to varying effect. For Armanious, the labour of making an object, rather than finding one and rebranding it as art, deepens viewers’ investment in it. “The question that’s always asked is: why not just show the real thing? Why bother?” Armanious says. “The answer being, if I didn’t bother making it, you wouldn’t be bothered looking at it.”Sometimes it isn’t always clear what is rubbish and what is art: in 2001,a cleaner in a London galleryaccidentally threw out full ashtrays, half-filled coffee cups, empty beer bottles and newspapers that were actually an artwork by Damien Hirst. The same thing happened againat Sala Murat in Italy in 2014– and again last year, whensome crumpled beer cansmade by French artist Alexandre Lavet were mistaken for rubbish in a Dutch gallery.View image in fullscreenAll the Good Times We Spent Together by Alexandre Lavet. The work was accidentally thrown out by a cleaner at the LAM Museum in Lisse, the Netherlands.Photograph: Alexandre Lavet/LAM museumProducing something new also allows artists to play with materials to comment on what we deem worthy of our attention. In 2008, the British artist Susan Collis had an exhibition at Ingleby gallery in Edinburgh. But on opening night, there was no obvious artwork in sight, just a broom, some screws in the wall and a paint-spattered wooden block on the floor. It was only when visitors looked more closely that they discovered treasure in the detritus. The screws were made from 18-carat white gold and studded with sapphires, while the paint drops and dirt caked on to the broom were opals, pearls and other gemstones.Similarly, for Ai Weiwei’s 2023 exhibition at the Design Museum in London, he made precise marble recreations of a roll of toilet paper and a polystyrene takeaway box, complete with chopsticks. In normal times, these objects would be considered almost worthless, but early in the Covid-19 pandemic they became worth their weight in gold.View image in fullscreenAi Weiwei, Marble Takeout Container, 2015.Photograph: Courtesy Ai Weiwei studioThis heightened questioning of what we value is particularly urgent in our age of climate crisis. Turk made his first bronze bin bag in 2000 and has since made replicas of cardboard boxes, apple cores and much else. (Apples cores are also a favourite subject of Glen Hayward, who carves similar pieces out of wood.) Turk has talked regularly about how we are defined by our rubbish –“We are what we throw away,”he previously told the Guardian– and his bulging bags reveal us to be greedy and wasteful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When it is increasingly difficult to parse what isfact or fiction, these artworks also make us question how much confidence we can place in our senses. They test the limits of our sight and, by extension, how we understand the world.View image in fullscreenArmanious’s 2015 work Logos, pictured inside Hany Armanious: Stone Soup, at the Buxton Contemporary in Melbourne. Courtesy the artist and Phillida Reid, London.Photograph: C Capurro/Christian CapurroArmanious’s replicas in particular are so accurate that gallery-goers must suspend their disbelief and trust that they truly are casts, not just found items. At Buxton Contemporary, the experience of trying to decipher them becomes a physical and mental task. Some sculptures are placed on the floor, others secreted on windowsills, yet more hung high on the walls, urging people to crouch and tiptoe as they try to look more closely at the works – all while watching their step. The effect is simultaneously unsettling and invigorating.It’s also fun, something that’s not always associated with contemporary art. “If you’re not enjoying the work, and having serious fun, then it’s not working,” says Armanious. “Fun is quite a serious state: it’s fully engaged, amused and curious.”Curiosity is perhaps the word that best describes the feeling engendered by Armanious’s mind-boggling creations. They are so inconceivable that it is tempting to reach out and touch them, to feel the difference between his copies and the originals. But please don’t – it is art, after all.Hany Armanious: Stone Soupis at Buxton Contemporary Melbourne until 11 April 2026Explore more on these topicsArtAustralian artSculptureGavin TurkAi WeiweiDamien HirstfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I like to fill squares of pastry and fold them into little triangular puffs, but if you prefer more of a Cornish pasty look (*food writer cancelled for suggesting paneer is an appropriate pasty filling!*), by all means stamp out circles, fold into half-moons and crimp the edges.Spiced paneer puffs with quick-pickled carrot raitaPrep20 minCook25 minServes3-4225g block paneer2 spring onions, trimmed20g mint leavesZest of 1 lime,plus 15ml lime juice1 green chilli, deseeded if you wish1 heapedtsp flaky sea salt1tbsp self-raising flour320g roll puff pastry1egg, beatenFor the quick-pickled carrot raita½tsp fennel seeds½tsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed30ml white-wine vinegar½tsp flaky sea salt, crumbled2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped300g carrots, peeled, quartered lengthways and finely sliced150g natural yoghurtHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Tip the paneer, spring onions, mint leaves, lime zest and juice, green chilli and salt into a food processor, and blitz, scraping down the sides occasionally, until the mix resembles very fine couscous. Add the flour, and blitz again until the mix has broken down even more finely. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.Unroll the pastry and cut it into 12 equal squares. Divide the paneer mixture evenly between the pastry squares (just over a heaped tablespoon on each square should do it), then bring up two opposite ends of the pastry to make a triangle. Squeeze gently all around the edges to seal, then transfer to a lined baking sheet. Repeat until all the pastry triangles are sealed (you can sit them upright, like little dumplings, or on their sides like triangles). Brush the pastries with the beaten egg, then bake for 25 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.Meanwhile, toast the fennel and coriander seeds in a small dry frying pan, then put them in a large bowl with the vinegar and salt. Mix well, then stir in the spring onions and carrots. Leave to pickle until you’re ready to eat.Just before serving, stir the yoghurt through the quick-pickled carrots, and serve alongside the hot pastry puffs.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyCheeseBakingPastrySnacksSaladIndian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Food styling assistant: Eden Owen-Jones.FoodSalty-sour noodles, shallot pasta and lamb ragu: Alison Roman’s recipes for store-cupboard specialsMake-ahead caramelised shallot pasta, brothy vinegar noodles with mushrooms and sesame, and a super-savoury lamb raguAlison RomanMon 24 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareTo say this caramelised shallot pasta changed my life might be a bit dramatic,but it also might be true – then again, so many people love a little skillet of caramelised shallots, a tin of anchovies and a whole lot of tomato puree as much as I do. But, first, for me one of life’s greatest pleasures is a bowl of perfectly cooked, slippery udon or soba in a shallow pool of something salty and vinegary, eaten alone on a brief but well-deserved lunch break. These noodles are a homage to the countless solo lunches I’ve had at a variety of wonderful Japanese restaurants.Brothy vinegar noodles with mushrooms and sesame (pictured top)Keep in mind that, while the brothy sauce (or saucy broth?) is designed to pool generously at the bottom of your bowl, this is certainly not a soup, and there shouldn’t be much of it left over to drink – only enough to generously dress your noodles. It’s intense in the best way, and hopefully there’s a bit left at the end to dip your lightly blanched greens into (only a suggestion, but a good one).Prep10 minCook30 minServes43tbsp olive oil675g mushrooms(oyster, chestnut, shiitake, maitake, etc), torn or cut into bite-sized piecesSea salt andblack pepper225g Chinese broccoli, or broccolini or baby pak choi, or other leafy greens of your choice, to serve (optional)225-280g dried udon or soba4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced120ml soy sauce, or tamari, plus extra to taste90ml white distilled vinegar, plus extra to taste1–2tbsp toasted sesame oil2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped or grated40g toasted sesame seeds(optional)25g garlic chives, orspring onions or chives, finely choppedPut the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot on a medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, season, then cook, stirring occasionally, until they’re evenly and nicely browned – 12-18 minutes. (Mushrooms tend to differ in how long they take to cook, so be patient and keep cooking if they aren’t browned by the 18-minute mark.)Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. If using the greens, quickly blanch them (for a minute and a half to two minutes for the thick-stemmed likes of Chinese broccoli or pak choi, about a minute for leafy greens such as kale). Lift out using tongs or a slotted spoon, and set aside (there’s no need for an ice bath).Add the noodles to the boiling water, and boil until cooked through (each type of noodle will vary, so follow the package instructions). Drain and rinse under cold water.Once the mushrooms are nicely browned and cooked through, add the garlic and stir to cook for a minute or two. Add the soy sauce, vinegar and 750ml water, bring to a simmer, then take off the heat. Add the sesame oil and ginger, taste the sauce and adjust with more salt, soy or vinegar as required.To serve, divide the noodles between four bowls, ladle some hot broth into each bowl and top with some of the mushrooms. Scatter the sesame seeds (if using) and chives over the top and serve with the greens alongside for dipping.Caramelised shallot pastaView image in fullscreenAlison Roman’s caramelised shallot pasta.The shallot paste can be made up to one month ahead, then stored, sealed and refrigeratedPrep10 minCook45 minServes460ml olive oil6 large shallots, peeled and very thinly sliced5 garlic cloves, peeled; 4 thinly sliced, 1 finely choppedSea salt andblack pepper1tsp chilli flakes, plus extra to serve60gtinned anchovy fillets(about 12), drained125-185g tomato puree(equivalent to 1 whole tube or tin)350-450g dried pasta, preferably a long, thin one such as bucatini or spaghetti1 handfulfresh parsley, tender leaves and stems finely choppedFlaky sea saltPut the oil in a large skillet or casserole on a medium-high heat. Add the shallots and sliced garlic, season and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes, until the shallots are completely soft and caramelised with golden-brown edges.Add the chilli flakes and anchovies (there’s no need to chop the latter because they will dissolve soon enough), then cook, stirring, to melt the anchovies into the shallots – about two minutes.Add the tomato puree, season and cook, stirring constantly to prevent any scorching, for about two minutes, until the tomato has started to cook in the oil a bit, caramelising at the edges and going from bright red to a deeper brick-red colour. Take off the heat and transfer roughly half the mixture to a sealable container, leaving the rest behind in the pan. (The contents of the container are your leftovers to be used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta, say, or smeared on to roast vegetables, or spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.)Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then cook the pasta until it’s very al dente (perhaps more al dente than usual). Save 480ml of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta. Transfer the pasta to the shallot pot (or, if you are using the leftover portion, to a hot skillet) and add 250ml of the reserved pasta water. Cook on a medium-high heat, swirling the skillet to coat each piece of pasta and using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any bits on the bottom, until the sauce is reduced and a little sticky, and perfectly coats each strand of pasta (add a splash or two more pasta water if you need it) – three to five minutes.Combine the parsley and the finely chopped garlic in a small bowl and season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide the pasta between bowls or transfer to one large serving bowl and top with the parsley-and-garlic mixture and a few more chilli flakes, if you like.Weeknight lamb ragu with anchovyView image in fullscreenAlison Roman’s weeknight lamb ragu with anchovy.This ragu is unapologetically lamb-forward. You could also use pork, beef or a mix, and it will turn out great – this recipe is really just a Trojan horse to inspire you to add anchovies or fish sauce to a quick ragu. These pantry staples deepen the flavours, and suggest a complexity that’s usually achieved only through time. Either ingredient is simultaneously virtually undetectable and paramount to success: barely anyone will notice they’re there, except to remark on how above-average fantastic this ragu is. The ragu can be made up to three days ahead, then stored, sealed and refrigerated, or up to two months ahead if frozen.Prep5 minCook50 minServes4-62tbsp olive oil1 medium yellow onion, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely choppedSea salt andblack pepperA pinch of chilli flakes(optional)2 anchovy fillets,or ½ tsp fish sauce2tbsp tomato puree450gmincedlamb2 x 400gtins crushed tomatoes350gdried pasta(noodles or tubes), to serve1 good hunkparmesan or pecorino, to serve1 small handful fresh marjoram, oregano or thyme leaves, to serve (optional)Put the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, season and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and softened – five to eight minutes. Add a pinch of chilli flakes (if using) and the anchovies, and cook for a minute or two to toast the chilli and melt the anchovies.Add the tomato puree and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, so it has a chance to stick to the bottom of the pot and caramelise a bit – two to three minutes.Add the lamb and season. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, stir until the fat starts to soften and the meat begins to break down. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the lamb begins to brown and sizzle in its own fat – eight to 10 minutesAdd the crushed tomatoes, stirring to scrape up any bits on the bottom of the pot. Half-fill the empty tomato tin with water, swirling to get any excess tomato that’s still hanging around in there, the pour into the sauce. Season again, then bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce is thick and insanely flavourful – 25–30 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until just before al dente. Reserve 250ml of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and put it back in the pot.To serve, toss the sauce into the pasta along with 120ml of the reserved pasta water, then cook on a medium heat until the pasta is perfectly cooked and nicely dressed – two to three minutes. Take off the heat, then divide the pasta between bowls and top with plenty of grated cheese. Scatter with marjoram, if you like, and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Something from Nothing, by Alison Roman, published by Quadrille at £27.
