As the broadcaster hits 70, we look back on the highlights – and lowlightsMark LawsonMon 22 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 07.06 EDTShareFor more than two decades, the BBCTelevisionService was the only option for UK viewers. Until 22 September 1955, when a commercial rival, Independent Television, started at 7.15pm with fanfares and speeches from a launch jamboree at London’s Guildhall, continuing with playlets from Oscar Wilde and Noël Coward, then a middleweight boxing bout.Over the subsequent seven decades,ITVhas screened shows that are unforgettable, wrongly and rightly forgotten and, in some cases, now-unforgivable. Here, as a 70th birthday card, are the most significant shows from each year, reflecting the shift from regional franchises to a single ITV Studios with dozens of independent production companies.1955 – Take Your Pick!Because it was funded by advertising rather than the licence fee (£3 per year at the time), ITV was able to be more commercial in gameshow prizes, which, on the BBC, had to be token. (Crackerjack,launched in the same year, gave pencils to winners and cabbages to losers!) On the first British show to offer cash prizes, finalists had to take their pick from boxes numbered one to 10, potentially winning a booby prize, a cash gift of £80 (about £1,800 now) or the “star prize” (car/package holiday).1956 –The OutsiderView image in fullscreenPrestige … Jane Birkin on Armchair Theatre – Poor Cherry.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockEarly regional franchises were awarded on the “quality” of their programme proposals, usually taken as code for “public service”. This meant high-end drama, including Armchair Theatre, a long-running (until 1974) prime-time slot for single plays. The majority were originals but, perhaps aiming for prestige, it began with a revival of a 1923 theatre piece, The Outsider, though, less conservatively, it was written by a woman, Dorothy Brandon.1957 – Jim’s InnHow nakedly commercial ITV could or should be was much debated. Initially, some regions broadcast an “advertising magazine” – mini-dramas packed with actors pushing products. Among the most successful was Jim’s Inn, set in a mock pub where the presenter, Jimmy Hanley, tried to flog stuff. Such programmes were outlawed in the 1963 Television Act and “product placement” illegal for 54 years.1958 – William TellIn the year that Pope Pius XII declared St Clare of Assisi the patron saint of TV – some pious Catholics placed an icon beside their aerials to boost the signal – this was an early international co-production. Lew Grade (uncle ofMichael Grade) had failed to win a franchise but his Incorporated Television Company sold shows to the networks, including this tea-time adventure series for which 14th-century Switzerland was recreated in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.1959 – Probation OfficerFact-based drama become a key ITV brand and this pioneer, fictionalising real cases from Probation Service files, was billed as a “dramatised documentary series”. Early ITV schedules had been dominated by half-hour dramas, but Probation Officer popularised the one-hour prime-time slot.1960 – Coronation StreetView image in fullscreenUnusually female-led … Violet Carson as Ena Sharples on Corrie.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesFive years after the BBC tried to spook ITV with soap opera – diverting 20 million radio listeners from the new service by killing young bride Grace in The Archers –ITV launched a TV soapthat has often rattled the BBC with its popularity. Made in the north of England about the north of England, it was also unusually female-led, with stand-out early characters including Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed), although William Roache as Ken Barlow was there then and remains now.1961 – SurvivalThe ratings hit this year was The Avengers, but at least as influential and more enduring was this wildlife series, which ended up running for 40 years. The title initially reflected Darwinian competition among animals but presciently came to imply extinction and conservation as well.1962 – Police5Lew Grade took over a failing Midlands franchise to create ATV, which found a canny way to fill five-minute gaps that were left because US imports tended to be shorter than ITV slots. Viewers were invited, pre-CCTV, to identify wrong ’uns from identikit and witness statements. “Keep ’em peeled,” said hostShaw Taylorfrom Scotland Yard at the end of each episode, pointing to his eyes. The grass-your-neighbours format peaked with the BBC’s Crimewatch UK (1984-2017) but Police 5, which ran until the early 90s, was the first guvnor.1963 – Ready Steady Go!View image in fullscreen‘The weekend starts here!’ … Stevie Wonder on Ready Steady Go! in December 1963.Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns/GettyThe era of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones spawned much pop music TV. A year ahead of the BBC’s Top of the Pops, this Friday evening live music and interview show spread the catchphrase: “The weekend starts here!”1964 – 7 UpView image in fullscreenNot long now till 70 Up! … 7 Up.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesNow nine years old, ITV had more competition (BBC Two launched this year) and was thinking about growing up. Regional franchise Granada optimistically signalled its own longevity by starting a project that might last for nine decades, revisiting 14 seven-year-olds at seven-year intervals. Apart from Coronation Street, this is the longest surviving ITV franchise – and the network has already trailed 70 Up for 2026.1965 – ThunderbirdsView image in fullscreenA cultural powerhouse … Thunderbirds.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesOnly 32 episodes were made of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson’s weird but watchable super hero puppet show – featuring electronic marionettes with visible strings – but reruns, homages and parodies make it a cultural powerhouse.1966 – Weavers GreenBBC and ITV shared thebiggest TV event – England’s still only ever football World Cup victory – but less memorable is a soap set around a veterinary practice. Unlike several ITV soaps that lasted decades, it was over by Christmas, though looked to the future by using lightweight video cameras rather than cumbersome film for its Norfolk location scenes.1967 – News at TenInitially, ITV news was short, regional and moveable to maximise advertising space. The national half-hour bulletin, produced by Independent Television News (ITN), went for 10pm to avoid the 9pm-ish BBC main news and allow time for mid-evening movies. At a time when actors read the BBC news, ITN employed journalists (including Alastair Burnet andReginald Bosanquet, and laterAnna FordandTrevor McDonald) who became at least as famous as the presidents and prime ministers.1968 – The Big MatchIn the 1967 contest for licences, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) gave Friday-Sunday in the capital to London Weekend Television and the rest to Thames. Each launched a show as a direct challenge to the BBC – LWT’s The Big Match kicked Match of the Day while Magpie, also starting in 1968, challenged Blue Peter (born 1958).1969 – On the BusesAlongside one of ITV’s most shameful commissions – Curry and Chips, with Spike Milligan playing a cosmetically assisted Indian – comedy was better represented by this London-set show, which made a star ofReg Varney, about drivers and “clippies” (conductors) on the capital’s distinctive red double-deckers.1970 – KateThe recent reshuffle had created a new Leeds-based broadcaster called Yorkshire. Its first slate included Kate, a Wednesday 9pm hit about a newspaper agony aunt. Phyllis Calvert, a British movie star, made her TV debut, confirming the medium’s rising status.1971 – Upstairs, DownstairsView image in fullscreenPosh and retro … Lesley-Anne Down and Jean Marsh on Upstairs, Downstairs.Photograph: LWT/AllstarLWT – despite a partial takeover at the time by the Australian republican Rupert Murdoch (later blocked by regulators) – went posh and retro with Upstairs, Downstairs, a story of aristocrats and their servants starting in 1903 in the super-rich Belgravia part of the transmission area.1972 – Emmerdale FarmView image in fullscreenWhat a survivor … Annie Sugden, played by Sheila Mercier, in  Emmerdale Farm.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockDespite schedules including a supersoap, Coronation Street, and a subsoap – Crossroads – the network responded to government permission for more daytime hours with a lunchtime “continuing drama” intended by the network Yorkshire to flaunt the possibilities of colour television by filming in the county’s beautiful rural parts. It’s another longtime ITV survivor, though now in prime-time and (since 1989) just called Emmerdale.1973–Divorce His, Divorce HersThe network Harlech had secured the Welsh licence partly with the promise that the cultural king of Cymru, Richard Burton, and his wife, Elizabeth Taylor, would appear on screen. Eventually they did, in a “made for TV movie” about a divorce: the husband’s viewpoint on Sunday, the wife’s the next night. The performances felt authentic … perhaps because the couple divorced the next year, though they would remarry and redivorce within 24 months.1974 – The World at WarThe idea of an ITV giant, the Thames programme controller Jeremy Isaacs, The World at War had started late the previous year. But it was in the first half of 1974 that the magnitude and magnificence of this 26-part series became fully apparent – using archive and interviews to depict the second world war from its 1930s origins to its 1960s aftermath to an audience full of survivors and relatives of the dead.1975 – The SweeneyView image in fullscreenIt has influenced all cop shows since … Dennis Waterman and John Thaw in The Sweeney.Photograph: ShutterstockBecause all the regional licensees were contractually required to reflect their patch, Thames included the capital’s underside in a show that has influenced all cop drama since. Named after rhyming slang for the CID’s rapid reaction force, the flying squad (Sweeney Todd), the show was defined by loudness – shouting, squealing tyres and the stripes on fat ties.1976 – Bill BrandIt now seems remarkable that 13 Monday prime-time slots were given to Trevor Griffiths’ dense epic about the Westminster disillusionment of a new Labour MP from the north of England, played by Jack Shepherd. Yet it described a tension in the Labour party between ideological purity and governmental compromise that continues now.1977 – The ProfessionalsView image in fullscreenThe Sweeney on speed … Martin Shaw, Gordon Jackson and Lewis Collins in The Professionals.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/LwtEssentially The Sweeney on speed, this was a classy example of the popular TV trope of the secret police unit licensed to do anything to stop bad guys. The agents were Bodie (Lewis Collins), who had left the SAS because it was a bit soft, and Doyle (Martin Shaw), an ex-copper who calmed the regulator by expressing qualms about extreme methods.1978 – The South Bank ShowCurrently being celebrated for braining-up British radio through 27 years of In Our Time,Melvyn Bragggreatly boosted ITV’s IQ during 32 years of the finest British television arts series, including landmark chats with Harold Pinter, David Hockney, Victoria Wood, Martin Amis, Miriam Makeba andOlivier Messiaen.1979 – MinderThames continued as an anti-London Tourist Board with another Cockney classic, featuring criminals too petty for The Sweeney. George Cole played Arthur Daley, a hapless chancer, with Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, his ex-boxer bodyguard.1980 – Death of a PrincessMargaret Thatcher cited the BBC’s Yes, Prime Minister as her favourite show; this was among her least. ATV’s drama-documentary fictionalised an apparently true story of a princess executed for adultery in Saudi Arabia, where political reaction led to the banning of British Airways flights and the cancellation of trade deals. Condemning the show, the Thatcher government seemed to lament that it lacked Middle Eastern censorship powers. That ATV lost its ITV licence in the 1982 reshuffle was officially a coincidence.1981 – Brideshead RevisitedView image in fullscreenProvocative …  Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews in Brideshead Revisited, which remains among the greatest ever TV dramas.Photograph: AlamyThe north-west franchise Granada openly aspired to be a BBC beside the Manchester Ship canal, most provocatively parking its tanks on the lawns of the country house classic adaptation with this 13-part version of Evelyn Waugh’s 1945 novel about Catholic nobs. From Jeremy Irons’s mournful narration via a cameo from Lord Olivier to the honeyed photography, it terrified the BBC, as planned, and remains among the greatest TV dramas.1982 – WolcottView image in fullscreenSadly didn’t even transmit … George Harris as Winston Wolcott in Wolcott.Photograph: ShutterstockThe only annual entry in this list that didn’t transmit. A 13-part series had been announced following an impressive critical reception for the previous year’s pilot with George Harris as the first lead Black detective on British TV. However, the producing company, ATV, lost the Midlands contract in the 1981 franchise round (which, incidentally, inspired Jilly Cooper’s 1988 novelRivals, now a Disney+ sensation) and so a pioneering project ended.1983 – Auf Wiedersehen, PetATV replacement Central had a starry opening slate including Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, mainly written byDick Clement and Ian La Frenais,which followed a group of British “brickies”, “chippies” and “sparks” who, unemployed in the UK, worked on German building sites. Launching stars Kevin Whately, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, it should be viewed by all historians of the UK’s relationship with Europe.1984 – The Jewel in the CrownView image in fullscreenAwe-inspiring … Art Malik and Tim Pigott-Smith in The Jewel in the Crown.Photograph: Granada TVGranada’s stalking of the BBC continued with another high-end filmed book: a 14-parter adapted from Paul Scott’s novels about the fall of the British Raj rule of India. Stance and casting might now be considered Anglocentric but the show steered great careers – Charles Dance, Tim Pigott-Smith, Geraldine James, Art Malik – and it is hard not to feel awe at the ambition and funding British television could then have.1985 – Widows IIA year, rare at the time, of female power. Cilla Black became British TV’s most important woman through LWT’s matchmaker flagship Blind Date; four major female comedians –Dawn French,Jennifer Saunders, Ruby Wax and Tracey Ullman–starred in the Central sitcom Girls on Top;and the second series of Widows, a feminist twist on the gangster drama established Lynda La Plante as one of TV’s key writers.1986 –Hot MetalHaving briefly owned LWT, Rupert Murdoch, as a rightwing newspaper baron, was the clear target, with rival print tycoon Robert Maxwell, of this spirited two-season sitcom from David Renwick and Andrew Marshall in which Robert Hardy, through pioneering split-screen, played both the owner and editor of a tabloid, a good joke about editorial independence.1987 – Inspector MorseIn what seemed like overreach then but prescience now, the producer Kenny McBain persuaded ITV to give two hours to adaptations of Colin Dexter’s books about a depressive, real ale-drinking, crossword solving Oxford detective, giving John Thaw a very different TV police career after The Sweeney. Morse, which ran until 2000, still leaves clear DNA traces on all detective dramas and a sequel, Lewis (2006-15) and prequel,Endeavour(2012-23), make it, at 33 years on air, British TV fiction’s greatest dynasty.1988 – Death on the RockA show Thatcher liked even less than Death of a Princess, the This Week documentary examined the alleged “execution” of three IRA members in Gibraltar. The Foreign Office made unsuccessful attempts to have the film banned but it was almost certainly no accident that in the next ITV licence round, Thames lost London to Carlton, a company with a young David Cameron as head of PR.1989 – Agatha Christie’s PoirotView image in fullscreen‘C’est magnifique!’ … David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThe two oldest broadcasters fought over England’s most popular novelist, with the BBC favouring Miss Marple and ITV Hercule Poirot. David Suchet meticulously caught every Belgian-Anglo vowel and moustache twitch in dramatisations of all 70 Poirot stories over 24 years.1990 – Who Bombed Birmingham?World in Action had screened investigative documentaries since 1963 but achieved its greatest success with a drama-documentary that freed six innocent people suspected of being IRA terrorists from jail and remains a gold standard of the genre known as “faction”, using performers to engage audiences with reporting.1991 – Prime SuspectView image in fullscreenWhat a star … Helen Mirren as DCI Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockHaving feminised robbers in Widows, Lynda La Plante did the same for cops with Helen Mirren – another example of the level of star TV could now attract – as senior detective Jane Tennison, solving cases while fighting misogyny and alcoholism. Seven series over 15 years make this a signature crime franchise.1992 –GladiatorsView image in fullscreenDo you feel the power? … it’s Gladiators.Photograph: ITV/RexHighest-bidderfranchisesforced surviving networksdownmarketto pay for their licences. A symptom of populist desperation was Gladiators, an arena entertainment game in which pseudonymous characters – Wolf, Jet, Falcon – competed in bone-cracking challenges.1993 – CrackerView image in fullscreenCareer-best stuff … Robbie Coltrane and Geraldine Somerville in Cracker.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesJimmy McGovern refreshed the police procedural by focusing on criminal psychologist Fitz (Robbie Coltrane’s career-best role) who gets results despite or because of his own personality disorders.1994 – Charles: The Private Man, The Public RoleJonathan Dimbleby secured from the heir to the throne the then most candid royal interview, including, most shockingly to monarchists and clerics, an admission of adultery. Diana, Princess of Wales, retaliated next year with a Panorama heart-spill – obtained, we now know, by interviewerMartin Bashirthrough nefarious means – which led to divorce,Diana’s presence in a fast car in a Paris underpassin 1997 and incalculable mental consequences for the couple’s sons.1995 –Band of GoldView image in fullscreenStar-making … Barbara Dickson, Geraldine James, Ruth Gemmell and Cathy Tyson in Band of Gold.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockKay Mellor(1951-2022) showed her special talent for tragi-comedy about northern English working-class women – see also Fat Friends and Playing the Field – in this returning series about sex-workers in Bradford, with a cast including Geraldine James, already a star, and Samantha Morton, becoming one.1996 – HillsboroughSomehow both forensic and emotive, Jimmy McGovern’s docudrama about the 97 fatalities from incompetent policing of overcrowding at a Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup in 1989 stood as both a memorial and a court of public opinion.1997– Cold FeetView image in fullscreenA cast supreme … Cold Feet.Photograph: ShutterstockGranada’s domination of ITV drama in this period (four of the past five entries) continued with Mike Bullen’s tender but sometimes tough examination of young couples navigating love, infidelity, cancer, unemployment with a supreme ensemble cast: Helen Baxendale, Hermione Norris, James Nesbitt, Fay Ripley, Robert Bathurst, John Thomson.1998 –Who Wants to be a Millionaire?SinceTake Your Pick! on opening night, ITV had pushed for ever bigger contest prizes and reached the long-desired seven figures withChris Tarrantpresiding over a quiz that required players to risk huge losses to win big.1999 – Pride of Britain AwardsAt a time when ITV hits and red-top newspapers each reached tens of millions, tie-ups made sense. The Sun often seemed to have an inside track to Coronation Street and the network collaborated with the Daily Mirror on this honours system for regular Britons.2000 – At Home With the BraithwaitesITV was disappointed that rights to the National Lottery went (from 1994-2017) to the BBC, but the underbidder got the better content than the rotating balls in this sparkling four-season drama about the domestic and moral consequences for a family that wins £38m. The series debut ofSally Wainwright, who has become a key TV dramatist, though largely on the other side (Happy Valley, Last Tango in Halifax.)2001 – Harry Hill’s TV BurpView image in fullscreenBrilliantly silly … Harry Hill’s TV Burp.Photograph: ITV/AvalonFrom Denis Norden’s It’ll Be Alright on the Night (from 1977) through to Clive James on TV (LWT, 1992-98), television had been increasingly hungry to eat itself, ridiculing clips from mainly foreign shows. Hill took broadcast cannibalism to its highest levels by focusing on British TV, often from the previous week, with a combination of silliness (puppets, pranks) and real critical acuity.2002 – I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!With financial pressures collapsing the regional structure to make ITV a single broadcaster, there was economic canniness in a show that could fill two to three weeks of prime-time for the cost of flying fading celebrities to eat animal genitalia in the Australian rainforest and paying the presenting fees of Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, who became ITV royalty. For quizzers: the first winner was DJ Tony Blackburn.2003 – The Second ComingBoth Channel 4 and the BBC turned down Russell T Davies’s story of a young Mancunian, played with his special intensity by Christopher Ecclestone, who believes he is Jesus Christ returned to Earth on a mission to save the world from Armageddon. Theologically serious and unnervingly convincing, it has dated only in the Jesus 2.0 being a video store worker.2004 – The X FactorA year after fantasising about finding a Messiah, the network identified one who was real (with some cosmetic help) in Simon Cowell, whose pop contest show began his long domination of ITV schedules. NB quizzers: Steve Brookstein.2005 – The Jeremy Kyle ShowThough there was muttering about quality, no one could doubt ITV’s quantity: now four channels and a thriving morning schedule, including Jeremy Kyle’s Anglicisation of US confrontation shows in which former friends and warring families faced off over sex or money claims, with a lie detector on hand to identify (in theory) liars. The show was cancelled in 2019 after the suicide of a recent contestant, althougha coroner found“no causal link”.2006 – See No Evil: The Moors MurdersView image in fullscreenSensitively done … Maxine Peake and Matthew McNulty in See No Evil: The Moors Murders.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockThe story ofchild killers Myra Hindley (Maxine Peake) and Ian Brady (Sean Harris) was told with dramatic sensitivity in an early collaboration between two masters of true crime drama: writer Neil McKay and producer Jeff Pope, whose later collaborations includeAppropriate Adult,The MoorsideandFour Lives.2007 – Britain’s Got TalentView image in fullscreenRiding on success … Anthony McPartlin, Declan Donnelly and Patsy May in Britain’s Got Talent.Photograph: Tom Dymond/Thames/RexThe network’smost successful producer – Simon Cowell – and favourite presenters – Ant & Dec – formed a power throuple in this variety contest for acts ranging from opera singers to trick-performing dogs. One of the former – Paul Potts – won the first series; one of the latter – border collie Pudsey – the sixth run (of 18 so far.)2008 – Moving Wallpaper/Echo BeachA sudden ITV executive desire not to be known mainly for talent shows and bushtucker trials is the most plausible explanation for arguably its strangest ever prime-time show. A half-hour comedy about the making of a soap called Echo Beach was immediately followed by an episode of that show. Hard now to believe it really happened.2009 – The ChaseBack to business as usual with an ingenious quiz in which civilians compete against a terrifyingly knowledgable professional quizzer called The Chaser. Still running today, it was crucial in securing Bradley Walsh a contract to present all TV shows if possible.2010 –Downton AbbeyView image in fullscreenShe never even watched an episode … Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess Grantham in Downton Abbey.Photograph: Nick Briggs/APCombining echoes of earlier ITV posho-shows Upstairs, Downstairs and Brideshead Revisited with his own 2001 movie Gosford Park, Julian Fellowes created one of TV’s most prolific and profitable franchises (six TV series, five specials, three movies) by suggesting the Edwardian aristocracy were surprisingly kind and liberal and persuading Britain’s greatest actor –Dame Maggie Smith– to do TV as the Dowager Countess, although she claimed never to have watched an episode.2011 – Long Lost FamilyThe digital possibilities of social media reconnection drive a tear-jerker that, with appropriate psychological support, reunites separated relatives. Key to its continuing success is the emotional intelligence, deepened by crises in their own lives, of co-hosts Nicky Campbell andDavina McCall.2012 – The Martin Lewis Money ShowAs “austerity” gave way to a permanent “cost of living crisis”, financial advice was vital. With a natural broadcasting manner and an astonishing ability to digest small print and identify big savings, Lewis is an exemplary public service expert.2013 – BroadchurchView image in fullscreenAn enduring crime show … David Tennant as DI Alec Hardy and Olivia Colman as DS Ellie Miller in Broadchurch.Photograph: Kudos/ITV/Rex/ShutterstockCurious for a cast including an actor who had played the lead in Doctor Who (David Tennant) and another who soon would (Jodie Whittaker), Chris Chibnall’s series confirmed that an enduring crime show needs a beautiful location – Dorset’s Jurassic Coast – and a sense of the reality of death: Tennant and Olivia Colman, as contrasting glum/warm detectives, investigated the long consequences of a child murder over three series.2014 – The Lost Honour of Christopher JefferiesAfter the murder of young architect Joanna Yeates in Bristol, her landlord, the schoolteacher Christopher Jefferies, was suspected by police and effectively convicted by print and TV media. He was completely innocent and Peter Morgan’s drama, directed by Roger Michell, has a superb Jason Watkins in a warning story of someone beaten with the wrong end of the stick.2015 – UnforgottenMaking cold cases hot, Chris Lang’s scripts begin with the chance discovery of a corpse that soon links with a disparate range of people who think they have got away from it or with it. DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and DI Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) were perhaps more empathetic than homicide detectives can reasonably be, and Walker handed over to Sinéad Keenan for the fifth and sixth seasons.2016 – VictoriaView image in fullscreenIn full fig … Jenna Coleman as Queen Victoria.Photograph: Gareth Gatrell/ITV PlcThe 90th birthday year of the former British monarch seems to have sparked monarchical drama with the launch of both Peter Morgan’s The Crown (Netflix) and Daisy Goodwin’s glossy bio-drama of the woman whose 63-year reign Queen Elizabeth II had just overtaken. The decision to concentrate on the youth of a figure known for being old paid off in Jenna Coleman’s sparky performance.2017 –Little Boy BlueView image in fullscreenWhere he showed his genius … Stephen Graham in Little Boy Blue.Photograph: ITVNews-based drama supremo Jeff Pope wrote this gruelling but moving four-parter about the investigation into the gun murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in Liverpool in 2007. As the homicide cop in charge, Stephen Graham gave notice of his genius for hyper-realistic acting.2018 – Gemma Collins: DivaWith audiences fragmenting, networks needed to be a broad church but worshippers of Broadchurch may have regarded as the work of Satan this reality show featuring a vivid influencer which screened on ITVBe, a niche channel for younger women.2019 – Good Morning BritainThe year 2019 was pivotal in British politics with Boris Johnson becoming an unelected PM, then an elected one and pledging to “get Brexit done”. This period was also the television zenith of another PM – Piers Morgan – who, perfectly counterweighted by co-host Susanna Reid, made the breakfast sofa a nervous perch for all authority figures.2020 – The Masked SingerView image in fullscreen‘Take it off! Take it off!’ … The Masked Singer.Photograph: Vincent Dolman/Bandicoot TV/ITV/PAFuture historians will enjoy the fact that just before the UK population was forced into masks by the pandemic, the latest TV hit was based around face-coverings with contestants belting out a number while elaborately disguised as a hedgehog, sausage or dressed crab with the revelation (to audience chants of “Take it off!, Take it off!”), sometimes exposing an impressive level of celebrity.2021 –StephenTwenty-two years earlier, ITV had screened The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, which was excellent but depressing as the racists who killed the 18-year-old schoolboy escaped justice. The sequel told a more rewarding story of the fight by Stephen’s parents, Doreen (Sharlene Whyte) and Neville (Hugh Quarshie) to achieve some convictions, having the luck to find an antiracist cop in the London police force: DCI Clive Driscoll (Steve Coogan).2022 –DI RayView image in fullscreenSleuths on the loose … Parminder Nagra as DI Ray and Peter Bankole as DS Kwesi Edmund.Photograph: Justin Slee/ITVWith storylines and casting unimaginable when ITV began, this very 21st-century police procedural starred Parminder Nagra as senior detective Rachita Ray.2023 –Changing EndsView image in fullscreenSassy … Oliver Savell as Alan in Changing Ends.Photograph: Ollie Upton/ITVAlan Carr’s sassy autobiographical sitcom about the football-phobic, homophile son of the Northampton Town FC manager in the 1980s featured the comedian as onscreen narrator, which underlined the body-snatching uncanniness of Oliver Savell’s perfect performance as the young Alan.2024 –Mr Bates vs the Post OfficeView image in fullscreenThey said it couldn’t be done … Mr Bates vs the Post Office.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockWise voices said it was no longer possible, given competition from global streamers, for UK networks to get vast nightly audiences for a local British story. Wrong: about 10 million tuned in live to Gwyneth Hughes’s four-parter about the subpostmasters who variously took their own lives or went through imprisonment, bankruptcy or divorce after a dodgy Fujitsu computer system falsely implicated them in fraud. Aged 69, ITV could still kick like it used to.2025 –I Fought the LawView image in fullscreenThe perfect birthday gift? … Sheridan Smith as Ann Ming in I Fought the Law.Photograph: Anastasia Arsentyeva/ITVSheridan Smithalready had a distinguished ITV CV – 2012’sMrs Biggs, 2014’sCilla– but even her talent for total emotional and physical immersion in a real person’s life was surpassed as Ann Ming, who, after her daughter’s killer escaped justice on technicalities, successfully campaigned to remove the 800-year-old “double jeopardy” law so that he could be tried again. (This also proved vital in the Stephen Lawrence case.) A performance that should surely win Smith a second Bafta best actress trophy gives ITV a perfect 70th birthday present.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionITVI'm a Celebrity ...Russell T DaviesDavid TennantTV comedyMonty PythonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Only last week at a press conference in Chequers, Donald Trump not only claimed to haveno idea who Peter Mandelson was, he also insisted he had ended a major war between Azerbaijan and Albania.If that wasn’t enough, on his return to the US the president went on to declare he had prevented conflict between Armenia and Cambodia. In a saner world, someone might raise an eyebrow at this. But no longer. Instead, everyone just nods and smiles. This is just The Donald being The Donald. What a guy!Here in the UK we have our own altered states. For some time now, Reform has been holding a weekly Monday morning press conference. Even when no one has very much to say. Just an opportunity forNigel Farageto let rip on some of his favourite subjects. Principally, himself. Nige can’t go more than a few days without the excitement of a TV camera recording his life before part of him dies inside. If he is not front and centre of the news channel, he has no sense of purpose. Lost to himself and the outside world. It doesn’t matter what he says, the meaning is in the saying of it. This is just Nige being Nige. What a guy!This Monday, Nige was to be found in the Royal Horseguards hotel in Westminster. His theme? Legal migration. Shortly to be made not so legal. His five minutes started now. Nige strode towards the lectern – just as theReform UKpanel fell off the front. A good beginning.Nige looked mildly irritated. He was bored of talking about people crossing the Channel in small boats. Everyone had already got the message that they were evil. Nige now wanted to focus on all those who had come here legally and been granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR). Well, he had news for them. Everyone’s ILRwould be revoked. There were just too many foreigners and Nige had never seen one that he didn’t want to deport.The thing about most legal migrants was that they were just lazy. Spongers. Coming here because they just wanted an easy life. Contributing nothing. Soaking up welfare benefits. And if they were working, they were in low-paid jobs we could probably do without. Like nurses, hospital porters and care workers. They were all part of the Boris wave. The greatest betrayal of Brexit since Nige himself. Nige was never too bothered about contradicting himself.Next up was Zia Yusuf. The Reform point guy for delivery. The supposed brains of the Reform operation. Though these things are relative. Zia, too, had never come across an immigrant he didn’t want to deport. The era of cheap labour was over, he said. There would be some acute skills shortage visas for some hospital and care home staff, but in return the employers would have to train up Brits and increase their wages. By now, we were well into the realms of incoherent fantasy. A three-year-old could see that this was all just nonsense.But Nige and Zia were rushing on their run. They had cooked this up on the back of a cigarette packet and managed to convince themselves they were going to save the country from bankruptcy. Savings of £230bn. Only foreigners on high earnings and perfect English would be allowed to stay. And then only for five years. And they couldn’t bring any of their relatives over, either. KEEP BRITAIN FOR THE BRITISH. We were being robbed of our own culture.Then came the questions and here the atmosphere turned tetchy. Nige and Zia had been expecting to be greeted as the great messiahs. Saviours rising from the streets. And now even the normally Reform-friendly rightwing media started to turn against them. They did have their credibility to maintain, after all. And much of this didn’t just sound openly racist, it was economically illiterate. If this was the future then count us out. Hit squads of border guards rounding up millions of foreigners to deport them. Public services gutted and on their knees. The country run by hundreds of MPs with no experience of anything.The £230bn of savings that even the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), which originally dreamed up the figure, now disowned. Nige didn’t care. That kind of accuracy was for halfwits. Nige knew better because he was Nige. Who cared what the CPS thought? The figure was probably far higher than £230bn anyway. So in reality he was being on the safe side. Just don’t cross him. Don’t challenge his reality. It’s all too fragile and might shatter.And don’t get Nige started on pensioners. Lazy, lazy, lazy. Foreign pensioners would all have to go. Can’t have them sitting on their fat arses sucking up benefits. There would be nothing for them. Just a plane back to where they came from. They weren’t needed here. Keep British welfare payments British. Some people are more British than others.Was Nige sure everyone hated legal immigrants as much as he did? On the Tommy Robinson march, all the anger was directed at illegals. Nige leaned forwards. The country needed educating. People hadn’t been taught to hate foreigners well enough. Once they knew as much about legal foreigners with ILR as he did, they would be out on the street demanding their deportation. Criminals in waiting. Refusing to work. Hate. Hate again. Hate better. You know it makes sense.Zia tried to be the nice guy. Yes, he understood it was going to be difficult for some foreigners who believed they had a right to stay in Britain. That’s why he was giving everyone several years’ advance warning. There was an easy way and there was a hard way. They could either leave of their own volition or be handcuffed on to a transport plane.British citizens would be allowed to stay whatever. For now. But don’t count on it. Don’t say he’s not a caring man. As for legal challenges? No problem. Just change the law. And Nige would try to stop EU citizens with settled status from claiming benefits.Reform’s new recruitDanny Krugernodded along at the back. This was his kind of politics of division. Nige wound up. If everyone knew foreigners like he knew foreigners … give ’em an inch and they take a mile. Nige being Nige.

Oliver said that after the fallout, “it does seem like some are now willing to weaponise Kirk’s death to do things they’ve been wanting to do for years”.He spoke of the “shamelessly flimsy pretext” used to suspend him and that “everyone knew the administration had it in for Kimmel”.Despite mischaracterisation elsewhere, Oliver stressed that Kimmel’s comments “weren’t about Kirk” and “many struggled to pick the offensive line out of his monologue”.He added that “Kimmel didn’t denigrate Charlie Kirk or make light of his killing” but just spoke about how the right were desperate to weaponise “an argument that has aged pretty well given everything that’s happened to Kimmel since”.The comments “set off a firestorm” and enragedBrendan Carr, the FCC chair, andNexstar, one of the largest owners of TV stations which then triggered his suspension by ABC.Nexstar owns 201 stations but was also trying to buy a company called Tegna to expand its reach, a deal which needed approval from the FCC. Another large company, Sinclair, announced it would not air Kimmel’s show and even cited Carr’s remarks in a statement.Carr used the internet to brag about the news and when asked about it by a CNN reporter, he sent a meme from The Office in response. “Oh very cool just when I thought this factory setting white man couldn’t get any hotter,” Oliver joked.Carr also went on TV to suggest it was a spontaneous grassroots movement from local broadcasters, but Oliver reminded viewers that it was the result of sweeping decisions from two giant companies.He said the “sequence of events here could not be clearer” and last week even saw Trump make the connection: “Probably not something you should say out loud.”But whileTed Cruz, a Republican Texas senator, said he was “thrilled”, he also added that it was a worrying assault on free speech.Hundreds of Hollywood stars sign open letter condemning Kimmel suspensionRead moreOliver reminded viewers “Kimmel is by no means the first casualty in Trump’s attack on free speech” but “this Kimmel situation does feel like a turning point and not because comedians are important but because we are not”.He said the “first amendment is absolutely critical in this country” and there are “chilling precedents all over the world” with countries like Hungary and Russia showing what happens when dictators target comedians on TV.While the “easier path for them is to keep him off the air and keep the administration off their back”, he stressed that if this ends up in court, Disney would probably win against the administration.Oliver said that Disney needs to “stand by Kimmel and his staff” and those at home should exert pressure by cancelling Disney+ and Hulu.He said that Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, will be remembered as one of the “cowards who definitely knew better but still let things happen”.He added: “Giving the bully your lunch money doesn’t make him go away, it just makes him come back hungrier each time.”Explore more on these topicsJohn OliverJohn Oliver recapUS televisionTV comedyComedyJimmy KimmelTelevisionDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well, fashion trends are a stark rejoinder to thatMon 22 Sep 2025 12.26 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 19.30 EDTShareWake up babe, a new trend just dropped.According to the websiteKnow Your Meme, it’s been five years since the “wake up babe” format – which sees the phrase pasted over an image of a man waking up his girlfriend to announce a new internet talking point – really took off. I first encountered it at the height of what might be called “core fever” in fashion. A new look seemed to be arriving on social media feeds every week, driven by gen Z’s love of blink-or-miss-it microtrends. “Wake up babe, there’s a new aesthetic,” seemed an apt and amusing way to sum up the times.The idea of “core” in fashion dates back to 2014, whentrend-forecasting agency K-Holedescribed a bland and anonymous aesthetic they saw on the streets of New York as “normcore”. Now a descriptor that is applied to everything from fromgen Z’s cult style icon Adam Sandlerto characters in video games, the suffix has since been joined by what feels like thousands of things – from “corpcore” (meaning a corporate, businesslike look) and“clowncore”, to one of my favourites, the anything-goes “weirdcore”.These microtrends aren’t just dizzying – they are part of the acceleration of fast fashion, with brands producing cheap, throwaway items to appeal to a fleeting moment. In 2025, this cycle has slowed down somewhat, but fashion hasn’t kicked the habit entirely. Just look at the recent “medievalcore”, an online aesthetic that takes its cue from an era more than 600 years before the invention of the iPhone. This is a style that focuses on long skirts, corsets and pretty chainmail headbands; it has been spotted across festivals this summer.It’s already been given the celebrity seal of approval, with the likes ofChappell RoanandMillie Bobby Brownwearing chainmail on the red carpet. Therewas even a knightat Burberry’s February show, such a novelty thatAnna Wintour had her picture takenwith it. But even if brands such as Di Petsa, Conner Ivesand Christian Diorbrought it to the catwalk, the trend has mostly spread online. More than 20,000 videos on TikTokfeature the hashtag medievalcore, 22,000 posts on Instagram, andPinterest reporteda 110% rise in searches for medievalcore at the end of 2024.View image in fullscreenThe Burberry Knight during London Fashion Week in February 2025.Photograph: Justin Ng/AlamyIt’s not the first time contemporary culture has been seduced by this period. See the 1960s, when models such as Pattie Boyd wore minidresses with trumpet sleeves, the Beatles and the Stones wore velvet tunics and Paco Rabannemade dresses from chainmail. Or think of thePre-Raphaelites – painterswho depicted 19th-century working-class young women such asJane MorrisandElizabeth Siddalas medieval ladies, as a way of exploring sensuality, sex and passion in the rigid Victorian era.As with most “cores”, it’s easy to trace a line between the trends we gravitate towards and the world we live in. There is a sense that young people raised in a digital world might want to regress to a time that feels deeply un-modern – when animals could be put on trial, and women would pluck their eyelashes to draw attention to their forehead. Or there’s an argument that medievalcore, an aesthetic in opposition to being current, is a rail against the recent“clean girl”or “that girl” looks, which emphasise a rigidly understated – and typically thin, white and blond – take on femininity.But I think that medievalcore actually says more about this moment in fashion, which is less about trends and more about escapism; dressing up as characters and entering a different world. It’s a point of view that mirrors outside interests – such as the growth of gaming culture. Gamers are used to creating outfits for avatars – perhaps this dress-up mentality is spilling over into fashion. Look at the way Halloween has become so much more of an event in the UK in recent years.View image in fullscreenChappell Roan performs onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, 11 September 2024.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty ImagesA lot has been written about the decline of subcultures and how young people no longer form these real-world communities in their day-to-day lives. But fashion trends are a stark rejoinder to that – they exist offline as much as online. Much like 30 years ago, when wearing a band T-shirt signalled to people who liked the same band, this is a signal that the other person wearing a corset is in the same online bubble as you.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Accordingto a 2023 reportby the American Library Association, 54% of gen Z and millennials had visited a library in the preceding 12 months. Orcottagecore, which sees people fetishise the countryside by wearing milkmaid dresses and posting pictures of cabins, but could also have influenced young people togo outside more. It certainly coincides with hiking and even fishing becoming more popular.Medievalcore has a chance to join this elite tier because it has history and characters around it, from Joan of Arc to Eleanor of Aquitaine and Caterina Sforza, and the fact it focuses on a time that was really, really long ago. This allows those involved to create a world around a look, one that could provide community – and certainly brings the escapism that the more lasting “cores” have. Microtrends might not be the best for the environment, or for fashion in general, but they do have value, because for the very online they can provide a place to play.Lauren Cochrane is a senior Guardian fashion writerExplore more on these topicsFashionOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Yet the 33-year-old, a relative unknown 12 months ago, sailed through all challenges as he became the favorite to win the election in November.One thing still looms over Mamdani, however:New YorkCity’s billionaire class, and the not-unrelated real estate lobby.Mamdani has terrified some traditional big-money Democratic donors and powerful real-estate tycoons by promising to freeze rent prices and raise taxes – slightly – on the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers.Such promises prompted elites to spend millions during the Democratic primary, which didn’t work. Mamdani coasted pastAndrew Cuomo, the former New York governor – but the rich aren’t done yet.Some of New York’s wealthiest landlords and business people gathered with Cuomo this month to “plot his path to City Hall”, with the city’s biggest developer warning that they must unite to stop Mamdani, according tothe New York Times.Among the plotters were at least two billionaires and one of New York’s biggest building developers. Days after that meeting, Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager andsome-time activistwho has a net worth of nearly $10bn, also weighed in.Ackman, who has donated to Democrats, but supportedDonald Trumpin 2024, called for Eric Adams, the incumbent mayor who, like Cuomo, is running as an independent candidate, to drop out of the race to clear the path for the former governor.Earlier, Ackman had claimed, as have other wealthy New Yorkers, that Mamdani’s proposal to place an additional 2% tax on New Yorkers earning more than $1m would cause rich people to flee the city. He pledged to invest huge amounts in blocking Mamdani, who more than 570,000 people voted for (including ranked choice voters) in the Democratic primary.“There are hundreds of million[s] of dollars of capital available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight,” Ackmansaid in June– adding that he is “in the text strings and the WhatsApp groups”.It was Cuomo who attracted the big money during the primary. An analysis byIn These Timesfound that real estate donors spent $6m trying to get Cuomo elected. The New York Timesreportedthat $250,000 alone came from the head of a Boston-based construction company planning to expand into New York.Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor, spent $8.3m supporting Cuomo over the summer, and the money is continuing to pour in: less than two weeks ago Ron Lauder, a billionaire Republican donor,gave $750,000to a super Pac backing Cuomo, in August John B Hess, head of the Hess Corporation, gave his second $500,000 donation, the investigative outlet Sludgereported.“Since the primary they’ve been panicking and scrambling, trying to figure out how they can defeat Mamdani to keep their bottom line,” said Sumathy Kumar, managing director of the NYS Tenant Bloc, an affordable housing advocacy group.“They’ve been holding emergency meetings trying to cohere around Cuomo. In the primary they dropped millions of dollars into the Cuomo-aligned super Pac – they’ve been trying everything they can, throwing money, and it doesn’t seem to be working.”That much is clear, given Mamdani continues to hold a commanding lead over Cuomo. This week,a Marist pollfound him winning 45% of the vote; Cuomo had 24%, the Republican Curtis Sliwa, 17% and the embattled Adams was at just 9%.It’s polling that reflects the urgency Cuomo-backers are feeling. In recent weeks, there have been repeated calls for Sliwa and Adams to drop out of the race to consolidate anti-Mamdani donors and voters, with Trump also reportedly weighing in – there have even beenreportsthe president’s advisers had discussed offering a job to Adams if he steps down.Even if that happens, however, there’s little hard evidence that Cuomo would win. The Marist poll asked New Yorkers how they would vote in a hypothetical match-up between just Mamdani and Cuomo: in that scenario 49% went for Mamdani compared with 39% for his opponent, suggesting the billionaire class’s efforts may be in vain.“It’s just not working,” Kumar said. “They’ve spent millions of dollars warning New Yorkers against a Zohran Mamdani win, and it didn’t work, because tenants want a rent freeze, they want to be able to stay in New York City.”With early voting in the election starting in just over a month – election day is Tuesday, 4 November – the richest New Yorkers may be finding out the hard way that money can’t buy you everything.“Many power brokers and billionaires are frustrated, and scared, because their demands are not the center piece of Zohran’s agenda and they find themselves outside of ‘the room where it happens’,” said Ana María Archila, co-state director for New York Working Families party, a progressive political party which backs Democratic candidates who align with its platform.“Zohran has tapped into a broadly shared sentiment that something has to change, and now. He is proposing concrete solutions and that is why so many people are enthusiastically supporting his campaign.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkAndrew CuomoThe super-richUS politicsEric AdamsDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now, for his biggest European show, the artist talks us through his disturbing new worksMon 22 Sep 2025 11.06 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 14.53 EDTShareHistory weighs on Kerry James Marshall, though not all that heavily. When he talks about the hefty subjects of his art – from slavery to civil rights – he does so with a disarming, disquieting lightness. Maybe that’s because at almost 70 years old, and at the peak of his popularity, he’s seen it all.Marshall grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, just a few blocks away from where the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, a white supremacist attack that killed four young black girls, took place in 1963. When his family moved to Los Angeles, they ended up right in the middle of the 1965 Watts riots, a six-day uprising fuelled by growing racial tension in the poorest part of the city.I set my own goals. They don’t tell me what I’m supposed to like and not likeAll of this has undoubtedly fed into his journey to becoming arguably the US’s greatest living painter. Today, seated in the galleries of the Royal Academy in London, where his jaw-dropping, large-scale, colourful paintings are going on display for a major show, he reels off a list of traumatic, shocking events from his youth. Beatings, murders, injuries, robberies, “and that’s not even half of it,” he says with a smile, chuckling.“I came this way against the odds, given the time that I entered art school and the way people told you that you’re not supposed to do this kind of stuff,” he says. “That had no effect on my ambition, because I set my own goals. They don’t tell me what I’m supposed to like and what I’m not supposed to like. I don’t accept that.”View image in fullscreenPicnic time … Untitled (Blanket Couple), 2014.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and David Zwirner, London/© Kerry James MarshallFrom the start, Marshall’s vision has been knowingly defiant. The cultural environment he emerged into after graduating from art school in the late 1970s was one heading full bore into conceptualism, and still trying to deal with the afterglow of abstraction, pop and postmodernism. He ignored all of that, and chose instead a notably classical take on figuration. Yet what he did was startlingly modern: he used the language of classicism to elevate ordinary, everyday and – crucially – black subject matter to the level of Titian, David or Velázquez.Think of the giant paintings that line the walls of the world’s great art museums:Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People,Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa,Rubens’ Massacre of the Innocents. Big, important paintings on big, important themes. And then look at Marshall’s 1993 masterpieceDe Style. It’s on the same enormous scale, and given the same prominence and heft, but this isn’t a scene from the Bible, or a pivotal moment in history. It’s a barbershop. It’s someone getting their hair cut while a couple of customers wait their turn. It’s a snapshot of everyday black life, heightened and celebrated.Marshall’s work sets out to prove that scenes of black life “can be as grand and spectacular” as anything from the history of art. “The significance in part was that you couldn’t walk by that thing and say you didn’t see it. You couldn’t pretend you didn’t notice it. It was there, and it was there in a big way.”De Style became his first painting to be bought by a museum when it was purchased by the Los Angeles County Museum ofArt. It’s astonishing, saturated with ultra-intense colour, bright reds, vivid yellows and deep, mesmerising blacks. It’s clever and assured, joyful and celebratory. And it cemented Marshall’s place at the forefront of American painting.Yet he seems wary of embracing the outwardly political nature of his painting. “I’m not making pictures because I want to be a ‘political artist’,” he says. “I’m making pictures because I like what pictures do. I like seeing them. I like making them.”His priority, he says, is people, especially the ones that inhabit his canvases. “There’s nothing more interesting than other human beings,” he says. “There’s no set of patterns, no combinations of colours, no textures. Human beings are more interesting to other human beings than anything else you can find and encounter on the planet. And making pictures of human beings still remains as fascinating an enterprise as anything you could do.”View image in fullscreenComplex reality … Abduction of Olaudah and His Sister, 2023.Photograph: © Kerry James Marshall. Image courtesy David Zwirner, London. Photo: Kerry McFateThat attitude feels a little hard to square with the subject matter as you walk through the Royal Academy show, his biggest ever in Europe. Early works deal with the absence of black figures from art history; other paintings look at the civil rights and black power movements. A central gallery is dedicated to images of theMiddle Passage, the journey that took enslaved Africans across the Atlantic to the US. These are heavy, powerful topics, and painting them in his grand, colourful, precise style feels like a political move.“I’m not interested in how people interpret the work, because I’m not providing people with an open-ended canvas in which they can say anything they want to say,” says Marshall. “I’m very particular about the things I want them to know about the particular image I’m making. These are very straightforward. These aren’t difficult things to interpret. Being obscure is not an objective that makes much sense to me.”Kerry James Marshall review – astonishing visions of black America, from bar-room boozers to families in spaceRead moreAnd there’s the point. You don’t really need to talk about political motive or narrative intention when you see a work likehis portrait of rebel slave Nat Turnerbrandishing a bloodied axe, his master’s severed head left rolling on the bed in the background. It is, indeed, very straightforward.Which makes his new series, painted just in time for this show, all the more unsettling. The works see Marshall tackle the “sensitive” and “polemical” (the Royal Academy’s words) history of black involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. The opening work depicts two African children being abducted from their homes by black figures, ready to be shipped across the ocean. It’s a bright, vibrant, verdant but deeply shocking painting, based on the story ofOlaudah Equiano, an 18th-century writer who was abducted from Nigeria as a child before buying his freedom and settling in London.“Olaudah had been passed on through a network of people,” says Marshall. “He got exchanged over four or five times. He didn’t see a white man until he got on the boat. That’s the slave trade too. It’s not just the boats. It’s not just the trip across the Atlantic. It’s everyday people who wanted some value from whatever was transpiring during the slave trade, people who participated as freelancers to get what they could. They didn’t care any more about abducting children than anybody else.”So why does he think people choose to ignore these sorts of stories?“Because they don’t fit the narrative of white people evil, black people good. It doesn’t fit.”The reality is more complex?“It’s always more complex than that. Always.”So what, I wonder, does painting it achieve?“It makes it available,” he says. “Pictures can be a catalyst for investigating or taking a look at areas of history that people tend to not find their way to.”This is what I always wanted – to be counted among the artists I admiredOn a basic level, these works are Marshall fighting for nuance in a society that he sees growing more divided by the day, pushing viewers to take responsibility and own their circumstances. “Human beings are much more complicated than any of us would like to recognise,” he says. “It’s easier to create boogeymen and scapegoats. And it’s also easy not to take responsibility for being a part of any of that. It’s always somebody else. I think this is critical: in all of the works I do, black people have agency.”It’s agency that got him where he is today. Before we part, I ask him if being here at the Royal Academy makes him feel as if he’s “made it” as an artist, like he’s written himself properly into the art history he has loved for so long. “This is what I always wanted,” he says. “I always wanted to be counted among the artists that I admired.”And like he said, he’s here against the odds, against centuries of societal repression, millennia of conflict. “Violence is at the root” of humanity, he says. “The opportunities to be killed are many and various, and we’re lucky to get to be as old as we get to be sometimes. We’re lucky to be alive.” He laughs his warm laugh. “We’re lucky to be alive.”Kerry James Marshall: The Histories is at theRoyal Academy, London, until 18 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designRoyal Academy of ArtsPaintingArtExhibitionsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Government sources said 770,000 universal credit claimants who are EU citizens would be exempt from the change.Estimates from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford put the total population of non-EU citizens with ILR at 430,000 at the end of 2024.Pressed on the impact of his announcement on sectors that rely on foreign labour, including the NHS and social care, Farage said he would open a strictly capped visa route for jobs where there was a skills shortage, while requiring employers to train local staff.Nicola Ranger, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Threatening to sack thousands of migrant nursing staff is abhorrent beyond words. These are people who have come to the UK to care for patients and become part of our communities. They deserve so much better than this.“The policy of retrospectively removing people’s rights in this way would be unprecedented, leaving migrant nursing staff unable to work or access welfare, despite having paid tax. It shows neither compassion nor an understanding of the fundamental role our brilliant migrant nursing staff play in health and care. Without them, services would simply cease to function.”Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said the plans “have no basis in reality”, while Anna Turley, the Labour party chair, said they were “falling apart in real time” and that Farage was “unable to say how many families his policy would break up”.Turley said: “Reform have been forced to admit that their policy does not apply to people from the EU – destroying Farage’s claims that it covers all foreign-born nationals. Farage is unable to say how many families his policy would break up, what the cost to businesses would be, what would happen to pensioners and how long it would take to implement.”Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “Threatening to deport people living and working here legally is unacceptable.” The Scottish National party’s deputy Westminster leader, Pete Wishart, said the proposals were “desperate and despicable”.Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the move could lead to another Windrush scandal. “Nigel Farage has not clearly thought this through. He has not worked out the impact on red tape or on taxes. He has not realised that lots of these people have made their lives here, contributing to businesses, to the health service,” he told GB News.Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said the policy was “half-baked and unworkable” and that Reform “lift our policies but strip away the detail that makes them enforceable”.Sunder Katwala, the director of the thinktank British Future, said: “Threatening to revoke the settled status of millions who already have indefinite leave is morally wrong, beyond the legal and practical chaos it would cause – it undermines the very idea of belonging in this country.“Debating future settlement rules for new arrivals is a legitimate public policy debate. Most of the public agree it is fair that people living here can apply to settle permanently after five years. The uncertainty this proposal creates for people who have already built their lives here – Hongkongers, EU citizens who came before Brexit and others – is unfair and must be resolved with urgency.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s only the beginning.”Meanwhile, Arab and Muslim leaders are set to meetDonald Trumpin New York to discuss their separate plan for a stabilisation force in Gaza as France joined the UK, Canada and Australia in recognising Palestine as a state.The recognition of Palestine by France and five other states played out in dramatic fashion later on the floor of the UN general assembly as France and Saudi Arabia co-chaired a summit to discuss the future of a two-state solution, a road map to peace that Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a dead-end.On Monday night Monaco, Belgium, Andorra, Malta and Luxembourg all recognised Palestine, bringing the total number of recognitions to three-quarters of UN membership.António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said in a speech that statehood was a “right, not a reward” for Palestinians.“Nothing can justify the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas or the taking of hostages,” he said. “And nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, derided the session as an “embarrassing political circus” and the US has warned its allies that the recognition of Palestine could lead to a “reciprocal” Israeli reaction, setting the scene for a major diplomatic crisis as world leaders meet in New York for the 80th anniversary of the UN.Israel has warned that it might respond to the recognition of Palestine by annexing the West Bank, citing claims from Hamas that recognition by allies of Israel was a victory for the terror group.“Nothing can also excuse developments in the West Bank that pose an existential threat to a two-state solution,” said Guterres. “The relentless expansion of settlements, the creeping threat of annexation, the intensification of settle violence – all of it must stop.”France has said the plan for a stabilisation force would marginalise Hamas by disarming the group and excluding it from power.The proposal includes a UN-mandated force to provide security inGazaas well as oversee the disarmament of Hamas and help train a PA police force.graphicThe diplomatic scramble played out in New York as Israel intensified its assault on Gaza City on Monday, with reports of 37 Palestinians killed across the territory, including 30 in Gaza City. Israel launched an offensive in the city last week against what it said were 3,000 Hamas fighters hiding in the city, ignoring international humanitarian concerns.The Arab League declared in July that Hamas must play no further role in governance, with power handed to a newly elected PA to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Hamas would be required to hand over its weapons to the authority.The Trump meeting, scheduled after his address to the UN’s general assembly, is the most direct engagement between the White House and Arab states on post-ceasefire plans for Gaza since he was elected president for a second time.Trump is expected to deliver an aggressive speech decrying “globalist institutions” on Tuesday, which he will claim have “have significantly decayed the world order”, a White House spokesperson said in a briefing.West Bank mapThe US president is also expected to meet leaders from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Nothing the president has done so far suggests that he shares the view held by the Gulf states that the PA is a viable alternative to Hamas, or should be considered a partner for peace. He has imposed sanctions on PA officials and banned Mahmoud Abbas, its 89-year-old leader, from coming to New York to speak to the UN. Abbas, addressing the summit virtually, commended the 149 nations that had already recognised a Palestinian state, and called on Hamas to surrender its weapons to the PA, adding: “We also condemn the killing and detention of civilians, including Hamas actions on October 7 2023.”Arab leaders see the meeting as a chance to pin down Trump on whether he supports the Arab League’s proposals for Gaza’s future, or even a variation put to him by a working group led by Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, and Jared Kushner, who is the president’s son-in-law. Neither of the reconstruction plans proposes the mass expulsion of Palestinians, a proposal that Trump at times has appeared to support. The Blair plan does not clearly endorse the PA as the long-term administrators for Gaza.The Arab states are likely to insist they will not join any international force unless the reformed PA is given a future role. They also want a roadmap to a two-state future that excludes further Israeli settlements or annexation of the West Bank.The UK on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state provisionally based on the 1949 armistice border, or “Green Line”, between Israel, the West Bank and Gaza before their 1967 capture.The PA, which exercises limited civic rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was forced out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, has said it was ready to govern Gaza and the West Bank with international support.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has insisted that Israel must retain overall security control alongside an Arab-led civilian administration. However, others in his rightwing coalition want to annex Gaza. Israel has driven the PA close to bankruptcy by withholding monthly revenue transfers.Lana Nusseibeh, a minister at the UAE foreign affairs ministry, said annexation would be a red line for the UAE since “it would strike at the heart of what the Abraham accords are trying to achieve”. The UAE signed the accords – deals brokered by Trump to normalise relations between Israel and the Arab states – in 2020 in return for Israel not annexing the West Bank.UAE leaders, bidding to present themselves as the startup nation of the future, did not suggest they would leave the accords but instead said plans for greater regional integration would become a dead letter.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, urged Israel not to respond to the new recognitions by annexing parts of the West Bank, saying “settler expansion threatens the very viability of a Palestinian state”.Cooper condemned violence on both sides, citing “continued bloodshed, manmade famine, terrorism and hostage-taking, settlement expansion and settler violence” and warned that “the two-state solution risks disappearing beneath the rubble – that is what extremists on both sides want”.She echoed others in saying Hamas could have no future in the governance of Palestine.France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said the recognition of a Palestinian state was a disavowal of Hamas since the plan called for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza. He pointed out that the general assembly had already endorsed a seven-page declaration this month outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution, while also condemning Hamas and calling for it to surrender and disarm.The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said: “Any and all steps toward an illegal annexation of occupied territory also undermine the chances of resolving the conflict in a sustainable way. However distant it may seem at this moment, a negotiated two-state solution is the path that can enable both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security and dignity. Germany regards recognition of a Palestinian state as a step more at the end of the process. However, such a process must now begin.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after tensions were laid bare last week when Sultana launched a membership portal without the party’s authorisation.Insiders said the pair had always got along and they managed to have a meeting in the corridors of parliament last week before the row. They said Corbyn would be able to move past it eventually but highlighted how damaging the public arguments were to internal relations, having left some incredibly distressed.Others closer to Sultana are believed to remain optimistic at the chance of a complete de-escalation over time.At least 20,000 supporters paid £55 for a full membership via the portal Sultana launched, which Corbyn and all of the other Independent Alliance MPs – Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed – condemned as a “false membership system”, warning their supporters to ignore the email and cancel any payments they had made.Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, defended her actions, hitting out with claims that she had been frozen out by a “sexist boys’ club” inside the party. Her allies said a “paranoid anti-democratic faction” inside the project had worked to exclude her from decision-making and was developing a rival membership system that would divert money to its own company giving it “complete control”, in anextraordinary attackon Corbyn’s longtime ally Karie Murphy’s involvement in the process.Corbyn rejected her accusations, saying Sultana had not been excluded from any discussions and remained part of a process “rooted in inclusivity and mutual respect”, in a joint statement co-signed by all of the Independent Alliance.While tensions undoubtedly remain about the process of establishing democratic principles surrounding Your Party itself and its founding conference, there is a clear desire from all sides to try to progress the process of launching the political entity.Sultana’s allies insist she is doing everything she can to build bridges with Corbyn and is clear that the founding conference must go ahead on the planned timeline.After she called off her plans to instruct “specialist defamation lawyers” to investigate a “number of false and defamatory statements” made about her concerning the launch of the initial portal, her allies had hoped there would be a possibility of showing a united front despite the low probability.The row has inevitably widened tensions among all MPs involved, with the four Independent Alliance MPs understood to be incredibly upset about Sultana’s string of posts.Sources close to them have said the characterisation of the environment being a “sexist boys club” had led to a spike in racist and Islamophobic abuse directed at them online, with one MP noting his daughter had been targeted too.All involved insist the conference will determine the party’s constitution, leadership and policy by one-member-one-vote, with MPs overseeing the transition rather than dictating outcomes.They believe this second more low-profile, low-stakes membership launch will help the movement move on from the party’s chaotic start.Explore more on these topicsZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

Coronavirus restrictions meant she had no face-to-face appointments.It was only after attending a private consultation that Brady, from Stevenage in Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. She died three weeks later in hospital while on oxygen.According to Jess’s rule, GPs will have to reconsider a patient’s case if their symptoms have escalated or they are unable to offer a credible diagnosis. The rule was developed by NHS England and the Royal College of General Practitioners.“Jessica Brady’s death was a preventable and unnecessary tragedy,” said Wes Streeting, the health secretary. “I want to thank her courageous family, who have campaigned tirelessly through unimaginable grief to ensure Jessica’s legacy helps to save the lives of others.“Patient safety must be the bedrock of the NHS and Jess’s rule will make sure every patient receives the thorough, compassionate and safe care that they deserve, while supporting our hardworking GPs to catch potentially deadly illnesses.“I don’t want any family to endure the pain Jessica’s family have been through. This government will learn from such tragedies and is taking decisive action to improve patient safety.”Jess’s rule began as a petition, started by her mother, Andrea, who also called for measures such as funding to allow GPs to refer all patients to specialists and for more face-to-face consultations.Change.org, the website that hosted the petition, said its almost 500,000 signatures made it the biggest healthcare petition on the platform since the pandemic.Andrea Brady said: “Jess lived for just three short weeks following her terminal cancer diagnosis. Despite her shock and devastation, she showed unfailing courage, positivity, dignity, and love. Jess was determined that people should understand how desperately she had tried to advocate for herself and seek a resolution for her declining health.“In the bleak weeks following the loss of Jess, I realised it was my duty to continue what she had started. It has taken nearly five years to bring about Jess’s rule. I would like to dedicate this initiative to all the young people who have been diagnosed too late.”Jess’s rule also aims to address concerns that younger patients and those from minority ethnic backgrounds often face delays in diagnosis of serious conditions.Research by the Nuffield Trust and theHealthFoundation thinktanks found that half of 16- to 24-year-olds required three or more interactions with a healthcare professional from a GP practice before being diagnosed with cancer. That compared with one in five across the whole population.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “No GP will ever want to miss signs of serious illness, such as cancer. Ensuring a timely diagnosis often means better outcomes for patients – but many conditions, including many cancers, are challenging to identify in primary care because the symptoms are often similar to other, less serious and more common conditions.“If a patient repeatedly presents with the same or similar symptoms, but the treatment plan does not seem to be making them better – or their condition is deteriorating – it is best practice to review the diagnosis and consider alternative approaches. We hope that by formalising this with Jess’s rule, it will remind GPs to keep this at the forefront of their minds.”Explore more on these topicsGPsHealthCancerHealth policyDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

More than a quarter (28%) of the 2,640 respondents said they had avoided places where they used to socialise and one in 10 (12%) changed where they exercise.Girls with disabilities felt particularly unsafe travelling, with only 17% saying they felt secure on public transport, compared with 33% of non-disabled girls.The survey also explored misogyny in schools. More than half of girls aged 11 to 18 (58%) said they had experienced male pupils making toxic comments while 32% reported seeing a teacher or member of staff subjected to sexist or misogynistic abuse.One in 10 girls aged 11 to 16 said they do not feel safe at school, a figure that rises to more than two in 10 for LGBTQ+ girls and three in 10 for disabled girls. One in 10 also said they had intentionally missed school to lower the risk of sexual harassment – a figure that doubles for girls with disabilities (21%) and rises to 18% for neurodivergent and LGBTQ+ girls.Among the younger pupils, a third of girls aged seven to 10 (32%) said they had experienced a comment from boys at school that made them feel uncomfortable while, 17% said boys at school regularly comment on the bodies of girls and young women.Girlguiding called on local authorities and schools to publish plans to tackle misogyny in their communities and for politicians in charge of public transport to engage with girls on their fears and make services safer.Amanda Azeez, the acting chief executive of Girlguiding, said: “Although a lot of progress has been made in creating an equal world, reading these stark findings makes us realise that in some areas, like the treatment and behaviour that girls’ face, things sadly haven’t changed at all.“Girls are not being treated equally and are consistently made to feel like they’re not enough. This is not only affecting their mental health but stopping them from being themselves.“To ensure girls’ safety and to tackle this issue, action needs to happen now, starting with listening to and involving girls and young women in how to address this.

There’s no downside.”He also spoke about upcoming recommendations that vaccines such as the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) shots should be given in a delayed manner or in smaller doses, despite limited evidence of the impacts. And he spoke about the hepatitis B shot, currently given to newborns as part of national vaccine standards, and possible recommendations to delay the first dose – again with limited evidence.Kennedy followed, announcing that the health department and US Food and Drug Administration would work to change the label on acetaminophen risks.Administration officials also unveiled a plan to further investigate how a possible treatment for autism might exists in the shape ofleucovorin, a drug currently used for patients with cancer and anemia.Trump, who has frequently voiced his concern over autism, said, along with Kennedy, that the US is suffering from an “epidemic”, and had flagged the major initiative on Sunday atCharlie Kirk’s memorialin Arizona.“Tomorrow we’re going to have one of the biggest announcement[s] … medically, I think, in the history of our country,” he said. “I think you’re going to find it to be amazing. I think we found an answer to autism.”One in 31 children aged eight had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) – a condition denoting communication and social difficulties, along with repetitive behaviors – in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That compares to about one in 150 in 2000.Kennedy, who previously peddled the theory that the condition is caused by vaccinations, has attributed the rise to “environmental toxins”.He told Monday’s event that the National Institutes of Health had been guilty of focusing “almost solely on political safe and entirely fruitless research” about autism’s causes. He said was committed to investigating the “ideology of the autism outbreak”.He called autism “a complex condition with a multi-factual ideology”.“One area we are currently examining is vaccines,” said Kennedy, who has frequently floated theories that the increase in the condition’s prevalence is fueled by vaccinations.However, specialists say the increase is mainly due to increased screening, combined with evolving definitions of the disorder. They have also said the causes are predominantly dictated by genetics.Scientists in the US and UK reacted to the Tylenol link sceptically, with British physicians denouncing it as “fearmongering” that risked stigmatising parents of children with autism.Alison Singer, president and founder of theAutismScience Foundation, voiced scathing criticism of the administration’s approach – specifically its assertions on Tylenol, which she called “not scientifically based”.“Any association between Tylenol and autism is based on very limited, conflicting and inconsistent science, and it’s premature to make this kind of unsubstantiated claim and risk undermining public health,” she said.“It’s misleading to families who deserve clear more factually based information.”She also questioned the basis of the White House announcement. “We’re uncertain as to why this press conference is being held today. To our knowledge, there was no new data that were uncovered, no new studies published, no new presentations were made. There wasn’t a scientific conference or a medical conference,” Singer said.Speaking on a call organized by Defend America Action, a campaign group, Debra Houry, a former chief medical officer and deputy director at the CDC, told journalists: “As of three weeks ago, we hadn’t seen evidence that acetaminophen was linked with autism, so it’s curious to know how quickly that was developed.”“There are many studies which refute a link, but the most important was a Swedish study of 2.4m births published in 2024 which used actual sibling data and found no relationship between exposure to paracetamol [known in the US as acetaminophen] in utero and subsequent autism, ADHD or intellectual disability,” said Dr Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University“The fearmongering will prevent women from accessing the appropriate care during pregnancy.US medical practitioners also cast doubt on the putative link with acetaminophen.Dan Jernigan, another former CDC career scientist and former director of the national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases, criticised Kennedy’s efforts.“We were all asked to be a part of autism studies and to put together [an autism plan],” he said. We helped develop some of that. But then over time, what we saw was [Kennedy] having an increasingly top down approach, essentially ‘my way or the highway,’ with no regard again for the scientific processes.”Some researchers have also pleaded caution on hopes for leucovorin, which has been reportedly shown in some tests to trigger marked improvements in the speaking and understanding ability of some people with autism.Irva Hertz-Picciotto, an epidemiologist and autism specialist at the University of California, Davis, told the Washington Post that unrealistic expectations could lead to a loss of trust.“I worry that it feels like everything is now tainted that comes out of the current administration,” she said.Bruce Mirken, communications co-chair of Defend Public Health, poured cold water on the announcements in advance. “While we don’t know what he will claim today, we do know that Kennedy has a history of false statements related to autism and that the scientific evidence shows there is no ‘autism epidemic’,” he said.Additional reporting by Melody Schreiber and agenciesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationAutismUS healthcareUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She based her findings on an analysis of 50 previous studies from 24 countries, including the UK, China, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Kuwait and Barbados.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, which represents family doctors in the UK, said: “That incidences of abuse against GPs and our teams are so widespread – and as this research shows, not just in the UK – is extremely distressing. It’s entirely unacceptable for anyone working in general practice to be at the receiving end of abuse of any kind, when they’re just trying to do their jobs.”Some assaults are so distressing that GPs call the police or remove perpetrators from their practice list, she added.Pulse, a website for GPs, has reported on a doctor being attacked by a man wielding a baseball bat and a man carrying knives threatening surgery staff.The long waits patients can face to see a GP or receive other healthcare is the most common reason some become violent or abusive, according to the research, which has been published in the British Journal of General Practice. Between 31% and 73% of GP personnel questioned in previous studies identified that as the trigger for aggression.“Unmet patient demands” – such as GPs declining to prescribe requested medicines or sick people being frustrated at the quality of their treatment – were the second commonest reason.The research paper said “some studies took a view that actions of staff may have contributed to the violence experienced by suggesting possible causes such as inadequate staff training on professionalism, interpersonal skills, conflict management or staff attitudes”. Female, younger and less experienced staff, including receptionists, bear the brunt of the aggression, it found.Dr Julius Parker, a deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GPs committee, said: “General practice in the UK and across the world is the front door to healthcare – and GPs are on the frontline when faced with people in pain and who are anxious and in distress, often frustrated with wider systems.“But no amount of frustration excuses violence against GPs here or abroad, as described in this research.”Research last year by MDDUS, a medical defence organisation, found that 84% of GPs who took part in a survey had been verbally abused and 24% physically abused during the previous year. In one incident, a patient with Covid coughed over a receptionist when he did not get a prescription he wanted.Pulse has alsoreportedhow Dr Osama Farooq, a GP in Fife in Scotland, suffered cuts and bruises when he was assaulted and racially abused outside a shop after finishing a 12-hour shift at his surgery. He left the practice because he no longer felt safe in the town.Explore more on these topicsHealthDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The researchers found that a property situated 500 metres from a station commanded an 8% premium – amounting to about £42,700 based on average prices in London – over an identical or very similar property 1,500 metres from a station.This was broadly in line with just before the pandemic, when this premium was 8.6%.There was a £10,900, or 4.9%, house price premium inGreater Manchester, and an £8,800 premium (4.6%) in Glasgow, on a comparable basis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Research into links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism havenot proved a causal relationship, while medical experts widely agree that growing diagnoses of autism cannot be traced back to a singular cause.Acetaminophen can be used to alleviate fever and pain during pregnancy. Leaving those conditions untreated can carry “significant maternal and infant health risks”, according to a statement from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Untreated fevers, for example, can lead to miscarriage, birth defects and premature births.Trump’s announcement was a triumph for health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has a track record ofmaking unproven claims about autismand autistic people. Yet it was also the latest move in another emerging campaign within the Trump administration: one that seeks to valorize “natural” pregnancy and motherhood – that is, pregnancy and motherhood without proven medical interventions – to the point where it can corrode women’s health and safety.Over the past several months, theTrump administrationhas taken steps to undermine pregnant women’s access to Covid vaccines and antidepressants. These steps have been in defiance of widespread agreement among medical experts that the benefits of these therapeutics tend to outweigh the risks. In May, Kennedy, who has long questioned the safety of vaccines, said that he “couldn’t be more pleased to announce” that the CDC would no longer recommend that healthy pregnant women get vaccinated against Covid.Then, over the summer, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hosted a panel about antidepressant use during pregnancy. Predominantly staffed with people who have a history of antidepressant skepticism or who have beenconsultants in litigation over antidepressants, the panel heavily emphasized the risks of taking antidepressants during pregnancy. One of the panelists, a psychologist named Roger McFillin, said that depression “has devolved into an umbrella term” and “doesn’t even have meaning any more”.“Are women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely?” he asked. “Those are gifts. They’re not symptoms of a disease.”They very well may be symptoms of a disease. Mental health conditions contribute to almost a third of all pregnancy-related deaths in the US, according to a2025 reportfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of deaths involving mental health struggles, roughly a third were suicides.Covid, too, endangers women’s lives – and those of their babies. A2021 study of 2,100 pregnant women around the worldfound that women who contracted Covid during pregnancy were 20 times more likely to die compared to those that did not catch the virus. More than 11% of women who contracted Covid also had their babies test positive for Covid.While the Trump administration casts doubt on whether women should use life-saving remedies to protect themselves against Covid and depression, Republicans have in recent months moved to embrace at least one kind of intervention: “restorative reproductive medicine” (RRM), a constellation of therapies that purport to “restore” individuals’ “natural” fertility without resorting to in vitro fertilization (IVF).Advocates of RRM say they are working to present women with more options, but pre-eminent medical groups such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine say that there is little evidence that RRM techniques work – and that it is effectively “a pseudonym for a basic infertility evaluation”, asone reproductive endocrinologist told the Guardian this summer.These moves – the attacks on pregnant women’s access to Tylenol, to Covid vaccines, to antidepressants; the insistence that women should get pregnant without IVF – all adhere to a basic fallacy known as “the appeal to nature”, or the idea that something that comes from the earth is better than anything human-made.This idea powers much of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, of which Kennedy is effectively the czar. It is also patently false.There are reasons why you are not supposed to drink unpasteurized, or “raw”, milk. (They’re calledcampylobacter, cryptosporidium, E coli, listeria, brucella, and salmonella.) And there are reasons why a small cut or a stubbed toe is no longer a death sentence. (They’re called antibiotics.)When combined with pregnancy, the illogic of the appeal to nature is stretched even further, folding in on itself likeLaffy Taffy. Not only should pregnancy – and the women who do it – be handled as “naturally” as possible, but pregnancy and motherhood are themselves women’s natural states.Authoritarian governments throughout historyhave sought to convince their people that this is true, in order to subjugate women and to ensure that women are reliable sources of reproduction.That’s why the Trump administration’s drive to diminish pregnant women’s access to Tylenol can’t be divorced from, say, its pronatalist interest in encouraging women to have more babies through$5,000 “baby bonuses”.Ultimately, all this may lead to fewer options and more pain for women – including those who find parenthood fulfilling, those who are uninterested in it, and those who are everywhere in between. In fact, without Tylenol, that pain may become quite literal.“All this pressure to become a mother and be a mother is emerging politically, but you’re not supposed to need any help or support,” the journalist Amy Larocca, author of the book How to Be Well: Navigating Our Self-Care Epidemic, One Dubious Cure at a Time, said in an interview earlier this year. “You’re supposed to be able to manage it all on your own and [have] no maternity leave, no medical care, no support.”She added: “There’s a lot of shaming of women who need help and support.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHealthUS healthcareDonald TrumpUS politicsWomenRobert F Kennedy JranalysisShareReuse this content"

Over a century late it might be argued.The formalities had been due to kick off at 11am outside what had been known as the Palestinian Mission to the UK but there was a problem: too many VIPs.There were MPs by the dozen, about 60 ambassadors, and a smattering of moderately famous faces. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and John Swinney, the first minister of Scotland, were among those present.All took their places in a pen in front of the three-storey postwar building in Hammersmith, west London, sealed off by metal barriers from a large contingent of TV cameras and microphones as well as a couple of hundred members of the public waving flags.The Palestinian cause has not always attracted such support and the swell of enthusiasm was causing a few logistical difficulties.Could we move back to allow the speakers out, an official asked, “just a few steps”. It didn’t prompt a lot of rejigging.The Labour MPs Liam Byrne and Rushanara Ali, who recently resigned as a homelessness minister over her treatment of her tenants, were pretty rooted to their prime spots by the flagpole.Passionate as they no doubt are about Palestinian rights, it would do no harm for the world, and the large Muslim population in their constituencies, to bear witness to their support of this historic decision by a Labour government.The Palestinian ambassador, Husam Zomlot, with a beaming smile and a wave, was able to walk down a ramp from the mission to open events at 11.15am.The Arabic song Mawtini (My Homeland), the unofficial national anthem for Palestine from the 1930s until the early 1970s, had been playing in the background but now the ambassador began his address, flanked by Swinney and Hamish Falconer, the minister of state for theMiddle East and north Africa.“Good morning,” he said to a whoop from the crowd. “Good, beautiful morning. We are gathered today in front of the Palestinian mission to the UK, here in London to mark a historic moment.“In the same capital of the Balfour declaration, after more than a century of ongoing denial, dispossession and erasure, the UK government has finally taken the long overdue step of recognising the state of Palestine.”Holding up a plaque, Zomlot said, to cheers from the crowd: “Very soon, pending some legal work, some bureaucratic work with the minister of the government … this plaque, which reads: ‘The embassy of the state of Palestine’ … will be placed right behind me on this building.”It was the turn of Falconer. Just 39 years old and put into a ministerial position immediately on being elected last summer, he is widely regarded in parliament as both smart and personable but he looked nervous. Falconer swallowed a couple of his opening words. This was not an easy crowd.“This is not only an endorsement of the vision of two states,” Falconer said. “It is a rejection of extremist ideas on both sides, fantasies of the destruction of the state of Israel or the expulsion of the Palestinian people …“The concept of two states living side by side is at risk of being destroyed by appalling violence and hunger by the relentless expansion of settlements and attacks in the West Bank. Despite the strongest demands of the UK and many others, the Israeli government has plunged deeper into a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and pushedGazainto famine.”View image in fullscreenHusam Zomlot, ambassador of the state of Palestine to the United Kingdom, lifts the new plaque of the embassy.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“Shame on you,” was a cry from the back.“This conflict can never be solved by force,” Falconer went on. “The restrictions on aid are indefensible. Children are starving. Our aid is piling up. I have seen it myself in warehouses. Hamas continues to hold hostages in appalling conditions, and the suffering of families on all sides continues to be brought. These actions do not serve the cause of justice.”“Stop arming Israel,” came a chant. “Stop arming Israel, Stop arming Israel.”The Palestinian flag (“black for our mourning, white for our hope, green for our land, and red for the sacrifices of our people,” said Zomlot) was raised to the jaunty, albeit militaristic national anthem, known as Fida’i (Warrior), adopted by the Palestinian Liberation Organisation in 1972.Joudie Kalla, 47, a Palestinian-British chef, and author of the prize-winning cookbook, Palestine on a Plate: Memories from My Mother’s Kitchen, was watching on. She said: “We came to London in 1981 and we’ve just been fighting for our rights, for freedom and dignity and to be able to go back home. I currently am not able to visit my country, neither are my family ever allowed back in. My parents are in their 80s. They’re gonna die without seeing home again.”It was a day of celebration for her but she had been left frustrated by Falconer’s words. “I just think he shouldn’t have spoken today,” she said. “This is not about Israel today. This is about Palestine. These conversations have happened in other places, but not when we’re recognising ourselves and we don’t always have to be put hand in hand with them every single time, and this is a problem: that we never have a moment that’s just for ourselves.”Khalid Abdalla, 44, the actor who played Dodi Fayed in The Crown, said he found Falconer’s words “insufficient”.“In the same way that raising the flag is not enough, it doesn’t sufficiently recognise this as a genocide,” he said. “You can feel [it’s] that sort of diplomatic speech, and yet, I also can feel that … we’re a tipping point globally. I felt in that sort of gathering of MPs and political figures that there is a difference between what they think privately and what they are doing publicly.”The Conservatives, whose leader, Kemi Badenoch, has condemned the recognition of Palestine as “reward for terrorism”, had not sent a frontbencher. There were Tories attending though.Kit Malthouse, chair of the Conservative Middle East Council, said a few words in support of recognition. Alan Duncan, a former Tory foreign minister, described Badenoch’s stance as “absurd”. He said: “I’m afraid the Conservative party has disgraced itself on this. It no longer seems to believe in international law.“They just buy the BenjaminNetanyahu playbook without any kind of sense of history or humanity. I’m afraid Badenoch has allowed her policy to be taken over by [the shadow foreign secretary] Priti Patel and her usual backers.”Ruba Atallah, a young Palestinian woman from Gaza who was asked to speak at the lectern after the politicians, put it all in context. “I stand here for my grandparents and the 48 members of my family whose fate was to be killed in Gaza during the ongoing genocide,” she said.“As a Palestinian from Gaza who has lost her family. I first thought that what I want is for Gaza to return to how it once was. Then I quickly realised that what I want, I truly want, is my family to come back so I may walk in Gaza with a heart full of light.”Explore more on these topicsLondonPalestinian territoriesForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricaGazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

What changed – and what does it mean for Heathrow?What tipped the balance for Gatwick?In February the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said she was“minded to approve” its second runwayplan, after planning inspectors initially recommended refusal. However, she outlined potential conditions, including making most passengers take the train rather than a car to the airport, which Gatwick only partly agreed to accept.Gatwick said it still needed time to examine the small print of the go-ahead, announced five weeks ahead of the deadline, which appears to reframe public transport quotas as targets rather than binding. The airport must also make some further concessions on compensating nearby homeowners for noise insulation or, in extreme cases, costs of moving away.What happens next?Assuming it accepts the relaxed conditions, Gatwick will start detailed design work on the £2.2bn scheme, hoping to getting the second runway operational by “around the turn of the decade”, according to a spokesperson.Now the busiest single-runway airport in Europe, it plans to bring its emergency or standby runway into routine use. That means the entire 2.5km strip must be moved sideways by 12 metres to allow safe dual operations, with other changes such as extending the two airport terminals and installing new aircraft gates. Gatwick will also pay for highway improvements in the vicinity of the airport.View image in fullscreenAn easyJet plane coming in to land at Gatwick airport.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAWasn’t it once a choice between Gatwick and Heathrow?Speaking after the announcement, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said backing Gatwick was “in addition to our commitments to a third runway at Heathrow”, as Labour pursues economic growth through infrastructure.For a long time there had been a clear direction that only one of Britain’s two biggest airports could expand to such a degree. TheAirports Commission concluded in 2015that only one additional runway should be built in south-east England, at Heathrow.However, there was some wriggle room, which Gatwick has exploited – and the government has now happily accepted – arguing that it was just making full use of existing capacity by upgrading its emergency runway.What does it mean for Heathrow?On one level, the signals are positive for Heathrow: the government has approved a runway that planning inspectors initially rejected, with economic growth through private investment in infrastructure prioritised.In terms of the “need” for more airport capacity, Alexander’s decision letter affirms that in Gatwick’s case the “need demonstrated is largely additional to, and different from, the need that would be met by the Heathrow scheme” – ie leisure, short-haul and point-to-point, rather than transferring at a major international hub for business travel.View image in fullscreenHeathrow airport.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PANonetheless, Heathrow’s proposals are a different order of magnitude: £21bn for the runway and up to £48bn in total for expansion. Plus, it is in close proximity to the capital, swallowing up land, demolishing houses and moving Britain’s busiest motorway, the M25.Gatwick supporters have included people such as the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who see it as an alternative and hedge against Heathrow. The residents of rural Sussex will be fearing a big increase in aircraft noise but hundreds of thousands more people would be subject to the noise and pollution from a third Heathrow runway.What about the environment?Britain’s mantra may not be drill, baby, drill – but with expansion also approved at London’s Stansted, City and Luton airports, it could well be fly, baby, fly. The government maintains that this is all doable with “strict environmental requirements”.However, as the Commons transport committee chair, Ruth Cadbury, says: “They continue to say they are committed to reducing carbon emissions, but we are waiting for them to show us how they will square the circle of doing so while enabling thousands more flights.”Alexander’s decision letter said she considered that net carbon emissions from a bigger Gatwick “will decrease as measures to reduce emissions from aviation are delivered”.Replacing the oldest aircraft will reduce emissions per passenger but much hinges on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Even putting aside questions about their validity or feasibility, the net CO2emitted from fuel containing SAF is projected to reduce by about 1% a year in the UK as mandates grow; flights are growing by 2-3% a year. By the end of the next decade, passengers could number 75 million at Gatwick compared with 43 million today.Will it boost the economy?Gatwick says the scheme will create 14,000 jobs and contribute £1bn annually to the region’s economy. Some thinktanks dispute whether airport growth really helps: the New Economics Foundation says business air travel has collapsed, and additional runways will result in three times as many tourists leaving the country as come in.Nonetheless, others say air links underpin wider trade, and outbound tourism is also valuable: according to the travel association Abta, outbound travel generates £52bn in gross value added annually and supports more than 800,000 UK jobs.The government says expansion will cut the cost of holidays through competition.Explore more on these topicsGatwick airportHeathrow airportTransport policyAirline industryAirline emissionsTransportAir transportexplainersShareReuse this content"

In the wake of the UK’s largest ever far-right rally, as the St George’s cross increasingly becomes a racist dog-whistle, this depressingly timely production is a rallying cry against unquestioned nationalism. A theatrical vendetta against Shakespeare’s Henry V, English Kings Killing Foreigners is a scrappy, headstrong two-hander interrogating theatre’s role in politics and protest. “All the flags,” Nina Bowers waves her hands, “isn’t it a bit National Front?”Shakespeare’s propagandistic history play has come to symbolise a bastion of English heroism, with the plucky “warlike Harry” mightily defeating the French. But as Bowers and Philip Arditti point out through energetic debates and playful sketches, the 1599 play champions colonialism, imperialism and extreme anti-foreign sentiment. This isn’t a new idea, with several productions, such asHeadlong’s remarkable 2022 rendition, engaging with the texts’ extreme xenophobia. But hurling Shakespeare’s band of brothers into the centre of their set-less stage, Bowers and Arditti claw passionately at the text, tearing it apart and asking whether there’s any acceptable way they can piece it back together.How huge London far-right march lifted the lid on a toxic transatlantic soupRead moreStarting at Camden People’s theatre last year, this show was created in response to the two Globe Ensemble actors’ experiences of performing Henry V. With smatterings of wittily toe-curling audience interaction, they unpick the text through a new, imagined production. They play heightened versions of themselves, with Arditti as a Shakespeare fanatic, while Bowers finds the Bard boring. When their show’s lead kicks the bucket, they’re both up for the role. What does it mean to cast a non-English actor as the king? A mixed-race actor? A queer woman? Does anything change if the performer’s identity has no impact on the rest of the story being told?Frequently very funny and at times deliberately uncomfortable, this is a smart, clear-eyed debate. Dramatically reserved until the final act, its pulse really starts to race as the show moves from telling us of the play’s harm to making us feel it. Switching out the context of the chorus’ prologue to the second act, where “All the youth of England are on fire,” they suddenly illuminate the words’ violence anew. In prompting us to reimagine this 400-year-old play, the pair ask what responsibility a theatre has in the shows it stages, wondering if and how a British history play can be reshaped to avoid being yet another production of an English king killing foreigners.At Soho theatre, London, until 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Still, at least he’s like a jolly old uncle as he delivers the bad newsLucy ManganMon 22 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShare‘Humanity has three great enemies: fever, famine and war. Of these, by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever.” Thus spake the revered physician Sir William Osler, and thus quoteth Dr Chris van Tulleken at the start of this hour-long trip into terror, entitled Disease X: Hunting the Next Pandemic. Buy your bunker and pack your go-bag as you watch.Van Tulleken is an associate professor at University College London, a practising doctor in infectious diseases and a tremendously affable sort, committed to making complex medical matters accessible to a wide audience. This makes his documentary about where and what the next pandemic virus will be (“It’s out there, trying to get into the human population every day”) a strangely jolly while utterly comfortless watch. I guess a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine – and contemplation of an existential threat – go down.So, what do we know? The short answer is: too much, and not enough. With the help of experts, Van Tulleken takes us through the sprawling virus families that give us the likes of Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, yellow fever, avian flu and Covid-19 (the last of which “may have been just a warning shot”), the means by which viruses can jump species, and how they could mutate to become the one that takes us all out. In other words, it would be worse than the bubonic plague, which is estimated to have killed 50% of the European population back in the day. Worse, too, than the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, which killed more people than the first world war. And worse, too, than Covid, that “warning shot” from a global armoury stuffed with uncountable numbers of potentially fatal viruses, which has killed more than 7 million people worldwide since it emerged in 2019.Like the world’s nicest, yet most terrifying, uncle, Van Tulleken explains that all that is required is for a virus to spread from a host, such as a bat or a bird, to a population with no herd immunity – that’s us – and for that virus to become airborne (enabling speedier transmission). Et voilà! You’re dead. And I’m dead. Or 10-15% of the infected are dead (in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Sars). Or 35% (Middle East respiratory syndrome, Mers). Or 40% (H5N1, AKA bird flu, which has already moved to cows, so you may want to curtail your raw milk habit). Or 40-70% (Nipah). You get the idea, I’m sure. None of it’s good.Especially as none of the above are Disease X. Our luck is still holding. Well, our luck and monitoring systems. Van Tulleken visits the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters in Geneva and sits in on one of the daily meetings of its public health intelligence unit as it collates reports from – usually far-flung, vulnerable – countries on growing disease hotspots. There is yellow fever in the Americas, anthrax in Uganda, haemorrhagic fever in Iraq … any one of which could explode or mutate into a more deadly variant. Or a report could come in revealing something completely new. I imagine if Disease X is airborne, a dome is lowered over Geneva that seals the WHO off to give us a fighting chance of survival. This isn’t mentioned by the mathematicians who demonstrate the modelling of viral spread (turning the dials of death rate, transmissibility and government and social responses up and down to fascinating effect), but I’m sure someone will think of it soon enough.The number of viruses becoming zoonotic – making the leap from animals or birds to humans – is increasing as we humans encroach on their territories, forcing ourselves into proximities nature never intended. Van Tulleken visits a Malaysian village destroyed by an outbreak of the Nipah virus, which arose as a result of its pig farming – a risk that can only increase for us all as such processes becomes more industrialised. At the same time, funding for disease surveillance and research into viruses is being cut (in the US especially, as the Trump administration continues its assault on public health measures and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Humans, it seems, are monumentally stupid and shortsighted enough to fritter away every advantage afforded by the phenomenal technology that exists to identify new virus variants, sequence their wily strands of DNA and develop vaccines against them, in order to save a few dollars now rather than millions of lives in the future.Pack well, my friends.

The canvas ceiling was painted a perfect summer blue, like the sky at this year’s Glastonbury.The last few years have been tough at Britain’s biggest luxury brand. In May, Burberry announced it was to cut 1,700 jobs from its 9,300 global workforce in an attempt to reduce costs after annual pre-tax profits tumbled 117% in the last financial year. But just hours before this show, Burberry rejoined the FTSE 100 after dropping out last year. A much-needed reset looks to be beginning to click.View image in fullscreenThe eclectic lineup of British celebrities, which has become a Burberry signature, included Ian Wright.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images“Britain in the summer is obsessed with music festivals,” said the designer Daniel Lee backstage. “And this year felt extra special – Glastonbury was amazing, Kendrick was here, we had Oasis. And musicians always have the best style.”The soundtrack was Black Sabbath, which Lee has been listening to on repeat since the death of Ozzy Osbourne. The clothes were more Woodstock than Wilderness: flower power daisies, skinny scarves, whipstitched leather jackets, tarot card prints and tiny crochet dresses.Lee said he was thinking about the upcoming quartet of Sam Mendes films about the Beatles, but also that “fashion has been oversized for so long, we wanted to challenge ourselves. A smaller silhouette feels newer now.”View image in fullscreenBurberry’s catwalk show took place under a perfect summer blue, like the sky at this year’s Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersSome of the trippier pieces perhaps looked a touch far-fetched, but drama is as much a part of Burberry as functionality. To be properly British, after all, you need common sense and a daft sense of humour. Burberry’s bread and butter is outerwear, so itsy-bitsy dresses came topped with the kind you need for a festival when the sun goes down: fringed leather jackets, and waxed canvas parkas.It looks increasingly likely that Yorkshire-born Lee, who joined Burberry during the downturn and whose job has seemed precarious for much of his three-year tenure, will survive the storm. He was cheered on by the eclectic line up of British celebrities which has become a Burberry signature. Maya Jama was next to Ian Wright, Jack Draper was deep in tennis chat with Anna Wintour, while Jennifer Saunders was between Twiggy and Joanna Lumley.A “Burberry forward” turnaround plan has been set in motion by the chief executive, Joshua Schulman – who joined Burberry last year from New York where he led the resurgent accessible luxury brand Coach – and the downward curve of Burberry sales is slowing significantly.View image in fullscreenAfter losing customers by hiking prices too high, Burberry is refocussing on more affordable pieces.Photograph: Kate Green/Getty ImagesSchulman’s international perspective could be helping Burberry tell its story about Britishness and heritage in a way that connects with shoppers, and the brand has cut through with unexpected celebrity tie-ups including the actor Richard E Grant on the catwalk in February’s show, and the Premier League footballers Eberechi Eze and Cole Palmer on billboards.After losing customers by hiking prices too high, Burberry is refocussing on more affordable pieces. “Scarf bars” in flagship stores are proving successful in bringing in customers who can’t afford a coat, but want to wear Burberry to stay warm.About 170 of the planned job cuts will affect the brand’s Castleford trenchcoat factory, where Schulman said overcapacity was “not sustainable”. But Burberry has committed to continue British production, with a renovation of the Victorian factory scheduled to begin next year.Explore more on these topicsLondon fashion weekBurberryFashion weeksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Missouri-born pop artist languished in up-and-coming mode for years – I first learned of her prismatic gay club anthem Pink Pony Club via a friend’s recommendation in 2020 – only to experience one of theswiftest ascents into the mainstreamI’ve ever witnessed. Just 18 months ago, she was still playing 2,000-cap amphitheaters in mid-sized cities; by summer’s end, she drew the largest crowd (more than 100,000) that Chicago’s Lollapalooza festival has ever seen. Herrise was so vertiginous– viralTiny Desk, Grammysbest new artist, festival undercard to headliner, international chart takeover – that she feels lifetimes away from the artist I saw, stunned by her own zeitgeist earthquake atNew York’s Governors Ballin June of last year.Her return to New York at Forest Hills stadium this weekend, her first live shows in the US in a year, thus represents a homecoming of sorts, and a victory lap for the occasionally rocky journey into the stratosphere. Her eight “pop-up” shows this fall, billed as the Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things tour, span the geographical linchpins of her music: four shows in New York, site of sexual awakenings (Naked in Manhattan) and devastating breakups (new single The Subway, the night’s pre-eminent vehicle for Roan’s torrential belt); two in Kansas City, Missouri, a few hours from her hometown of Willard; and two in Los Angeles, where Roan forged the joyously queer and infectiously cheeky pop of her debut and still only studio album,The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.Post Malone review – megawatt charisma and anthemic hooks from an irresistibly genial outlawRead moreIt’s a testament to the potency of Roan’s maximalist sound, chock-full of sexually frank asides, baroque feelings and lavish camp, that a 93-minute set containing almost every song she’s recorded had the feeling of a greatest hits show. Roan was allegedly not “feeling 100” on Sunday night – “I have a migraine, so I can’t bang my head super hard, but that’s kinda my thing, so pretend I bang my head a lot tonight,” she said before nominally teaching the YMCA-style Hot To Go! dance to 13,000 devotees, ranging from young girls to queer twentysomethings to a middle-aged man in front of me texting his mom “I love her!!!!” mid-show. But whatever felt off to her did not translate in a show that felt as triumphant as it did laidback – an artist gone through the wringer, finally relaxing into superstardom. You know from the second she appears in a whimsically gothic castle, styled as both musketeer and princess and bemoaning a boring man’s “fugly jeans”, that Roan has finally hit her big-tent stride.View image in fullscreenChappell Roan is joined by Heart’s Nancy Wilson.Photograph: Ragan Henderson/Foundations MusicA chameleon explicitly indebted to drag – several queens opened Sunday’s show, as on most other dates – Roan, born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, played every other royal role in a loosely fairytale-themed show: damsel, knight, jester, queen of the castle high-kicking the point of out every line; supplicant to the guitar heroes of her all-female, 70s rock-styled band; heir to the lineage of bombastic, unapologetic female showmanship when introducing Heart’s Nancy Wilson for a deafening, and transcendent, rendition of Barracuda. Roan is easily one of the strongest vocalists of her pop generation, though she was occasionally overwhelmed by the joyous din – whether for illness or celebration, she often let the audience take over. I lost her voice entirely in the pop-rock deluge that is The Subway, her hearty belt subsumed in a cascade of devotion from fans to singer to subject.It’s a femininomenon! How Chappell Roan slow-burned her way to stardomRead moreThat’s befitting a show that, while exuberant and celebratory, still managed to feel casual and intimate, more relaxed than the last time she performed on US soil. “I’m like really hard on myself, I’m really, really hard on myself, for performing … I can’t do 100% today. I guess that’s OK, I’ll have fun,” she said while seated on a throne for Coffee, evincing a hard-earned and endearing looseness after white-knuckling into the stratosphere with the attendantstalkersand social mediacontroversies. (Vocally, her “less than 100%” is another’s 10,000%.)But for all the pop bombast – and I prefer Roan’s more-is-more, unleashed inner child performance style – it was on the slow-burnCalifornia, the night’s penultimate song, that she got me. A homesick ballad written and released in 2020, as her first foray into pop music faltered and before she returned to Missouri, the track is now at extreme odds with the supernova Roan has become. And yet, in a brief moment of stirring a cappella – “I stretched myself across four states / New lands, west coast, where my dreams lay” – her voice held all that once was: big dreams and disillusionment, conflicted yearning for a dying place, a distinctly midwestern sense of obligation and humility that does not go away. It was an emotional jolt in an otherwise effervescent show – a hymn and a reminder that she, and many others in the crowd, had come a long, long way.Explore more on these topicsChappell RoanPop and rockNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the event, he has written his way off the page and into an entirely new publishing model. The Universal Turing Machine is the title both of Beard’s memoir and themass memoir projecthe hopes others will help him to build.Organised as a chessboard, each of the 64 squares narrates one year of Beard’s life, in 1,000 words per year. (He’s 58, so the last five years are fictionalised.) The reader moves around the “board” as if they were a knight, picking the next year to read from options limited by the knight’s L-shaped ambulation.“The way you go round it, what you want to know, will tell you something about yourself,” he says. Each entry or square contains signposts to future and past entries; you can pick your subplot or skip to the juiciest bits, read faithfully or game the machine. The public are free to respond to the constraints of the board however they choose, merging or repeating years, provided they submit 64 years to fit the shape of the board, each of no more than 1,000 words. The memoirs will be displayed in a grid with each square a clickable whole-life memoir. As more are published, the overall grid of the “machine” will grow.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Universal Turing MachineThe project takes its title from the test that Alan Turing devised to discern artificial intelligence from human intelligence. “The idea is that if you write your memoir, you are passing the Turing test,” Beard says. “You are showing that you’re human through the life that you’ve lived, through the memories that you have. In a way, it’s a resistance to AI-generated content.”Beard’s memoir is beautifully written, with a dedication to emotional accuracy that feels both tender and ruthless. “Much of the kindness in our marriage involved leaving the other person alone,” he writes, “which often went unnoticed.” Or of his dad’s last breaths: “We fed him drops of water from the spout of a rainbow-striped teapot and watched the mist in his eyes become dominant, a grey colour like old washing-up water or wet kitchen-towel or cold lamb-fat or the outside of a blown lightbulb …”It is impossible to resist the thought that it ought to be a book. But Beard found that however he ordered his honest memories, the process of ordering made them feel less honest. He realised he remembered specific events in his life in the context of what happened before and after them, and there was no satisfying way to represent this truth in fiction. “The thing to get your head around is that [this memoir] doesn’t work in anyoneorder, but it does work inevery possible order.“I remembered by jumping around,” he says. The answer was to find a way for readers to jump around, too.There are precedents for nonlinear narratives, such as BS Johnson’s The Unfortunates, which was published as loose leaves in a box, or Julio Cortázar’s Hopscotch, which contained instructions for alternative reading sequences.“But it’s still there on the page,” Beard says. “By using technology, you can make it an immersive, interactive experience.”Beard started out writing experimental fiction – his early works wereOulipian. Damascus (1998), for instance, used only nouns from the Times on the day the Maastricht Treaty took effect. He switched to memoir with 2017’s The Day That Went Missing, which told the story of his brother’s death by drowning; Beard was in the sea with him, aged 11. The book disclosed, and bore, its emotional constraints. Each memoir has been more revelatory than the last.“Yes, because each time I get better at telling the truth,” he says. “I can now see that the novels were acts of deflection and evasion … I was using them to get validation, basically. Of course, I didn’t realise that at the time … Whereas once I got into nonfiction, I was just concentrating on trying to write what was true, and I’ve got much closer to what I think writing is for, and why writing is valuable.”The Universal Turing Machine is free to read, and publication on the platform is free too. Memoirs are submitted as word documents, and will be copy edited. Beard, who used to direct the National Academy of Writing, will personally read and copy edit the first 15 memoirs to be published.There is no commercial outcome – unless a publisher comes forward with an innovative suggestion of how to represent The Universal Turing Machine on paper. An origamist, perhaps?“It’s uncommodified, which is one of the reasons why it feels important – and the fact that everyone can give it a go,” Beard says. “That seems to me a much more healthy way to approach writing than to get caught up in the competitive traps of sales and validation and essentially showing off.”“It’s a way of taking writing seriously,” Beard says. “I’m enthused by it because I believe in literature. I believe in writing. And it feels a little bit threatened at the moment.”Contributions to The Universal Turing Machine can be made atuniversalturingmachine.co.ukExplore more on these topicsBooksAutobiography and memoirfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On opening night, intoxication is down and women say they feel safer from spikingAlastair ShuttleworthMon 22 Sep 2025 12.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 13.04 EDTShare‘If it doesn’t work, I can say I tried something,” shrugs Chris Hindle. We are sat in XLR, his 200-capacity club in Manchester’s student-filled Withington suburb, discussing the figurative anvil dangling over club culture.The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) recently reported that the UK has lost three venues a week in the past three months, seven in 10 venues are failing to make a profit anda quarter of towns and cities that had nightclubs in 2020 now have none.“Alcohol duties are going up, bills are going up, yet drinking habits and attendances have dropped,” he says. Luckily, he’s got a plan – one potentially crazy enough to work.XLR is trialling a new BYOB (“bring your own booze”) model. Ticket-buyers arrive with pre-bought drinks: XLR advise a limit of eight cans or one 75cl bottle of spirit per person, with no glass allowed inside. After a security check, they take them to the bar staff. Behind the bar, there are numbered wooden shelves resembling the shoe cupboards at a bowling alley. Your drinks go in one for £2, the number goes on your hand, and when you want one you ask the staff to hand it over. There is also a working bar, if you’d rather buy a cold beer.“Some clubs are charging £5 for a ticket, you get to the bar and it’s £12 for a double,” says Hindle, meaning cash-strapped students will stay in or pre-drink heavily to spend less later. By raising ticket prices to £10-£15 but allowing BYOB, he aims to incentivise students to come out, knowing they can then drink at supermarket prices.Legally, it’s a straightforward situation. XLR needs a premises licence to sell alcohol and host regulated entertainment, along with a personal licence held by a designated premises supervisor. To also allow BYOB, Hindle doesn’t require extra licensing – he simply needs to show he is continuing to uphold the standards of the licensing he already has. While there are members’ clubs requiring club premises certificates, and BYOB events that supply alcohol under temporary event notices, XLR seems to be Manchester’s first licensed club which is also BYOB – and I can’t find a similar model elsewhere.View image in fullscreen‘Nobody’s turned up with a full crate’ … Chris Hindle, owner of XLR.Photograph: Hayley AmberI go to the opening night at 11:30pm, with two cans of lager, one 20cl glass bottle of rum (I’m given a resealable water pouch at security to decant it into) and a bottle of Coca-Cola. I get my cupboard and ask for the rum and Coke. XLR are currently having punters mix their own drinks, using stacks of plastic shot glasses and cups on the bar, but Hindle says this is under review. Tonight is going well. Its reduced capacity of 120 is already nearly sold out at an average of £12 per ticket, and everyone seems to get it.“I think it’s really good,” says Amelie, who brought with her a small rum, pineapple juice and a knock-offBuzzBallz. “Drinks can be really expensive when you go out to clubs, so ramping up the ticket price a little but allowing you to bring your own drinks does save money.”“You never go to a house party and they supply the drinks,” notes Ted, who brought seven lagers to XLR. He also notes the lack of necessity to pre-drink: “Now you can show up to the event whenever you want and enjoy the whole night.” Daisy, who brought “squashka” (squash, water, vodka), recalls friends pre-drinking too hard ahead of previous nights out at conventional clubs, then getting denied entry for being too far gone.She makes a good point – I’ve not seen anyone wasted yet. “The people I’ve seen today have been a lot less intoxicated, more interesting in conversation,” Josh says, “because they haven’t pushed themselves too hard before they got here.”Another concern that XLR’s new policy may help to mitigate is drink-spiking: CounterSpike, a company producing drink testing strips, has reported a five-fold increase in the UK since 2020.Hindle, whose club contains 17 CCTV cameras, considered this with his staffed cupboards, and punters seem to feel safe. “People know they can bring their drinks in, screw their own lids on and you own your own drinks,” Amelie says. “You know what’s in them.”One currently unanswered question is what to do with the night’s leftover booze, which punters can’t take home due to licensing restrictions. For now, it will sit in storage.Outside, Hindle is beaming. “Nobody’s brought anything too stupid, nobody’s turned up with a full crate. It’s going really well.”I leave feeling as if I’ve watched the student night-life equivalent of the fosbury flop: a stunning innovation that seems primed to become the new norm. I can picture these in loads of student areas – and am a bit jealous of the kids who might go.Explore more on these topicsMusicClubbingClub cultureManchesterGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Palestinians need unfettered support – and nowMon 22 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 10.53 EDTShareWelcome, but behind the curve. That is the summary of the coordinated recognition of a Palestinian state byCanada, Australia and Britain. The emphatic gesture is a historical moment where the record is not written, but corrected. Palestinian statehood has always existed, and recognising that fact confers credibility on the recognisers, and not the Palestinian claim to their inalienable rights.As part of the shifting tide against Israel, even in theUnited States, recognition of a Palestinian state enshrines what the Israeli state seems committed to erasing once and for all – the legitimate claim of Palestinians to their own land. Naming and insisting on Palestinian statehood is vital. As the activist Arab Barghouthitold the Guardian last week, the recognition protects the idea of a Palestinian state, because the Israeli government is “bragging about the fact that they are killing the idea of a Palestinian state. And diplomatically, when countries like Britain and France and Canada recognise Palestine, that means something.”Now, more proof that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. How can western governments still refuse to act? | Steve CrawshawRead moreSuch gestures are important, especially for a cause that is fundamentally about a people’s right to exist in sovereignty on their own land. Keeping that notion alive, even if Israel never reverses course, resists theIsraeli government’s driveto have full and final dominion over Palestinians without condemnation or acknowledgment of the erasure of Palestinian rights, and confers status, respect and international treaty relations upon the Palestinian state. And there is weight to Britain, a member of the G7 and a permanent member of the security council, along with France, going up against US and Israeli propaganda that conflates Palestinian recognition with rewarding Hamas.But the road to this recognition has been ignoble in action and flawed in rationale. As far as the British government is concerned, belatedness and timidity have been defining features of its response to the situation in Gaza over the past two years. The government cannot escape the cloud of Keir Starmer’s words in those early days,when he said thatIsrael has the “right” to cut off power and water from Gaza. Nor the ignominy of refusing to back a ceasefire in November 2023, forcing members ofthe shadow cabinet to resign their rolesin order to vote for an amendment to the king’s speech call for a ceasefire.But the failures are not only historical, they are current and, indeed, concurrent, with the recognition. The government thatspeaks of the intolerable urgencyof the situation in Gaza is the same that received the Israeli president in Downing Streetearlier this month, a man whose declaration that there is “an entire nation out there that is responsible” for the 7 October 2023 attacks has beencited by a United Nations commissionas inciting genocide. It is also the same government that has deployed its full forceon many hundreds of peaceful protestersobjecting to the banning of Palestine Action. And despite the suspension of sales and licences for offensive weapons to Israel, British firms have stillprovided thousands of military items, including munitions that comprise bombs, grenades, torpedoes, mines and missiles.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer issues a statement from 10 Downing Street confirming the UK will recognise a Palestinian state, 21 September 2025.Photograph: 10 Downing Street/PAAnd it is only the force of public opinion that has dragged the government to even that partial suspension. Whether it issanctions against far-right Israeli ministersfor inciting violence against Palestinians, or the move to recognise a Palestinian state, the government has always moved too slowly, and even then producing only half-measures and confusing statements. That is inevitable when its responses do not come from a place of political duty, but pressure and calculation. These calculations never quite yield the desired result of projecting a government in command of the situation, because it is constantly trying to reconcile two things that cannot be joined together – placating public opinion, while still not making a meaningful rupture with the Israeli state.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cynic in me asks: why now? | Rokhaya DialloRead moreThe result is that the announcement of the intent to recognise a Palestinian state had already been weakened by its bizarre conceptualisation, framed as it has been around certainconditions that Israel must meet, including a ceasefire and permitting aid into Gaza, to head off the recognition. Palestinians either have an inalienable right to statehood and self-determination or they do not, and linking that right to the compliance of their occupier maintained a wildly unrealistic, if not fantastical, notion that Israel has any interest at all in pursuing a two-state solution when it is hurtling persistently in the other direction. It is clear now, two years into a genocide, that the Israeli government is not one that can be threatened, urged or scolded into ceasing its violation of Palestinian human and political rights.Which is why Palestinian statehood cannot be a phantom lever: a recognition that is not connected to anything, something that ends up being a fig leaf for western governments to say that they have taken big steps, and therefore catch a break. It cannot be something to roll out as a firm talking point when pressed, and to absolve themselves of the further action that must be taken. It must be more than an end in itself.It cannot be high-octane but low-stakes signalling, unaccompanied by any tangible measures that would stop genocide and the invasion and re-settlement of Gaza: a second ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, and the looming annexation of the West Bank. Backing it up must be some form of sanctions, trade embargos and international isolation. And, even then, those measures would only be a start on the road to withdrawing global legitimacy from the Israeli state on the basis that it has long become an outlaw.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians flee amid an Israeli military operation, Gaza City, 21 September 2025.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersRecognition of a Palestinian state is a big step on the part of countries that have withheld that right for too long, and we will hear a lot of “better late than never”s over the next few days. But the potential import of the move has been diminished by the colossal events over the past two years: war crimes and atrocities that the world still has failed to respond to proportionately.Is it better late than never? I don’t know. Too many have been killed, maimed and starved for that phrase to be anything but a glib line that resigns us to a politics in which the lowest expectations are the best that can be hoped for. If the next steps are all to be better late than never, then the sum total of all this high historic action, as far as it will change the fate of a single Palestinian on the ground, is zero. For this to be the important move that it can be, it must be followed by steps that meet the moment in action, over and above the political pronouncements.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesOpinionKeir StarmerIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelLabourMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

For their sake, we must hope Your Party’s hotheads give way to calm strategistsMon 22 Sep 2025 11.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 14.53 EDTShareThe left traditionally faces four formidable enemies: wealthy interests, the political elite, the mainstream media and itself. Over the past few days, the latter hasstormed back with a vengeance.When the independent MP and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the former Labour MP Zarah Sultana announced the birth of a new leftwing party, the surge of interest shocked even its founders. More than 750,000 people signed up in support of an unchristened, nonexistent party.Polling suggestednearly a third of Britons would vote for an alliance with the Greens; among under-35s, support rose to 52%. That media outlets spent more time mocking its placeholder name, Your Party, than seeking to understand this phenomenon tells its own story. In today’s Britain, “legitimate concerns” means kicking out migrants, not taxing elites to rebuild crumbling services.Alas, a deeply unattractive public row in recent days appeared to detonate the whole project. Sultana seeks the co-leadership of a new party, and her camp felt she was being frozen out by Corbyn’s advisers and the four independent MPs who won on a platform opposing Israel’s genocide and tackling economic misery at home. Corbyn’s team believe that he remains the politician most able to galvanise the grassroots. The independents feel that, having crushed the Labour machine when Keir Starmer was securing a landslide, they represent a mass base that must be respected and given a major role.Fearing being sidelined, Sultanaunilaterally launched the membership schemeunder her allies’ control. Threats of legal action on both sides followed, as well as accusations of sexism by Sultana. Social media filled with despairing posts, mostly younger voters who know where Britain is headed and thought their lifeboat had been scuppered by friendly fire.Thankfully, a miscalculated game of chicken appears to have drawn to a close, and plans to launch a new party have resumed.Sultana has halted legal actionand rightly warned that “the stakes are too high for failure to be an option”. We must hope that hotheads on all sides give way to calm strategists.A grassroots initiativeis constructively calling for a new elected committee to take over the proceedings. Given the scale of both opportunity and danger, a leftwing implosion would be tragic – and unforgivable.Conditions have never been better for a force to Labour’s left. Starmer wooed the membership to become leader of the party as a socialist, then swerved right and launched an assault on Labour’s left flank. As prime minister, Starmer has done everything his party’s right has desired: attacked social security , bashed migrants , refused to hike taxes on the rich. The result? Having ejected a despised Tory government a little more than a year ago,only 11% of voters approveof the government – 72% disapprove.Meanwhile, polling consistently shows mass support for leftwing policies such as hikingtax on the richandpublic ownership. The Greens, meanwhile, have elected theextremely impressive Zack Polanski, whose eco-socialist pitch is cutting through. An alliance between a new left party and the Greens could replace an imploding Labour.None of this erases the challenges. Any viable left coalition must recognise British Muslims as essential to its base. They have been politicised by western bloodbaths in mostly Muslim lands such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Palestine; by the hardship that disproportionately strikes their communities; and by endemic, mainstreamed Islamophobia. Strong community networks – so rare in atomised Britain – make for formidable ground campaigns.But some tensions cannot be wished away, including the tension within such a coalition between socially conservative and progressive values on issues such as trans rights. However, the two most prominent British Muslim politicians – the Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the former Scottish first minister Humza Yousaf – have been steadfast pro-LGBTQ allies, unlike most Christian Tory MPs. Muslims were voting Labour when it passed gay rights legislation. Many voters at the time – Muslim or not – didn’t support equalising the age of consent or scrapping Section 28, but decided they had other priorities. Any left alliance must fiercely confront Islamophobia, oppose the slaughter of Muslims abroad and champion the rights of all minorities. That’s not only moral; it’s strategic. Younger voters will walk away otherwise – and the electoral coalition will collapse.Failure now would be criminal self-indulgence. Economic insecurity defines millions of lives. Fascism is resurgent across the west. Authoritarianism is hardening at home: witness themass arrest of peaceful anti-genocide activistsunder Labour’s anti-terror laws. Starmer’s indulgence of anti-migrant politics – and his refusal to address the economic roots of despair – only legitimises Farageism. A united left with a compelling message would drag the political conversation away from punching down at migrants, to take on the wealthy elites actually responsible for Britain’s decline. That would force Starmer and Farage alike on the back foot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We must stand upJoel SwansonWhat is happening to Judith Butler – a Jewish intellectual – in the name of fighting ‘antisemitism’ is outrageousMon 22 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTShareAmid all the other breaking news consuming the United States this month, the University of California, Berkeley, arguably the nation’s most elite public university,gave the Trump administrationa list of 160 names of faculty, staff and students, as part of an investigation into “alleged antisemitic incidents”.While all the names on this list are significant, one name in particular that UC Berkeley handed over to the Trump administration stands out: Judith Butler, the eminent queer theorist, literary theorist and philosopher, and one of the most famous public intellectuals in the United States today.In addition to Butler’s name representing one of the most high-profile academic scalps demanded by the Trump administration in its campaign against higher education so far, Butler’s name is also notable for another reason: Butler is proudly and publicly Jewish,and has written extensivelyabouttheir Jewish identityandhow it informs their politics. In the name of “fighting antisemitism”, the Trump administration is publicly making an example out of arguably the most famous Jewish public intellectual in the country today.As a professor of Jewish studies, whose work intersects with gender and queer theory in substantial ways, I teach Butler regularly in my classes, both their writings on gender performativity and on Jewish politics. I never endorse Butler’s perspectives on Jewish politics, and when I teach their writings against Zionism, I am always careful to present them to my students alongside opposing perspectives. In truth, while I find their writings on gender highly valuable for my work, I have considerable differences with them on issues of Zionism and Middle East politics.None of that matters right now. If we are going to defend the Jewish community in the United States, we have to stand up for Professor Butler.Butler, whocompared the legal allegationsagainst them to Kafka’s famous novel The Trial, likened the public targeting to the McCarthy era, writing that the practice of universities forwarding names to the federal government was a “well-known practice from the McCarthy Era … We should not be naive. Will those of us named now be branded on a government list? Will our travel be restricted? Will our email communications be surveilled?”Butler is right to compare the current climate of higher education to the McCarthy era, but this comparison works for more reasons than the obvious ones. Like the current campaign against “campus antisemitism”, McCarthyism was also an antisemitic campaign against Jews who did not fit into the prevailing politics of the day.During the McCarthy era around the 1950s,a survey conducted by the American Jewish Committee found that more than half of all Americansassociated Jews with the act of spying on behalf of the Soviet Union. Indeed, out of 124 people interrogated for perceived links to communism by the senator Joseph McCarthy’s notorious Senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs in 1952, an overwhelming79 of them, two-thirds, were Jewish.The antisemitic campaign did not end there. The representative John Rankin, a stalwart supporter of the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac) and McCarthyism,delivered a speech on the floor of the House of Representativesin which he openly listed the names of Jews whom he suspected of being communists. Rankin went so far as to accuse these Jews of changing their names to hide their Jewish identities.As he said: “One is Danny Kaye. We found his real name was David Daniel Kaminsky. Then there was Eddie Cantor. His real name was Edward Itzkowitz. Edward G Robinson, his name is Emanuel Goldenberg … There’s another one here who calls himself Melvyn Douglas, whose real name is Melvyn Hesselberg.” Not terribly subtle.The Jewish musician Larry Adler, blacklisted from Hollywood as a result of suspected communist ties,reported receiving a letter from Huacbeginning with: “Dear Kike.” And those US senators most vocally opposed to McCarthyismreceived antisemitic hate mail from angry constituents, one labeling a lawmaker a “henchman of the Jew Deal … some crackpot fronting for the Jews”.The law the Trump administration is using to deport foreign students for suspected antisemitism, theMcCarran-Walter Act, even has its roots in McCarthy-era antisemitism. It was initially used to block eastern European Jewish immigrants from the US, including Holocaust survivors, because of suspected links to communism.According to the professor Michael Kagan of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, the Pennsylvania representative Francis Walter, champion of the law, “was a virulent antisemite. He just sort of thought Jews and Communists were overlapping groups.”The parallels between the antisemitism of the McCarthy era and the current day do not end there. Then, as now, too many American Jewish organizations decided that the way forward was not to fight for the rights of all Jews, but to throw leftist Jews under the bus in the name of respectability politics.As historianAviva Weingartenhas demonstrated, during the McCarthy period, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) “endeavoured to banish communists from the ranks of the Jewish community and its offices” so as to combat any public link between Jewishness and leftism in the minds of the American public. The AJC evenfinanced and promotedthe spread of anti-communist literature to prove their patriotic American bona fides. Likewise, the AJCexpelledthe leftist Jewish People’s Fraternal Order in 1949, ultimately leading to the latter organization having toshut down. And in the early 1950s, organizations including the ADL and the AJCinvestedin a large publicity campaign designed to promote the image of the American Jew as a loyal, patriotic American citizen and capitalist; the groups evendiscussed approachingParamount Pictures to produce a movie in which a Jewish American secret agent fights international communism.The McCarthy era was a time of great antisemitism in US history. But instead of standing together as a Jewish community under threat, too much of the organized Jewish community decided that it was better to rid themselves of meddlesome leftwing Jews to win entrance into mainstream American culture for themselves.Today, they are on the verge of making the same mistake. Too many American Jewish organizations likethe AJCandthe ADLhave cheered the Trump administration’s crackdown on higher education in the name of “fighting antisemitism”, ignoring the way in which this crackdown isfalling heavily on Jews deemed to have the wrong politics.Judith Butler’s politics on Israel-Palestine are controversial, and I may not always agree with them. But they are part of a rich tradition of Jewish dissent, going back to Baruch Spinoza and running through such Jewish luminaries as Kafka, Freud, Rosa Luxemburg and the “non-Jewish Jew” Isaac Deutscher. We may not always agree with all of these thinkers, but part of having a rich Jewish intellectual community means making space for them. We are all worse off when we cast out the dissenters.Butler rightlycompared their treatment by the Trump administration to the McCarthy era. Just as back then, the government wants to claim the scalp of a high-profile dissenting Jew, in the name of enforcing a conformity of acceptable Jewish politics. But the American Jewish community made the mistake back then of casting out dissenters for the sake of respectability, rather than standing up and declaring that Jewish socialists are also a rich part of the Jewish communal tapestry. Let’s not make the same mistake again. Standing up for Jews on campus means standing up for the rights ofallJews.Joel Swanson is professor of Jewish studies at Sarah Lawrence CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS universitiesFreedom of speechcommentShareReuse this content"

Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, followed up bylanding an Airbus A320in a flight simulator in West Sussex. Assuming legal challenges are overcome, it is possible to believe the new runway will be operational by 2030.Give thanks that the holding pattern is finally over. Few proposed infrastructure projects capture the UK’s inability to get on with the job quite like Gatwick. The airport has been arguing for expansion for more than a decade on the grounds that it is approaching full capacity and the spadework is relatively easy – shifting an emergency runway 12 metres north to allow it to be used as part of normal operations.Airport expansion is never without controversy, of course. Proposals must be assessed for noise, pollution, impact on the national carbon budget and much else. Yet successive governments have driven everybody mad for years by accepting the case for more runway capacity in the south-east and then failing to make it happen.Gatwick given green light for £2.2bn second runway planRead moreHoward Davies’ airports commission in 2015 backed a third runway at Heathrow as the proposal that would deliver the biggest economic boost to the UK, but the political game has always been about the art of the possible. The politics arounda third runwaystill look toxic (never mind this government’s support), while Gatwick has alwayslooked relatively straightforward, imposing fewer detriments on fewer people.The clinching argument, you would have assumed long ago, would have been the price tag, since the costs will ultimately be recouped from passengers via landing charges. Gatwick prices its project at £2.2bn, a snip when set against the latest £50bn blowout budget for a third runway plus facilities at Heathrow. The difference is easily explained: Gatwick is building within its existing borders and making greater use of existing infrastructure, while Heathrow’s plan involves shifting part of the M25 for starters.Even the last leg of Gatwick’s journey to approval has been a saga. Alexander was “minded to recommend” the proposal in February after several months spent reviewing the Planning Inspectorate’s qualified verdict. Monday’s actual recommendation contained tweaks that should not have required much agonising, such as the airport coughing up minor sums towards bus, coach and rail improvements. Maybe the dance was necessary to minimise the chances of the whole scheme being overturned in the inevitable judicial review. But it is yet another vivid demonstration of the challenges of getting projects built.One can, of course, take the principled view that any airport expansion is abhorrent on environmental grounds. It is a reasonable position. But one can still bemoan a planning system that makes it so difficult to achieve a desired political end once the growth versus climate trade-offs have been examined. Gatwick’s expansion is finally happening (probably). It should not have taken so long to get to this point.Explore more on these topicsGatwick airportNils Pratley on financeHeathrow airportTransport policyPlanning policyTransportAirline industryAir transportcommentShareReuse this content"

Still, something about it snagged in my brain and I’ve found myself brooding about that expression and how it gets used.That “not your [family member]’s” formula entered the vernacular in a 1988 US car ad, when it was directed at dads: “Not your father’s Oldsmobile”. Now, though, it seems mostly to have defaulted to mothers. It’s a lazy marketing brag or headline, a shorthand for new, directional and disruptive, and I’ve started to hate it.I’m not usually actively angered by reflexive sexism and ageism; I tend to let it wash over me in a dispiriting wave. And I don’t, actually, feel personally slighted by the expression. I am, indeed, a mother who is also terminally cautious and aesthetically unadventurous. Whatever you’re marketing (unless it’s “fire” or “the wheel”) is likely to be more edgy and innovative than I’m comfortable with.But what about all the other mothers? If you’re my age, your mother probably came of age in the 60s, experiencing Sgt Pepper-inspired psychedelia, the summer of love and Mary Quant micro-minis. Any mother since could have experienced all manner of fashion and cultural revolutions: punk, glam rock, New Romantic, acid house or grunge. I inherited two garments from my mum, a woman infinitely braver than me in every way. One was a bum-skimming babydoll nightie in a cacophonously bright floral bordered with black lace, the other a completely transparent crocheted Biba dress. Unlike her, I’ve never dared wear either in public. And that’s just clothes. Your mothers have seen (and done) things you people wouldn’t believe, so leave them out of this – they shouldn’t be a cheap punchline to sell shampoo.If we need a new shorthand for “conventional, careful, staid and reserved” in the UK, the answer is staring us awkwardly in the face.

But those involved in the project have to act in harmony - and stay on topicMon 22 Sep 2025 11.16 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 14.53 EDTShareNone of us are in our first flush of youth – well, obviously some are, but not Yanis Varoufakis, Ken Loach or, for that matter, me. The Greek firebrand economist and the campaigning British film-maker havewritten an open letterimploring Your Party to stop being idiots, or – in their only marginally less inflammatory language – “to work together in good faith”. The only reason I would bring anyone’s age into this is just a simple: how many times?How many times must everyone over the age of 18 have looked at theLabourparty, its left flank, its right cadre, its sodden middle, and thought, “I’m out, I’m completely out, I am no longer emotionally engaging with this”, only to be dragged back in by sheer desperation, to find once again that we were right the first time?To recap on Your Party: it launched with an announcement by one of its leaders, Zarah Sultana, that the other leader apparently didn’t know about. Jeremy Corbyn managed to contain his annoyance to the extent that he didn’t immediately disavow the project, but nevertheless got it across that he was only lukewarm about the co-leadership idea,putting out a statementthat merely said Sultana would “help [him] build a real alternative” to Labour, one that understood that “poverty, inequality and war are not inevitable”.At this point, the party had no name. Some wag on X suggested Jezzbollah, but it was the start of July and Palestine Action had just been proscribed as a terrorist organisation, so no sane person would have laughed. Nope, not one. Meanwhile,in the Spectator, a rightwing contrarian was suggesting that Glastonbury should be bombed, but to fantasise about the death of your opponents is just ordinary, decent free speech, while to laugh at wordplay is hate speech – don’t look at me, I didn’t make these rules. I would like to point out, however, that the right is greatly outdoing the left in confidence at the moment.View image in fullscreenYou can see what they were trying to do … Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana in London last month.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe new party looked like a shambles, in other words: a “messy surprise”, ran one headline. The lack of name seemed to be one of the main counts against it – until, that is, its holding name arrived, Your Party. You can see what they were trying to do: bring everyone into the tent, give everyone a sense of ownership. In that, it was not ineffective: it said that 600,000 people signed up for updates and information on how to get involved in under a week. There is no shortage of appetite for these ideals, none. Yet it remains the worst name under the sun, for its simple ambiguity – what are we actually talking about? The political party co-led by Corbyn and Sultana; the movement-building project of Corbyn’s, with Sultana helping; or a social event that one person in this conversation thinks the other one is having? Again, observe the enemy: everyone knows what “reform” means, and everyone – even my kids, who would cross the street to avoid picking up even the scantest current affairs knowledge – knows who the leader is.Zack Polanski’s win shows leftwing candidates are still underestimated – even by Jeremy Corbyn | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThings move quite fast in these febrile times, so you may have forgotten the bit where nobody informed the Workers party. Its leader,George Galloway, more in anger than in sorrow, tweeted that he couldn’t possibly work with Your Party anyway, “due to significant difference on the issues of trans … Russia-Ukraine… net zero and other things”. No time now to linger on the bits of the left that are actually indistinguishable from the right. The Corbyn allies in Your Party were named, and it was exactly the same team, centred around political strategist Karie Murphy, who did such sterling, pluralistic work while he was leading the Labour party.One reason Reform are doing so well is that they don’t let anyone tell them their silly agenda won’t wash with the voters. They won’t be told by pollsters, they won’t be told by sensible centrists; they will just keep on thumping away until their issues are all any of us are talking about. The left, by contrast, operates on a spectrum, from “poverty, inequality and war can wait until we’ve dealt with the deficit” to “I will wage implacable war upon injustice, just as soon as I’ve destroyed this comrade”. They cannot, any of them, stay on topic – they could learn from Nigel Farage, they could learn fromZack Polanski, but they have to start learning from someone.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

By blurring truth and criminalising dissent, he is dismantling the US’s free-speech order from withinMon 22 Sep 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 19.26 EDTShareAt Sunday’s memorial for the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump paid a peculiar tribute. Having quoted Mr Kirk’s words of forgiveness, he put aside the script. “That’s where I disagreed with Charlie,” hesaid. “I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them.” It was a stark and clarifying admission. Mr Trump does not seek to criminalise hate speech so much as to criminalisespeech he hates.The US is beingdraggedinto a state of emergency. Speech is framed asterrorism. Satire is rebranded asenemy propaganda. Employerspunishworkers for personal posts. The predictable result is a chilling climate of surveillance and reprisal, in which citizens learn to keep quiet. The assassination is not just being used to police manners; it is being used to reconstruct the public square so that dissent equalsdisloyalty, and disloyalty is treated as a security threat.Hannah Arendtwarned of the existential peril in blurring the line between truth and lies: then truth doesn’t stand; it becomes optional. Mr Trump’s reportedfalsehoodsabout paracetamol and autism will harm mothers, stigmatise families and erode trust in medicine. But in Trumpland such costs are outweighed by the political payoff of pitting supporters against thescientific“establishment”.His assault is twofold. First, speech is being weaponised through partisan media, online influencers and harassment networks that seek to capture attention while corroding the conditions for open dialogue. Second, state power is weaponised by cowingsocial mediaplatforms, threatening networklicencesand politicising information. Handing TikTok to rightwingbillionairesis a morbid symptom of democratic decline.“Authority is to be controlled by public opinion, not public opinion by authority,”saidthe US supreme court. That defines the first amendment: citizens, not the state, decide which ideas survive, with narrow limits likefraudordefamation. By presuming to define “truth”, Mr Trump subverts self-government. Hate rallies thrive in Trump’s America because,since 1969, speech is unprotected only if intended and likely to incite “imminent lawless action”.The US is a free-speech outlier. Other democracies accept broader, more collective trade‑offs to protect vulnerable groups, maintain public order and prevent incitement andharassment. Eachcountryis different but the bargain is similar. Speech is presumptively free, yet words are considered acts with foreseeable harms. Words can mobilise mobs, direct harassment and orchestrate violence. The point isn’t to shield anyone’s feelings, it’s to make coexistence possible.Mr Trump has inverted the American model. Rather than robust exchanges under neutral rules, he selectively rewards allies whiledegradingthe conditions of honest debate. All this while the infosphere is saturated with viral lies, making it easier to justifypunitive state action“to keep order”. That is how an emergency becomes a system.The answer is not the censor’s pen nor a free-for-all. It requiresresilientdemocratic plumbing; social mediaplatformsmade accountable for publishing harms; and properly defining dangerous conduct. The aim – particularly in the US – must be to preserve free expression as the bedrock of self-government while dismantling the machinery that warps attention toward outrage and partisan mobilisation. Mr Trump’s speech was disgraceful. When power learns to hate its opponents, democracy will fail.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Of course this is to some extent true for all governments. But it is particularly so for a Labour administration that made the revival of the NHS part of itscore pitch to voters.Such assessments of progress are all the more pressing in the context of Sir Keir Starmer’s increasingly beleaguered leadership. With Wes Streeting widely recognised to be among a handful of possible successors, colleagues and party members will be asking: has he delivered what they and voters hoped?In terms of frontline improvements, the answer is no, or not yet. After falling for six months in a row, hospital waiting lists in England recently rose slightly. And while ministers point to figures showing that the overallnumbers of GP and hospital appointments have increased, research reveals ongoingproblems with staffingandlow patient satisfaction. Although few people seem to have fully grasped this at the time, the £22.6bn boost in last year’s budget is being absorbed by inflation, higher national insurance contributions and pay rises – including the 22.3% awarded to resident doctors – restricting scope for spending elsewhere.The difficulties involved in the ambitious behind-the-scenes reorganisation that Mr Streeting initiated in the spring have also become clearer. The tight timetable for the 42 regional integrated care boards (ICBs) to reduce their running costs by 50% is in doubt, after bosses revealed that theycannot afford redundancy payouts. With half of NHS England’s 15,000 staff also due to lose their jobs, as the organisation is merged with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), it appears that ministers promised an Andrew Lansley-style shake-up before coming up with a plan to deliver it – and having previously ruled such a thing out.It is not hard to find experts who think that bringing NHS England and the DHSC closer together makes sense in principle, or who agree that a more limited role for ICBs could turn out to be preferable. But the fear of some of those who have observed successive waves of change in the NHS is that the government has, once again, underestimated the distracting and destabilising effect of a restructuring exercise. Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation thinktank, called it a“chainsaw approach”and compared the rapid turnover of health agencies in England to the situation in Germany, where an institute with a similar remit to the UK Health Security Agency has existed since 1891.Now, with the cost of redundancies likely to lead to further cuts, on top of the “financial reset” already underway (due to a projectedoverspend of £6.6bn), the risk is that ministers have created the conditions under which organisations turn inward – rather than mobilise to deliver what the public wants. A suggestion from the new local government secretary, Steve Reed, that the devolution bill could be amendedto give mayors new powers over hospitals, seems poorly timed given existing pressures – even if local control of public services is the right direction of travel in the end.The 10-year plan for England launched in July rightly recognised that the health system must adapt to meet thechallenges of the present and future. The worrying amount of attention being consumed by internal reorganisations is an unwelcome blast from the past.Explore more on these topicsNHSOpinionWes StreetingHealthGPsSocial careSteve ReededitorialsShareReuse this content"

It is unconscionable that any child should go to bed hungry – least of all in the world’s fifth largest economy.As the children’s commissioner wrote in her July 2025 report, “This report should not have to exist.” Nor, indeed, should this letter, nor Stephen Cottrell’s excoriating piece (I have seen the extent of child poverty in the UK and I say this: the two-child benefit cap must go, 1 September), nor Gordon Brown’s powerful warning (Nothing prepared me for the child poverty I see in Britain. November’s budget can and must halt its inexorable rise, 15 September). And yet here we are – still needing to remind our leaders that poverty blights childhood, shortens lives, and scars futures.In our clinics we see the consequences daily: babies failing to thrive because their parents cannot afford formula; school children too hungry to learn; teenagers weighed down by the stress of family poverty. These are preventable harms.The two-child benefit cap is a policy choice that keeps hundreds of thousands of children in poverty. It must go. The evidence is overwhelming – from theChild Poverty Action Groupto theBritish Medical Journal– that lifting the cap would be the single most effective step to reduce child poverty.We urge the government to act: introduce a modest tax on wealth, or other progressive measures, to fund this change. The archbishop of York has called for it. Gordon Brown has pleaded for it. We, as paediatricians, add our voices. Our children cannot wait.Guddi Singh and Geoff DebelleLondonYes, Bridget Phillipson, you are quite right to say that the two-child benefit limit is spiteful (Scrapping of two-child benefit cap closer as Bridget Phillipson attacks ‘spiteful’ policy, 19 September). It was when the previous government implemented it. And it still was when you, Bridget,voted to continue with it.None of us need to be told that children are not responsible for how many siblings they have, how much money their parents earn, or how any government decides to treat them. I am aLaboursupporter and voter all my adult life, and a member for some years, and this is the most cynical government I can remember. At least the government who passed it had a (from their point of view) commonsense reason for doing so. And now, when the prime minister and his senior advisers can see their support slipping across the country, this policy suddenly has to go?I am longing for the opportunity to vote in a different prime minister and deputy prime minister. Maybe then we will be able to have a real Labour government.Joan FriendOldham, Greater ManchesterThe neighbour, who, seeingBridget Phillipsonas a child playing outside in a jumper in the cold, “put money through the door in an envelope” to pay for a coat actually did it there and then.He didn’t, like Phillipson, wait over a year, then wake up one morning to suddenly realise, a bolt from the blue, that the two-child benefit cap policy was “spiteful” and had “punished and pushed children into hardship”. Phillipson should be thankful that her childhood neighbour was a Keynesian. So unlike Starmer, Rachel Reeves and Phillipson herself, he knew that he could afford what he could do.David MurrayWallington, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The vote also represents a startling turnaround in his own footballing arc, almost exactly 12 months on from being left out of the PSG squad to play Arsenal after a heated argument with his manager during a game at Rennes.A subsequent tactical switch by Luis Enrique, moving Dembélé into the centre, led to an explosion of 25 goals in 20 games from December to March, a run of form his manager put down to something his star attacker must have eaten over Christmas.Ballon d’Or 2025: Dembélé and Bonmatí claim top awards, England duo honoured – liveRead moreThe culmination of that six-month surge arrived with May’sannihilation of Interin the Champions League final, a match marked by the spectacle of Dembélé literally crouching like a sprinter to begin his forward press.It is a genuinely heartening comeback story for a likable, humble, prodigiously talented footballer, who was treated roughly at times at Barcelona as he struggled to adapt to the pressure of a hugely expensive move, but who saw off the darling of La Masia, Lamine Yamal, in the final vote here.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman won the Johan Cruyff award for top female coach.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAAt the podium Dembélé struggled to hold back tears several times as he thanked everyone from his home suburb to his agent, before finally inviting his mother on stage to share the moment of glory.Earlier on it had also been a night of flowers for English football as the women’s game swept the opening half of the ceremony. There were awards for England’s head coach, Sarina Wiegman, the England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and Arsenal as club of the year. Such wasthe degree of Anglo-dominanceat that point there were scattered boos from the Parisian crowd as Arsenal’s players went up to take their gong.Alessia Russo had been tipped to take the top individual women’s award. In the event the Ballon d’Or was won by Aitana Bonmatí for the third successive year, despite ending on the losing side to Russo in the finals of both the European Championshipand the Champions League. Russo came third behind her Arsenal teammate Mariona Caldentey.From early in the evening the venue had been crammed to the gods with gleamingly attired footballers, their glamorous hangers-on and the usual indeterminate men in flamboyant tuxedos. There was an early flush of excitement as the men’s Kopa trophy for best young player was won for the second year running by Lamine Yamal, present in a deliciously soft and shiny deep blue suit and immaculate bleach rinse.Quick GuideBallon d'Or 2025: all the big winnersShowBallon d'Or• Ousmane Dembéle (PSG/France)• Aitana Bonmatí (Barcelona/Spain)Kopa Trophy•Lamine Yamal (Barcelona/France)•Vicky López (Barça/Spain)Johan Cruyff Trophy• Luis Enrique (Paris Saint-Germain)• Sarina Wiegman (England)Yashin Award•Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG/Man City/Italy)•Hannah Hampton (Chelsea/England)Gerd Müller Trophy•Viktor Gyökeres (Sporting/Arsenal/Sweden)• Ewa Pajor (Barcelona/Poland)Club of the Year• PSG (men's team)• Arsenal (women's team)Socrates Award• Xana FoundationWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After which, the English arrived.

True to form the red carpet was a parade of courtiers, influencers, grifters, faces, mixed in with a very happy-looking Premier League champion manager, Arne Slot, his buffed and gleaming head startlingly luminous under the hard white lights.Above all, bringing the Ballon d’Or back to Paris is another moment of ascent for the PSG chair and most powerful person in European football, Nasser al-Khelaifi, who was also present early on to address his home audience, the first tell that Dembélé might just have won the men’s prize.Explore more on these topicsBallon d'OrAlessia RussoAitana BonmatíWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The 62-year-old corporate lawyer brought the energy, ideas and self-certainty that helped transformArsenalfrom drifting in the immediate post-Arsène Wenger years to sustained title challengers under Mikel Arteta. His perceived wisdom was less well received.“Tim has ideas and opinions on every subject and they are always right,” another club source said, with some sarcasm. “His absence will certainly be felt, although he may not be missed. He was very forceful. I never had a problem myself. It will be one less person speaking at meetings I suppose. Other big voices like Steve Parish and Todd Boehly may come to the fore.”Lewis was particularly forceful in urging the Premier League to strongly enforce its profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) and associated party transaction (APT) regulations, projecting Arsenal as leaders of the self-sufficient elite against state-funded clubs with theoretically unlimited means. This led to repeated clashes with executives from Manchester City and Newcastle, among others.Such simmering ill-feeling led to a minor diplomatic incident at the Etihad Stadium last September when Lewis left the directors’ box having apparently failed to shake hands with his hosts after City’s last-minute equaliser. Unsurprisingly, some City executives struggled to disguise their feelings of schadenfreude at Lewis’s absence, after an 18-year association with the Kroenke family,during Sunday’s visit to the Emirates Stadium.View image in fullscreenVinai Venkatesham (left) will represent Tottenham in Premier League meetings after the departure of Daniel Levy (right) from the club.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersAfter Lewis was appointed executive vice-chair two years ago, a move that triggered thedeparture of Arsenal’s chief executive at the time, Vinai Venkatesham, he became particularly vocal at Premier League meetings. In addition to taking a strong line on PSR and APTs he pushed successfully for rules limiting the amortisation period of players’ contracts to five years, in response to the new Chelsea ownership handing out eight-year deals, but was unable to persuade the requisite 14 clubs to close other perceived financial loopholes such as the sale of property assets to related companies.Levy pursued many of the same objectives by very different means, earning the grudging respect, rather than resentment, of others. Although he often drove the hardest of bargains as in his transfer negotiations, few of his peers knew what he was thinking until the time came for him to speak.“I doubt there’ll be much impact felt from Daniel’s absence at the meetings themselves,” one said. “He was very careful not to antagonise people and would say very little. He was always very polite, never aggressive. He preferred to do his lobbying in private, as he didn’t want people to know what he was up to.“The boardroom changes at Tottenham and Arsenal have got people talking, but I’d be surprised if it makes a substantive difference to the Premier League, as the instructions from the owners won’t change. Both clubs are run very prudently and I’m sure that will continue. They’ve both been big advocates of PSR and will vote for the new squad cost controls which are being proposed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lewis has gone 18 years after he first advised Stan Kroenke on the purchase of the family’s initial 9.99% stake in Arsenal.Richard Garlick has been promoted from managing director to chief executive as a result and will be the club’s main voice at Premier League level that, along with the return of Ventakesham, will delight the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters.Garlick was director of football at the league until being recruited by Venkatesham for Arsenal four years ago, the beginning of a rapid rise which has taken the Yorkshireman to the most senior role at the club. The pair share the league’s vision for a competition that pursues global growth underpinned by robust financial regulations and will be collegiate in how they go about it.The boardroom changes in north London add to the feeling of it being a more collaborative Premier League than has been the case in recent years, although the impending Manchester City verdict could blow the emerging consensus to smithereens.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurArsenalBusinessanalysisShareReuse this content"

He had a contract with Red Bull until 2030. The team’s parent company, as is normal in such cases, has not confirmed any figures.The announcement was made the day after Red Bull securedtheir second consecutive victoryunder Horner’s replacement, Laurent Mekies, at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.Horner led Red Bull from the relatively humble beginnings of what had been the Jaguar team to extraordinary success, with eight drivers’ and six constructors’ titles. But his final year and a half in charge was marked by controversy and a decline in the team’s form.At the start of 2024, accusations of inappropriate behaviour were made by an employee against Horner –he was cleared by an investigation– and caused no little unrest within the team. That was followed by the loss of a number of key personnel, including the enormously successful designer, Adrian Newey, the sporting director, Jonathan Wheatley, and the head of strategy, Will Courtenay.Although Max Verstappenwent on to win the title, their car was increasingly off the pace and there was open dissent against Horner fromVerstappen’s father, Jos, who had called for him to be removedamid a power struggle between the principal and Red Bull’s parent company.Fears that Verstappen might leave the team, with the car proving to be even further off the pace this season, are believed to have played a central part in Horner’s dismissal, which was orchestrated by Red Bull GmbH’s chief executive officer of corporate projects and investments, Oliver Mintzlaff.It is reported the agreement will allow Horner to return to work in F1 as early as next spring although Red Bull have not confirmed this.

However Alpine’s parent company, Renault, has repeatedly dismissed suggestions the team is for sale.“Leading Red Bull Racing has been an honour and privilege,” Horner’s statement read. “When we started in 2005, none of us could have imagined the journey ahead – the championships, the races, the people, the memories.

England, the host side, will face ­Canada in the final on Saturday at a long sold-out ­Twickenham and ­figures released on Monday showed more than 440,000 tickets have been sold for the competition.Twickenham stage set for England to deliver fairytale finish and lasting legacyRead more“That is 100,000 more than our original objective,” the tournament’s managing director, Sarah Massey said. “It is three times the number that was sold for the last Women’s Rugby World Cup. It is an extraordinary milestone that even surpasses our best expectations.”The competition has broken ­several attendance records with the final likely to follow suit with a landmark for a women’s rugby match when more than 80,000 are expected at the home of England rugby. The record stands at 58,498, set in the 2023 Six Nations match between England and France.However, fans showing up in stadiums is only one part of the picture with a peak of 3.1 million ­viewers watching England’s semi-final against France on BBC One.England saw off FranceandCanada knocked out New Zealand, the defending champions, in part thanks to their respective fast ruck speed as Canada and England completed 45% of their rucks in less than two seconds.The tournament director, Yvonne Nolan, said: “That is rapid. That is quicker than the average men’s Test rugby speed. It is a massive jump in ­standards and that is what we are seeing across this whole tournament. Back [in 2022], 11% of Canada’s rucks were that quick and 21% of England’s were.”The women’s 15s player of the year and breakthrough player nominees were named on Monday with the England centre Meg Jones up for player of the year alongside the Canada lock Sophie de Goede and the New Zealand back-row Jorja Miller.

There have been one or two key errors but we’re talking about 50 Premier League games, every one high octane. They are there to be enjoyed and right now referees are playing their part. Let’s hope that continues.Even one of the major talking points from the weekend was not a wrong decision in terms of the laws but a question of how to manage it. That is a reference to Darren England’s booking of Kiernan Dewsbury‑Hall for taking a quick free-kick in the Merseyside derby, a decision that apparently baffled Jack Grealish. It’s one that is worth looking at.Pep Guardiola is leading a strangely defensive new approach to the Premier LeagueRead moreWhat you find with free-kicks is that normally in the defensive third or the middle of the park, teams want to play. So the ball is put down and, provided it is not moving, away we go. In and around the penalty area with attacking free‑kicks, players want more ceremonial stuff. They want it stopped. They want to set the wall up. They want to be in the right position.As a referee, you would normally just say: “Do you want to go fast or slow?” And they’ll say: “No, we’ll wait for the whistle, ref.” So that’s it. You stop the game then. You’re in control of that situation. The ball’s placed, you put your spray down, you march the wall back 9.15 metres, remind everyone about using their arms so they don’t handball it and the players will want to take a free-kick on your whistle.At Anfield the free-kick in question for Everton was just inside the Liverpool half. England was setting everything up and making his way towards the penalty area. Then the free-kick was taken while he had his back to the ball and he cautioned Dewsbury‑Hall for unsporting behaviour.I don’t know what was said between the referee and the Everton players; he could have been telling them to wait for the whistle. But my view is that’s a situation you can manage. In that situation, I’m getting Everton to take the free-kick again. If you do that, you wouldn’t have too many complaints, would you?View image in fullscreenKiernan Dewsbury-Hall was booked for taking a free kick too quickly against Liverpool.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersWhat happened on the same afternoon at Fulham is testimony to the good start in terms of officiating. We saw some strong refereeing from Michael Oliver and a good video assistant referee intervention which led to an in-stadium announcement.Let’s start with the VAR intervention which led to Fulham having a goal overturned, after Rodrigo Muniz was adjudged to have fouled Nathan Collins in the buildup. It was a really good intervention because Oliver can’t see the action from his position. Before Muniz takes possession he flings an arm back. It’s not a violent act but he catches Collins in the face which draws blood. Then he spins away, turns and scores.After Jarred Gillett, the VAR, recommends a review, Oliver goes to the monitor and looks at it. Oliver quite clearly sees something he didn’t see in real time and disallows the goal. It’s a fair call because Muniz’s arm catches Collins and the defender can’t then challenge for the ball.Oliver then comes back on to the pitch and explains his decision to the crowd. They get to understand why a referee has done what they’ve done. We’re always looking for more communication – it’s really important – and the game has evolved to take it in. It is important that people understand the decision-making process. There’s nothing worse than leaving the ground and not knowing what has happened, so these announcements are a strong addition and a really good communication tool for spectators in the stadium and fans watching on TV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The situation occurs when King goes down in the box apparently under a challenge from Jordan Henderson. Simulation, in refereeing terms, is a decision that has to be taken very, very quickly and has multiple factors. Is the player avoiding contact? Is the player initiating contact? Is he exaggerating contact, or are they just throwing themselves to the ground in the hope of winning the penalty?King was already going to ground, then he made contact with Henderson and Oliver was in the right position to spot this: directly behind play on the edge of the area, with a clear view. If you’re a young referee and you’re learning your trade, the position of the referee in this instance is exactly the place you want to be. Oliver issues a yellow card to King for simulation because, while there is contact, King does try to deceive the referee into awarding a penalty. Oliver was quick, decisive and very positive.Chris Foy is a former Premier League referee and will be writing regular columns for the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsFootballRefereesLaws of footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Eyebrows had been raised by the way Manchester City approached the second half of theircommanding derby winlast week, sitting off, allowing United the ball and picking them off on the break. But their performance indrawing at Arsenal on Sundaywas on a different level entirely: just 33% possession, the lowest any Guardiola side has ever registered in a league game. By the end they had four central defenders, two holding midfielders and a full-back on the pitch.But even that doesn’t get to the heart of how strange this was. In the previous five seasons there have only been 10 occasions when City did not have more possession than their opponents in a Premier League game. Only once before in the Premier League has City’s possession under Guardiola dipped below 40% – when they registered 37% inbeating Arsenal 3-1 in February 2023, a decisive game in that season’s title race as it pulled City level on points with Arsenal at the top, although they had played a game more. That fixture, though, was an extreme version of the United game: City sitting deep, looking to strike on the break and, as it turned out, scoring twice in the final 20 minutes to seal their win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they ended that game in 2023 with more defenders than they had started, it was only because of the ill-starred experiment with using Bernardo Silva at left-back. It was not a full-on retreat into the bunker. Sunday’s game was, at least until the decisive moment of injury-time when City, bafflingly in the circumstances, were undone by a ball played in behind their defensive line. Perhaps it’s unreasonable to expect a team so used to playing on the front foot to be able immediately to man the barricades.There was an odd sense of the game mirroring the sides’ clash at the Etihad last season. On that occasion it was Arsenal, with a half-time lead, who retreated and looked to stifle the second-half before succumbing in injury-time. The major difference then was that Arsenal had been reduced to 10 men by the dismissal of Leandro Trossard just before the break. And even then there was a sense that their retreat had been so extreme that they had courted the equaliser they eventually conceded. Why, then, would Guardiola do it with a full 11? Was the memory of last season’s5-1 mauling at the Emiratesweighing so heavily on him?Guardiola is not a dogmatist. He has always evolved. But even by his standards Sunday was a radical departure. He insisted after that the approach had been forced on him by “one of the best teams in Europe” but, given no Guardiola side has ever played remotely like that before, does that meanArsenalare by far the best side he has ever faced? Or is it an admission that he does not trust this squad to play the possession football with which he is so associated?Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreWhen he has changed before – a full-back tucking in as an additional midfielder, fielding four central defenders, having John Stones step out – it has always been with the intention of establishing control, of creating the platform on which the carousel could turn. This, though, was about survival. And what made it all the odder was that in the first-half, it was the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta whoseemed a little over-cautious, favouring the functional over the players who could have tried to expose a City side who, impressive as they have looked against United and a Napoli reduced early to 10, have lost twice already in the league this season and were potentially vulnerable.Caution is back at the highest level of football. The progressive, pass-heavy style that has been hegemonic over the past 15–20 years is yielding to a more physical game centred on crosses, set plays and giving nothing away. Even Guardiola is moving on from the paradigm he did more than anybody else to establish. Yet on top of the table, five points clear,are Liverpool, who began the season by reducing the amount of cover they had in midfield. As Arsenal and City fret, Liverpool blithely get on with scoring more than the opposition.It’s true that looking shaky in two-goal leads and relying on late winners is not sustainable, and true also that Arsenal, having played Liverpool (away) and City, have probably had the tougher fixture list. But still, as all the likely top three make stylistic tweaks, Liverpool’s is an extremely healthy position as their new signings settle.The uncertain journey into a post-Pepist world goes on.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Sotogrande.’ From that to sitting at a Ryder Cup dinner, 19 years later is pretty cool.” Next stop, Bethpage.Lowry has told his close friend that he envies him, in the nicest possible sense. The 38-year-old looked on with smiles, but green eyes, asMcIlroy won the Masters– completing a career grand slam – and produced heroicsto win a second Irish Openthis month. “I said to him the other day, I am starting to get really jealous,” Lowry says. “I also said to him that I hope Irish people realise how lucky they are to have Rory at that level, coming back to play the Irish Open every year.‘My time in the sun’: Rory McIlroy on Ryder Cup hopes and Masters gloryRead more“He says: ‘Yeah, but how lucky are we to have that support?’ I was very jealous of the Masters, I was very jealous that Irish Open Sunday. I am happy for him, of course I am, but I want to achieve stuff myself.“I want it so badly. I want everything, I want to achieve it all. If I was to pack it all in now, would I be happy with what I have? I have had a pretty good career. But do I want more? Absolutely. That is the reason to get up in the morning.” McIlroy thinks Lowry can be overly hard on himself.Lowry laughs when contemplating any interviews where McIlroy is not a key topic for discussion. He jabbed back on the Saturday evening at Augusta, when his pal’s Green Jacket quest was a mistimed line of questioning. “I get it, I totally get it,” Lowry says. “But I have just come off the course. The last thing I want to do is talk about another player doing what I am trying to do the next day.” Which is fair enough.By 2007, Lowry and McIlroy were part of the Ireland side that triumphed in the European Amateur Team Championship at Western Gailes. Lowry, who beat Victor Dubuisson in the final, can reel off the others in that team without effort. Lowry and Ireland defended successfully in 2008.“All these guys were great players,” Lowry says. “I never thought I was better than any of them. Amateur golf in Ireland was really popular because of Rory. I learned a lot from that, even playing in front of decent crowds.“I had always looked at others as being better than me. That helped me. I wouldn’t say I played with a chip on my shoulder, but I played with that fear of not being good enough.”That sense still lingers despite Lowry sitting at the top of the game. “All the time,” he says. “You play with a fear of failure. The reason I get up and work every day is because I am afraid to fail. A fear of not being good enough. I don’t go to practise because I think I am good enough. I never play with loads of confidence.View image in fullscreenThe careers of Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry (right) have been linked closely and they enjoyed success for Europe in the 2023 Ryder Cup.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA“In that 2007 team, I was number four, five or six. I wasn’t even close to the top, I wasn’t part of any Walker Cup conversation. I took a lot of confidence from Western Gailes, went home and won the Irish Close Championship and started doing well abroad.“I don’t think I ever realised how good I was and I was still so young. Enter tournament, play, if I didn’t win I just moved on to the next week. Then I get an invite to Baltray in 2009 and bang, there you go.” Lowry won that Irish Open when still an amateur.McIlroy is the golden boy of European, never mind Irish, golf but glances through time link him intrinsically with Lowry. The pair diverged in 2007, when McIlroy made his Open debut and turned professional, but they return to the Ryder Cup arena this week as hugely influential members of Team Europe. They possibly have a point to prove together; at Whistling Straits in 2021,a comprehensive Friday defeatby Tony Finau and Harris English was a miserable experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You want to go and win. It’s the same as qualifying for the Masters; there’s no point doing that then missing the cut.”That lastRyder Cupon US territory wounded all in European colours. Lowry watched his compatriot and close friend Pádraig Harrington criticised heavily for his approach to captaincy. “Brutal,” is his assessment of what Harrington endured. “He has had such an amazing career, is such an amazing man, that it was harsh enough on him.”Ryder Cup home crowd could turn on USA team at Bethpage, claims Luke DonaldRead moreThe 38-year-old dismisses any notion of a Covid-affected away game hampering Europe in Wisconsin. “You don’t make excuses.

I wanted to right that wrong and even more so this time, going away again even though we are now a totally different team.”Lowry was married in New York. Any sense the Bethpage experience has him quaking in his shoes would be completely wrong. “We go there a couple of times a year. I am completely in love with New York, nothing but good experiences.“This is an opportunity. A lot of people dwell on negatives; how tough it will be, how bad the crowd might be. How amazing an opportunity do we have here? We could write ourselves in history. I havewon an Open, a Ryder Cup, my national open.

Tom Voyce, 43,died while trying to cross the River Alnin Northumberland in his Toyota Hilux in December, asStorm Darraghpassed through the UK. His body was found days later in deep water after a major search.An inquest at County Hall, Morpeth, Northumberland, was told that Mr Voyce had attended a shoot at his brother-in-law’s farm on 7 December last year, then spent the evening with him and two other men in the Queen’s Head pub in Glanton.Tom Voyce, former England rugby player, presumed dead after car swept awayRead moreCoroner Andrew Hetherington ruled the death was an accident and found that Mr Voyce had not taken his usual route home in the prevailing conditions that night. Hugh Wood, brother of Voyce’s widow Anna, told the hearing he last saw his brother-in-law at about 11.45pm in the bar. There had been a shoot with about 16 guests but it was hampered by the weather and people helped themselves to a bottle of port during the day, Mr Wood said.The event ended at 5.30pm when everyone was extremely wet. Mr Wood said they drank alcohol in the pub, but he observed no ill-effects in Mr Voyce that evening. Mr Wood said the storm left local roads waterlogged. Some parts were flooded and winds were gusting at 30mph that night.He estimated the distance to the Voyces’ home in Alnwick was about eight miles. Anna Voyce raised the alarm the next day when her husband failed to come home and Mr Wood said “it dawned on us to look in the fords and that’s where we came across his vehicle”.Pathologist Dr Clive Bloxham told the hearing that the cause of death was immersion in water. A diver found him on 12 December in two metres of water in a mill pond.Dr Bloxham said there were no signs of external or internal damage and that Mr Voyce was “a well-built, muscular man”. Toxicology tests showed no sign of drugs “but he did have a high blood alcohol level”, Dr Bloxham said.A reading of 215 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood was detected. The drink-drive limit is 80 milligrams. “This is over two-and-a-half, nearly three times that limit,” Dr Bloxham said. “Despite the possibility of tolerance to drinking alcohol, this level would be expected to have impaired his coordination and judgment. You would expect him to have a significant degree of intoxication with this level and impaired decision-making prior to his death.”Lisa Chisholm, publican at the Queen’s Head, said Voyce had a bar tab which he settled before leaving and she estimated he had drunk about four bottles of Magners cider, and bought drinks for other people. She said Mr Voyce, who was not a regular, was “good conversation” and stood at the end of the bar in good spirits.View image in fullscreenThe search operation at Abberwick ford on the River Aln near Alnwick, Northumberland, for former England rugby player Tom Voyce.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PADC Victoria Henderson, who led the police inquiry, said accident investigators found part of the Hilux’s number plate had broken off at the water’s edge, indicating the vehicle had approached Abberwick ford at speed. The car was in reverse gear which led to the belief that Mr Voyce may have tried to go back the way he came when the vehicle stalled in the water.It was subsequently damaged by repeatedly hitting a footbridge near the ford, before water levels dropped, allowing it under the bridge. She said it was unclear if Mr Voyce had tried to get out of the vehicle or if he had been swept away by the force of the water. She said that a ford warning road sign would have been visible, but the depth pole showing the height of the flood was submerged on the other side of the crossing.Mrs Voyce asked about the possibility of barriers being put in the ford to stop vehicles being washed away, as had happened at other local crossings, and the coroner said he will pass on the suggestion to Northumberland county council and Northumbria police.Mr Hetherington said flooding would have given the illusion that the road was flat when in reality the ford dropped 6ft. After his death, Mrs Voyce said in a statement: “Absolutely devastated and heartbroken doesn’t even describe how we feel.” The couple, who had a son, Oscar, moved to Northumberland where Mr Voyce set up a business, having previously worked in banking after he retired from rugby.Former teammates expressed their shock and sadnesswhen he went missing, including Matt Dawson andLawrence Dallaglio.Mr Voyce started his senior playing career at Bath, then spent six years with Wasps where he helped them win European and domestic titles, before leaving to join Gloucester in 2009. He won nine caps for England and made 220 Premiership appearances before retiring in May 2013.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Is there any more reason to question whether a horse is running on its merits than there was this time last month, or last year?The intimate association between racing and betting has inevitably meant that cheating and race-fixing have been perceived – and actual – threats to the sport’s integrity from its earliest days. Doping and favourite-nobbling, often on bookies’ orders, were rife in racing’s formative decades, and as recently as 1990,Dermot “Needleman” Browne’s 23-horse doping spreewas a bruising assault on racing’s reputation.The betting market is not always the motivation for cheating, asthe Mahmood al-Zarooni doping scandalat Godolphin’s Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket in 2013 proved. But everyone knows that certainty that a horse, and a fancied horse in particular, is not going to win will forever have a value for criminals and cheats.As a result, the BHA will always face the classic paradox of how to prove a negative whenever it reassures the betting public that British racing is clean and fair. And while its extensive dope-testing regime has turned up only a tiny handful of cases of deliberate doping, either to improve or impede performance, since the Zarooni case a dozen years ago, there will never be an easy test to detect conspiracies between individuals such as the one involved in the Hillsin case.What the Hillsin affair does demonstrate, however, is that conspiring to stop a horse is one thing, but getting away with it is another.There was plenty of focus in the aftermath of last week’s finding against Kitts and Higgins on some of the more lurid details that emerged during the hearing. The fact that the Burnley striker, Ashley Barnes, is Higgins’s son-in-law, had been warned off by the BHA after refusing to assist with the investigation, was widely highlighted. So too was Kitts’s decision to have “Hillsin” tattooed on his backside while on holiday a few weeks later.But while it took an age to get the case to a hearing, an important point to remember is that everything about Hillsin’s race at Worcester race had the strong whiff of a fix around it, from the gelding’s pre-race drift in the betting from 2-1 favourite overnight out to 11-1 at the off, to Kitts’s cringeworthy reluctance to even shake the reins as he sat motionless in a close third on the run to the line.The fact that Kitts, who had only recently returned from a 14-day ban for lack of effort in a race in May, was banned from riding and racecourses by the BHA two days later also strongly suggested that this was not just a case of a young conditional getting a hold-up ride horribly wrong.And so, eventually, it proved. Higgins told Kitts to stop the horse and the jockey agreed to do so, but while he achieved that primary aim, the manner in which he did so could hardly have been more embarrassingly obvious.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowLingfield  1.45 Master Vintner 2.15 Dors Delight 2.45 Portacloy 3.15 Indian Spirit 3.45 Panelli 4.15 Notimeforchitchat 4.45 Rift Valley (nap) 5.15 Jackson Street 5.45 AdaceBeverley  2.08 Adiada 2.38 Kody B 3.08 Beerwah 3.38 Democracy Dilemma 4.08 One Night Thunder 4.38 Charming Fellow 5.10 HibernateWarwick  2.28 Gone In Sixty 2.58 John Barbour 3.28 Beau Quali 3.58 Belle Montrose 4.30 Sail Away 5.00 Deep Purple 5.35 My Gift To YouSouthwell  4.25 Night Tara 4.55 Daizen 5.30 Luzon Heights (nb) 6.00 Celestias Comet 6.30 True Promise 7.00 American Bay 7.30 Star Of Mali 8.00 Road To Wembley 8.30 Aoife’s ThunderWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Penalties in the Hillsin case have yet to be decided, but Kitts’s career was effectively over as soon as he crossed the line in third two years ago, while Higgins, who refused to engage with the disciplinary process, is highly unlikely to ever be allowed back on to a racecourse.We can only wait and see what emerges from the Gambling Commission’s investigation into possible race-fixing. The Hillsin case, though, should serve as a lasting reminder to any rider facing the same choice as Kitts that it could be the last decision they make as a jockey.Explore more on these topicsBritish Horseracing AuthorityTalking HorsesHorse racingHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will make a decision to shoot down flying objects without discussion when they violate our territory and fly overPoland. There is no room for debate here.”On Friday, Estonia reported that three Russian MiG-31 jets had crossed into its airspace for 12 minutes before being forced to withdraw. The incident followed the entry of 20 Russian drones into Polish skies earlier this month, which Nato fighters shot down, and a separate Russian drone incursion into Romania.1:32Yvette Cooper says UK will confront Russian planes in Nato airspace – videoThe breaches have rattled Europe, particularly countries bordering Russia, fuelling fears that Moscow is testing Nato’s defence commitments.Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said: “Russia clearly feels it can act with impunity inUkraine, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the whole of eastern Europe.”He added: “Russia’s neighbours, not unreasonably, fear they could be next.”Estonia, which called for the emergency meeting, told the security council that its record of the jets’ incursion was “based on hard facts, based on solid evidence, whatever Russia is claiming”.Holding up a printout from the country’s air radar, Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, pointed to what he said was a clear “violation of Estonian territory and sovereignty”.He also displayed closeup photographs of the Russian jets, stressing that they were “carrying missiles and were combat-ready”.“The violation is crystal clear, and Russia is lying again, as it has lied before several times,” he said.Russia has rejected Estonia’s claims and has said it lacks evidence.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, told reporters on Monday: “We never heard in the Estonian statement that they have objective monitoring data to back up their claim. That is why we consider such words to be empty, unfounded and a continuation of a completely reckless pattern of escalating tensions and provoking a confrontational atmosphere.”But at the emergency UN session, the incursions drew widespread condemnation as reckless.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russia must urgently stop such dangerous behaviour.”He added: “Either Moscow wants to escalate and pull more countries into this conflict with Ukraine, or it doesn’t have full control of those who operate its fighter planes and drones. Either scenario is very disconcerting.”In Moscow, Vladimir Putin appeared to continue his recent overtures to Washington amid growing frustrations from Trump with the Russian president over faltering efforts to end the Ukraine war, as well as stalled talks between the US and Russia on other bilateral issues.“We want to avoid provoking a further strategic arms race,” Putin told his security council during a televised meeting.But he coupled the conciliatory note with combative language, saying that Russia was “capable of responding to any threats with military-technical measures”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaNatoEstoniaPolandUkraineUnited NationsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”However, Sinclair Broadcast Group, the largest owner of ABC stations in the US, said it still would not air the show on its 38 ABC affiliate stations.Sinclair, which ran a Kirk tribute in place of Jimmy Kimmel Live! last week and is known topromote conservative talking points, has previously stated that it will not allow Kimmel’s show back on its stations – including ABC in the Washington DC metro area – until he apologized to Kirk’s family, made a “meaningful personal donation” to them and to Kirk’s right-wing activist group Turning Point USA, and met with Sinclair representatives“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preemptingJimmy KimmelLive! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming,” Sinclair said in a statement Monday. “Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return.”The move comes after an extraordinary week that found late-night television in the political crosshairs. The tumult began last Monday, when Kimmel said during his monologue that “the Maga gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.The quote went viral – by Wednesday Brendan Carr, the FCC chair, threatened ABC’s affiliate licenses if Disney did not “take action” against the host. Disney suspended Kimmel indefinitely after the broadcast groups that own hundreds of affiliate stations, Nexstar – currently seeking merger approval from the FCC – and Sinclair, pre-empted the show.The suspension drew praise from Trump and Carr, who also threatened that he may be “looking into” The View, another ABC talk show critical of Trump. But it sparked condemnation from Hollywood talent, unions, media pundits, other talk show hosts and even Republican politicians like Ted Cruz, wholikenedCarr’s threats to that of a mob boss.“The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other – to disturb, even – is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people,” the Writers Guild of America wrote in a blistering statement. “It is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice.Earlier Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)releasedanopen lettercondemning Disney’s decision signed by over 400 Hollywood stars including Jennifer Aniston, Ben Affleck, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro.Though production of Kimmel’s show will resume as usual Tuesday, it remains unclear how available the broadcast will be.

But our greatest joy will come when there are no (political) prisoners in Egypt,” she added.“I strongly welcome the news that Alaa Abd el-Fattah has received a Presidential pardon,” British foreign minister Yvette Cooper said. “I’m grateful to President Sisi for this decision. We look forward to Alaa being able to return to the UK, to be reunited with his family.”Egypt’s National Council for Human Rights, a state-funded body, also welcomed the decision, saying it signalled a growing emphasis on swift justice.The UK prime minister,Keir Starmer, is known to have telephoned Sisi three times to lobby for Abd el-Fattah’s release. His national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also called for his release as did the former foreign secretary David Lammy. It appears a growing warmth in British-Egyptian official relations – including over how to handle the Palestine question – may have played a role in the president’s decision.Abd el-Fattah’s 69-year-old mother was admitted to hospital in London twice after going on hunger strikes to try to secure his release. The prominent activist and maths professor also held vigils outside the Foreign Office and Downing Street, saying she was prepared to die to achieve her son’s release.The campaign was also led by Abd el-Fattah’s two sisters, Mona and Sanaa, and other family members. They tried to keep a low profile once the possibility of his release became known, fearing that anything they might say could upset a delicate process. After hearing news of her brother’s impeding release, Mona issued a short tweet in Arabic saying: “My heart will explode.”Abd el-Fattah’s pardon was reported by al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egypt’s intelligence service. It said: “The Egyptian president issues a pardon for the remainder of the prison sentence for a number of convicted persons, after taking the constitutional and legal procedures in this regard. The pardon includes … Alaa Ahmed Seif El-Islam Abd el-Fattah.”The human rights council had recommended seven prisoners for release but its recommendations are not always followed.The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, said: “I am absolutely delighted to hear Alaa has received a pardon.“Laila, Mona, Sanaa and Alaa’s entire family’s tireless campaign for his release has been incredibly moving. Their love for him was clear when I met Sanaa last year. I am so glad they will get to see him come home.”Kerry Moscogiuri, the campaigns director at Amnesty International, said: “Alaa should never have endured this nightmare in the first place. Alaa and his family … have endured unimaginable pain by his groundless imprisonment.“Amnesty calls on the prime minister to urgently push for Alaa’s complete freedom and safe travel to the UK. This is an opportunity to begin a new chapter in which the UK government works more strategically and consistently on behalf of UK nationals arbitrarily held overseas.”A writer and supporter of the Arab spring, Abd el-Fattah has been in jail since 2019. In 2021, he was sentenced to five years but the authorities claimed the two years he spent in pre-trial detention did not count toward his sentence. He was convicted of spreading false news and harming Egypt’s national interest. A UN panel found the allegation stemmed from Abd el-Fattah sharing a Facebook post about the death of a prison inmate.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsEgyptHuman rightsMiddle East and north AfricaAbdel Fatah al-SisiKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The UN is also using AI as an aid to climate diplomacy.Butconcerns over the vast and increasing energy requirements of large datacentresmust prompt governments to act, said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change.‘Something is working’: UN climate chief optimistic about green transitionRead more“AI is not a ready-made solution, and it carries risks. But it can also be a gamechanger. So we now need to blunt its dangerous edges, sharpen its catalytic ones, and put it astutely to work,” he said. “If you run a major AI platform, power it with renewables, and innovate to drive energy efficiency.”He added: “Done properly, AI releases human capacity, not replaces it. Most important is its power to drive real-world outcomes: managing microgrids, mapping climate risk, guiding resilient planning.”Stiell gave an upbeat assessment of the state of global climate action, saying the world was “aligning with theParis agreement”, with renewable energy booming, and governments set to produce fresh commitments on cutting carbon.Speaking on Monday on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, where world leaders have gathered amid stark geopolitical tensions, conflict and economic strains, he made a robust defence of climate diplomacy, in the face ofoutright hostility from Donald Trump’s White House.“If we look past the noise, the facts show a world aligning with the Paris agreement,” he said. “Investment in renewables has increased tenfold in 10 years. The clean energy transition is booming across almost all major economies, and hit $2tn last year alone.”China hasled the global clean energy boom, but others – including the EU, India,African nations and Latin America – are also seeing widespread uptake of clean options. Investment has hit obstacles in the US, where Trump has ordered the dismantling of federal efforts to tackle the climate crisis, but many state governments and companies are continuing with their commitments.Companies are seeing economic opportunities in the shift to a low-carbon world, but more finance is still needed. According to research published on Monday by theIndustrial Transition Accelerator, of more than 700 low-carbon industrial installations in planning and development around the world, only 15 a year were gaining the finance necessary to go into full production. This represented a $1.6tn (£1.2tn) opportunity for investors, the group said.Citing the research, Stiell said: “We’re not waiting for miracles. The economics are on our side. Over 90% of new renewables cost less than the cheapest new fossil option. The technologies and solutions already exist.”But he said the benefits of therace to a low-carbon economywere not yet being felt “in living rooms”, though companies were seeing the difference. “This boom is uneven. Its vast benefits are not shared by all,” said Stiell.The impacts of the climate crisis were also accelerating, he added, so progress needed to be much faster. Governments are obliged, under the Paris agreement, to produce fresh national plans – known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs – on curbing greenhouse gases. They were due in February, but Stiell extended the deadline to this month ahead of thecrunch Cop30 climate summit in Brazil in November, where the next decade of climate action will be discussed.Many major economies – including the EU, China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia – have yet to formally submit their national plans. Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris agreement.Stiell, who in a recent interview with the Guardiancalled for more emphasis on the positive economic opportunities of the climate crisis, said: “Every Cop has its challenges. And there are always naysayers. But they are only the story if we make them the story.“Right now we need to reaffirm, sending a stronger, unmistakable signal: the world is still rock-solid behind Paris, and fully onboard for climate cooperation – because it works, and together we will make it work faster.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Climate crisisCop30Paris climate agreementUnited NationsShareReuse this content"

On the edge of theAmazon rainforest, it was where her story played out for five years, from enduring the Covid pandemic, to watching her two children get into the university.But in March everything changed. An eviction notice gave them and their neighbours 30 days to vacate their apartments. One by one, all 12 families were forced out. “It was very painful,” Freitas said.The reason, she was told, was that the building’s owner planned to convert all of the flats into short-term rentals for Cop30, the annual climate summit which is scheduled to take place in the Brazilian city in November.This year’s summit, which began with an idealistic dream that the world would come to see the climate crisis for themselves in the rainforest, is increasingly enmeshed in anger and recriminations over sky-high accommodation costs and accusations that poorer countries are being forced out of the meetings.Freitas’s story has become an all too common one in a city which, even before it was chosen to host the summit, was suffering a housing shortage and the country’ssecond-highest rental costs.“Cop30 was just the cherry on top,” said Priscilla Santos, the co-founder of theRede Amazônidas pelo Climathinktank. She credits the big real estate companies that operate in the city with triggering the lodging crisis.“They immediately moved to secure exclusive deals with high-end property owners and promised to rent them out to foreigners at outrageous prices,” she said.Local government picked up the idea and Cop30 was presented as a money-making opportunity onsocial mediaand beyond.Promotional materialfound by the Guardian encouraged local people to “take advantage of this great opportunity to earn even more”.View image in fullscreenThe Belém skyline seen from a river boat.Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/APLured by the prospect of once-in-a-lifetime profits, landlords soon started favouring short-term rentals for Cop30 at the expense of the city’s residents.Freitas’s husband, who is an Uber driver, spent the 30 days after their eviction notice scanning the streets for rental listings. Each time the conversations were the same: “Is it for Cop? No? Then we’re not renting to you.”It was clear from the beginning that Belém would not haveenough hotel roomsfor the 50,000-odd people expected to attend the summit, so resorting to private homes was always a condition for the event to happen. But the way it has played out has in some cases been unfortunate.Giovana Silva* moved with her husband to a three-bedroom house with a back yard in February 2024, when the couple decided to start a family.A year into the three-year fixed-rate lease, however, the landlord approached them. In exchange for agreeing to vacate the house in November, Silva and her husband were offered about a tenth of the landlord’s expected profits from Cop30 rentals.The verbal agreement included some remodelling of the property, which was supposed to last a week. Instead, it dragged on for almost three months. “The worst part was being confined to our bedroom, the only part of the house that remained undisturbed,” Silva said.Silva is pregnant and it pains her to think of what’s to come: stripping the house of anything remotely personal, moving in with the in-laws for a month, and not knowing how the guests will treat her home or what it will look like when she returns. “It’s much too little money for such a heavy burden,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To them the coverage seems colonial and stereotypical. Despite all the challenges, they are adamant that they want to host the summit, which Santos says is more than a symbolic choice.“We need people to come here and see the Amazon for what it really is, beyond exotified or romanticised notions,” she said.The event has already created a ripple effect. “Everyday people have started to perceive themselves as being affected by the climate crisis. This discussion, once niche, has now become commonplace,” Santos said.“The lady who cleans my house, who months ago confused Cop with the football World Cup [Copa, in Brazilian Portuguese], not only recognises the international importance of the event, but she now understands what climate change is and how it affects her life,” said the lawyer Ieda Andrade.Andrade foundedConexão Cop30, an accommodation micro-platform that connects hosts and guests by word of mouth. Like hers, a number of others emerged in recent months – including a Christian-led community-based accommodationplatform– as locals strive to offer affordable alternatives to Cop attenders.“The Belenense are a welcoming people and we are making a genuine, heartfelt effort to accommodate everyone who wishes to come,” said Santos.With the help of a lawyer, Freitas managed to get an extra 30 days to vacate her apartment. After two months her family finally secured a new place to live – one that is more expensive, less connected and much farther from her mother’s new address.That’s home for now. But whether it will remain so once the summit is over is yet to be seen. “With the construction and renovations all over town, we hope to have more and better options,” Freitas said.Regardless of what the future holds, she insists on clarifying that she is not at all against Cop30. “We want to be a part of this discussion,” she said.* Name changed at interviewee’s requestExplore more on these topicsCop30BrazilAmericasClimate crisisAmazon rainforestnewsShareReuse this content"

The earthquake was strong and long, loud noises and objects falling from shelves. Residents could be heard shouting. Many people reported lying awake waiting for aftershocks.Online, too, residents reported feeling their homes shake. Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) posted on X that trains were running at reduced speeds as it completed safety track inspections.

The Canadian company, part-owned by China’s Anta Group, had partnered with a Chinese artist, Cai Guo-Qiang, who oversaw similar shows for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.The organisers said the display used biodegradable, environmentally friendly materials, that all stock herds had been relocated and wildlife had been coaxed away with salt bricks. It said the project had passed tests in line with those set by the2022 Beijing Winter Olympicsand abided by pollution management standards equivalent to those in Japan and Europe.But videos of the display posted online by the brand were met with a barrage of criticism, accusing the brand of acting against its environmentally aware image and calling for boycotts.“Imagine selling $800 jackets for mountain lovers, then nuking the mountains,” said one commenter on Instagram. “The global climate is already getting worse, and these damn people really don’t leave any way for wild animals and plants to survive,” said a Weibo user.On Sunday, Arc-teryx and Cai issued apologies for the event, with the company saying the display “was out of line with Arc’teryx’s values”.“The event was in direct opposition to our commitment to outdoor spaces, who we are and who we want to be for our people and our community,” it said on its officialInstagram page, adding that it was “addressing this directly with the local artist involved and our team in China”.“The public’s criticism has alerted us that the evaluation of the expression of art needs to be more professional and we need to be more humble and respectful of nature,” it said.Cai posted his “sincere apologies”, telling his Weibo followers that there were “many oversights on our part” and pledging to help with any cleanup work needed.The Tibetan plateau and its mountains are sacred to Tibetan Buddhists. The region has been tightly controlled since it was annexed by China in the 1950s and authorities strictly limit the activities of ethnic Tibetans. In recent years the region has become a popular tourist destination for travellers from other parts of China, leading to concerns about environmental damage and overcommercialisation.Trump’s reported pause on Taiwan weapons aid sparks fears he is using island for China trade dealRead moreA county environmental bureau official told local media on Saturday that the event had been given prior approval after government meetings and was compliant. He said no environmental assessment was required because the materials were environmentally friendly. “For now, the local ecology does not appear to be damaged,” he added.However, after the backlash, the Shigatse government and Communist party branch launched an investigation.On Monday, the China Advertising Association said it was “disappointed” in Arc’teryx for not having “explored more positive marketing strategies”.“The display, under the guise of ‘respecting nature’, potentially harmed the environment, ultimately eroding years of trust,” it said in a statement.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaTibetAsia PacificRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

When asked if it should haver been followed up Rymer replied: “Perhaps.”“I understand that an email was received, no action as such was taken. My understanding is that information was received and wasn’t followed up on.“I do understand whoever received that did nothing. Having looked at this now I may well have asked the team to make further inquiries but this didn’t happen. At the time the team didn’t take any further action.”He added that Home Office caseworkers did not have access to all the information about Farruku and that it could not be the case that any concern raised would lead to someone not being taken to the barge.“The barge was not a place that was not suitable to accommodate someone with mental health conditions,” said Rymer.The inquest continues.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

We have advised the Duchess of York of this decision and thank her for her past support.”The founders of the food allergy charity The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation also dropped Ferguson as a patron, saying they were “disturbed” to read the comments. Prevent Breast Cancer and The Children’s Literacy Charity also said they had cut ties with the duchess, who had been a patron of both charities.Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, the founders of The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, said: “We were disturbed to read of Sarah, Duchess of York’s, correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein.“Sarah Ferguson has not been actively involved with the charity for some years. She was a patron but, in the light of the recent revelations, we have taken the decision that it would be inappropriate for her to continue to be associated with the charity. We would like to thank her for her kindness and support in the past.”The Sun reported that the duchess had “humbly apologised” to Epstein for linking him to paedophilia in the media, and described him as “steadfast” and “generous”. Her spokesperson said it was sent “in the context of advice the duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats”.The email stemmed from an interview with the Evening Standard on 7 March 2011, in which Ferguson apologised for accepting £15,000 from the sex offender. “I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. I am just so contrite I cannot say,” she had told the paper. “Whenever I can, I will repay the money and have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.”But, a little more than a month later, the duchess sent the message to Epstein. In it, she said: “I know you feel hellaciously let down by me. And I must humbly apologise to you and your heart for that. You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family.”She continued: “I was advised in no uncertain terms, to have nothing to do with you and to not speak or email you. And, if I did, I would cause more problems to you, the duke and myself. I was broken and lost. So please understand. I didn’t want to hurt Andrew one more time. I was in overriding fear. I am sorry.”The duchess’s spokesperson previously said Ferguson had spoken of her regret about her association with Epstein and “does not resile” from condemning him publicly.Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan, in the US, in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.Explore more on these topicsSarah FergusonJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

But Kyle has since promised there will be no backsliding on the legislation.Phillipson said: “As deputy leader I would personally grab the employment rights reform that Angela long pushed for to ensure it is enacted in full and not watered down. No ifs or buts. I will work with every single trade union rep in our country to ensure this crucial legislation sees the light of day to deliver change for working people. From no more exploitative zero-hours contracts to securing day one rights and fair pay for a fair day’s work.“I’m used to standing up to vested interests. I took on the private school lobby to end their tax breaks and deliver an education system that works for everyone. I’ll be as strong a champion for working people. I will be the unions’ champion for employment rights reform at the cabinet table, like Angela was. We simply cannot let it fall down the agenda. I want a strong mandate from members and unions to push every day to secure this vital reform for workers.”Chris Kitchen, the NUM general secretary, backed her pledge and said: “Bridget stands with workers. Her pledge today to drive forward the employment rights bill and be a voice for unions at the cabinet table further underlines why we believe she is the right choice for deputy leader. As a united Labour party, governing and campaigning with Labour values, we can transform workers’ rights in this country.”The bill includes a ban on “exploitative” zero-hours contracts, ending most instances of fire-and-rehire, day one protection from unfair dismissal, and protection for workers from harassment.Joanne Thomas, the general secretary of the Usdaw union, said: “We need a strong voice around the cabinet table with their own personal mandate from unions and workers to deliver this legislation. We are reassured that Bridget has said she will personally grab the mantle from Angela Rayner to drive greater fairness and security into workplaces across this country.”Alasdair McDiarmid, the Community assistant general secretary, said: “Bridget has shown time and time again as education secretary that she respects and values trade unions, working closely and constructively with union partners in that role. This is a clear and unwavering commitment to delivering the ERB in full. We need a champion who will push for these changes at the heart of government.”Explore more on these topicsBridget PhillipsonLabour party leadershipLabourTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Burrows – whoseUUP profilecalls him a champion against those facing injustice – told the Stormont assembly that Bailey had been “incarcerated for life”.He made the announcement on Monday that the dog was out. “The full circumstances of Bailey leaving prison will have to be examined,” he said. “There’s going to be an effort I hope made to try and find Bailey a permanent home to live in. This has been a disgraceful episode from start to finish.”Burrows said prison officers lacked dog-handling training and that Bailey had lacked a primary handler and an opportunity to “recuperate” in a domestic setting.View image in fullscreenMagilligan prison, where Bailey was a support dog.Photograph: Ireland/AlamyA prison service spokesperson there had been no neglect and that a threat from outside the prison, relayed by police, had prompted Bailey’s transfer.“A perfectly happy and well-looked-after dog at Magilligan prison has had to be moved after the PSNI made us aware of a callous and calculated external threat to say that Bailey was going to be harmed in an attempt to embarrass the governor,” they said.Bailey had been safe and cared-for when inside Magilligan and was safe and cared-for now, said the spokesperson. “The benefits of dogs providing emotional support is widely recognised. In prison environments dogs can offer support to people with poor mental health and addiction issues, help promote positive changes in behaviour and reduce stress and anxiety.”The spokesperson said “inaccurate and sensationalist reporting” of the case had caused the prison service “unnecessary distraction”.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandPrisons and probationAnimal welfareDogsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned on Monday: “We must destroy the axis of evil Iran and we have the power to do so. This is what lies ahead of us in the coming year, a year that could be a historic one for Israel’s security.”Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the window for reaching an agreement with Iran was limited, adding it was hard to predict if the snapback of the UN sanctions lifted when Iran reached a nuclear deal in 2015 will take place this weekend. With the deadline so close the risk of diplomatic miscalculation is high.Abbas Araghchi is also likely to meet European foreign ministers on Tuesday.He warned: “They have tested Iran repeatedly and know we do not respond to the language of pressure and threat. I hope we can find a diplomatic solution in the coming days, otherwise Tehran will take appropriate measures.”Some in Iran have said the latest crisis, and the threat of a return to a more prolonged war between Israel and Iran, is so severe that Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, should try to meet the Donald Trump to break the deadlock in New York.It would be the first meeting between a US president and an Iranian president since the 1979 revolution in Iran. Pezeshkian spoke with the Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, before leaving Tehran for New York.The deadline for the reimposition of six sets of suspended UN sanctions is Saturday night, when the last chance for the UK, France and Germany to defer sanctions for as long as six months or a year expires. If the three European powers reimpose sanctions, they could not be lifted in future without the US agreeing not to use its veto. Iran has warned the reimposition of UN sanctions would see the end of Iranian cooperation with the nuclear inspectorate.Araghchi’s meeting with the director general of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, will set the tone for Iran’s diplomacy this weeksince the lack of Iranian cooperationwith the agency lies at the heart of the European’s threat to use their power to reimpose the UN sanctions. Grossi admitted the position was very difficult but said he hoped “we are on the way to get more cooperation”, and that would require more time for diplomacy.The European countries’ three key demands are that Iran restart full cooperation with the IAEA, including allowing IAEA inspectors to visit Iran’s bombed nuclear sites, provide a full explanation of the whereabouts of its previous 400kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium – and, finally, commit to reopen the talks with the US on the future of its nuclear programme that were broken off when Israel started to bomb Iran’s leadership and nuclear sites on 12 June.Iran has been trying to extract a US commitment that no further attacks on its nuclear sites will be made by Israel.At a meeting with the IAEA in Cairo on 9 September, Iran came to an agreement that it would report on the highly enriched uranium stockpile within 28 days. But the proposed agreement, from the European perspective, did not contain enough tangible commitments about IAEA accessing Iran’s bombed nuclear sites, or what would happen to the stockpile.Since then, Iran has suggested that once the stockpile is located its purity could be reduced from 60% to 20%, making the stockpile less useable for a nuclear bomb.Iranian diplomats are under huge conflicting domestic pressure, with rival factions waging a ceaseless political battle over the country’s approach to the west, the flaws in the original nuclear deal signed in 2015, and the need to act to get western sanctions lifted. Araghchi has insisted the foreign ministry has the authority to negotiate on behalf of Iran.The Tehran stock market has reacted very negatively to the threat of sanctions, causing a further depreciation of the rial, a trend that undermines the claims the reimposition of UN sanctions will not have great impact on the already heavily sanctioned economy.In an attempt to crank up the domestic pressure, a group of more than 70 Iranian parliamentarians released a call for Iran to abandon its opposition to possessing a nuclear weapon.Ahmad Aryaeinejad, the representative of Malayer in the parliament, referring to the letter of 71 parliament members for building nuclear weapons, said: “Why should most global powers have nuclear weapons, but the Islamic Republic must remain without this weapon? Why everyone yes, us no? We too must build nuclear weapons.”He continued: “If we have an atomic bomb, even if we don’t use it, our enemies will no longer imagine that they can harm us and do whatever they want.”Explore more on these topicsIranUnited NationsNuclear weaponsInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)Middle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She wrote on social media: “My heart is whole again … Oh how I can’t wait to have my dear daughter in MY arms.”The IUD scandal and the “parenting competence” tests have shone a spotlight in recent years on Denmark’s current and historical treatment of Greenland, which remains part of the Danish commonwealth after ceasing to be a colony in 1953.It is believed that 4,500 women and girls, some of them as young as 12 at the time, were fitted with IUDs without their knowledge or consent between 1966 and 1970 by Danish doctors in an apparent attempt to reduce the population of Greenland.Greenland’s former prime minister Múte B Egede has described Denmark’s actions as “genocide”.Frederiksen’s announcement – her most concrete remarks yet on reparations – comes amid intense international pressure, particularly from the US, which has repeatedly threatened to acquire the Arctic territory since Donald Trump took office. Denmark formallyapologised for the scandalin August.The prime minister said she would discuss the plan for the fund with her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, in Nuuk on Wednesday.“On behalf of Denmark, I have apologised to the women affected in the IUD case and for the failures for which Denmark is otherwise responsible, where Greenlanders have been systematically treated differently and inferiorly than other citizens of the kingdom,” she said.“I look forward to the opportunity to mark the official apology in Nuuk together with the president of the Greenlandic parliament. We cannot change what has happened, but we can take responsibility and we can create the conditions for reconciliation with the past.”Victims of the scandal welcomed the announcement. Bula Larsen, who is among the 143 women who sued the Danish state for 45m Danish kroner for what they describe as a violation of their human rights, said she was still awaiting news of their case but that the latest announcement was a sign of progress. “It seems like that Denmark is willing to make an effort to acknowledge that the state has violated our human rights,” she told the Guardian.The chilling policy to cut Greenland’s high birth rate – podcastRead moreAviaja Fontain, whose mother, Hedvig Frederiksen, was fitted with an IUD at the age of 14 without her knowledge, said the announcement made her feel as if “they finally won”.She said: “After three years of fighting, hearing that she is making a fund feels like she is acknowledging that they crossed our human rights. And because the Danish government is finally acknowledging what they did, it is making my scar smaller. But my scar will never heal because we will carry this scar for the rest of our lives.”Naaja H Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for justice and gender equality, said the announcement should have come sooner. “The problem with proposing this in the 11th hour before the apology is that it risks being viewed as calculated instead of sincere and remorseful,” she said.Campaigners against “parenting competence” (FKU) tests also welcomed the decision by the appeals board to reunite Brønlund with her daughter.Høje-Taastrup, the municipality that had put Brønlund’s daughter into care on the basis of the testsdespite them being bannedon people with Greenlandic backgrounds, did not name Brønlund. But it said the board had informed the municipality that it had decided to reverse its decision on “a much-publicised case” and had informed them to implement its decision.Anya Krogh Manghezi, the municipality’s director of children and youth, said: “We have been looking forward to receiving clarification, and we will of course take note of the decision of the Danish social appeals board and act immediately accordingly. Even though the case has received a lot of attention and the media has reported many details, we are still bound by confidentiality, so we cannot go into more detail about what is happening in the case. Only that we will continue to support the young child and the family.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It felt like the world had gone a bit mad, that we lost a moral compass, that a layer of humanity was being stripped away by what was happening here.”Tennant is one of more than 1,600 people who has settled out of court with the publishers of the now defunct News of the World over the phone-hacking scandal, which closed Britain’s biggest-selling Sunday newspaper and shone a light on the cosy relationships between some parts of the media, government and police in the UK. He is cautious when talking about his experience. “I get very confused as to what I am legally allowed to talk about,” he admits.View image in fullscreenWhistleblower … Tennant plays journalist Nick Davies.Photograph: ITVIt was all quite some time ago, too. The drip-drip of stories in the Guardian about illegal news gathering by Rupert Murdoch’s tabloid; the collapse of the “rogue reporter” defence that sought to pin the blame for wrongdoing on the News of the World’s royal editor, Clive Goodman; the public revulsion about the hacking of the phone of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler; the trial of Rebekah Brooks (cleared and still head of Murdoch’s papers in the UK) and Andy Coulson (jailed after being forced to resign as both editor of the News of the World and, later, as David Cameron’s spin chief).The News of the World closed in 2011, with Murdoch apologising to a parliamentary committee – “the most humble day of my life”, the media mogul said. The Crown Prosecution Service shuttered its investigation in 2015 and Tennant received his apology and payout three years later. An old story, then.And yet it isn’t, say Tennant and Jack Thorne, the scriptwriter who, along with Stephen Graham, won an Emmy last week for the Netflix hitAdolescence.View image in fullscreen‘We’re in a world where so much harm is happening and it’s our job to engage’ … screenwriter Jack Thorne.Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images for BFITennant and Thorne are talking via video-call (Tennant is filming the second season of Rivals “in the middle of a field, God knows where”) to promote The Hack, their new ITV drama series.It follows the saga through the eyes of Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter who pursued the story and Dave Cook, the police detective who investigated the axe murder of the private investigatorDaniel Morgan. Figures associated with the News of the World were allegedly involved in attempts to interfere in the police investigation. Tennant plays Davies and Robert Carlyle, best known for playing Begbie in Trainspotting, takes on the role of Det Ch Supt Cook.Thorne, 46, says he did not initially think there was something interesting to be told about “a group of journalists behaving badly that got found out”.It was only as he read into it more that Thorne realised it was “something that involved a lot more groups of people, at least after it came out”.“How that worked, in terms of that relationship between politics, the police and the media, is really, really interesting,” he says. “And that thing of celebrating journalism that was brave enough to stand up to its own industry – which is not something I’d be capable of in my industry – was fascinating to me.”View image in fullscreenRichard Pepple as DI Graham Twyler in The Hack.Photograph: ITVHe adds: “It’s not about these powerful bodies – the press, the police and politics – conspiring together. I think there was a complacency, more than that.“There was a complacency in the journalism, and then there was a complacency in the way those other bodies looked at that journalism.“They said, ‘OK, this is how much we understand, and this is how much we choose to understand. And, because we’ve got our own things going on, we’re going to keep on that path’.”The scandal is key to understanding how we ended up where we are today, he says. It was a kind of “destruction of journalism” – or, at least, the model in which the so-called legacy media were able to assume a certain level of trust among the public.It is also an unfinished story, say Thorne and Tennant.The fallout led to a public inquiry chaired by Sir Brian Leveson that looked at the culture, practices and ethics of the British press.There was supposed to be a second part that would have examined the relationship between journalists and the police, including criminality and corruption. The Conservative government stopped it in its tracks. Keir Starmer appears equally uninterested.“We only heard half of it,” says Thorne. “And Leveson should have been given the ability to go back in and look at criminality in particular, which could have led to a whole number of different conclusions, which would have maybe changed the media landscape for the better.”Tennant, 54, adds: “I don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t still happen. I think it was inconvenient. I think the first one cost five and a half million, which is a lot of money, but it’s the sort of money they bat around quite freely in other circumstances.“So I don’t think that’s a convincing or compelling argument to why it didn’t happen. I don’t know what pressure was exerted where, but I certainly feel that the government, at the time, felt it was inconvenient, and that was a tragedy. I don’t know why the government now is continuing to ignore it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tennant agrees.View image in fullscreenFamiliar face … Toby Jones as Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ITVThe drama makes much of the fears of the victims of phone hacking to put their heads above the parapet and challenge the News of the World.Tennant says it was not a difficult decision for him to get involved in the dramatisation of a most acutely painful period for Murdoch and his chief lieutenants.“Maybe I was foolhardy, and maybe I’ll come to regret that, but I think we’re being very fair,” says Tennant, who has been criticised in the pages of the Sun for some of his comments in support of the rights of people in the transgender community. “We’re being pretty objective, I think. It’s been told from Nick’s point of view, and clearly Nick had a particular agenda, but neither do we paint Nick as someone who got it all right, necessarily.”He adds: “I just knew I wanted to tell the story. It wasn’t something that I spent a lot of time worrying about.”As a victim of hacking, Tennant believes he was ideally placed to empathise with Davies’s disbelief that the authorities, and the rest of the British media colloquially known as Fleet Street, were willing to turn a blind eye to what was going on.“I felt it was very easy to plug into that sense of moral bewilderment over what is happening, and that people are getting away with this,” says Tennant. “And indeed, you know, Nick’s tenacity that he stuck with this story, while the rest of the world couldn’t seem to get annoyed.“His sense of moral outrage was so great, and he knew that this was awful, and yet the rest of the world didn’t seem to catch up.“It’s an oversimplification but also a truth to say that it took the gross violation of Milly Dowler’s phone to really make the world suddenly go, ‘Oh, hang on. This is an awful thing to do to people. This is stealing people’s privacy. This is awful and wrong. And hang on a minute. We should have been shouting about this earlier.’”The real events behind The Hack: a timeline of scandal, cover-ups and collapseRead moreBoth Thorne and Tennant are big consumers of news. Tennant, an occasional buyer of a physical newspaper, says he tries to start the day with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Both men pay subscriptions to news websites.Thorne says he finds it “immensely troubling” that truth is now so contested in Britain. He describes it as a “refusal of fact”.“My dad has bought a copy of the Guardian every day since 1962 so he’s a die hard,” says Thorne. “I’m a subscriber to the Times, Telegraph, Guardian. I try to consume it from all sorts of different angles, because I think that’s part of my job, right? There’s a bit of a movement against news and saying, ‘It’s a little bit too depressing … I don’t engage because it gets me too upset.’ And I go, ‘You’re a powerful person. How dare you?’ We’re in a world where so much harm is happening, and it’s our job to engage.”The Hackstarts Wednesday at 9pm on ITV1 with the full box set on ITVX.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDavid TennantToby JonesJack ThornePhone hackingNational newspapersPress intrusionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’d had one of the biggest records in the world – Never Gonna Give You Up with Rick Astley. Rick’s manager rang and said: would I like to go for lunch with Granada TV? We had a very pleasant lunch with David Liddiment, head of light entertainment, but I didn’t really understand why he wanted to meet me.Night-time television was relatively new. I’d seen a few things, but thought: “Who’d want to watch Elvis Costello talking about Irish politics at 1am when you’ve been for a curry and 10 pints?” I said: “What you should do is take a film crew to a nightclub.” David said: “Could you do that?” I said: “Sure.” I’d grown up watching Ready Steady Go! I knew I needed a co-presenter. I’d seen Michaela Strachan because my kids watchedWide Awake Club. When I was introduced to her, I thought: “She’s bubbly. She’d be great.”I twisted my ankle and the physio said, 'You can't walk.' I said, “Not only have I got to walk, I’ve got to dance!”Although the idea was to go out live from real nightclubs in the middle of the night, for some reason we did a pilot at 2pm on a Saturday at Mr Smith’s in Warrington. The dancers made the turntables jump. The cameramen wanted the lights up full and complained it was too loud. Michaela and I had no idea what the other was saying. To say it was a disaster is an understatement. The worst thing you can try to do is create two hours of nightclub entertainment on a Saturday afternoon where nobody’s had a drink. How David ever commissioned a series based on this pilot, I still don’t know.When the series went out for real, we were beamed live at 1am via satellite. But Granada decided it was too expensive, so we’d tape it, the tapes would be biked back to Granada, and it would be broadcast an hour later. At one point it was so cold driving over the Peak District, the tapes had to be thawed out with a hairdryer. The audience were just regular punters. We’d say: “If you’re here with somebody else’s wife, stand apart.” The police watched to find criminals who’d jumped bail and would turn up and arrest them. It was chaotic.Some sections were so outrageous we got warned by the authorities: people drinking custard out of condoms at 1am was not acceptable. But we didn’t dream this up. This was what was happening in nightclubs up and down the country. There were downsides. Driving home at 3am in my bright red Porsche, I got so fed up with being stopped by the police, I bought a Land Rover on the grounds it would never do more than 70mph. Bugger me, the next Saturday night, they pulled me over at 3am and went: “We’ve just been watching you on television.”View image in fullscreenThe Hitman and Her visit the Discotheque Royale in Manchester.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockMichaela Strachan, presenterI was doing the Wide Awake Club on Saturday mornings and a show called Michaela on Sundays singing The Wheels on the Bus for preschoolers. I hadn’t asked TV-am if it was OK for me to present this late night adult music show in case it got in the way of me presenting children’s TV – I doubt these days you’d be allowed to do both – and hadn’t signed the contract. They called it The Hitman and Her in case they’d had to replace me with another her.I twisted my ankle just before the pilot. The physio said: “There’s no way you’re going to be walking.” I said: “Not only have I got to walk, I’ve got to dance.” No wonder Pete seemed so stressed. We were given a run of six weeks that lasted four years. It was hugely successful. The viewing figures got up to 1.3m. I’m astonished how many people still say: “I remember you from The Hitman and Her.” I think: “Who were all these people watching at 2am?”Timmy Mallett and Michaela Strachan: how we made Wide Awake ClubRead moreMuch of it we would not get away with now, like Clothes Swap, where people would swap clothes behind a sheet and we’d drop the sheet on purpose. Get Your Gums Around These Plums was bobbing for apples in custard. There was a suggestion of a game where the bloke was blindfolded and had to feel different girls to see if he could guess which one was his girlfriend. Thank God one of the female researchers said: “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”I quickly learned to look after myself, otherwise you’d get your bum pinched. Even the dynamic of Pete and me was quirky. He gave me the most backhanded compliment. He said: “Do you know why you work on this show? It’s because you’re attractive, but not attractive enough to make other women hate you.” In other words: you’ve got enough of the girl next door for people to think that you are their friend rather than a threat.People say: “You should bring it back.” It was a lot of fun and has become iconic but some of it was incredibly tacky. Let’s not bring it back and analyse it in today’s world because I don’t think it would be so fondly remembered.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It nearly didn’t.BeforeDavid Fincherreceived a draft of Andrew Kevin Walker’s script for his 1995 psychological thriller Seven, he’d sworn off the possibility of ever directing again, still reeling from his notoriously rocky experience on his debut feature, Alien 3, which had ultimately been taken out of his hands. (“I’d rather die of colon cancer than make another movie,” he colorfully put it.) Walker’s script had already gone through various permutations since 1989, most notably a twist ending that had been written out of subsequent drafts for being irredeemably bleak. Yet, the original version was the one that Fincher read and he was unwilling to compromise, despite persistent pressure from executives and test screenings that seemed to confirm that it was too bleak an ending.‘The entire industry said no’: the story behind seminal teen comedy Clueless at 30Read moreNow 30 years later, Seven is proof that audiences don’t know what they want until you give it to them. Or that all audiences are not the same, even if Hollywood is often desperate to appeal to everyone at once. There have been so many hacky imitations of the film since – so many that have mimicked its neo-noir edginess and its baroque depiction of serial murder – that it can be hard to remember the impact the film had at the time, when there was nothing else quite like it. While The Silence of the Lambs had legitimized this sort of grisly undertaking, it nonetheless took place in a world where evils could be banished and traumas eased. Fincher’s urban hellscape suggests another level of malevolence, a world embodied more by its sinister villain than hard-nosed detectives out to stop him. Maybe it was a place viewers recognized.To that end, Morgan Freeman’s weary, soulful performance as William Somerset, the soon-to-be-retired lieutenant detective at a godforsaken precinct, now seems like a dry run for Tommy Lee Jones’ ageing lawman in No Country for Old Men. Both men have aged into a present that’s beyond their capacity to comprehend, much less control, despite their considerable veteran wile. But even a seen-it-all type like Somerset has trouble wrapping his mind around the case that will occupy his final week on the job, when he planned to pass the baton to David Mills (Brad Pitt), a volatile young detective who had perversely requested a transfer to his miserable, rain-choked, crime-ridden domain. Somerset knows from the first horrific murder that another one is coming, and probably many more after that.The buddy-cop dynamic between Somerset and Mills is conceived broadly, with Somerset the worldly and methodical sage and Mills the brash hothead who acts on impulse. Yet over the course of the film, the distance between them in age, experience and temperament doesn’t narrow so much as syncopate into real chemistry, which is credit to Freeman and Pitt’s performances. In time, they develop a complementary skill set, owed in no small part to Mills’s wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who insists on having Somerset over for dinner and seems to reintroduce them as humans, outside of the daily grind. There’s even a moment when they nearly outsmart their target and surprise him, but that’s about as far as it gets.With cinematographer Darius Khondji imposing an insistently grim visual mood – the dark lighting, another concern for the studio, recalls Gordon Willis’s work on The Godfather – Fincher never shows any of the killings in Seven, but renders shocking tableaux from their aftermath. At the first crime scene, Somerset and Mills discover a morbidly obese shut-in face down in a plate of spaghetti, with his wrists and ankles bound by wire. At the second, a high-powered defense attorney is found in his office with a literal pound of flesh on the scales of justice, the word GREED written in blood on the carpet. The “John Doe” that Somerset and Mills are chasing has chosen the Seven Deadly Sins as a theme for serial murder, but his literary references are like a couple of semesters in the classics department, with nods to Dante, Milton, Chaucer and Shakespeare.It’s funny to see a gritty procedural like Seven where the detectives have to hit the library – Mills turns out to be more of a Cliff’s Notes guy – but part of what distinguishes the film from its successors is how beautifully it merges the visceral with the philosophical. The film is every bit the hard-R shocker that made it a conversation piece in 1995, but Walker and Fincher’s obsession with evil as a theme manifests itself in the head and the gut simultaneously. Mills often tries to dismiss “John Doe” as a garden-variety sicko, but Somerset understands better the grotesque story that the killer is telling about the sins that have overwhelmed this unnamed, perhaps unsalvageable city. They are two sides of the same coin.The ending of Seven works so effectively because Walker and Fincher make it inevitable in every dread-soaked frame. The same test audiences that might reject “the box” seem likely to have rejected the film’s entire point of view, butactualaudiences responded in great force to a world they either recognized or feared, much like people responded to the pessimism of postwar noir. The unfortunate clones that followed Seven – two of which, Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider, starred Freeman– used the habits of a serial killer as a gross marketing gimmick, disconnected from any larger purpose. The terror of Fincher’s film is that John Doe not only controls what Somerset and Mills see, but seems to be directing our eyes, too. Seven is not about evil so much as it is a sensory immersion in it.Explore more on these topicsDavid FincherBrad PittMorgan FreemanGwyneth PaltrowKevin SpaceyThrillersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What we’ve really enjoyed about the streaming space is we’ve been able to experiment. It’s harder to do that in the movie space. And now I think that that’s why it feels so good to be able to move into a Mandalorian movie as we’re coming off of three seasons of a very successful show. We’ve actually built an audience for that, and we gave the young audience an opportunity to enter Star Wars at a different place and not feel like you have to have seen everything. It can become their Star Wars. And that, I think, is the fun storytelling challenge.”Explore more on these topicsStar WarsPedro PascalJeremy Allen WhiteSigourney WeaverScience fiction and fantasy filmsThe MandalorianDisney+newsShareReuse this content"

But the times they are a-changing, because leading characters of pensionable age are all over the place nowadays, whether solving crimes inThe Thursday Murder Club; turning the tables on swindlers inThelmaorThe G; wrestling with unreliable memories inThe Fatheror Familiar Touch; or preying on other inmates or staff inThe HomeorThe Rule of Jenny Pen.Not long ago, the screen was monopolised by smooth-skinned teens and twentysomethings, but now it has been infiltrated by creased faces imbued with the sort of personality that can only be accrued over decades of experience and with minimal recourse to cosmetic surgery. And not just as non-player characters but in starring or pivotal roles in the narrative; no longer to be condescended to and patted on the head simply for lasting the course, but as people just like the rest of us. Real people!View image in fullscreenIn her 40s … Beulah Bondi as Lucy Cooper and Victor Moore as Barkley Cooper in Make Way for Tomorrow (1937).Photograph: THA/ShutterstockWhich is not to say older characters are never stereotyped. Recent examples tend to be one of three kinds: feisty, frail or fiendish. Feisties hatch plans, solve murders and fight back against injustice, sometimes with the help of younger relatives who teach them how to use the internet. Frails are on a downward slide into dementia but their condition is treated with sympathy and respect, as is the plight of their relatives and carers. Meanwhile the Fiendish are egomaniacal miscreants who exploit, terrorise or kill. I sometimes wonder if it might be better to be a Fiendish than a Frail, though I would probably incline more towardsMonty Python’s Hell’s Grannies, handbagging pedestrians out of the way, than, yuck, sucking the essence out of young people’s eyeballs.As a woman now in her 70s, I am particularly alert to signs of representation of my generation in the cinema, and naturally I don’t recognise myself in any of these categories. But then, like most people my age I suspect, I don’t see myself as old. I am, though, ever on the lookout for ageing role models. One is forever being wrongfooted by classic Hollywood. It’s a shock to realise Beulah Bondi was still in her 40s when she played old Ma Cooper in Make Way for Tomorrow – of course the Great Depression would have aged people, but this was ridiculous. Gloria Swanson was 50 when she played Norma Desmond inSunset Boulevard, depicted as terminally over the hill – though of course Billy Wilder’s film is itself an acerbic commentary on a film industry that scrapped its figureheads as soon as they were past the first flush of youth.People are now living longer, and there are more of us refusing to be shunted aside. In 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics, 18% of the population of the UK were aged 65 or over. In 2041 this is projected to increase to 26%. More than a quarter! We all like to see ourselves represented in the cinema, proving there are still aspirations, fears and existential crises in the old carcass yet. And our favourite film-makers are getting older alongside us, so it makes sense that more ageing boomers are turning up on screen and actually doing stuff rather than being wheeled on as token grandparents.View image in fullscreenThe puppet master … John Lithgow as Dave Crealy in The Rule of Jenny Pen (2024).Photograph: Stan Alley/IFC Films and ShudderNow that the golden age of the mature female sleuth (Miss Marple, Jessica Fletcher, the Snoop Sisters) has passed, and that Judi Dench has now effectively retired from acting and the late Maggie Smith is no longer able to give her masterclass in withering epithets in Downton Abbey, we are obliged to look elsewhere for our doughty role models.Helen Mirrenshouldn’t be required to shoulder all the burden on her own, as she shuttles between an unusually broad range of pensionable personae: from royalty to military intelligence to KGB agent to assassin to cockney crime matriarch to Barbie narrator. And anyway, who among us would dream of referring to Mirren as “elderly”?Sometimes a smidgeon of Captain Tom-type sentimentality is allowed to creep in to a film, as happens in the otherwise admirably unromanticisedThe Great Escaper, based on real events, in which Michael Caine, egged on by Glenda Jackson in her last film role, absconds from his East Sussex care home to attend D-day commemorations in France. Only rarely are real-world concerns, such as trying to keep warm when your winter fuel payments have been cut, addressed on the big screen, least of all in The Thursday Murder Club, in which the intrepid seniors live in suites in a huge country mansion, a long way from neorealist dispatches such as Umberto D (1952), in which the aged protagonist gets behind with his rent and is kicked out of his digs.The aged are often cast as harbingers of doom. Young gerontophobes, terrified of getting older, see their elders as unattractive, even monstrous, not to mention responsible for having reduced the world to its current parlous state. Hence, perhaps, the zombie-like hordes in the 2022 Spanish horror film The Elderly, in which their lethal aggression seems linked to global warming. In the similarly themed German film Old People, from the same year, pensioners turn savagely on younger folk in what appears to be a worldwide conspiracy. Taking a cue from Spinal Tap’s David St Hubbins, we should probably call this subgenre Night of the Assisted Living Dead. Of course the bloodthirsty oldies are metaphors – symbols of the older generation’s selfishness, or of relatives’ guilt at consigning Grandpa to a care home – but it doesn’t stop you wondering why their young victims don’t just push them over. Because as everyone knows, our bones are brittle, and once we’ve fallen over we can’t get up.View image in fullscreenVeteran rockers … Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean, in Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.Photograph: Kyle Kaplan/APMeanwhile, those of us of a certain age are not just searching for desperately needed laughs but hoping to rekindle the spirits of our younger, sprightlier selves when we reunite with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer (average age 78) as the veteran rockers of Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.There is serious Oscar buzz around 95-year-old June Squibb’s fearless performance inEleanor the Great(Scarlett Johansson’s feature debut), as well as 75-year-old Amy Madigan’s bonkers one inWeapons.More than six decades after the actor himself enlisted in the US Marine Corps, 86-year-old Scott Glenn stars as an ex-soldier in the action thriller Eugene the Marine, which recently premiered at the Oldenburg film festival. Ian McKellen (86) plays a famous artist who goes head-to-head with a forger (Michaela Coel) in The Christophers, a black comedy from Steven Soderbergh. Morgan Freeman (88) is coming up in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. Charlotte Rampling (79) plays a formidable virtuoso in Arnaud Desplechin’s Two Pianos. And Samuel L Jackson (76) shows no sign of slowing down, having made five films last year, with another three coming up. Obviously we should be grateful these skilled veterans are still getting meaty roles instead of being put out to pasture. But might it also be a sign that the younger generation aren’t yet fit to fill their shoes?In any case, the golden agers keep on coming, and they are legion.

A sweet slice of disco-infused pop, it is about the moment that Deacon Blue’s career took off, in the wake of their debut album Raintown, a point rammed home by the stageside screens, which show the band in their youth: a veritable riot of white denim, leather jackets and questionable millinery. “We seemed to do it all and it all seemed so easy,” sings Ricky Ross, his voice echoed by that of co-vocalist Lorraine McIntosh, as indeed it was then.You can’t really blame Deacon Blue for re-asserting how successful they were. They are the kind of band pop histories generally overlook – squeezed out of the late 80s narrative by the rise of acid house and Madchester at one extreme and Stock Aitken Waterman at the other – but they were, by any metric, both huge and inescapable: when they play their 1989 hit Fergus Sings the Blues, you find yourself automatically imagining it coming out of a radio, so omnipresent was it on BBC Radio 1 at the time.Nevertheless, you could hardly describe Deacon Blue as forgotten. The Great Western Road made the Top 3 and Brighton Centre is packed, part of a tour that exclusively inhabits the UK’s arenas. Their latter-day resurgence might rest on the fact that Ross has minted a songwriting style that, while musically indistinguishable from the band’s purple patch – and thus matching his and McIntosh’s voices, pretty much as they were in the questionable millinery years – lyrically seems intent on growing old with their audience. The Great Western Road’s title track and Mid Century Modern affectingly ruminate on time’s passing, their melancholy flecked with the-best-is-yet-to-come optimism.View image in fullscreenHard-bitten stories of Glasgow life … Lorraine McIntosh sings with Deacon Blue at Brighton Centre.Photograph: Jamie CarterThere’s also some politics, which comes as a surprise, but probably shouldn’t: beneath the glossy production, Raintown’s hard-bitten stories of Glasgow life carried an implicit critique of Thatcherism’s impact on the city. Tonight, Ross talks about the world being in “deep shit” and offers a glancing reference to welcoming migrants to the UK, while the brooding Your Town, from 1993’s coolly received attempt at post-Achtung Baby reinvention Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, plays out with the faces of Trump, Farage and Putin glowering from the screens.‘I’d been singing the wrong word for 30 years’: Deacon Blue on how they made DignityRead moreThere’s something heartening about the audience cheering this stuff, but they’re really here for the hits: Chocolate Girl, When Will You (Make My Telephone Ring), Dignity. You can occasionally pick out the influence of Prefab Sprout on Deacon Blue’s sound – and on Raintown’s title track, the Blue Nile’s drizzly urban angst – but refitted for broader appeal, made brawnier and more unashamedly poppy. It was too crowd-pleasing in approach to be critically acclaimed, but nearly 40 years on, even a dedicated naysayer might be forced to concede it worked: as Real Gone Kid hits the pop bullseye dead-on, those crowds are very much still being pleased.Deacon Blue play Utilita Arena, Birmingham, 22 September; Leeds First Direct Bank Arena, 23 September and Bournemouth International Centre, 25 September.Then touring.Explore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Filmed predominantly in South Jamaica, Queens, and allegedly featuring real guns, it’s a grimy and energetic video, yo-yoing between the group performing on a beach and aggressive closeups shot in dimly lit basements. Martel, a young white woman who had directed two documentaries, might have seemed like an unlikely choice, but according to Onyx member Fredro Starr, she properly mucked in. “She would be getting on the floor, like getting dirty with it,”he said in one interview. “She made that video. If you wasn’t a director who was willing to get dirty, that video wouldn’t have came out like that. I gotta give her the props.”Mariah Carey – All I Want for Christmas Is You (1994)Mariah Carey: All I Want for Christmas Is You – videoMartel directed a number of videos forMariah Carey, including Dreamlover, The Roof, and the remix video for Heartbreaker. The clip for this festive behemoth, however, was actually filmed before Carey had even written the song. Co-directed by Carey herself and shot at farm in upstate New York, it was made to look like Super 8 in post-production, with Carey getting so cold during filming that her hair froze. While Carey has said that she didn’t “love every shot in this video”, it does exemplify what Martel called her “minimalist work”, putting artists “front and centre” in her videos: “They have to perform because there is not a lot else going on.”Method Man – I’ll Be There for You / You’re All I Need to Get By ft Mary J Blige (1995)Method Man: I’ll Be There for You / You’re All I Need to Get By ft Mary J Blige – videoWhile her videos often prioritised simplicity, Martel’s approach for this Grammy-winning partnership between Method Man and Mary J Blige was more cinematic, incorporating a loose narrative about a man being pursued by police. The romance embedded in Method Man’s lyrics is captured in the more grounded shots of the rapper and Blige silhouetted against a backdrop of an industrial cityscape, their appearance a reminder that love helps you overcome life’s challenges.Christina Aguilera – Genie in a Bottle (1999)Christina Aguilera: Genie in a Bottle – videoMartel directed two music videos for Christina Aguilera, including the one for her indelible debut single. Here you can see the director’s emphasis on performance in action, a then 18-year-old Aguilera serving up tight choreography and a bare mid-riff as she shimmies into pop stardom. Nipping at the heels of Britney Spears’s … Baby One More Time, both song and video were a lightning rod for controversy. But Aguilera’s offering wore its sexuality more boldly and with more maturity than Spears. This was likely by design: “Even if there’s a sexual fantasy involved,”Martel said in 2003, “it doesn’t have to be a lazy, exploitive mess.” It’s a philosophy she perhaps didn’t always stick to, but one in practice here.Eve – Who’s That Girl? (2001)Eve: Who’s That Girl? – videoBy the early 2000s, you can see Martel becoming more adventurous. While her work still primarily spotlighted what shedescribed in 2013as “the artist doing it”, the video for Eve’s Who’s That Girl? demonstrates how she was experimenting with different technologies, aesthetics and set design. From the appearance of a tiger, the various CGI backdrops and a strange, animated vignette to the highly saturated colour palette and overblown lighting, this video feels like it wrote the style guide that Hype Williams would later follow throughout the 2000s.NERD – Lapdance (2001)NERD: Lapdance – videoIf Eve’s Who’s That Girl? was Martel expanding herself, this NERD video feels reminiscent of her earlier work with artists such as Onyx and Redman. “I try to stay true to the genre of music in terms of the lensing, framing and lighting,” shesaid in 2006, something that feels particularly true of the video for the solo cup-waving frat rap of Lapdance. The chiaroscuro lighting suggests depravity, Pharrell and the gang cavorting with scantily clad women at a testosterone-fuelled house party. Martel and NERD even made an explicit version of the video, featuring nudity and eye-rolling girl-on-girl action, something of a precursor to the infamous video for Blurred Lines.Justin Timberlake – Like I Love You (2002)Justin Timberlake: Like I Love You – videoMartel clearly understood the role a good music video could play in introducing an artist to the world. “Yes, it’s a sales tool,” shesaid in 2003, “but it’s also a visual presentation of the artist’s poetry and culture, interpreted by the director.” This mentality is on full display in the Like I Love You video, which helped reposition Justin Timberlake as a solo star. The simplicity of the video (“none of my videos are conceptual, even the conceptual ones,” she once said) provides ample room for Timberlake to prove he’s no longer a curly-haired teenybopper as he dances with a virility that accentuates his maturity. And the many close ups of his face? Proof that Martel understood the video’s target demographic.Stacie Orrico – Stuck (2003)Stacie Orrico: Stuck – videoNarrative wasn’t usually a priority for Martel, but she leaned into it while making the video for Stuck, the underrated single by Stacie Orrico. The story plays out like something from a teen drama, Orrico lamenting her ongoing attachment to an ex-boyfriend who cheated on her. Martel captures the teenage frustration and longing of the song by repeatedly isolating Orrico, be it through the window of a school bus, the fence of a basketball court or by placing her alone in her bedroom. Doing so lends the story credibility, resulting in a video that has timeless appeal.Robin Thicke – Blurred Lines ft TI, Pharrell (2013)Robin Thicke: Blurred Lines ft TI, Pharrell – videoIt’s the song and video that launched 1,000 think pieces, many of which rightly highlighted the predatory lyrics and the issue of how women were often objectified in music videos. For her part,Martel saidthat she was simply trying to make something that would “sell records” in the internet age. In that respect she delivered: the song became one of the best-selling singles of all time. The video is also typical of Martel’s minimalist style. Inspired by the work of George Balanchine, Richard Avedon and, incredibly, Benny Hill, the video is set against a white wall, Martel employing meme-able props, nudity, exaggerated movements and oversized graphics to draw the eye.‘Audiences can smell fakeness a mile away’: the creative directors behind pop’s biggest starsRead moreWas it sexist? Martel didn’t think so, suggesting that it actually skewered the queasy message of the song. “I wanted to deal with the misogynist, funny lyrics in a way where the girls were going to overpower the men,”she said at the time. Later, in 2021, when writer and model Emily Ratajkowski, who starred in the video, alleged that Robin Thicke had sexually assaulted her on the set,Martel confirmed the story, saying she shut down the shoot until Thicke apologised. “We kept on and Emily was phenomenal,” she added. “She’s really the star of the video. She’s fully mocking him and the male gaze with her beautiful shape and ferocious energy. She’s playful, not seductive. And quite hilarious.”Miley Cyrus – We Can’t Stop (2013)Miley Cyrus: We Can’t Stop – videoIf Martel’s work for Aguilera and Timberlake’s softly suggested each star’s sexuality, she chucked subtlety out the window for We Can’t Stop. The aim, she said, was to “make a trippy, fucked-up video that was like a giant selfie” while catering to “a new generation of kids that are overstimulated as viewers”. Why that meant including numerous shots of Miley Cyrus sticking her tongue out is unclear, but the scenes of twerking, dancing bears and hedonistic partying certainly captured the yolo ethos of the early 2010s. And if it (hyper)sexualised Cyrus, so what? “Some songs are about sex, some moments in careers are about sex,”Martel said in 2013. “If it’s called for, we go there … I’m comfortable with sexuality, so that maybe helps performers. We are talking about music videos.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockChristina AguileraRobin ThickePharrell WilliamsMariah CareyJustin TimberlakefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it can’t mask the frontman’s brutal honesty. He talks about childhood trauma – and partying with Post MaloneHuw BainesMon 22 Sep 2025 00.01 EDTShareWhen Ian Shelton was growing up in Enumclaw, a small town near Seattle, coming home from school was a constant step into the unknown. “I was living in fear of the next fucked-up experience,” he says. Sitting in a store room above the London venue his band Militarie Gun will later fill with shoutalong aggro-pop energy, the singer is jetlagged but animated as he puts himself back there, his sandy hair peeking from beneath the hood of his sweatshirt. “Twice, my bus pulled up as an ambulance pulled away from our house,” he continues. “There was never a point when you were safe from things getting worse.”Shelton says his childhood was defined by addiction. His mother was a relapsed alcoholic, meaning rehab, AA meetings and spells in jail. Often, it fell to him to look out for his younger siblings. “There was a huge question mark over what every day would bring,” he says. This feeling created an anxiety that Shelton thrashed out at hardcore shows, having been sucked in by Bay Area greats Ceremony as a 15-year-old. He began to write his own kitchen-sink compositions, too. “That fear needs a release,” he says. “I found music. I wrote a song that was just my mom’s name. At the time, there was a domestic violence incident and a restraining order – and I channelled my anger into a diss track.”It’s 4am and Post Malone’s just handed me a Bud LightShelton started out in straight edge youth crew bands, but his compulsion to create grew into hardcore projects that showed formal daring and lyrical brutality, from the iPhone-recorded screeds of S.W.A.T. to the searing power-violence of Regional Justice Center, named after the facility that housed his brother, Max, following his arrest on drug-related assault charges.Against this backdrop, the melodic, crossover-ready indie-punk of Militarie Gun’s new record God Save the Gun is a change of pace. And yet its meticulously sculpted refrains can’t mask Shelton’s in-your-face candour. “Things you’ll never remember, I’ll never get to forget,” he barks on God Owes Me Money, a gritty anthem about making his trauma work for him.But then you listen to B A D I D E A, which opens with the words: “I’ve been slipping up.” You realise Shelton’s sights aren’t trained on his family. In a grimly ironic twist, they’re actually trained on the puffy-eyed, sloppy alcoholic he became after the success of Militarie Gun’s 2023 debut Life Under the Gun. “The finger has to be pointed at me,” he says. “The things you’ll never remember, things I’ll never forget? There are people I’ve hurt who feel the same.”Shelton formed Militarie Gun in Los Angeles in 2020, playing every instrument on their noisy, hooky first EP. As soon as the pandemic allowed, he started touring relentlessly, with a rotating lineup cohering around guitarists William Acuña and Kevin Kiley, bassist Waylon Trim and drummer David Stalsworth.Further EPs followed, on Denver hardcore institution Convulse and Seattle’s Alternatives Label, but then Militarie Gun signed with Loma Vista, home to Iggy Pop and Sleater-Kinney; and to Jay-Z’s Roc Nation management company. When their single Do It Faster featured in a Taco Bell advert, it was heard by rapper Post Malone, who the band partied with after his show at the Louvre in 2024. “I felt like I was inAlmost Famous,” says Kiley. “It’s 4am and Post Malone’s just handed me a Bud Light.” Shelton adds: “I’ve had a lot of those experiences and it’s fun bringing people into that chaos. Like, ‘Isn’t this fuckingweird?’”Having sworn off drinking for most of his life, the anxiety-stricken boy that was still inside Shelton in his 30s found it a welcome lubricant in room after room full of strangers. “I was more outgoing,” he says. “It helped me be present. I was more comfortable on camera – I could be a guy in a band trying to sell a record.”Having seen so much during his youth, he couldn’t reconcile any of this with what he thought rock bottom looked like. Instead, his own words tipped him off. When he played a demo of the Wonderwall-adjacent Daydream to his ex, he noticed he’d mumbled its second verse. “Been drunk every day for a month,” ran one of its lines. “I didn’t think to change the lyrics,” he says. “But I made them harder to hear. So there would be no questions.”Shelton is now six months sober. God Save the Gun isn’t a recovery record, but it makes it impossible to view his about-face outside the context of his upbringing – the kid who held it together for his family, now holding it together for his band. “I don’t have the ability to moderate,” he says. “Alcohol is one of the only things that made me feel normal, but I disappointed people. That’s a place I wasn’t willing to go.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result left many people in a state of shock and denial, unable to process exactly what went wrong.No one was more shocked thanKamala Harris, whose inner circle had been confident on election night that they’d eked out a win during the whirlwind campaign. Cupcakes with “Madam President” toppings were ready to go; champagne on ice. “It says a lot about how traumatized we both were by what happened that night that [my husband] Doug and I never discussed it with each other until I sat down to write this book,” Harris reveals in her new memoir, which functions as a political postmortem.I don’t know if Harris found writing 107 Days cathartic, but reading it certainly wasn’t. Instead, the book, which unfolds in strictly chronological order, is a frustrating slog. It seems likely to alienate her critics further and provides no closure or hope for her supporters.Harris has always been accused of sounding phoney; criticism she brushes off in the book as sexism. When Charlamagne Tha God, host of popular radio show The Breakfast Club, observed that she came off as “very scripted” on the campaign trail, she retorted that it was actually “discipline”. The memoir was Harris’s opportunity to go off-script. Instead she sticks to her talking points.You can almost feel her teeth grind as she recounts the many mishaps, attributable to Biden, that her campaign was forced to firefightWhich isn’t to say there aren’t some real insights. One of the most compelling sections describes her gloomy birthday celebrations, 16 days before the election. Harris had expected Doug to do something special – she’s a big birthday person – but he was so beaten down from the campaign that he shrugged the day off. The frustrated pair ended up fighting. This is one of the few moments Harris shows the emotional toll of an intense campaign. It humanises her; the book would have benefited from more of this kind of material.There are occasional glimpses of how Harris really feels about Joe Biden; her bitterness at the impossible lot he handed her. You can almost feel her teeth grind as she recounts the many mishaps, attributable to him, that her campaign was forced to firefight. The moment the outgoing president was photographed putting on a “Trump 2024” cap during a 9/11 commemoration event, for example. Or when he seemed to call Trump supporters “garbage”. You sense real anger that he didn’t allow her to shine as vice-president.But while Harris doesn’t refrain from criticising Biden, she doesn’t go full-throttle either, remaining guarded on some of the key questions that still trouble people. There was no “conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden’s infirmity”, she says, insisting “there was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern”. While she admits she had concerns about him, she maintains he was fully competent. Given that CNN’s Jake Tapper, in his bookOriginal Sin, has convincingly detailed Biden’s decline, this feels very hard to believe. What else isn’t she being fully honest about, you wonder?Harris was indisputably put in a very difficult situation when Biden dropped out. But if he had stuck to his promise to be atransitional president, if she’d had more time to campaign – would it have made a difference? Was Harris the right person to fight Trump? Gavin Newsom, the California governor who is a likely Democratic contender for 2028, clearly didn’t think so. After Biden bowed out, Harris started working the phones for endorsements. The notes from her call with Newsom, she writes, just say: “Hiking. Will call back.(He never did.)”And Harris herself seemed to have some initial doubts about her chances. Frazzled, she called her pastor for wisdom at the start of her campaign, and put him on speakerphone as he reassured her inner circle: “He talked about Queen Esther, who saved her people when they were threatened. ‘You were born for a time such as this,’ he said, and I teared up … It grounded us all.” From that point on, Harris insists she was the right woman for the moment.Her own book, however, makes it clear she still has blind spots about what went wrong. While a JanuaryYouGov pollsuggests Biden’s unconditional support for Israel significantly affected Democratic voter turnout, Harris is largely dismissive of Gaza. Of demonstrators who turned up at campaign stops she asks: “Why weren’t they protesting at Trump rallies?” Can she really not understand? Because Trump was not in power at the time, and she was. Because President Biden made it clear he had no real empathy for Palestinians. Harris doesn’t seem to have much, either.It’s not just those upset about Gaza who will bristle at this account. The former vice-president’s characterizations of peers such as Pete Buttigieg (talented but too gay for the America to accept as herrunning mate), and Josh Shapiro (an egoist) are not particularly juicy, but have already causedbad blood. As for any Harris supporters hoping 107 Days might bring closure or optimism, they will also be sorely disappointed. It may be time for the holdouts to finally take those Harris signs down, because the woman who kept telling voters “we’re not going back” fails to chart any kind of path forward for the United States. In the end, she seems just as helpless as the rest of us.107 Days by Kamala Harris is published by Simon & Schuster (£25 in the UK; $30 in the US).

Should we believe them?David ShariatmadariMon 22 Sep 2025 02.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 16.51 EDTShareWhat if I told you I could stop you worrying about climate change, and all you had to do was read one book? Great, you’d say, until I mentioned that the reason you’d stop worrying was because the book says our species only has a few years before it’s wiped out by superintelligent AI anyway.We don’t know what form this extinction will take exactly – perhaps an energy-hungry AI will let the millions of fusion power stations it has built run hot, boiling the oceans. Maybe it will want to reconfigure the atoms in our bodies into something more useful. There are many possibilities, almost all of them bad, say Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares in If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, and who knows which will come true. But just as you can predict that an ice cube dropped into hot water will melt without knowing where any of its individual molecules will end up, you can be sure an AI that’s smarter than a human being will kill us all, somehow.This level of confidence is typical of Yudkowsky, in particular. He has been warning about the existential risks posed by technology for years on the website he helped to create,LessWrong.com, and via the Machine Intelligence Research Institute he founded (Soares is the current president). Despite not graduating high school or university, Yudkowsky is highly influential in the field, and a celebrity in the world of very bright young men arguing with each other online (as well as the author of a 600,000-wordwork of fanficcalled Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Colourful, annoying, polarising. “People become clinically depressed reading your crap,” lamented leading researcher Yann LeCun during oneonline spat. But, as chief scientist at Meta, who is he to talk?And while Yudkowsky and Soares may be unconventional, their warnings are similar to those of Geoffrey Hinton, the Nobel-winning “godfather of AI”, and Yoshua Bengio, theworld’s most-cited computer scientist, both of whomsigned up to the statementthat “mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war”.As a clarion call, If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies is well timed. Superintelligent AI doesn’t exist yet, but in the wake of the ChatGPT revolution, investment in the datacentres that would power it is now counted in the hundreds of billions. This amounts to “the biggest and fastest rollout of a general purpose technology in history,”according to the FT’s John Thornhill. Meta alone will spend as much as $72bn (£54bn) on AI infrastructure this year, and the achievement of superintelligence is now Mark Zuckerberg’s explicit goal.Not great news, if you believe Yudkowsky and Soares. But why should we? Despite the complexity of its subject, If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies is as clear as its conclusions are hard to swallow. Where the discussions become more technical, mainly in passages dealing with AI model training and architecture, it’s still straightforward enough for readers to grasp the basic facts.Among these is that we don’t really understand how generative AI works. In the past, computer programs were hand coded – every aspect of them was designed by a human. In contrast, the latest models aren’t “crafted”, they’re “grown”. We don’t understand, for example, how ChatGPT’s ability to reason emerged from it being shown vast amounts of human-generated text. Something fundamentally mysterious happened during its incubation. This places a vital part of AI’s functioning beyond our control and means that, even if we can nudge it towards certain goals such as “be nice to people”, we can’t determine how it will get there.That’s a problem, because it means that AI will inevitably generate its own quirky preferences and ways of doing things, and these alien predilections are unlikely to be aligned with ours. (This is, it’s worth noting, entirely separate from the question of whether AIs might be “sentient” or “conscious”. Being set goals, and taking actions in the service of them, is enough to bring about potentially dangerous behaviour.) In any case, Yudkowsky and Soares point out that tech companies are already trying hard to build AIs that do things on their own initiative, because businesses will pay more for tools that they don’t have to supervise. If an “agentic” AI like this were to gain the ability to improve itself, it would rapidly surpass human capabilities in practically every area. Assuming that such a superintelligent AI valued its own survival – why shouldn’t it? – it would inevitably try to prevent humans from developing rival AIs or shutting it down. The only sure-fire way of doing that is shuttingusdown.What methods would it use? Yudkowsky and Soares argue that these could involve technology we can’t yet imagine, and which may strike us as very peculiar. They liken us to Aztecs sighting Spanish ships off the coast of Mexico, for whom the idea of “sticks they can point at you to make you die” – AKA guns – would have been hard to conceive of.Yudkowsky and Soares present their case with such conviction that it’s easy to emerge from this book ready to cancel your pension contributionsNevertheless, in order to make things more convincing, they have a go. In the part of the book that most resembles sci-fi, they set out an illustrative scenario involving a superintelligent AI called Sable. Developed by a major tech company, Sable spreads through the internet to every corner of civilisation, recruiting human stooges through the most persuasive version of ChatGPT imaginable, before destroying us with synthetic viruses and molecular machines. It’s outlandish, of course – but the Aztecs would’ve said the same about muskets and Catholicism.Yudkowsky and Soares present their case with such conviction that it’s easy to emerge from this book ready to cancel your pension contributions. The glimmer of hope they offer – and it’s low wattage – is that doom can be averted if the entire world agrees to shut down advanced AI development as soon as possible. Given the commercial and strategic incentives, and the current state of political leadership, this seems a little unlikely.The crumbs of hope we are left to scrabble for, then, are indications that they may not be right, either about the fact that superintelligence is on its way, or that its creation equals our annihilation.There are certainly moments in the book when the confidence with which an argument is presented outstrips its strength. A small example: as an illustration of how AI can develop strange, alien preferences, the authors offer up the fact that some large language models find it hard to interpret sentences without full stops. “Human thoughts don’t work like that,” they write. “We wouldn’t struggle to comprehend a sentence that ended without period.” But that’s not really true; humans often rely on markers at the end of a sentences in order to interpret them correctly. We learn language via speech, so they’re not dots on the page but “prosodic” features like intonation: think of the difference between a rising and falling tone at the end of a phrase such as “he said he was coming”. If text-trained AI leans heavily on punctuation to figure out what’s going on, that shows its thought processes are analogous, not alien, to human ones.And for writers steeped in the hyper-rational culture of LessWrong, Yudkowsky and Soares exhibit more than a touch of confirmation bias. “History,” they write, “is full of … examples of catastrophic risk being minimised and ignored,” from leaded petrol to Chornobyl. But what about predictions of catastrophic risk being proved wrong? History is full of those, too, from Malthus’s population apocalypse to Y2K. Yudkowsky himself once claimed thatnanotechnology would destroy humanity“no later than 2010”.The problem is that you can be overconfident, inconsistent, a serial doom-monger, and still be right. It’s important to be aware of our own motivated reasoning when considering the arguments presented here; we have every incentive to disbelieve them.And while it’s true that they don’t represent the scientific consensus, this is a rapidly changing, poorly understood field. What constitutes intelligence, what constitutes “super”, whether intelligence alone is enough to ensure world domination – all of this is furiously debated.At the same time, the consensus that does exist is not particularly reassuring. In a 2024 survey of 2,778 AI researchers, themedian probability placedon “extremely bad outcomes, such as human extinction” was 5%. Worryingly, “having thought more (either ‘a lot’ or ‘a great deal’) about the question was associated with a median of 9%, while having thought ‘little’ or ‘very little’ was associated with a median of 5%”.Yudkowsky has been thinking about the problem for most of his adult life. The fact that his prediction sits north of 99% might reflect a kind of hysterical monomania, or an especially thorough engagement with the problem. Whatever the case, it feels like everyone with an interest in the future has a duty to read what he and Soares have to say.If Anyone Builds it, Everyone Dies by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares is published by Bodley Head (£22).To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The Faloduns at the centre of Cursed Daughters share tales of heartbroken women across the generations who just can’t seem to hold on to a man. There’s Fikayo, whose husband left after he tired of tending to her chronic illness; Afoke, who seduced her younger sister’s boyfriend; Feranmi, the matriarch of the family, who got pregnant by a married man and received the curse from the man’s first wife. Again and again, the narrative is interrupted by these tales about grandmothers and great-great-grandmothers; eventually, it feels almost as if the novel is haunted by the stories themselves.Nigerian-British novelist Oyinkan Braithwaite splashed on to the literary scene in 2018 withMy Sister, the Serial Killer, a taut debut about sisterhood, jealousy and murder. Cursed Daughters, her second novel, swaps true crime for a more atmospheric spookiness, but it shares a lingering fascination with the dark secrets that might bind the women of a family together. The Falodun curse forms an ominous, ever-hovering presence for the three main characters – Monife, Ebun and Eniiyi – as they grow up, fall in love, and attempt to defy the supernatural forces that seem to hold their family in thrall.In 1994, 19-year-old Monife meets gentle, light-skinned Kalu, whom she nicknames Golden Boy. He’s the perfect man, she believes, to break the curse. “There was not a single shred of doubt in her mind that they would be together for ever,” she thinks at one point, in a moment of dramatic irony. We know their relationship doesn’t end well: the novel begins in 2000, as Monife drowns herself at a beach. Monife and Kalu’s love story unfolds throughout the novel with an inexorability that eventually becomes a tad predictable, especially when we meet Kalu’s rich, beautiful and cruel mother.Paranormal trappings aside, the true family curse may just be these women’s inability to reckon with their pastMonife’s death casts an eerie shadow over the lives of the other two protagonists. Monife’s cousin Ebun gives birth to a daughter on the day of Monife’s funeral – a daughter whom, she notes with growing unease as the years pass, looks and acts exactly like Monife. Twenty-four years later, that daughter, Eniiyi, falls in love with Zubby, a light-skinned boy she rescues from drowning. Their connection – instant, visceral – feels otherworldly, and Eniiyi begins to have strange visions of Monife, uncanny intrusions that force her to reckon with the notion that she may be a reincarnation of her dead aunt.Braithwaite braids these three women’s stories into a narrative that unfolds gracefully even as it leaps backwards and forwards in time. But despite the novel’s decades-spanning scope, its story feels oddly static, even claustrophobic. Cursed Daughters spends much of its time establishing the preternatural similarities between Monife and Eniiyi – the same-shaped scars on their thighs, the same relationship dynamics with their (very similar) boyfriends, the same recurring image of a black bird of prey. But all these details seem to signify, with little variation, is that the family is, well, cursed. Elsewhere, one finds a similar heavy-handedness. “What if the trauma of losing the love, stability and social standing that came with marriage had left epigenetic markers on generation after generation of the Falodun women?” wonders Eniiyi, who happens to be an aspiring genetic counsellor.But Eniiyi’s musings do gesture at a meaningful idea: paranormal trappings aside, the true family curse may just be the Falodun women’s inability to reckon with their past. After Monife dies, her room is kept just as she left it – except for the water damage that seeps through the ceiling and warps the door and walls, an evocative symbol of unprocessed grief. One sees lingering family trauma in the way Monife’s mother can’t let go of her ex-husband – she resorts to arcane rituals in an attempt to lure him back – and in the way Monife overreacts to being left alone at a party by Kalu. “How could he understand how easy it was for a person who purported to love you to abandon you?” she thinks, reminded of her father’s sudden withdrawal. It’s these emotional responses, these ways one learns to love, that also form a family’s inheritance – a resonant truth that deserves more development in this novel about intergenerational pain.Cursed Daughters by Oyinkan Braithwaite is published by Atlantic (£18.99).

Both the death of Christine McVie in 2022 and Lindsey Buckingham’s earlier firing, in 2018, were assumed to have made any reunion impossible.“Without Christine, no can do,” Stevie Nicks told Mojo last year. “There is no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac back together in any way. Without her, it just couldn’t work.”She added that Buckingham’s health,after emergency open-heart surgery in 2019, would preclude him from “the kind of touring that Fleetwood Mac does”, going out for 18-month stints, “even if I thought I could work with Lindsey again”.The Mail reported that Rowling is planning a two-day celebration for her 60th with a James Bond theme. Blondie previously played at a party thrown by the author in 2017.Despite there being little chance of a full Fleetwood Mac reunion, it does appear there has been a rapprochement between Buckingham and his former bandmates. He and Mick Fleetwood play on a new single by Miley Cyrus, Secrets, released last week.And he has participated in a teaser campaign for a new reissue of Buckingham Nicks, the sole duo album he and his original bandmate made prior to joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975, sharing joint Instagram posts riffing on the release.Apple is producing a new documentary on Fleetwood Mac, the first to be authorised by the band. Directed by Frank Marshall, who also made the Bee Gees film How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, it will feature new interviews with the surviving members.Rowling’s most recent book is The Hallmarked Man, the latest under her Robert Galbraith pen name.Explore more on these topicsFleetwood MacPop and rockJK RowlingnewsShareReuse this content"

Thrash pioneers and stadium mainstaysMetallicahave been in the doldrums for half a decade; the grungey, hard rock gristle of their last two records, Load and Reload, and reconfiguration as short-haired, eyeliner-wearing Anton Corbijn muses have alienated them from their headbanger OG fans; inter-band relations are at a low ebb and longtime bassist Jason Newsted has jumped. Meanwhile, the tectonics of theheavy musiclandscape are shifting around them – the solipsistic dirge ofnu-metalnow energising the disenfranchised youth of America. It’s time for a rebirth.Regrouping in San Francisco, singer and guitarist James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and determinatively named producer Bob Rock hole up in a makeshift studio in the Presidio and set to relocating the old garage-band spark that gave birth to albums as seismic as Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets.That was the plan for 2003’s St Anger, anyway. It was not to be. Film-makers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky were tasked with documenting the group’s comeback; shadowingMetallicaas they wrote their first masterpiece of the new millennium, while also finding a replacement for Newsted. What they made was a candid, blissful portrait of a band beset with personal beef, wild hubris, limitless cash and absolutely zero good song ideas.‘I laugh out loud’: why Johnny Stecchino is my feelgood movieRead moreSuperficially,Some Kind of Monsteris a vérité dissection of the creative process in disarray. A good chunk of the film’s 2.5-hour runtime is spent observing the band grinding out the record’s turgid, down-tuned riffs, drums that famously sound like a bin being pushed down the stairs and heinous lyrics (“Temptation wreck my head! Temptation make you dead!” et al) in a state of palpable ennui. It’s fascinating seeing a former juggernaut of a band responsible for vintage rippers such asCreeping Death,OneandDamage Inc(plus performances including this crackers1991 show in Moscow) calcifying in real time.But it’s mostly the fraught interpersonal relationships that make Some Kind of Monster such a lark. Specifically, two bickering narcissists – Hetfield and Ulrich – and a “performance enhancement coach” called Phil Towle, airlifted in to corral some semblance of harmony. Hetfield (stubborn, controlling, prone to door-slamming) and Ulrich (profane, lofty, woeful drummer) come across as uniformly awful. The omnipresent Towle, though, is a gem: relaying messages from deceased founding bassist Cliff Burton, penning boneheaded “mission statements” (“We come now to create our album of life / We honor the brilliance of each and harmony of ONE,” etc), and proffering his own terrible lyrics to the band’s new songs. When it comes to being fired – Hetfield concerned he sees himself as a fourth official member – the panicked hunger for his monthly $40,000 retainer could be seen from space.The rest of the cast is more redeemable. Hammett is embattled and hippyish, clearly happier surfing and plodding around on his ranch in a giant stetson than mediating for his sniping bandmates (and who, to twist the knife, ban Hammett from playing his trademark solos as a concession to nu-metal’s anti-virtuosic stylings). Rock is sycophantic but steadying. Newsted seems mostly relieved to be free of the behemoth; new bassist Robert Trujillo adorably starstruck, the sequence of his rattling through turbo-speed 80s rager Battery a brief vision of modern-day Metallica at glorious full throttle.‘The energy is infectious’: why Bride and Prejudice is my feelgood movieRead moreEven away from Towle, levity abounds in the inadvertent Tap-esque hijinks that flow thick and fast. Take your pick: Hetfield lamenting: “I need a pen! None of this pencil shit!”, then noticing a roadie’s misspelling of “Mettlica” on his mic. Accidental Ulrich catchphrases (“It sounds stock to my ears!”). Hammett coaxing an ungodly racket out of his guitar with an electric nail buffer. And especially Ulrich’s wizened, sage-like father Torben’s damning reaction to hearing the album rushes for the first time: “If you said, ‘you were our adviser,’, I would say: ‘delete that.’” All gold, but there’s some occasional pathos, too: Hetfield may be an arse, but he’s consumed by alcoholism, abandonment issues and guilt over his parental shortcomings; while an overdue meeting between Ulrich and Megadeth’s Dave Mustaine, fired from Metallica in 1983, eschews the pop-psych jargon for some astute reflection on their dead friendship (and closes, poignantly, with Mustaine yelling “Metal up your ass!” in an old TV spot).The film ends, more than 700 days in, with the album wrapped, Phil given the heave-ho, a promo video filmed atCalifornia’s terrifying San Quentin prison and absolutely no sense that the record is anything but a sopping wet squib (despite Ulrich deludedly declaring: “You can make something aggressive and fucked up with positive energy between the people creating it!”).And while St Anger may be rubbish, Some Kind of Monster never fails to delight. For its lack of a redemptive arc, the cosmic schadenfreude, and a study of a group failing to navigate the grim musical landscape of the early 2000s, the film is my rainy-day staple. In any case, St Anger has sold 6m copies to date – so who’s laughing now, eh?Metallica: Some Kind of Monster is available to rent digitallyExplore more on these topicsMetallicaMy feelgood movieDocumentary filmsMetalMusic documentaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These include the original RSC production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses in 1985, Machinal in 1993 and (somewhat outrageously at the time), as Shakespeare’s Richard II in 1995.But a talent as fine as this is not going to be left alone for long by the film and TV industries, and Shaw has been in demand on screen for decades. Her first biggish film role was as Christy Brown’s doctor in My Left Foot, and she went on to do a wild variety of things, some you might expect (Jane Eyre, Anna Karenina, The Butcher Boy) and some you definitely wouldn’t – Three Men and a Little Lady, The Avengers (not that one,the other one) and the legendarily bad Super Mario Bros.Like many a big-league thespian though, Shaw is probably best known to film audiences for her continuing role in theHarry Potterfilms – as the nightmarish Petunia Dursley – but perhaps has outshone that on the small screen, with significant roles in Killing Eve (as spy chief Carolyn Martens), Fleabag (as Phoebe WB’s counsellor), and Star Wars spinoff Andor (as Maarva, Diego Luna’s adoptive mother).On the big screen more recently she’s popped up in awards-bait films (Colette, Ammonite, Hot Milk) and now has a (weirdly all too rare) lead role in new drama Park Avenue, in which she plays a mother reconnecting with her daughter (played by Katherine Waterston) after the latter leaves her husband and holes up in mum’s apartment in the celebrated thoroughfare of the title. So, lots to ask about; get your questions in by 6pm on Wednesday 24 September and we’ll print the answers in Film & Music.Park Avenue is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewHarry PotterDrama filmsFiona ShawFleabagAndorKilling EvecalloutShareReuse this content"

He was chatting to one of the neighbours next to the town church when the man raised his hand and pointed to one of the bells, calling it thetentenublobell.“He told me that, when played in the right way, the bell had the power to protect against hail storms, either by pushing the storm away or by turning the hail into water,” recalls Silberius. “Until then, I thought that bells were only used to call people to mass or to announce that someone had passed away, but this was different, it was sort of magical.”Santillán del Agua, BurgosBell of the TentenubloSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2025/09/19-45355-Tentenublobell.mp300:00:0000:00:09Silberius, 56, was shocked by the revelation, but thought of it only as a curiosity at the time. A musician and multimedia artist, he is often immersed in many different projects, from playing prehistoric music to producing photography and video art about his region. Then, about two years ago, the issue of the bells resurfaced when he was visiting Covarrubias, another village in Burgos which has a 15th-century church.Bells were the most instantaneous means of communication – there were no street lights, no alarms, and no telephonesSilberius had the idea of creating a site that would allow these ages-old instruments to have a new life on modern smartphones. “I was just thinking that the neighbours would find it amusing,” he says. He took pictures, recorded the bell sounds and, aided by ChatGPT, coded a very basic website.But when he finished, he realised he couldn’t stop there. “It was highly addictive,” he recalls. And sothe websiteevolved into a collaborative platform where anyone can upload photographs, audio files and information about their local bell towers and signature bell ringing patterns. He called it Tån:talán, a name that evokes the sound of bells ringing. Today the website hosts more than 500 bell towers and almost 2,500 bells.View image in fullscreenThe bell tower of the Santo Domingo de Silos monastery amplifies the sound of its two-tonne Glockengiesserei Bachert bell.Photograph: Blanca Saenz de Castillo/AlamyFor centuries, bell ringing has been a fundamental way of communication in Spain, particularly in the rural world. Bells called people to attend mass, but also marked the beginning of daily chores, pauses for lunch or rest, and the end of the working day. Bells were also rung to warn about storms and wildfires, to convene villagers to undertake communal work, and to announce births, deaths and marriages.Yecla de Yeltes, SalamancaGothic bellSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2025/09/19-45275-Gothicbell.mp300:00:0000:00:14“Bells were the most instantaneous and fastest means of communication in those days, when there were no street lights, no alarms, and no telephones,” explains Ulises Hernando Chico, a bell enthusiast and collaborator of Tån:talán. “The old chimes were very dynamic and diverse. For example, when someone died, people knew not only whether the person was a man or a woman, but also exactly the time of the funeral and the person’s social status.”View image in fullscreenEnthusiast and collaborator … 15-year-old Ulises Hernando Chico.Photograph: Tån:talánHernando, who is only 15 years old and went from playing with toy trains and spinning tops to becoming obsessed with bells, has spent the last two years researching and documenting bells and bell towers. With more than 400 bells recorded, he is by far Tån:talán’s biggest contributor. “I’m lucky enough that my parents take me everywhere,” he jokes.Ringing a bell may seem simple, but there are many ways to do it. In therepique, for example, the bell remains still and the sound comes from striking it with the clapper that hangs inside. It’s different from thebandeo, in which the bell swings back and forth, and from thevolteo, where the bell turns over completely. Bells can also be struck on the outside with a mallet, producing a duller, more metallic sound.In addition, these sounds, played on a set of bells, can be combined to create specific patterns, their meanings varying between different Spanish regions, and even between villages. For example, a very common call is the “toque a concejo” (call to council), used to summon villagers to discuss matters of general interest. In some parts ofBurgos, this call is performed with two bells, one high-pitched and one low-pitched. First, the bell ringer strikes the high-pitched bell in a long peal followed by several shorter strokes (ding … ding, ding, ding, ding, ding); then, on the lower bell, he repeats the same pattern (dong … dong, dong, dong, dong, dong). By contrast, in the province ofZamora, the same call is performed on a single bell, repeating several times a sequence of three short strokes (ding, ding, ding … ding, ding, ding).Hontoria de la Cantera, BurgosBell of Saint Michael the ArchangelSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2025/09/19-45323-SaintMichaelbell.mp300:00:0000:00:11For centuries, bells were rung by professional bell ringers, their technique passed orally from generation to generation. But over the course of the 20th century, most bell towers have been automated; patterns were simplified and unified across the country. And as bell ringers lost their jobs or died, a large part of this cultural richness was lost.In recent years, local associations of bell ringers have emerged across the country. These volunteers work to preserve and protect the tradition, documenting old patterns and fighting for formal recognition. Their work has been paramount in helping manual bell ringing in Spain become part of Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list.View image in fullscreenPatterns and striking techniques can communicate different messages … Hernando at work.Photograph: Tån:talánYoung people like Hernando are playing an important role in this process. Many of the members of local bell ringing associations are children or teenagers, who take delight in playing centuries-old bells and find in these groups a way of socialising and learning about their traditions. Hernando himself is a member of one of these associations, Campaneros de Burgos: “We organise concerts and exhibitions, trying to promote the old ringing patterns, and also document, rehearse and practise them.”Engaging with the younger generation has also been one of the principles of Tån:talán, which is why it was designed with mobile phones in mind. The platform includes many features to make it more interactive and appealing to young people. For example, there is a piano where each key produces a different church bell sound, and a trivia game, where people are challenged to correctly identify different patterns. Another feature allows users to deconstruct the sound of each bell into its harmonic notes and tweak them to hear the resulting sound.“It’s a way of attracting young people to this world,” says Silberius. “Because if we don’t get the new generations interested, it will be hard to preserve these traditions.”Explore more on these topicsMusicEuropeSpainHistoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, a self-imposed short, sharp shock has brought order and urgency into my lifeAnandita AbrahamMon 22 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 11.45 EDTShareI’ve always struggled to get out of bed. Life beyond the covers seemed dreadful because it was chilly, vertical, and full of minor inconveniences, such as no milk in the fridge and other people. Lying down, I could simply exist. My day couldn’t get off to a bad start if I refused to start it. I couldn’t wake up on the wrong side of the bed if I stayed snoozing.I wanted to be the kind of person to seize the day instead of lying in bed for hours. I tried keeping my phone on the other side of the room, so I would have to get out of bed to fetch it. But I would simply retrieve it and scurry back into my warm cocoon. My flatmates were instructed to shove me out of bed – that didn’t work either, I just shouted at them. Some mornings, small sips of Red Bull while I was still under the covers were the only thing that finally got me up.I’ve often wondered how it got to this. Perhaps it had to do with myattention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, or that my Indian mother used to wake me up for school by wordlessly turning the big lights on and tearing the sheets off me. Or perhaps I was just lazy.But that all changed when I found out about the 3-2-1 method. The trick is to count down out loud, quickly, and leap out of bed on “one”. No countdowns from 200, and you can’t draw out the numbers slowly.My mornings have been transformed. After the short shock of getting out of bed so quickly, I can now make my coffee slowly – I used to have to skip it altogether when I was in a rush. At noon, I can smugly look back on all the things I’ve done that morning, even if they are as simple as reading the news thoroughly or wearing an outfit I feel confident in, rather than throwing on whatever was closest. I no longer wake up just in time for my first appointment – I now do it early enough to have some time to myself. I’m still not a morning person, but I feel much more productive.There have been times, of course, that I’ve been tempted to ignore the countdown and stay in bed. But the more times I thought this, the more I would feel a scathing sense of embarrassment. My mother was no longer jolting me awake – so why couldn’t I listen to my own voice, trust I was acting in my own best interest, and get up?I realised that the only thing I hate more than not being in bed is feeling as if I don’t have any willpower. I’ve regained the early hours of the day and a sense of control over my own life. I know now that not every morning will be perfect, but they all must be lived.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedSleepHealth & wellbeingAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What can her new book about finding focus teach the rest of us?Mon 22 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 07.51 EDTShareZelana Montminy once had a client who, when he finally looked up from his phone, found love. He was so absorbed in – or distracted by – his work that in his sessions with Montminy, he would often stop talking mid-sentence to check his phone. Montminy asked him to walk outside with her, and to put his phone in his pocket. His eyes darted around uneasily at the people on the busy sidewalk “as if he wasn’t sure what to make of the world”. But after this, while he waited at a crossing one morning, he said hello to the woman beside him. “Finally,” the woman said. “I’ve stood in this spot for two months and you’ve never looked up.”The anecdote serves Montminy’s purpose so well. She could have made it up, but she insists that not only did it happen, but her client and his fellow pedestrian went on to marry.Montminyis a behavioural scientist, author and speaker, whose recent corporate clients include American Express, Coca-Cola and Estée Lauder and whose portfolio of voluntary positions includes the Los Angeles Advisory Council ofCommon Sense Media. You don’t have to look further than the title of her new book to find the moral of this story: Finding Focus – Own Your Attention in an Age of Distraction.The contention that underpins the book is that “our most valuable resource isn’t time. It’s attention” – if only we could take back control of where we place it. Montminy saw this in herself while researching the book, swapping in and out of the “many, many hats” of her own working week.“We are in a crisis of distraction,” she says. “We are constantly task-switching. Our attention has been hijacked in so many ways. And no matter how many hacks we’re doing, we are exhausted. But it’s not from doing too much. It’s from being everywhere and nowhere all at the same time.”View image in fullscreen‘I try to be in nature for a certain chunk of time every day,’ says Montminy.Photograph: Morgan PansingWe are talking on a video call. Montminy, who has three children, a labradoodle, and plenty of opportunity to test out her thoughts about task-switching in the laboratory of daily life, is parked at a mall in westLos Angeles, between an appointment and a meeting. She was at an event last night, then up at 6.20 this morning, and her youngest daughter didnotwant to leave the house for kindergarten, but Montminy looks fresh-faced rather than frazzled.The car is an apt setting, because Montminy was driving when she got the idea for the book – or realised that the book was personally necessary. She had stopped at a red light. “And I reached to look at my phone. It was a very busy work day and I yet again was trying to take on too much.” She was just congratulating herself on managing to send an email in this sliver of time when she became aware of her son calling from the back seat. “Mom!Mom! I’m talking to you!”She hadn’t heard a word he had said. “And I had this total epiphany. I thought: ‘I’m doing the very thing that I always say not to do, and that I don’t ever want [my children] to do.’”In this time that we’re in culturally, everyone has normalised burnout in a way that I think is really dangerousFocus is a crowded field in publishing, so where does Montminy’s book, whichMalcolm Gladwell’s book clubhas picked as a must-read, fit? She mentions Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’sconcept of flowand the work ofSherry Turkleon the impact of digital distractions on relationships.Cal Newportadvocates distraction-free focus in Deep Work – but, Montminy says: “It still broaches the productivity lane … I did not want to write another book about productivity.”In fact, she thinks we have been getting focus all wrong. “Most people think of focus as something we have to do to get things done.” But this makes it all about output. “We have to think about it very differently. Focus,” she says, “is an act of emotional resilience. How do we claim our clarity and presence in a world that commodifies our attention? How do we decide what matters and then protect it?”What Montminy realised, in the car with her son, was that she had fallen into a familiar trap. “I was wearing productivity as a badge of honour.”She has always been good at multitasking. And looking at success in terms of outputs and rewards is “just culturally how I was raised”, she says. “My parents and my sister were born in the Soviet Union [in Moldova] and immigrated [to the US] in the 70s. I’m first generation. And with that comes expectation, adjustment.”What’s different now is that “in this time that we’re in culturally, everyone has normalised burnout in a way that I think is really dangerous”. We kid ourselves that we are resting when really we are merely distracted. “A distraction is something you do to escape the present moment. Resting is a return to presence. Both involve stepping away – but only one of them is restorative.”View image in fullscreenMontminy and her youngest daughter at the Cleobella Mother’s Day Tea Party in May.Photograph: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for CleobellaWhile her previous book,21 Days to Resilience, offered something of a quick fix, Finding Focus is a guidebook to meaningful and lasting change. Montminy herself has transformed the way she lives, and over the past few years has disavowed multitasking and no longer believes in what she calls “the myth of balance”. Rather, she says, there are “seasons”, in which different elements of life – family, work, voluntary roles – require more attention. She normally lives in the affluent Pacific Palisades suburb of Los Angeles, and is quick to point out that she is able to “outsource … accepting help with household cleaning, occasional childcare, and sometimes driving. I used to want to do it all, to be everything to everyone. But that was draining and unsustainable, and it left me scattered instead of present. I’ve had to learn to accept help from family, friends and others, and I don’t want to pretend it’s all me because that only reinforces, especially for women, the false idea that we should shoulder every layer of household and family life alone.”I can’t help noticing that Montminy’s gaze keeps lowering to the passenger seat beside her while she talks. Is she multitasking?“So you saw my attention go? For a moment, right?” she says. There are ants in the car! And while technically they require Montminy to multitask, the ants are a low cognitive demand, and actually, a “glimmer” – a little bit of connection and joy in the day, while she sits there musing. “What a funny life to live in a car. I have trained myself to hold on to those moments,” she says. “How do we build out a tiny, tiny stitch of time within whatever we’re doing to feel that?”I might look up from my desk and just stare and be present with my thoughts. It’s shocking to me how rare that isThe smallness of that “tiny stitch of time” sounds poignant, but Montminy says: “This is why I’m so passionate about focus and attention, because when we notice the small stuff, when we’re focused enough to attune to those moments, that is what makes up a life.”After she had finished writing the book, but before it was due to be published, Montminy’s cherished paths, routines and community were subject to a horribly literal burnout: thePalisades wildfire earlier this year. Thirty-one people died and “there was a colossal loss of infrastructure. The whole community was levelled. My children’s schools, dance studios, dentists, every single sidewalk that they walked and loved.”Montminy’s house was left standing – but everything inside was ruined. Like many others, she and her husband, an investment banker, and their children, are now staying in another part of the city, though they hope to return in a few months. “We lost not just the physical community, but the community itself,” she says. “I wake up some mornings and think it’s all still a dream.”Montminy delayed publication, and while she didn’t rewrite Finding Focus, she felt herself, in the aftermath of the fire, rewritten by it – “rearranged by grief”.“We’re grieving every day as human beings. We grieve ideas of what we thought would happen. We grieve a simpler life. We grieve expectations. We grieve for people and relationships that don’t show up in the way we wanted. We push all that grief down and away. We don’t want to deal with it. And so we distract ourselves. It’s our pacifier.”View image in fullscreenMontminy’s house was one of many affected by the fires in Palisades and Eaton, Los Angeles in January this year.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesMontminy has a gift for practicality, for saying things that make perfect sense in a way that makes you happy to believe you were already thinking them. Some of her recommendations – such as time-blocking – are familiar, but her own daily mental health workout, her effort to choose where to focus, has brought a deeper shift, the feeling that she is engaged in “a daily act of defiance”.It begins when she wakes up and refuses to check her phone first thing – “because that primes your brain for distraction”. She keeps a pad on her desk, “which visually is super-calming”, where she writes anything that comes to mind. “And when I dump it, I can sort of let it go. I clear the mental clutter which frees my working memory for the things I need to get done.”She creates “micro-pauses” in her day. “Even driving without music for 10 minutes is like a daily meditation.” She has at least one phone-free ritual – no phones at dinner, for instance – and tries “to be in nature for a certain chunk of time every day”.Is doom scrolling really rotting our brains? The evidence is getting harder to ignore | Siân BoyleRead moreOne of the hardest elements of her mental fitness regime has been “building up my boredom tolerance, trying to let myself be idle without filling the gap”. She has had to start small – looking out of a window for five seconds, then trying to last a bit longer. Think of it as like building your number of reps in the gym. “I might look up from my desk as a break, and just stare and be present with my thoughts. It’s shocking to me how rare that is.”The aim, she says, is “to arrive every day with more clarity, more agency. If we can sit with those important feelings and work through them, [we can] come out on the other side with growth and learning and strength and resilience.”Zelana Montminy’s Finding Focus is published by Headline (£16.99).

Well, for weeks, I wasn’t. I half-dozed by night and dragged myself through each day; slow, unsmiling and stripped entirely of mojo. Because just as I’d packed away the sleep aids, my cat, Iggy, died.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.You’ve met Iggy. He was that hopelessly beautiful creature who served as muse, home office manager and testing director for every Filter article I’ve ever written, chiefly themattress reviews. TheIkea Valevågtriumphed in his claw-sharpening test, but theOrigin Hybrid Prowas his favourite for sleeping, especially when it was propped up in the hallway awaiting collection by the appropriately named hardship charityScratch. He’d scramble up the cliff face of the mattress’s sleeping surface and curl up atop its edge, carpeting it with his silky white fur. I like to think a few strands are still there, waving in the breeze of a sleeper’s happy snore.Tester in chiefWhen it came to testingsleep aids, Iggy was less a beneficiary and more a test in himself. Would any products knock me out so soundly that I slept through his requests for an early breakfast?Mouldable silicone earplugsdid the trick, blocking high-frequency noises without silencing the bass hum of city life, which I actually find quite soporific. Pressing those soft blobs into my ears felt like switching the light off, and unlike many of the products I tested, they helped me stay asleep rather than just nudging me into unconsciousness. Now, of course, I’d give up sleep in a Faustian deal to hear Iggy wail at 5am again.Towards the end of his unjustly brief 14-ish years, 10 of which he spent with me, he took to curling up beside my head while I slept. In seeking comfort, he gave it in infinite measure. His purr was more soothing than any sounds on theSnoozeBand, and the smell of his fur more ambrosial than anylavender spray.No more need for earplugsView image in fullscreenBig stretch: testing all these mattresses proved hard work.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianHis loss in early August shattered my sleep patterns more than any heatwave could manage. I needed help sleeping, but the context had changed profoundly (I didn’t need earplugs to block pre-dawn miaows); it was my mind, not my body, that kept me awake. A magnesium bath is physiologically calming, but the memory of Iggy playing with my hair while I soaked in the bath powerfully overrode it with a slap of sleep deprivation.My husband and I had to get away. All we wanted was Iggy, but as we couldn’t have him back, the next best thing was a proper sleep. As trite as it seemed, we did at least have a suitcase full of freshly tested, non-pharmaceutical little helpers. Theblackout eye maskproved genuinely essential in a little room in the Lake District, and coupled with the change of scenery, it gave our brains and bodies their first real rest in weeks.We’re now home, testing all sorts of bedding that Iggy would have loved.

He suggests forming them by dropping them into a wine glass of polenta, swirling the glass to coat each malfatti, then poaching. I made them for my parents’ first visit to our new home, and encouraged everyone to get involved by swirling their own; I also made them for weaning (with a little less salt) and got my daughter, Alba, involved as soon as she was old enough to hold a wine glass. They’rethatgood. But now, with not one but two toddlers to contend with, I make life a lot easier by turning them into fritters, and use up the insane quantities of chard from the garden at the same time. This is my homage to Russell’s original.Malfatti fritters with chard and sage butterPrep20 minCook20 minServes2-3350g chard100g parmesan, grated (a vegetarian one, if need be)250g ricotta100g flour1 mediumegg1 tsp sea salt flakesOlive oil, for frying25g salted butter15 sage leavesWash the chard, then put it in a microwaveable bowl for which you have a lid (I use a Pyrex bowl with a snugly fitting plate on top). Cook on high for two minutes, stir, then return to the microwave and cook for another two minutes.Drain the chard, then, once it’s cool enough to handle, squeeze to remove most of the excess water. Tip the chard into a food processor and chop into small pieces – you don’t want a puree, but neither do you want any great big lumps. Add the parmesan, ricotta, flour, egg and salt, then blitz briefly until everything’s just combined.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large, nonstick frying pan. Turn down the heat to medium, then, working in batches, fry heaped tablespoons of the malfatti mix for two to three minutes on each side, until evenly golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll, and repeat with the remaining malfatti batter (keep the cooked fritters warm in a low oven, if you wish).Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small frying pan on a low heat, then add the sage leaves. Turn up the heat to medium, and fry for two to three minutes, until the leaves are lovely and crisp and the butter has browned. (Do watch this, though, and adjust the heat so the butter doesn’t burn.)Serve the malfatti fritters drizzled with the sage butter. They need very little else alongside, but sparkling water or wine would work well.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkQuick and easySnacksFoodCheeseStarterEggsVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We opened our restaurant,Trattoria della Gloria, in Milan in 2023, and instinctively refused to spend every night selling a remote and often fictional past. Instead, we explore and experiment with ancient gestures, methods and pairings to create “new old things”. That is, dishes that our grannies could have made, but didn’t.Green beans carbonara (pictured top)Italy is no country for sauces – most of our meat, fish and vegetable dishes are usually served by themselves, or with just olive oil and little else. Italian sauces do exist, but they are held in captivity by pasta dishes. Carbonara, say, has become a very serious matter, calling for nothing but guanciale (cured pork cheek) and pecorino romano. It’s good, but it’s actually a very recent “tradition”: as a child in north Italy in the 1990s, I had never even heard of guanciale, and our carbonara was just fine.Prep30 minCook30 minServes4, as a side orlight lunch200g guanciale, or unsmoked pancetta1 egg plus 3 egg yolks100g grated pecorino romano, or parmesan, plus extra to finish800ggreen beans, tailedSea salt andblack pepperCut the guanciale (or most likely pancetta) into 5mm strips or cubes and put them in a cold, nonstick frying pan. Turn on the heat to low, then slowly heat up the meat (with no oil), tossing or stirring every now and then, for about eight minutes in total, until the fat starts to melt and the pieces of pork first turn translucent and then go crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried guanciale/pancetta to a plate lined with paper towel, and take the pan off the heat, reserving the very hot fat.In a bowl, whisk the egg, egg yolks, grated cheese and plenty of black pepper for a minute, then pour the hot fat over the top and mix it in very well. The result is essentially a hollandaise with cheese and pork fat (instead of the usual butter).Fill a large pan with water, season with salt, bring to a boil, then add the green beans and cook for six to nine minutes, according to how done you like them.Drain the beans, then divide them between four plates. Taste the sauce and add salt, if need be (unlikely); if it looks a little too thick, loosen with a spoonful of the bean cooking water. Pour the sauce all over the beans, top with the crisp guanciale and more grated cheese and black pepper, then serve.Leftover bread tiramisuView image in fullscreenTommaso Melilli’s leftover bread tiramisu.Savoiardi or boudoir biscuits are often hard to find, but you need them to make tiramisu. That’s why I gave up on them years ago, both at home and at the restaurant, and now I use leftover bread instead. The original name for french toast waspain perdu, meaning “lost bread”, which makes thistiramisu perduto.Prep25 minCook15 minRest20 minAssembly10 minServes86-81cm-thick slices1- to 2-day-old sourdough, crusts left on500ml whole milk100g caster sugar, plus 20g extra for dusting200ml brewed strong coffee500g fridge-coldmascarpone500ml fridge-coldwhipping creamCocoa powder,for dustingHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the sourdough slices on a deep tray, cover with the milk, dust with the 20g caster sugar, then roast for about 15 minutes, until just golden. At this point, the bread should be rising like a very rustic cake. Take it out of the oven and leave to cool to room temperature for about 20 minutes.Once the bread has cooled, pour the coffee all over it and gently turn the slices so they soak up the coffee entirely and you don’t end up with any chewy corners.Meanwhile, make the mascarpone cream. Whisk the mascarpone, 100g sugar and 100ml whipping cream for 30 seconds, then add the remaining cream and beat again, this time slowly, for about 10 minutes, until the cream turns stiff but is still smooth.Using a large spatula, spread half the cream mix over the bottom of a deep, roughly 24cm x 35cm x 5cm glass dish. Using your hands, drain the bread and use it to cover the layer of cream. Dust with cocoa powder, then cover the bread with the remaining cream. The tiramisu doesn’t really need to rest, but an hour in the fridge will be fine. Just before serving, dust with more cocoa powder.Tommaso Melilli is chef and co-owner ofTrattoria Della Gloriain MilanExplore more on these topicsFoodItalian food and drinkPastaDessertMain courseVegetablesSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

He asked his parents, who are both songwriters, to lend him some money for a 3D printer, using some techniques he learned from Shark Tank.“I said to my parents: ‘If you lend me some money to buy a 3D printer, [at first] you’ll get all the profits from the merch I’ll make,’” he says. “‘But once you’ve made your money back, you get 20% of the profits and I get 80%.’”Referring to his dream3D printingbusiness as an “infinite money cycle”, Levi is confident: “3D printing is the way I’m going to make the most money.” He plans to print key chains and badges to sell at festivals and online, and start to repay his parents when sales take off.“When I grow up, I want to start off being employed and learning things from an older person,” he says. “After that, I might start my own business.”Lila, seven: ‘I feel super happy every time I sell a toy’She may be only seven, but Lila has already earned £800 from her business, L’il Toybox, which sells 3D-printed characters on Etsy and at markets and fetes.“At fairs, my dad and I saw other people selling 3D-printed toys, and we thought: ‘We can do better,’” she says.Lila’s father, a web designer, started her off with an initial investment by buying their first 3D printer – a single-colour version – for £200. He helped her get to grips with the technical knowhow of designing and printing each character. Once she had made some profits, Lila’s earnings were enough to upgrade to a multicolour 3D printer, which cost about £500.Lila, who lives in Norfolk, spends about 10 hours a week researching online to see what other people are printing, as well as watching YouTube videos to stay on top of the latest trends. “I also practise playing with things we create to make sure they are good quality and don’t break,” she says.View image in fullscreenLila sells her 3D-printed characters at markets, fetes and on Etsy.Lila and her father have created a variety of animals such as pandas and geckos, and base some of their creations on what is topical, for example, making and selling skeletons and pumpkins before Halloween.Each character takes up to 10 hours to make, although the printer can be left on and unattended. The materials for the smaller ones can cost as little as 50p and Lila sells each piece for between £3 and £8.She has taken £950 from sales and repaid some of the cost of the printer purchase – she repays some each time she attends a fair, and also makes a contribution towards the maintenance costs.“I feel super happy every time I sell a toy,” Lila says. “I like making things with my dad because we get to spend lots of time together.“Having a business, running the stall and taking payments helps me understand maths. It also helps me feel more confident talking to grownups.”Rodgean, 12: ‘Dealing with cash helps me in maths’Rodgean’s reselling business was fuelled by an urge to declutter. He asked his mother whether he could sell old things that were taking up space, such as unwanted toys and clothes and shoes he had outgrown. She was planning to give or throw them away, so she agreed.He markets on Vinted and at car boot sales and sells at least one item daily, basing the price on the quality and age of the item and how many people are interested in it.Rodgean’s business really took off over the summer holidays, when he had more free time to spend on listing and selling items. So far he has made more than £70.He now creates bracelets and scarves to sell alongside his secondhand items, and even plays the ukulele at car boot sales to draw in the crowds. “It feels like a reward at the end of the week to be able to have fun and sell my items,” he says.Rodgean, who is from the Midlands, puts most of what he earns into a savings account for university and uses some of it to reinvest in his business, buying glue and craft equipment and scarves to decorate. He allows himself money for the occasional treat. He also regularly allocates a portion to send to Cancer Research UK.View image in fullscreenRodgean markets on Vinted and at car boot sales.Rodgean says his business and his schoolwork go hand in hand, and he has learned valuable lessons such as about supply and demand. He also learns from the money lessons on his GoHenry app.“Dealing with cash and change helps me in maths, while haggling and negotiating helps my confidence in debating club,” he says. “I use the money skills that I learn from the car boots for my academics, because it helps me understand things in a different way. For example, I increase the value if there are more people, and then I lower it once it settles down.”Rodgean also highlights the environmental benefit of buying and selling secondhand. “It’s not just financially better, it also helps with the environment and prevents waste,” he says. “Selling secondhand is really useful, sustainable – and fun, too.”Skyla, 16: ‘It helps set you up for managing your time’When Skyla from London was given a £30 Snazaroo face-painting kit for her 15th birthday, she could not have imagined how business would be booming only a year later.She began practising on her little brother, and took some pictures, which her mother posted on Facebook, offering Skyla’s services for £30 an hour for birthday parties.Soon, Skyla had her first job and it snowballed from there, with glowing reports of her skills spreading by word of mouth. Social media has been instrumental in spreading the word.View image in fullscreenSkyla (left) built a business after receiving a face-painting kit on her 15th birthday.Skyla also works as a waitress and does a few face-painting parties every month, with business booming over the school holidays. She now charges £60 an hour, and has made profits of about £2,000 so far.“I want to be an artist in the future, so having this business helps me artistically, but it’s also good experience knowing how to promote myself and how to speak to people professionally,” she says.“Running your own business helps set you up for managing your money and your time in the future.”Setting up a businessThere are no specific laws preventing children from running their own sole trader businesses, although you cannot register as a company director until you are 16.While the children’s wellbeing and schools bill, which is going through parliament, aims to update child employment laws, it does not regulate small businesses or side hustles.Everyone needs to pay tax regardless of age, and children have the same annual tax allowance and liabilities as adults.Like adults, children are entitled to a personal tax-free allowance up to £12,570. This is how much income you can earn before you need to pay tax.HM Revenue and Customs has anonline calculatorto work out if you owe any tax.Explore more on these topicsEntrepreneursYoung peopleChildrenConsumer affairsSmall business3D printingE-commercefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This particular oasis was a perfect circle of inky, deliciously cold-looking water. Only problem was, it was 10 metres below the trail. I took a deep breath and channelled my inner Tom Daley. One, two, three – go! I leapt into the void and plummeted like a stone – points deducted for the huge splash as I hit the water.When I came up for air, I had the cenote, or sinkhole, to myself, barring the birds nesting in the craggy rocks that formed it. I floated on my back and watched as a black vulture tried to coax her fluffy chick to take its first flight. Who knew carrion-eaters were so cute?View image in fullscreenThe Yaal Utzil cenote is one of many along theCamino del Mayab, a 68-mile (110km) walking and cycling trail near Mérida on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. The trail opened in 2020, but follows historic paths; walkers and cyclists can tackle it independently or go on a guided tour. I was walking it over five days with a couple from Hong Kong and our guide, Misa Poot.Before the journey, I met the co-founder of the camino, Alberto Gutiérrez Cervera. He took up walking with friends while at university in Mérida. Inspired by the success of the Camino de Santiago in Europe, he decided to turn his student hikes into a Mexican pilgrimage route, offering a more sustainable form of tourism than, say, the nearby resorts of Cancún on the peninsula’s Caribbean coast.Rachel Dixon jumps into a cenote on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula – videoAlberto showed me around Mérida, the “white city”, and introduced me to Maya history and culture. Many tourists visiting ancient sites such as Chichén Itzá assume the Maya are a long-dead civilisation, but they are very much alive in Yucatán today. However, Alberto explained, modern Maya often face poverty and prejudice.Mérida was founded by Spanish conquistadors in 1542, but it was built on the site – and using the stones – of an ancient Maya city, Ti’ho. Alberto took me to the Palacio de Gobierno on Plaza Grande, where powerful murals by Fernando Castro Pacheco tell the brutal story of the conquest. Of all Indigenous groups, the Maya held out the longest against the invaders and led uprisings against them – during the Caste war of the 19th century, they almost recaptured Mérida.Early the next morning, it was time to start walking. As we were in the driest season (April/May), we would set off at 6am to beat the heat, and walk only about nine miles a day. Humberto Choque, our driver, would transfer the luggage while Misa led the walks.We set off from Xmatkuil, just outside Mérida. It was easy going; Yucatán is largely flat and the paths are well maintained. Misa, an ornithologist, pointed out birds as we walked: bright orange orioles, yellow-bellied flycatchers, turquoise motmots, even a couple of parrots.Misa pointed out birds as we walked: bright orange orioles, yellow-bellied flycatchers, turquoise motmots, even a couple of parrotsWe were scheduled to stop at Hacienda Yaxnic; the region is known for its haciendas as well as its cenotes. I had pictured a colonial country house and fantasised about a cool drink on a shady terrace. What I discovered was a hulking ruin – picturesque, but abandoned. I would soon find out why.We continued our walk to San Antonio Tzacalá, where we met a young historian at the community library built by proceeds from the camino. His lecture shed light on our journey. The haciendas, originally owned by the Spanish, grew rich on what was effectively Maya slave labour. The whole region was once devoted to growing a monocrop,henequen(a kind of agave) that was so valuable for making rope it was known as “green gold”. The paths we were walking were miniature railroads, where “trucs” (carts) trundled the leaves from the plantations to the hacienda to be processed.After this sobering talk, we were invited to a local home for lunch. Our hosts taught us how to makerecado rojo, a spice paste in numerous Yucatán dishes, most famouslycochinita pibil(slow-roasted pork). For us, it was used to marinate chicken or flavour potato cakes (my vegan option), served with rice, refried beans and salad.View image in fullscreenSmall restaurants have opened on the trail to serve hikersThe camino has brought employment to villagers such as this host family; 80% of the income generated by the tours stays in the 14 communities it passes through. Without it, many would be forced to leave to find low-paid work in Mérida. Now, more people can continue their traditional ways of life on themilpa: smallholdings used to grow corn, beans and squash, and raise a few chickens, turkeys or goats. Later on the walk, we visited a woman who also keeps melipona bees, a small stingless variety revered throughout Maya history, but now endangered.The camino has brought employment to villagers who serve lunch from their homesAfter lunch, we drove to a new ecological centre, built partly in recompense for the environmental damage caused bythe controversial Tren Mayarailway, which opened in 2023. Here, we learned that Yucatán’s cenotes were formed by the Chicxulub asteroid that hit 66m years ago. Before that, the peninsula was underwater; on later parts of the route, we saw fossilised sea creatures underfoot.We heard about efforts to protect the landscape, including the establishment of the surrounding Cuxtal Ecological Reserve. This forested region is home to 168 species of birds. Another aim of the camino is to educate local people, as well as visitors, about the value of the land – not as a commodity to sell to developers, but as a precious habitat, carbon store and water source (the reserve provides 50% of Mérida’s water).In the late afternoon, we arrived at our first cenote, Sambulá, an underground cave with clear, shallow water. Cave swallows swooped overhead, snatching insects as we swam. By the time we emerged, Misa and Humberto had erected five tents. We had dinner with a family who taught us each a phrase in the Yucatec Mayan language: mine was “Ma’alob ak’ab”, or “Good night”. I was certainly ready for bed, and slept soundly despite the hard ground, waking to birdsong.View image in fullscreenHikers stop for a swim at an underground cenoteOver the four days that followed, we settled into our routine of walking, visiting, swimming – and eating. The food was hearty home cooking such aspoc chuc(citrus-marinated grilled pork),salbutes(deep-fried tortillas with various toppings) andpanuchos(similar but stuffed with black beans). I was offered vegan versions, or alternatives such astortitas de chaya(maize fritters mixed with a spinach-like green). One family had opened a small restaurant after honing their skills hosting walkers.We swam in cenotes every day. One was warmed by the sun and half-covered in water lilies; others were below ground, with spooky stalactites and stalagmites. Unlike cenotes elsewhere in Yucatán, which I had shared with coachloads of visitors, these were blissfully empty.One of the haciendas we stopped at had been turned into ahotel. I got my wish, sipping a margarita by the pool, but felt uncomfortable in light of its history. Another was now amuseum. Our guide, in his 70s, had worked there all his life. He showed us the jail cells – holes in the ground – where workers were once imprisoned for minor misdemeanours.View image in fullscreenHikers explore the ruins of the Tzacalá hacienda in southern MéridaViva Zapotec! A thriving ecotourism project in Mexico’s Oaxaca stateRead moreWe spent our second night in cabanas and the last two in ahotel. Misa and Humberto, both in their 20s, were lively company, introducing us to Mexico’s melodramatic telenovelas – Abyss of Passion! Fire in the Blood! – playing us songs by its most-loved crooners and teaching us Latin dance steps.On our last day, we ventured down to a candlelit underground cenote, where we took part in a moving closing ceremony led by a Maya shaman (the intended final stop on the walk, the archaeological site of Mayapán, is currently closed). We were encouraged to reflect not just on our journey, but our lives. There wasn’t a dry eye among us.I had been prepared for a long, hot walk punctuated with cooling dips, but the Camino del Mayab is far more than that. It is a chance to learn about the Maya way of life – and help sustain it for generations to come.The trip was provided byCamino del Mayab; the five-day all-inclusive tour is 14,900 Mexican dollars (about £580); next available tours 12-16Novand 12-16 Dec.

The process involves giving up the illusion of control and discovering the liberation and limits of your own agencyMoya SarnerMon 22 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareIam emerging into the light after the first chapter of potty training our toddler. This involved not leaving the house for several days and gleefully shouting, “No more nappies!” as our daughter ran around bare-bummed and we began learning together how to get the poo and wee in the potty. I’m finding it a fascinating process – as well as messy, devastating and joyful. I learned a lot from readingOh Crap! Potty Training, by Jamie Glowacki; one particular line hit me like the smell of new poo all over our cream carpet: “If you put pressure on the process, it will collapse.”This is not only true of potty training. Sex, relationships, learning, play, recovery – these are processes that need to unfold in their own way and time, because under pressure they will warp, buckle and collapse. Understanding this is key to building a better life – but it is much easier to know this cognitively than it is to actually live it.We might say, “No pressure”, but saying something does not make it so. We suffer from a profound and painful longing for things to be done right away – for there to be, instead of a process, a button to press that makes it happen. I wonder if it was this unconscious wish for immediacy that led humankind to develop machines and technology. Perhaps the inventors of the button in the late 19th century were driven by their frustration about the time it takes to grow and develop and learn and form relationships and raise children, and they created something that makes an instant change. You press a button and something happens – a light goes on or a sound comes out or an explosion goes off. This is seductive for so many of us; it gives the intoxicating illusion of control. Whenever we get home, as soon as my daughter sees the doorbell, she says: “I want to press button.” Like many other children and indeed adults, she enjoys pressing her mother’s buttons, too.We live in an era when so much can be achieved so quickly by the press of a button and its close relative, the stroke of a screen, that it is difficult to accept that many things do not work that way. Being in a process is a very different beast. A button works perfectly under pressure; a process may collapse. A button is easy to press; a process can be hard to bear. A process involves giving up the illusion of control and instead discovering the liberation and limits of one’s own agency, as well as accepting you don’t know things and tolerating being a beginner. I have realised in psychoanalysis just how abominable all this feels to me – and that’s part of why I’m still in it.As a new patient, I wanted instant results, and convinced myself that I had already changed, had already grown out of my difficulties after just a few months. Fortunately my analyst declined my invitation to collude with my fantasy that I could bypass the painful, difficult and complex process of real internal growth, which is not linear, and which develops from the inside out. Instead, she offered me her thoughts about what was truly going on for me unconsciously, as well as her capacity to bear the feelings I wanted to control-alt-delete.This experience has shaped my view that it is absolutely crucial that a therapist is able to identify the inevitable conscious and unconscious pressures coming from a patient, and to draw attention to them. The therapist might then be able to open up the possibility to explore that pressure, so the patient might have thoughts and feelings about it, to understand where it comes from and how it plays out in their internal and external worlds, in their past and present. It was a tremendous relief for me to discover that my analyst was able to be separate from me in this way, to have thoughts about the pressure I suffered, rather than be crushed by it, like me.Am I advocating some kind of loosey-goosey, anything-goes, pooing-on-the-carpet anarchy as the only alternative to pressure? I am not. I think this assumption, that there can only be two alternatives – pressure or “anything goes” – can make it very difficult for us to find our way through any kind of developmental process, alone or with a partner, friend, colleague, child, patient or therapist.Being in a process is what it means to build a life – in childhood as in adulthood, with its better times, its worse times and everything in between. I realise this all over again every time I argue with my husband and we find a way to repair. And every time I come out of a session with my analyst and I feel completely lost. And every time my daughter has an accident and I say: “Next time, you need to try to do it in the potty.”Although it is painful and frustrating to recognise that nothing meaningful can be fixed by pressing a button, I also find it grounding. It’s a relief to recognise that I’m in all these processes and each has its own life, and although I have agency, I am not in control of their trajectories. This understanding, which ebbs and flows and is not always with me, brings me hope that feels rooted in ordinary reality, rather than a chimeric, filtered, blemish-free selfie fantasy. It can feel quite subversive in our times of cancelling and culture wars and swiping left or right. It leaves me feeling freer, more fulfilled and more real.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodExplore more on these topicsMental healthHow to build a better lifeCounselling and therapyChildrenHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some kinds have been linked topoor waste removalfrom the brain.“Any time we perform a task, the area of the brain responsible for that task needs more blood,” says Carare. “That forces the blood vessels to open up and feed the brain. When they do, they also help clear waste. For both processes to work, the vessel walls need to be flexible.”Doing a puzzle stimulates blood flow, even to slightly compromised vessels in the brain, which helps maintain functionsGenetics, conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes, as well as lifestyle choices such as smoking and poor diet, can lead to a stiffening of these walls, making the brain less efficient at getting nutrients in and clearing toxins out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She had hoped to work in a university after she graduated.Instead, Nahid now spends her mornings at a religious school in the basement of a mosque in the western city of Herat, sitting on the floor and reciting scripture with 50 other women and girls, all dressed in black from head to toe.She knows theTalibanis “trying to change women’s minds”, but says she attends the class because, “it’s the only way I can leave my home and fight depression”. The incentive of 1,000 Afghanis (£11) she receives every month also helps.Nahid’s story is not unusual. A Guardian andZan Timesinvestigation across eight of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces has revealed the Taliban’s deliberate and calculated efforts to make religiousstudies the only education option available to women and girls in Afghanistan.After firstexcluding women and girls from secondary schooland further education more than four years ago, the regime has been building a large network of religious schools that promote a new alternative.There were more than21,000 Islamic religious schools, or madrasas, across Afghanistanby the end of last year, according to reports. Between September 2024 and February 2025, the Taliban built or laid foundations for nearly50 new madrasasacross 11 provinces.The schools are run by mullahs in the mosque or in their homes, for which they receive a salary from the education ministry. To staff the schools, the ministry has issued teaching certificates to 21,300 former madrasa students that allow them to teach at high school, undergraduate or even postgraduate level at universities.Families have been left with few alternatives since girls were excluded from secondary education and often find themselves pressed or incentivised into enrolling their children, especially daughters, in religious schools.View image in fullscreenAfter the Taliban stopped their secondary education, some older girls continue to attend classes in underground schools, such as this one in Herat.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyThe mullahs also have an incentivise to fill the classroom as more pupils mean a higher salary. As community leaders and conduits for aid, they wield enormous power over most people’s daily lives.Karima, from the south-western Nimroz province, pulled her two daughters out of school at the request of the local mullah. “He said he would give us food aid if I sent them to his class,” she says. “But in the end, nothing came.”Another mother, Nasreen, says she was told: “Send your daughters to our religious classes or you get nothing.”The result is a steady reshaping of community norms. Families who resist face isolation and hunger. Those who comply often watch their daughters return home more rigid and critical in their thinking, sometimes denouncing their own parents as “infidels”. Even job opportunities, reports suggest, are reserved for families whose daughters attend religious classes.In the girls’ primary schools that remain open, the impact is visible. Class sizes are much smaller. In Nimroz, one teacher says that 57 of her pupils left for madrasas this year. “Before, each grade had four sections with 40 students. Now we have three sections with only 20 to 25.”Even those who stay often attend both institutions, spending mornings in the madrasa and afternoons in school, until pressure mounts and they drop out of non-religious education altogether.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Teachers report falling school rolls as girls leave for madrasas.Photograph: Lynsey Addario/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, experienced teachers with university degrees have been barred from teaching. Their replacements are often teenage former madrasa pupils with no educational training but strong ideological credentials.In the western province of Farah, a headteacher recalls being ordered to dismiss five qualified teachers. One of their replacements was appointed despite being unable to read fluently; her only qualifications, says the head, were that she had connections with officials and held a certificate from a religious school.The curriculum in madrasas is narrow: memorising theQur’an, the Taliban’s interpretations of Islamic law, gender roles, and rules about dress and behaviour. No mathematics or science are studied.Textbooks are imported from Pakistan and printed in Pashto, the language of the ethnic group from where the Taliban emerged. This is even the case in Dari-speaking regions (Dari and Pashto are the two main official languages in Afghanistan), leaving many children struggling to understand.Taliban launch crackdown on Afghanistan’s secret beauty salonsRead moreActivists say even international aid is being siphoned off to support madrasas. In one case, stationery donated by Unicef to a public school was diverted to a mullah’s class; the school janitor was told to record the pilfered supplies as being “misplaced”, says a schoolteacher.The expansion of madrasas is also reshaping Afghanistan’s job market. Civil servants with years of training are being replaced by teenagers with just madrasa certificates. In Nimroz, one activist recalls a woman with a bachelor’s degree and 20 years’ experience at the women’s affairs department being dismissed without explanation. Her replacement was a 17-year-old madrasa graduate. “Now everyone understands. If you want a job, forget university. Go to the madrasa.”The message has filtered down. The girls that were interviewed say they no longer dream of becoming doctors or engineers. Instead, they see madrasa certificates as safer and increasingly the only qualification that counts.For Nahid, the economics student who felt obliged to become a madrasa pupil, the paradox is cruel. The classes offer her a reprieve from isolation and depression, but only within the confines of an ideology she rejects. “If I stay home, I will lose my mind,” she says. “If I go, at least I see other women.”Explore more on these topicsWomen under the TalibanRights and freedomWomen's rights and gender equalityTalibanAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaIslamReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has not left the UK since and has no criminal convictions. He had two strokes in 2019 that left him with speech and mobility issues.George has endured periods of homelessness and says he has lost count of the number of friends who have given him shelter over the years. He says he no longer has any close family inNigeria.“I don’t know how many different sofas I’ve slept on, too many to count,” he said.George had made various applications for leave to remain in the UK, which theHome Officerejected. He said he was overjoyed to finally have the fear of deportation lifted after the judge’s ruling.“I’m so happy I don’t know what to say,” he said. “My life has just begun again. Before I didn’t have hope, but now by God’s grace I can move forward with my life.”His previous solicitors submitted a forged entry stamp in his passport in 2005, and have subsequently been reported to the police and legal regulatory bodies.George said he knew nothing about the passport stamp until many years later. His current lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC Solicitors, cited his poor previous legal representation as the reason for George’s problems resolving his immigration status.A Home Office rejection of his case before his successful appeal states: “It’s open to your family and friends to visit you in Nigeria.”The immigration tribunal judge who granted George the right to remain in the UK referred in his ruling to the fact that the solicitor who submitted the fake passport stamp had been struck off. He said George had stopped going to see his GP because of fears about his immigration status.“It is unfortunate that the appellant went on to suffer two cardiovascular attacks having refrained from going for health checks,” the judge said, adding that George has been destitute while in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other bodies were found when they dug further, to a depth of 30cm.Research conducted by Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at Goldsmiths, University of London, using satellite analysis and images shared by SFHR from the site, confirmed that a minimum of 36 skulls could be identified. SFHR’s researchers believe there are more than 300 bodies at the site based on their own counts but said they could not take pictures of all of them because of time constraints.Forensic Architecture confirmed that the site was probably used as a mass grave by identifying the clearing of the land and the emergence of track marks over a period of time.“There were so many bodies visible, I couldn’t imagine I would see something like that. These were people who might have once walked beside me on the streets and now here were there skeletons,” said a member of SFHR’s team, whose identity has been concealed for fear of reprisals. “The scene was horrific. We all froze from that first moment we stepped into the pit and saw so many corpses superficially buried there.”They said the bodies were buried in an undignified manner, without respect for local customs. They found many bodies were probably in the clothing they were wearing when they were killed. Some were blindfolded. They said there were no signs of military uniforms or equipment in the graves.SFHR’s first informant told them that the bodies buried in the mass graves belonged both to people killed shortly after detention and those who had been detained for several years. They were not necessarily militants but were suspected of collaborating with them; however, they had been executed without any legal process or substantial evidence.Another source confirmed the site south of al-Arish city and said he had witnessed an execution of 15 people there, after which soldiers had placed weapons next to their bodies and the next day claimed in a statement that they had killed 15 terrorists in a clash.The wife of a man who was arrested during a mass raid in 2016 alongside his father and brothers said that nine years later the family are still trying to find information about their relatives but are constantly told by security forces to give up.“We have lived in fear. Nine years is a long time and we have lived without any news. I was scared to ever look through the statements of the military spokesperson, to see their names and pictures among those ‘liquidated’,” she said.The woman said the family were ordinary civilians. Her mother-in-law would go to meet recently released prisoners and ask about their family, but found no information.She said the family has struggled since most of the men in the family were arrested and others fled Sinai for fear of the same happening to them. The women fend for themselves by baking bread and selling it locally.She also has a young son, who she was pregnant with at the time of her husband’s arrest, and has been looking after the daughter of one of the brothers whose wife had died prior to his arrest.“It’s hard to see my son grow up knowing nothing of his his father other than a picture,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking. Not a single night of these past nine years have I slept without tears running down my cheeks.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptIslamic StateHuman Rights ActMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

On the edge of theAmazon rainforest, it was where her story played out for five years, from enduring the Covid pandemic, to watching her two children get into the university.But in March everything changed. An eviction notice gave them and their neighbours 30 days to vacate their apartments. One by one, all 12 families were forced out. “It was very painful,” Freitas said.The reason, she was told, was that the building’s owner planned to convert all of the flats into short-term rentals for Cop30, the annual climate summit which is scheduled to take place in the Brazilian city in November.This year’s summit, which began with an idealistic dream that the world would come to see the climate crisis for themselves in the rainforest, is increasingly enmeshed in anger and recriminations over sky-high accommodation costs and accusations that poorer countries are being forced out of the meetings.Freitas’s story has become an all too common one in a city which, even before it was chosen to host the summit, was suffering a housing shortage and the country’ssecond-highest rental costs.“Cop30 was just the cherry on top,” said Priscilla Santos, the co-founder of theRede Amazônidas pelo Climathinktank. She credits the big real estate companies that operate in the city with triggering the lodging crisis.“They immediately moved to secure exclusive deals with high-end property owners and promised to rent them out to foreigners at outrageous prices,” she said.Local government picked up the idea and Cop30 was presented as a money-making opportunity onsocial mediaand beyond.Promotional materialfound by the Guardian encouraged local people to “take advantage of this great opportunity to earn even more”.View image in fullscreenThe Belém skyline seen from a river boat.Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/APLured by the prospect of once-in-a-lifetime profits, landlords soon started favouring short-term rentals for Cop30 at the expense of the city’s residents.Freitas’s husband, who is an Uber driver, spent the 30 days after their eviction notice scanning the streets for rental listings. Each time the conversations were the same: “Is it for Cop? No? Then we’re not renting to you.”It was clear from the beginning that Belém would not haveenough hotel roomsfor the 50,000-odd people expected to attend the summit, so resorting to private homes was always a condition for the event to happen. But the way it has played out has in some cases been unfortunate.Giovana Silva* moved with her husband to a three-bedroom house with a back yard in February 2024, when the couple decided to start a family.A year into the three-year fixed-rate lease, however, the landlord approached them. In exchange for agreeing to vacate the house in November, Silva and her husband were offered about a tenth of the landlord’s expected profits from Cop30 rentals.The verbal agreement included some remodelling of the property, which was supposed to last a week. Instead, it dragged on for almost three months. “The worst part was being confined to our bedroom, the only part of the house that remained undisturbed,” Silva said.Silva is pregnant and it pains her to think of what’s to come: stripping the house of anything remotely personal, moving in with the in-laws for a month, and not knowing how the guests will treat her home or what it will look like when she returns. “It’s much too little money for such a heavy burden,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To them the coverage seems colonial and stereotypical. Despite all the challenges, they are adamant that they want to host the summit, which Santos says is more than a symbolic choice.“We need people to come here and see the Amazon for what it really is, beyond exotified or romanticised notions,” she said.The event has already created a ripple effect. “Everyday people have started to perceive themselves as being affected by the climate crisis. This discussion, once niche, has now become commonplace,” Santos said.“The lady who cleans my house, who months ago confused Cop with the football World Cup [Copa, in Brazilian Portuguese], not only recognises the international importance of the event, but she now understands what climate change is and how it affects her life,” said the lawyer Ieda Andrade.Andrade foundedConexão Cop30, an accommodation micro-platform that connects hosts and guests by word of mouth. Like hers, a number of others emerged in recent months – including a Christian-led community-based accommodationplatform– as locals strive to offer affordable alternatives to Cop attenders.“The Belenense are a welcoming people and we are making a genuine, heartfelt effort to accommodate everyone who wishes to come,” said Santos.With the help of a lawyer, Freitas managed to get an extra 30 days to vacate her apartment. After two months her family finally secured a new place to live – one that is more expensive, less connected and much farther from her mother’s new address.That’s home for now. But whether it will remain so once the summit is over is yet to be seen. “With the construction and renovations all over town, we hope to have more and better options,” Freitas said.Regardless of what the future holds, she insists on clarifying that she is not at all against Cop30. “We want to be a part of this discussion,” she said.* Name changed at interviewee’s requestExplore more on these topicsCop30BrazilAmericasClimate crisisAmazon rainforestnewsShareReuse this content"

The storm skirted the Pacific coast of Mexico with minimal disruption, eventually dissipating to the west of Baja California on Tuesday, but the remnants went on to cause havoc on Thursday. Residual moist air from the tropical storm was drawn north-east towards California, bringing heavy downpours and thunder to central and southern counties.The heaviest rainfall was in the mountains of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where up to 68mm (2.67in) fell in a few hours. Further north, Death Valley – famously one of the driest places on Earth – received 15mm of rain, triple the average rainfall for September and a full quarter of the yearly average.This led to flash flooding and mudslides, some powerful enough to carry trees and rocks. Debris buried homes and covered roads, trapping several drivers, and killing a two-year-old boy travelling in a car swept away by flood water.InNew Zealand, a very active weather front travelled slowly north-east across South Island on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue wind and rain warnings across most of the island, including a rare red wind warning for the whole of the Canterbury region. Large swathes of the island received more than 50mm of rain as the heavy downpours lingered, with Aoraki Mount Cook recording 83mm in six hours. Wind gusts widely reached 50-60mph, with far higher speeds over the mountains, topping out at 139mph on Mount Hutt.Though the front weakened somewhat as it moved towards North Island on Sunday, lower parts of the island were also battered by wind and rain. Across both islands, hundreds of homes lost power, trains were cancelled, and major roads were flooded. There was little let-up for western parts of South Island, which is being lashed by further heavy rain after a second front moved in during Sunday night. While winds this time are not so severe, similar amounts of rainfall are expected.SouthernmostChinais bracing for Super Typhoon Ragasa, which is skirting the northern tip of the Philippines as it barrels towards an expected landfall on Wednesday. CForecasts suggest Ragasa will hit the Leizhou peninsula before crossing the Gulf of Tonkin towards northern Vietnam.

Western diplomats were reportedly turned away from observing the trial.Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a media freedom NGO, said on Saturday that Zhang had been sentenced to four years in prison.The sentencing came 16 months after she was released following afour-year sentenceon the same charge. Zhang provoked the ire of the authorities after she travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the initial response to the Covid-19 outbreak. She was one of a number of independent journalists to be detained for broadcasting reports about the severe lockdown at ground zero of the pandemic.Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said reports of Zhang’s rearrest and sentencing were “deeply disturbing”.He said: “This is the second time Zhang has been convicted and subjected to a custodial sentence for this offence. We call for her immediate and unconditional release.”Zhang Zhan: who is the Chinese citizen journalist facing a second trial?Read moreAleksandra Bielakowska, an advocacy manager for RSF, said Zhang’s sentence was “utterly appalling, adding that the citizen journalist “should be celebrated globally as an ‘information hero’, not trapped in brutal prison conditions”.Zhang is thought to have lived underclose surveillancesince being released in May last year after her first four-year term in prison. In August 2024, she was detained and later charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, with her indictment citing posts on social media that “seriously damaged the country’s image”. The authorities have not publicly confirmed what the specific offending social media posts were.During Zhang’s first spell in prison she went on hunger strike and there were reports of her being force-fed.Yalkun Uluyol, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Zhang’s politically motivated imprisonment is the price she pays for investigating the government’s wrongdoings as a citizen journalist and activist who dared to challenge the official narrative of the [Chinese] Communist party. Authorities should drop all charges and immediately and unconditionally release Zhang Zhan. Other governments should publicly raise her case with Beijing and press for her freedom.”According to RSF, there are at least 124 media workers imprisoned in China. The country ranked 178th out of 180 territories in the 2025 RSF world press freedom index. Only North Korea and Eritrea rank lower.The Chinese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsChinaPress freedomJournalist safetyAsia PacificCoronavirusNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Canadian company, part-owned by China’s Anta Group, had partnered with a Chinese artist, Cai Guo-Qiang, who oversaw similar shows for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.The organisers said the display used biodegradable, environmentally friendly materials, that all stock herds had been relocated and wildlife had been coaxed away with salt bricks. It said the project had passed tests in line with those set by the2022 Beijing Winter Olympicsand abided by pollution management standards equivalent to those in Japan and Europe.But videos of the display posted online by the brand were met with a barrage of criticism, accusing the brand of acting against its environmentally aware image and calling for boycotts.“Imagine selling $800 jackets for mountain lovers, then nuking the mountains,” said one commenter on Instagram. “The global climate is already getting worse, and these damn people really don’t leave any way for wild animals and plants to survive,” said a Weibo user.On Sunday, Arc-teryx and Cai issued apologies for the event, with the company saying the display “was out of line with Arc’teryx’s values”.“The event was in direct opposition to our commitment to outdoor spaces, who we are and who we want to be for our people and our community,” it said on its officialInstagram page, adding that it was “addressing this directly with the local artist involved and our team in China”.“The public’s criticism has alerted us that the evaluation of the expression of art needs to be more professional and we need to be more humble and respectful of nature,” it said.Cai posted his “sincere apologies”, telling his Weibo followers that there were “many oversights on our part” and pledging to help with any cleanup work needed.The Tibetan plateau and its mountains are sacred to Tibetan Buddhists. The region has been tightly controlled since it was annexed by China in the 1950s and authorities strictly limit the activities of ethnic Tibetans. In recent years the region has become a popular tourist destination for travellers from other parts of China, leading to concerns about environmental damage and overcommercialisation.Trump’s reported pause on Taiwan weapons aid sparks fears he is using island for China trade dealRead moreA county environmental bureau official told local media on Saturday that the event had been given prior approval after government meetings and was compliant. He said no environmental assessment was required because the materials were environmentally friendly. “For now, the local ecology does not appear to be damaged,” he added.However, after the backlash, the Shigatse government and Communist party branch launched an investigation.On Monday, the China Advertising Association said it was “disappointed” in Arc’teryx for not having “explored more positive marketing strategies”.“The display, under the guise of ‘respecting nature’, potentially harmed the environment, ultimately eroding years of trust,” it said in a statement.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaTibetAsia PacificRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister warned threats to annex parts of Palestine and permanently displace Palestinians could end any chance at peace.“Such conduct risks putting a two-state solution beyond reach,” Albanese said.Albanese and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, have stressed Australia is not a central player in Middle East politics but can use its status as a smaller power to voice support for a ceasefire and an end to the conflict.Albanese has cultivated close ties to leaders including Macron, Britain’s Keir Starmer and Mark Carney of Canada.The leaders are adjusting to a shifting international order, in part due to Trump’s America First approach to foreign policy.Members of Netanyahu’s far-right government have been pushing to annex the occupied West Bank for years. The ultranationalist finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has discussed plans to annex more than 80% of the West Bank. Australia has sanctioned Smotrich and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, alleging they have incited violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.Responding to Albanese’s announcement of immediate recognition, Netanyahu warned a Palestinian state was “not going to happen” and told world leaders to “stand by”.“There will be no Palestinian state to the west of the Jordan River,” Netanyahu said.Netanyahu has the backing of the US president,Donald Trump, for his hardline management of the war, sparked by the 7 October attacks, despite being isolated from many other international leaders.Albanese urged the international community to cooperate.“Working together, we can build a future where instead of children in Gaza dying in pain, living in fear or being taught to hate, they can go to school, build a ‘life in larger freedom’, aspire to raise children of their own.”Before the formal announcement on Palestinian recognition, a group of 25 Republican lawmakers – including Texas senator and Trump loyalist Ted Cruz – wrote to Albanese and his UK, French and Canadian counterparts urging a rethink of the decision.Describing recognition as a “reckless policy that undermines prospects for peace”, the lawmakers warned the move would put the countries at odds with a longstanding US position and “may invite punitive measures in response”.Ley replied to the lawmakers on Monday (Australian time) to assure them the decision does not have bipartisan support in Australia, and would be reversed if theCoalitionwon the next election.She said Australia’s national interest would be served through a US-backed process, which she said could only be achieved after Hamas was removed from Gaza and all of the hostages captured in the 7 October attacks were released.Ley said the Albanese government pushed ahead with recognition despite these “crucial conditions” not being met.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has made clear Hamas has no role in a future Palestinian state.“In this time of global uncertainty I want to affirm that millions of Australians remain committed to our enduring friendship with the United States and our Alliance,” Ley’s letter said.“We cannot allow our relationship to drift, which we have unfortunately seen under our current Prime Minister, including on the matter you have raised.”Ley confirmed in the letter plans to travel to the US later this year, her first overseas trip as opposition leader.So farno meeting with Trump has been scheduledon the sidelines of the UN general assembly,despite significant effort from the Australian side.Albanese has leaders meetings scheduled across the week and will likely come face to face with Trump at a cocktail party for world leaders, hosted by the US on Wednesday.The Simon Wiesenthal Center, based in Los Angeles, hit out at Australia’s recognition of Palestine’s statehood on Monday. Named for the legendary Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter, the organisation is a global Jewish human rights organisation.Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the US centre’s director of global social action, said if governments truly cared about humanitarian crises, “they would demand the immediate release of every last hostage before Hamas kills them all”.In the past, both sides ofAustralian politicssupported Australia a two-state solution as the only pathway to a secure and peaceful resolution between Israelis and Palestinians.Allies’ recognition of Palestine angers Netanyahu – but his options for response are limitedRead moreThe Executive Council of Australian Jewry president, Daniel Aghion, said recognition would not bring peace.“Far from creating momentum towards a two-state peace, recognition of a Palestinian state in these circumstances will set the process back. Recognition must come at the end of a peace process not during the conflict.”Separately Albanese could meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in New York to discuss Australia’s bid to hostthe Cop31 climate summit. Turkey is bidding for hosting rights, and if neither country withdraws, the event will default to Bonn, Germany, despite strong support for Australia.The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, met with his counterpart in New York to try to reach a breakthrough.Wong oversaw an event to mark new codified protection for aid workers in conflict zones.

She wrote on social media: “My heart is whole again … Oh how I can’t wait to have my dear daughter in MY arms.”The IUD scandal and the “parenting competence” tests have shone a spotlight in recent years on Denmark’s current and historical treatment of Greenland, which remains part of the Danish commonwealth after ceasing to be a colony in 1953.It is believed that 4,500 women and girls, some of them as young as 12 at the time, were fitted with IUDs without their knowledge or consent between 1966 and 1970 by Danish doctors in an apparent attempt to reduce the population of Greenland.Greenland’s former prime minister Múte B Egede has described Denmark’s actions as “genocide”.Frederiksen’s announcement – her most concrete remarks yet on reparations – comes amid intense international pressure, particularly from the US, which has repeatedly threatened to acquire the Arctic territory since Donald Trump took office. Denmark formallyapologised for the scandalin August.The prime minister said she would discuss the plan for the fund with her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, in Nuuk on Wednesday.“On behalf of Denmark, I have apologised to the women affected in the IUD case and for the failures for which Denmark is otherwise responsible, where Greenlanders have been systematically treated differently and inferiorly than other citizens of the kingdom,” she said.“I look forward to the opportunity to mark the official apology in Nuuk together with the president of the Greenlandic parliament. We cannot change what has happened, but we can take responsibility and we can create the conditions for reconciliation with the past.”Victims of the scandal welcomed the announcement. Bula Larsen, who is among the 143 women who sued the Danish state for 45m Danish kroner for what they describe as a violation of their human rights, said she was still awaiting news of their case but that the latest announcement was a sign of progress. “It seems like that Denmark is willing to make an effort to acknowledge that the state has violated our human rights,” she told the Guardian.The chilling policy to cut Greenland’s high birth rate – podcastRead moreAviaja Fontain, whose mother, Hedvig Frederiksen, was fitted with an IUD at the age of 14 without her knowledge, said the announcement made her feel as if “they finally won”.She said: “After three years of fighting, hearing that she is making a fund feels like she is acknowledging that they crossed our human rights. And because the Danish government is finally acknowledging what they did, it is making my scar smaller. But my scar will never heal because we will carry this scar for the rest of our lives.”Naaja H Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for justice and gender equality, said the announcement should have come sooner. “The problem with proposing this in the 11th hour before the apology is that it risks being viewed as calculated instead of sincere and remorseful,” she said.Campaigners against “parenting competence” (FKU) tests also welcomed the decision by the appeals board to reunite Brønlund with her daughter.Høje-Taastrup, the municipality that had put Brønlund’s daughter into care on the basis of the testsdespite them being bannedon people with Greenlandic backgrounds, did not name Brønlund. But it said the board had informed the municipality that it had decided to reverse its decision on “a much-publicised case” and had informed them to implement its decision.Anya Krogh Manghezi, the municipality’s director of children and youth, said: “We have been looking forward to receiving clarification, and we will of course take note of the decision of the Danish social appeals board and act immediately accordingly. Even though the case has received a lot of attention and the media has reported many details, we are still bound by confidentiality, so we cannot go into more detail about what is happening in the case. Only that we will continue to support the young child and the family.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We will make a decision to shoot down flying objects without discussion when they violate our territory and fly overPoland. There is no room for debate here.”On Friday, Estonia reported that three Russian MiG-31 jets had crossed into its airspace for 12 minutes before being forced to withdraw. The incident followed the entry of 20 Russian drones into Polish skies earlier this month, which Nato fighters shot down, and a separate Russian drone incursion into Romania.1:32Yvette Cooper says UK will confront Russian planes in Nato airspace – videoThe breaches have rattled Europe, particularly countries bordering Russia, fuelling fears that Moscow is testing Nato’s defence commitments.Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said: “Russia clearly feels it can act with impunity inUkraine, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the whole of eastern Europe.”He added: “Russia’s neighbours, not unreasonably, fear they could be next.”Estonia, which called for the emergency meeting, told the security council that its record of the jets’ incursion was “based on hard facts, based on solid evidence, whatever Russia is claiming”.Holding up a printout from the country’s air radar, Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, pointed to what he said was a clear “violation of Estonian territory and sovereignty”.He also displayed closeup photographs of the Russian jets, stressing that they were “carrying missiles and were combat-ready”.“The violation is crystal clear, and Russia is lying again, as it has lied before several times,” he said.Russia has rejected Estonia’s claims and has said it lacks evidence.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, told reporters on Monday: “We never heard in the Estonian statement that they have objective monitoring data to back up their claim. That is why we consider such words to be empty, unfounded and a continuation of a completely reckless pattern of escalating tensions and provoking a confrontational atmosphere.”But at the emergency UN session, the incursions drew widespread condemnation as reckless.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russia must urgently stop such dangerous behaviour.”He added: “Either Moscow wants to escalate and pull more countries into this conflict with Ukraine, or it doesn’t have full control of those who operate its fighter planes and drones. Either scenario is very disconcerting.”In Moscow, Vladimir Putin appeared to continue his recent overtures to Washington amid growing frustrations from Trump with the Russian president over faltering efforts to end the Ukraine war, as well as stalled talks between the US and Russia on other bilateral issues.“We want to avoid provoking a further strategic arms race,” Putin told his security council during a televised meeting.But he coupled the conciliatory note with combative language, saying that Russia was “capable of responding to any threats with military-technical measures”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaNatoEstoniaPolandUkraineUnited NationsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has previously said it could be counterproductive to recognise the state of Palestine before it was established. “If something that doesn’t exist is recognised on paper, the problem could appear to be solved when it isn’t,” shetold the Italian daily La Repubblicain late July.View image in fullscreenPolice and protesters face off in Milan.Photograph: Claudia Greco/ReutersGrassroots unions acrossItalycalled for a 24-hour general strike on Monday in solidarity with the people of Gaza, citing reasons that included the “inertia of the Italian and EU governments” to address the humanitarian crisis in the territory.From Milan to Palermo, Italians poured on to the streetsin at least 75 municipalitiesacross the country. In Genoa and Livorno, dock workersblockedports over concerns that Italy was being used as a staging post for the transfer of arms to Israel.graphicIn Rome, more than 20,000 people gathered outside the Termini train station waving Palestinian flags and chanting “free Palestine”. Michelangelo, 17, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he had turned up to support “a population that is being exterminated”.In the neighbouring Piazza dei Cinquecento, a political science student cited therecently published findingby a UN commission that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza to explain why she and other students were among those protesting.“This doesn’t mean we’re anti-Jews or antisemitic, and we’re tired of the media and politicians playing on this misunderstanding,” the student, identified only asAlessandra, told La Repubblica. “It just means we’re against a government that’s committing genocide while the international community looks the other way.”View image in fullscreenDock workers and protesters block the port of Genoa.Photograph: Matteo Minnella/ReutersUnder the slogan of Let’s Block Everything, those taking part in the general strike called on the government to suspend commercial and military cooperation with Israel and expressed support for the Global Sumud Flotilla, aninternational initiativeof more than 50 small boatsseeking to break Israel’s naval blockade and deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza.Organisers said 50,000 people had turned out in the northern city of Milan, and police in Bologna put the figure there at more than 10,000.Tensions escalated in Milan when dozens of protesters dressed in black and armed with batons tried to smash the main entrance of the city’s central train station.View image in fullscreenScuffles break out between protesters and police in Milan.Photograph: Claudia Greco/ReutersThey threw smoke bombs, bottles and stones at police, who responded with pepper spray.

It’s only the beginning.”Meanwhile, Arab and Muslim leaders are set to meetDonald Trumpin New York to discuss their separate plan for a stabilisation force in Gaza as France joined the UK, Canada and Australia in recognising Palestine as a state.The recognition of Palestine by France and five other states played out in dramatic fashion later on the floor of the UN general assembly as France and Saudi Arabia co-chaired a summit to discuss the future of a two-state solution, a road map to peace that Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a dead-end.On Monday night Monaco, Belgium, Andorra, Malta and Luxembourg all recognised Palestine, bringing the total number of recognitions to three-quarters of UN membership.António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said in a speech that statehood was a “right, not a reward” for Palestinians.“Nothing can justify the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas or the taking of hostages,” he said. “And nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, derided the session as an “embarrassing political circus” and the US has warned its allies that the recognition of Palestine could lead to a “reciprocal” Israeli reaction, setting the scene for a major diplomatic crisis as world leaders meet in New York for the 80th anniversary of the UN.Israel has warned that it might respond to the recognition of Palestine by annexing the West Bank, citing claims from Hamas that recognition by allies of Israel was a victory for the terror group.“Nothing can also excuse developments in the West Bank that pose an existential threat to a two-state solution,” said Guterres. “The relentless expansion of settlements, the creeping threat of annexation, the intensification of settle violence – all of it must stop.”France has said the plan for a stabilisation force would marginalise Hamas by disarming the group and excluding it from power.The proposal includes a UN-mandated force to provide security inGazaas well as oversee the disarmament of Hamas and help train a PA police force.graphicThe diplomatic scramble played out in New York as Israel intensified its assault on Gaza City on Monday, with reports of 37 Palestinians killed across the territory, including 30 in Gaza City. Israel launched an offensive in the city last week against what it said were 3,000 Hamas fighters hiding in the city, ignoring international humanitarian concerns.The Arab League declared in July that Hamas must play no further role in governance, with power handed to a newly elected PA to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Hamas would be required to hand over its weapons to the authority.The Trump meeting, scheduled after his address to the UN’s general assembly, is the most direct engagement between the White House and Arab states on post-ceasefire plans for Gaza since he was elected president for a second time.Trump is expected to deliver an aggressive speech decrying “globalist institutions” on Tuesday, which he will claim have “have significantly decayed the world order”, a White House spokesperson said in a briefing.West Bank mapThe US president is also expected to meet leaders from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Nothing the president has done so far suggests that he shares the view held by the Gulf states that the PA is a viable alternative to Hamas, or should be considered a partner for peace. He has imposed sanctions on PA officials and banned Mahmoud Abbas, its 89-year-old leader, from coming to New York to speak to the UN. Abbas, addressing the summit virtually, commended the 149 nations that had already recognised a Palestinian state, and called on Hamas to surrender its weapons to the PA, adding: “We also condemn the killing and detention of civilians, including Hamas actions on October 7 2023.”Arab leaders see the meeting as a chance to pin down Trump on whether he supports the Arab League’s proposals for Gaza’s future, or even a variation put to him by a working group led by Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, and Jared Kushner, who is the president’s son-in-law. Neither of the reconstruction plans proposes the mass expulsion of Palestinians, a proposal that Trump at times has appeared to support. The Blair plan does not clearly endorse the PA as the long-term administrators for Gaza.The Arab states are likely to insist they will not join any international force unless the reformed PA is given a future role. They also want a roadmap to a two-state future that excludes further Israeli settlements or annexation of the West Bank.The UK on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state provisionally based on the 1949 armistice border, or “Green Line”, between Israel, the West Bank and Gaza before their 1967 capture.The PA, which exercises limited civic rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was forced out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, has said it was ready to govern Gaza and the West Bank with international support.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has insisted that Israel must retain overall security control alongside an Arab-led civilian administration. However, others in his rightwing coalition want to annex Gaza. Israel has driven the PA close to bankruptcy by withholding monthly revenue transfers.Lana Nusseibeh, a minister at the UAE foreign affairs ministry, said annexation would be a red line for the UAE since “it would strike at the heart of what the Abraham accords are trying to achieve”. The UAE signed the accords – deals brokered by Trump to normalise relations between Israel and the Arab states – in 2020 in return for Israel not annexing the West Bank.UAE leaders, bidding to present themselves as the startup nation of the future, did not suggest they would leave the accords but instead said plans for greater regional integration would become a dead letter.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, urged Israel not to respond to the new recognitions by annexing parts of the West Bank, saying “settler expansion threatens the very viability of a Palestinian state”.Cooper condemned violence on both sides, citing “continued bloodshed, manmade famine, terrorism and hostage-taking, settlement expansion and settler violence” and warned that “the two-state solution risks disappearing beneath the rubble – that is what extremists on both sides want”.She echoed others in saying Hamas could have no future in the governance of Palestine.France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said the recognition of a Palestinian state was a disavowal of Hamas since the plan called for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza. He pointed out that the general assembly had already endorsed a seven-page declaration this month outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution, while also condemning Hamas and calling for it to surrender and disarm.The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said: “Any and all steps toward an illegal annexation of occupied territory also undermine the chances of resolving the conflict in a sustainable way. However distant it may seem at this moment, a negotiated two-state solution is the path that can enable both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security and dignity. Germany regards recognition of a Palestinian state as a step more at the end of the process. However, such a process must now begin.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned on Monday: “We must destroy the axis of evil Iran and we have the power to do so. This is what lies ahead of us in the coming year, a year that could be a historic one for Israel’s security.”Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the window for reaching an agreement with Iran was limited, adding it was hard to predict if the snapback of the UN sanctions lifted when Iran reached a nuclear deal in 2015 will take place this weekend. With the deadline so close the risk of diplomatic miscalculation is high.Abbas Araghchi is also likely to meet European foreign ministers on Tuesday.He warned: “They have tested Iran repeatedly and know we do not respond to the language of pressure and threat. I hope we can find a diplomatic solution in the coming days, otherwise Tehran will take appropriate measures.”Some in Iran have said the latest crisis, and the threat of a return to a more prolonged war between Israel and Iran, is so severe that Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, should try to meet the Donald Trump to break the deadlock in New York.It would be the first meeting between a US president and an Iranian president since the 1979 revolution in Iran. Pezeshkian spoke with the Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, before leaving Tehran for New York.The deadline for the reimposition of six sets of suspended UN sanctions is Saturday night, when the last chance for the UK, France and Germany to defer sanctions for as long as six months or a year expires. If the three European powers reimpose sanctions, they could not be lifted in future without the US agreeing not to use its veto. Iran has warned the reimposition of UN sanctions would see the end of Iranian cooperation with the nuclear inspectorate.Araghchi’s meeting with the director general of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, will set the tone for Iran’s diplomacy this weeksince the lack of Iranian cooperationwith the agency lies at the heart of the European’s threat to use their power to reimpose the UN sanctions. Grossi admitted the position was very difficult but said he hoped “we are on the way to get more cooperation”, and that would require more time for diplomacy.The European countries’ three key demands are that Iran restart full cooperation with the IAEA, including allowing IAEA inspectors to visit Iran’s bombed nuclear sites, provide a full explanation of the whereabouts of its previous 400kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium – and, finally, commit to reopen the talks with the US on the future of its nuclear programme that were broken off when Israel started to bomb Iran’s leadership and nuclear sites on 12 June.Iran has been trying to extract a US commitment that no further attacks on its nuclear sites will be made by Israel.At a meeting with the IAEA in Cairo on 9 September, Iran came to an agreement that it would report on the highly enriched uranium stockpile within 28 days. But the proposed agreement, from the European perspective, did not contain enough tangible commitments about IAEA accessing Iran’s bombed nuclear sites, or what would happen to the stockpile.Since then, Iran has suggested that once the stockpile is located its purity could be reduced from 60% to 20%, making the stockpile less useable for a nuclear bomb.Iranian diplomats are under huge conflicting domestic pressure, with rival factions waging a ceaseless political battle over the country’s approach to the west, the flaws in the original nuclear deal signed in 2015, and the need to act to get western sanctions lifted. Araghchi has insisted the foreign ministry has the authority to negotiate on behalf of Iran.The Tehran stock market has reacted very negatively to the threat of sanctions, causing a further depreciation of the rial, a trend that undermines the claims the reimposition of UN sanctions will not have great impact on the already heavily sanctioned economy.In an attempt to crank up the domestic pressure, a group of more than 70 Iranian parliamentarians released a call for Iran to abandon its opposition to possessing a nuclear weapon.Ahmad Aryaeinejad, the representative of Malayer in the parliament, referring to the letter of 71 parliament members for building nuclear weapons, said: “Why should most global powers have nuclear weapons, but the Islamic Republic must remain without this weapon? Why everyone yes, us no? We too must build nuclear weapons.”He continued: “If we have an atomic bomb, even if we don’t use it, our enemies will no longer imagine that they can harm us and do whatever they want.”Explore more on these topicsIranUnited NationsNuclear weaponsInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)Middle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He has variously threatened annexation of occupied Palestinian land and bilateral action againstcountries that joined the tide of recognition.But laying formal claim to part or all of the West Bank would jeopardise the Abraham accords, the historic agreement thatnormalised ties with regional powersincluding the United Arab Emirates.That deal was perhaps the most high-profile foreign policy achievement of Donald Trump’s first presidency, cited in nominations for the Nobel peace prize he openly covets, and one of Netanyahu’s own landmark achievements.The UAE, one of its most important partners, has already said annexation is a “red line”, and the deal’s collapse would carry a high risk of alienating Netanyahu’s single most important supporter.Israel chose a bilateral response to Ireland, Norway and Spain when they recognised a Palestinian state last year,including withdrawing ambassadors.Doing the same thing now, when so many key allies have followed suit, would be far more complicated – and could harmIsraelfar more than its targets, former Israeli diplomats said.It would accelerate Israel’s trajectory towards the isolated“super-Sparta” statusthat Netanyahu celebrated last week and then backed away from after public outrage and economic warnings.Alon Liel, a former diplomat who served as Israel’s ambassador to South Africa, said: “I think its such a difficult dilemma that Netanyahu decided to postpone. There is no way Israel will not respond, and there is no way Israel will respond in a clever way. The cabinet is on the point of discussing which mistakes to make.”The Jewish new year holiday, celebrated on Monday and Tuesday, and the upcoming UN general assembly have given Netanyahu a chance to claim breathing space while he considers his options.He is travelling to the US for the meeting and said his response to the UK, France and others would come after meeting Trump. That meeting will take place after the US presidentmeets Arab leadersin New York.Before leaving, Netanyahyu convened a meeting of the Israeli security cabinet to discuss possible responses to recognition, Israeli media reported.In a clear indication of concerns about the risks of annexation, the two strongest advocates of that approach – the far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich – were not invited.In addition to the future of the Abraham accords – which Trump and Joe Biden hoped to expand to include Saudi Arabia – many of the Trump family and allies have deep financial ties in the region.But domestic political pressures over a corruption trial and upcoming election may outweigh Netanyahu’s worries about antagonising Trump, said Alon Pinkas, another former Israeli diplomat.“Netanyahu of two or three years ago would not have dared annex anything,” said Pinkas, whose former positions include consul general in New York. “Netanyahu of September 2025 is unhinged; detached from reality, with an acute case of delusion of grandeur [about the idea he is] redrawing the regional map; afraid of an election; scared of his trial [on corruption charges]. If all of those point to partial annexation, he might actually do something.”Israeli politicians react bitterly to international recognitions of Palestinian stateRead moreInside Israel, debate has swung confusingly between an insistence that recognition is an irrelevant gesture towards an empty symbol, and fury at the countries that have pressed ahead.Across most of Israel’s political spectrum, from the far right to the centre-left leader Yair Golan, the move to recognise the Palestinian state has beencondemnedas a “reward for terrorism”.But even if a sovereign Palestine is still more an idea than a reality, recognition has profound legal and diplomatic implications. British recognition has a particular diplomatic and historic weight because of the role Britain played inlaying the groundworkfor the creation of the state of Israel with the Balfour declaration of 1917.Liel said: “I see it as more than a bilateral event; it [should be understood in] the historic perspective of the Balfour declaration. It’s a kind of correction to the British historic role.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

A number took onward flights to Northern Ireland and Scotland where they will purse their studies.Their arrival followed months of campaigning by politicians, academics and others on behalf of more than 100 Palestinian students holding offers from UK universities this year. Supporters are hoping others will follow and a permanent pathway will be established to ensure more Palestinian scholars benefit.The Gaza students with scholarships to UK unable to take up their placesRead moreThe education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, welcomed them, saying: “The flight time from Amman to England is only around six hours, but this was a journey that was months in the planning and years in the making.“These students have lived through the most appalling ordeal. After almost two years of war, many have lost loved ones, and all have had their lives and their education thrown into chaos. Yet despite all the death and destruction they’ve witnessed, they’ve not given up. Instead, they’ve chosen to answer loss with learning, despair with determination, and war with hope.“They are an inspiration to us all and I am deeply relieved that they’ve arrived in the UK and can now continue their education in safety.”Their arrival came shortly after the UK joinedCanada and Australiain formallydeclaring recognitionof Palestinian statehood.Commenting after the students’ arrival, the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “Our support … reflects the UK’s commitment to the future of postwar Gaza and its reconstruction, where educating the next generation will play a vital role.”The cohort includes recipients of the Chevening scholarship, the government’s flagship international programme, which is aimed at leaders of tomorrow and supports them to pursue one-year master’s degrees in the UK.Not included in the cohort, however, were two women – one bound for Glasgow, the other the Liverpool School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – who declined their initial invitations for evacuation when they were told their young children and spouseswould not be permittedto exit the Gaza Strip with them.Just days before the first bus of UK students was due to leave Gaza last week, the two PhD students were informed that while their families were eligible for UK visas, they were not eligible for the evacuation. Put in an “impossible situation”, according to supporters, they chose to stay.Nora Parr, a University of Birmingham researcher who has been coordinating efforts to support the students, said she was thrilled to finally see the Palestinian scholars being welcomed at university campuses across the UK.“They are beginning a new chapter of what has for all been a surreal journey from devastation to opportunity,” she said. “Of course the logistics and parameters of the new UK scheme for students are still being worked out. We hope that mothers and fathers will not be asked to choose between education and family survival, that post-doctoral scholars will be included and that mechanisms toward a permanent pathway for education in the UK will be established, as a political solution is created for Palestine, allowing these scholars to use what they have learned in the UK to rebuild their communities.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationUniversitiesGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She based her findings on an analysis of 50 previous studies from 24 countries, including the UK, China, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Kuwait and Barbados.Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, which represents family doctors in the UK, said: “That incidences of abuse against GPs and our teams are so widespread – and as this research shows, not just in the UK – is extremely distressing. It’s entirely unacceptable for anyone working in general practice to be at the receiving end of abuse of any kind, when they’re just trying to do their jobs.”Some assaults are so distressing that GPs call the police or remove perpetrators from their practice list, she added.Pulse, a website for GPs, has reported on a doctor being attacked by a man wielding a baseball bat and a man carrying knives threatening surgery staff.The long waits patients can face to see a GP or receive other healthcare is the most common reason some become violent or abusive, according to the research, which has been published in the British Journal of General Practice. Between 31% and 73% of GP personnel questioned in previous studies identified that as the trigger for aggression.“Unmet patient demands” – such as GPs declining to prescribe requested medicines or sick people being frustrated at the quality of their treatment – were the second commonest reason.The research paper said “some studies took a view that actions of staff may have contributed to the violence experienced by suggesting possible causes such as inadequate staff training on professionalism, interpersonal skills, conflict management or staff attitudes”. Female, younger and less experienced staff, including receptionists, bear the brunt of the aggression, it found.Dr Julius Parker, a deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GPs committee, said: “General practice in the UK and across the world is the front door to healthcare – and GPs are on the frontline when faced with people in pain and who are anxious and in distress, often frustrated with wider systems.“But no amount of frustration excuses violence against GPs here or abroad, as described in this research.”Research last year by MDDUS, a medical defence organisation, found that 84% of GPs who took part in a survey had been verbally abused and 24% physically abused during the previous year. In one incident, a patient with Covid coughed over a receptionist when he did not get a prescription he wanted.Pulse has alsoreportedhow Dr Osama Farooq, a GP in Fife in Scotland, suffered cuts and bruises when he was assaulted and racially abused outside a shop after finishing a 12-hour shift at his surgery. He left the practice because he no longer felt safe in the town.Explore more on these topicsHealthDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The researchers found that a property situated 500 metres from a station commanded an 8% premium – amounting to about £42,700 based on average prices in London – over an identical or very similar property 1,500 metres from a station.This was broadly in line with just before the pandemic, when this premium was 8.6%.There was a £10,900, or 4.9%, house price premium inGreater Manchester, and an £8,800 premium (4.6%) in Glasgow, on a comparable basis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than a quarter (28%) of the 2,640 respondents said they had avoided places where they used to socialise and one in 10 (12%) changed where they exercise.Girls with disabilities felt particularly unsafe travelling, with only 17% saying they felt secure on public transport, compared with 33% of non-disabled girls.The survey also explored misogyny in schools. More than half of girls aged 11 to 18 (58%) said they had experienced male pupils making toxic comments while 32% reported seeing a teacher or member of staff subjected to sexist or misogynistic abuse.One in 10 girls aged 11 to 16 said they do not feel safe at school, a figure that rises to more than two in 10 for LGBTQ+ girls and three in 10 for disabled girls. One in 10 also said they had intentionally missed school to lower the risk of sexual harassment – a figure that doubles for girls with disabilities (21%) and rises to 18% for neurodivergent and LGBTQ+ girls.Among the younger pupils, a third of girls aged seven to 10 (32%) said they had experienced a comment from boys at school that made them feel uncomfortable while, 17% said boys at school regularly comment on the bodies of girls and young women.Girlguiding called on local authorities and schools to publish plans to tackle misogyny in their communities and for politicians in charge of public transport to engage with girls on their fears and make services safer.Amanda Azeez, the acting chief executive of Girlguiding, said: “Although a lot of progress has been made in creating an equal world, reading these stark findings makes us realise that in some areas, like the treatment and behaviour that girls’ face, things sadly haven’t changed at all.“Girls are not being treated equally and are consistently made to feel like they’re not enough. This is not only affecting their mental health but stopping them from being themselves.“To ensure girls’ safety and to tackle this issue, action needs to happen now, starting with listening to and involving girls and young women in how to address this. Girls should be able to rely on decision-makers to keep them safe, as well as their peers for support.”The research also highlighted how girls and young women have supported each other, with 70% of 11- to 21-year-olds saying they have stood up for other girls experiencing sexism or misogyny.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsSexual harassmentPublic transportYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

It would also build on national insurance cuts made by the former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who argued the system represented an “unfair double tax on work”. The previous government’s 4p cut in national insurance, costing the exchequer £20bn a year, was not matched by an increase in income tax.The intervention comes as Reevesfaces intense scrutinyover Labour’s economic management amid widespread speculation about tax increases in her autumn budget, which is due on 26 November.Economists warn that Labour’s high-stakes welfare U-turns, elevated borrowing costs and an anticipatedproductivity downgradefrom the Office for Budget Responsibility could leave her with a shortfall against her self-imposed fiscal rules of up to £40bn.Reeves has so far been tight-lipped over the potential for tax increases, preferring to focus on the government’s mission to drive up economic growth to help swell the Treasury coffers.Earlier this month she said decisions in her budget would aim to ensure the government had enough money to fund public services, while also seeking to safeguard workers and business investment.Reeves’s budget planning is being overseen byTorsten Bell, the former Resolution Foundation chief executive who is now the pensions minister. Dan Tomlinson, a former researcher at the thinktank, was promoted in this month’s reshuffle to become a junior Treasury minister, with responsibility over tax measures at the budget.Calling on the chancellor to use the budget as an opportunity to reshape the UK’s £1tn-a-year tax system, the Resolution Foundation said Reeves could set out changes to reduce a bias against employees while raising more from wealthier individuals.Putting forward a £30bn package of proposals, options alongside the “switch” in income tax included extending the scope of employer national insurance to cover limited liability partnerships, such as big law firms, and taking action to tackle unpaid small-business corporation tax.Other measures included the adoption of a broader sugar and salt tax, a carbon charge for long-haul flights and shipping, and changing vehicle excise duty to account for the road damage, noise and air pollution caused by heavier vehicles.Adam Corlett, a principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “These sensible reforms would raise revenue while doing the least possible harm to workers and the wider economy. And by acting decisively, the chancellor can turn her full attention back on to securing stronger economic growth.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “The chancellor makes tax policy decisions at fiscal events. We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Tax and spendingRachel ReevesEconomic policyIncome taxNational insurancenewsShareReuse this content"

We’ll boost funding for cancer research in the UK. We’ll rebuild a National Cancer Research Institute after it was closed under the Conservatives, to coordinate research and drive it forward.”Calum Miller, the party’s foreign affairs spokesperson, used his conference speech on Monday to make a similar attack on Farage – and on Trump – with a call for a new law outlawing ministers from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.Miller cited the example of Whitehall officialspushing golf bossesto hold the 2028 Open at Trump’s Turnberry course, saying the claims needed to be investigated.“We must Trump-proof our politics – especially in light of people like Farage, already measuring the curtains in No 10, who care more about what that office could do for them, than what it can do for this country,” he said.The Lib Dems have previously accused Farage of prioritising Trump’s interests over those of the UK, such as his recent appearance before a congressional hearing on censorship at which the Reform leader agreed with Republican members about what he called the “awful authoritarian” situation for free speech in the UK.On Monday afternoon the conference held a session where delegates heard from the party’s “Reform watch” panel – councillors in seats with heavy Reform representation after May’s local elections – about how to respond to the threat.Speaking to reporters after his speech, Miller said the Lib Dems appeared to be the one political party that could take on Farage.“We’ve seen basically the collapse of the Conservative party as a serious proposition, both in terms of their policy platform and in terms of their ability to operate in lots of our communities, and we can see Reform are riding high in the polls,” he said.“And I think we would like to think of ourselves, in our values and in the approach we take to policy, as an antidote to Reform.”Explore more on these topicsEd DaveyLiberal DemocratsLiberal Democrat conferenceReform UKNigel FarageDonald TrumpVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

Research into links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism havenot proved a causal relationship, while medical experts widely agree that growing diagnoses of autism cannot be traced back to a singular cause.Acetaminophen can be used to alleviate fever and pain during pregnancy. Leaving those conditions untreated can carry “significant maternal and infant health risks”, according to a statement from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Untreated fevers, for example, can lead to miscarriage, birth defects and premature births.Trump’s announcement was a triumph for health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has a track record ofmaking unproven claims about autismand autistic people. Yet it was also the latest move in another emerging campaign within the Trump administration: one that seeks to valorize “natural” pregnancy and motherhood – that is, pregnancy and motherhood without proven medical interventions – to the point where it can corrode women’s health and safety.Over the past several months, theTrump administrationhas taken steps to undermine pregnant women’s access to Covid vaccines and antidepressants. These steps have been in defiance of widespread agreement among medical experts that the benefits of these therapeutics tend to outweigh the risks. In May, Kennedy, who has long questioned the safety of vaccines, said that he “couldn’t be more pleased to announce” that the CDC would no longer recommend that healthy pregnant women get vaccinated against Covid.Then, over the summer, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hosted a panel about antidepressant use during pregnancy. Predominantly staffed with people who have a history of antidepressant skepticism or who have beenconsultants in litigation over antidepressants, the panel heavily emphasized the risks of taking antidepressants during pregnancy. One of the panelists, a psychologist named Roger McFillin, said that depression “has devolved into an umbrella term” and “doesn’t even have meaning any more”.“Are women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely?” he asked. “Those are gifts. They’re not symptoms of a disease.”They very well may be symptoms of a disease. Mental health conditions contribute to almost a third of all pregnancy-related deaths in the US, according to a2025 reportfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of deaths involving mental health struggles, roughly a third were suicides.Covid, too, endangers women’s lives – and those of their babies. A2021 study of 2,100 pregnant women around the worldfound that women who contracted Covid during pregnancy were 20 times more likely to die compared to those that did not catch the virus. More than 11% of women who contracted Covid also had their babies test positive for Covid.While the Trump administration casts doubt on whether women should use life-saving remedies to protect themselves against Covid and depression, Republicans have in recent months moved to embrace at least one kind of intervention: “restorative reproductive medicine” (RRM), a constellation of therapies that purport to “restore” individuals’ “natural” fertility without resorting to in vitro fertilization (IVF).Advocates of RRM say they are working to present women with more options, but pre-eminent medical groups such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine say that there is little evidence that RRM techniques work – and that it is effectively “a pseudonym for a basic infertility evaluation”, asone reproductive endocrinologist told the Guardian this summer.These moves – the attacks on pregnant women’s access to Tylenol, to Covid vaccines, to antidepressants; the insistence that women should get pregnant without IVF – all adhere to a basic fallacy known as “the appeal to nature”, or the idea that something that comes from the earth is better than anything human-made.This idea powers much of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, of which Kennedy is effectively the czar. It is also patently false.There are reasons why you are not supposed to drink unpasteurized, or “raw”, milk. (They’re calledcampylobacter, cryptosporidium, E coli, listeria, brucella, and salmonella.) And there are reasons why a small cut or a stubbed toe is no longer a death sentence. (They’re called antibiotics.)When combined with pregnancy, the illogic of the appeal to nature is stretched even further, folding in on itself likeLaffy Taffy. Not only should pregnancy – and the women who do it – be handled as “naturally” as possible, but pregnancy and motherhood are themselves women’s natural states.Authoritarian governments throughout historyhave sought to convince their people that this is true, in order to subjugate women and to ensure that women are reliable sources of reproduction.That’s why the Trump administration’s drive to diminish pregnant women’s access to Tylenol can’t be divorced from, say, its pronatalist interest in encouraging women to have more babies through$5,000 “baby bonuses”.Ultimately, all this may lead to fewer options and more pain for women – including those who find parenthood fulfilling, those who are uninterested in it, and those who are everywhere in between. In fact, without Tylenol, that pain may become quite literal.“All this pressure to become a mother and be a mother is emerging politically, but you’re not supposed to need any help or support,” the journalist Amy Larocca, author of the book How to Be Well: Navigating Our Self-Care Epidemic, One Dubious Cure at a Time, said in an interview earlier this year. “You’re supposed to be able to manage it all on your own and [have] no maternity leave, no medical care, no support.”She added: “There’s a lot of shaming of women who need help and support.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHealthUS healthcareDonald TrumpUS politicsWomenRobert F Kennedy JranalysisShareReuse this content"

However, Bakiskan warned that, unless Trump relents, the 1.5% forecast “may soon look optimistic”.He said: “Taken together, the erosion of trust in institutions, a loss of human capital, tariffs, chronic uncertainty, and unsustainable fiscal policies can raise the tail risk of a financial crisis in the US. In the long run, they may set a path for an even weaker dollar and higher long-term yields.”A Deutsche Bank market strategist, Jim Reid, said the new application fee “caused a huge amount of uncertainty over the weekend for those that rely on it”.Trump’s announcement on Friday triggered chaos in the tech industry, with some businesses in Silicon Valley urging staff not to travel outside the country. It prompted the White House to clarify on Saturday that the new higher fee applied only to new applicants and would be a one-off payment.Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the broker XTB, said Amazon had the highest number of workers on H-1B visas, closely followed by Microsoft, the Facebook owner Meta, Apple and Google.“Although these companies have the money to afford the visas, other sectors who also rely on H-1B visas may struggle with future recruitment, for example the health care and education sectors,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheIndian government hit back at the new fee for skilled workers, warning it would have “humanitarian consequences” by way of “disruption caused for families”.On Sunday, India’s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, said: “They are also a little afraid of our talent. We have no objection to that.”On Monday, the share prices of the multibillion-dollar Indian tech groups Infosys and Tata Consulting Services fell by about 3% in response to the news.

Out of 12 voting board members, Miran was the only one to vote against the crowd. He wanted a half-point cut, not a quarter-point cut.Miran told the Economics Club of New York that rates should be below 3% by the end of the year, and dismissed fears thatthe US president’s tariffswere stoking inflation.Federal Reserve cuts US interest rates for first time since DecemberRead more“Relatively small changes in some good prices have led to what I view as unreasonable levels of concern,” Miran said, adding that tariffs would ultimately lead to “substantial swings in net national savings” for the country.That is a very different view from the one that Fed chairJerome Powellspoke of last week.“Higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of good, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen,” Powell said. While it seems like inflation from tariffs may be “relatively short-lived, a one-time shift in the price level”, inflation could be “more persistent”.“That is a risk to be assessed and managed,” Powell said.Miran said his analysis has led him to believe that sellers from exporting countries will lower their prices. Muchinflationis from rising costs in the housing market, including the rental market, which he said will see a cooling off as the US’s population decreases amid Trump’simmigrationpolicies.Economic data appears to be more in line with Powell’s analysis. Since April, inflation measured by the consumer price index has gone up 0.6% – from 2.3% to 2.9%.For years, the Fed has set its target inflation rate at 2%, a rate which has not been seen since 2021. But Miran said that he sees this goal as too restrictive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Miran is the first Fed governor to serve on the board while simultaneously holding a role in the executive branch in nearly 100 years. Miran is also chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, a role from which is taking a leave of absence while he serves on the Fed’s board until January 2026.The new Fed governor on said he would continue to be a voice of dissent against the direction that the Fed is heading in, though he emphasized that his views come from his own analysis. When asked about the discussions he had with the president, Miran said that Trump “never asked me to set policy in a specific way”.“I will always be polite and collegial, but I don’t view building with consensus for the sake of establishing consensus,” Miran said. “I’m not going to vote for something I don’t believe in just for the sake of creating an illusion of consensus where there is none.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyEconomicsJerome PowellTrump administrationUS politicsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Its three liberal justices dissented from Monday’s order letting Trump remove Slaughter for now.John Roberts, the chief justice, on 8 September had paused an order from Loren AliKhan, a Washington-based US district judge – – a move that allowed Trump to keep Slaughter out of her post – to give the court more time to consider how to respond to the justice department’s request.Federal law permits a president to remove FTC commissioners only for cause – such as inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office – but not for policy differences. Similar protections cover officials at other independent agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board.Slaughter was one of two Democratic commissioners who Trumpmoved to firein March. The firings drew sharp criticism from Democratic senators and antimonopoly groups concerned that the move was designed to eliminate opposition within the agency to big corporations.AliKhan in July blocked Trump’s firing of Slaughter, rejecting the Trump administration’s argument that the tenure protections unlawfully encroach on presidential power. The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit on 2 September in a 2-1 decision kept the judge’s ruling in place.The supreme court did not set a precise date for the arguments scheduled for December.The lower courts ruled that the statutory protections shielding FTC members from being removed without cause conform with the US constitution in light of a 1935 supreme court precedent in a case called Humphrey’s Executor v United States. In that case, the court ruled that a president lacks unfettered power to remove FTC commissioners, faulting Franklin Roosevelt’s firing of an FTC commissioner for policy differences.The Trump administration in its supreme court filing in Slaughter’s case argued that “the modern FTC exercises far more substantial powers than the 1935 FTC”, and thus its members can be fired at will by the president.Lawyers for Slaughter in court papers pushed back against that contention, arguing that the FTC’s development over the decades is “a story of continuity, not transformation”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpLaw (US)Trump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The vote also represents a startling turnaround in his own footballing arc, almost exactly 12 months on from being left out of the PSG squad to play Arsenal after a heated argument with his manager during a game at Rennes.A subsequent tactical switch by Luis Enrique, moving Dembélé into the centre, led to an explosion of 25 goals in 20 games from December to March, a run of form his manager put down to something his star attacker must have eaten over Christmas.Ballon d’Or 2025: Dembélé and Bonmatí claim top awards, England duo honoured – liveRead moreThe culmination of that six-month surge arrived with May’sannihilation of Interin the Champions League final, a match marked by the spectacle of Dembélé literally crouching like a sprinter to begin his forward press.It is a genuinely heartening comeback story for a likable, humble, prodigiously talented footballer, who was treated roughly at times at Barcelona as he struggled to adapt to the pressure of a hugely expensive move, but who saw off the darling of La Masia, Lamine Yamal, in the final vote here.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman won the Johan Cruyff award for top female coach.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAAt the podium Dembélé struggled to hold back tears several times as he thanked everyone from his home suburb to his agent, before finally inviting his mother on stage to share the moment of glory.Earlier on it had also been a night of flowers for English football as the women’s game swept the opening half of the ceremony. There were awards for England’s head coach, Sarina Wiegman, the England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and Arsenal as club of the year. Such wasthe degree of Anglo-dominanceat that point there were scattered boos from the Parisian crowd as Arsenal’s players went up to take their gong.Alessia Russo had been tipped to take the top individual women’s award. In the event the Ballon d’Or was won by Aitana Bonmatí for the third successive year, despite ending on the losing side to Russo in the finals of both the European Championshipand the Champions League. Russo came third behind her Arsenal teammate Mariona Caldentey.From early in the evening the venue had been crammed to the gods with gleamingly attired footballers, their glamorous hangers-on and the usual indeterminate men in flamboyant tuxedos. There was an early flush of excitement as the men’s Kopa trophy for best young player was won for the second year running by Lamine Yamal, present in a deliciously soft and shiny deep blue suit and immaculate bleach rinse.Quick GuideBallon d'Or 2025: all the big winnersShowBallon d'Or• Ousmane Dembéle (PSG/France)• Aitana Bonmatí (Barcelona/Spain)Kopa Trophy•Lamine Yamal (Barcelona/France)•Vicky López (Barça/Spain)Johan Cruyff Trophy• Luis Enrique (Paris Saint-Germain)• Sarina Wiegman (England)Yashin Award•Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG/Man City/Italy)•Hannah Hampton (Chelsea/England)Gerd Müller Trophy•Viktor Gyökeres (Sporting/Arsenal/Sweden)• Ewa Pajor (Barcelona/Poland)Club of the Year• PSG (men's team)• Arsenal (women's team)Socrates Award• Xana FoundationWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After which, the English arrived.

On Sunday things changed for the betterOliver ConnollyMon 22 Sep 2025 07.11 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 11.45 EDTShareCaleb Williams needed this. Ben Johnson needed this. TheChicago Bears, more than anyone, needed this.The Bears dismantled the Cowboys on Sunday, 31-14, with an offense that finally resembled the one fans had imagined when Williams was drafted first overall and Johnson was hired to orchestrate a rebuild. It was fast. It was explosive. It was bruising. It was fun.Two weeks into the season, Williams had been uneven. There were few signs of progress from his frustration-filled rookie season. The flashes of greatness were still there, but they were again sandwiched around moments of disappointment. His accuracy was erratic, his decision-making inconsistent and he struggled to get to grips with the breadth and complexity of Johnson’s offense. Johnson, the new head coach tasked with reshaping a broken franchise, had already seen an 11-point lead vanish in Week 1 and a 50-point throttling at the hands of his former team in Week 2.On Sunday, everything clicked. The Bears didn’t just beat the Cowboys; they hammered them.You could pinpoint the exact moment the Williams-Johnson partnership came together. With four minutes left in the first quarter, Johnson dialled up a flea flicker. Williams pitched the ball to running back D’Andre Swift to attack the line of scrimmage. But it was a fake-out. Swift turned and tossed the ball back to Williams. The ball hung in the air, but, in an instant, Williams gathered it, surveyed the field and threw a 65-yard dot to Rome Odunze.BEARS FLEA FLICKER TDDALvsCHI on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/tMeMMgsWEy— NFL (@NFL)September 21, 2025It was the most exhilarating play Chicago has had in a generation, and the longest completed pass of the season so far. According to Next Gen Stats, Williams’ throw traveled 62.1 yards in the air. From there, the Bears didn’t relent.By half-time, Williams had put together the smoothest, most efficient performance of his career: 10-for-16, 239 yards, three touchdowns, zero interceptions, a passer rating of 145.8. It was even sweeter coming against a defense coached by Matt Eberflus, whom the Bears fired in November, in part, for mishandling the development of Williams. The Cowboys, meanwhile, are still dealing with the aftershocks of the Micah Parsons trade. They cannot rush the passer, stuff the run or cover anyone. For the first time in his career, Williams had time and open receivers – and he tore a defense apart.By the end, Williams had tied his career high with four touchdown passes and set new marks for yards per attempt (10.6) and passer rating (142.6). Most significantly, he didn’t take a single sack. For a quarterback dragged down 68 times last year, the third-most inNFLhistory, it was as important as the touchdowns. His last sack-free game came two years ago in college. The pocket, for once, was clean, and he spread the ball around to eight different targets and finished with four touchdowns to four different receivers.The Bears even produced something they haven’t in more than 15 years: a 19-play drive. The last one, in 2009, fizzled with a turnover on downs. This one ended with Williams sneaking a touchdown on fourth-and-goal. It was another sign that Johnson’s Bears had arrived, with an offense capable of controlling the tempo of the game or scoring in a flash.The Johnson-Williams marriage, despite their reputations, was no sure thing. The two have contrasting styles. Johnson craves rhythm. He is exacting about the details. Williams offers the opposite. He’s a “feel” player, a playmaker, someone who thrives when he can break out of the pocket and create plays on his own. Last season, he finished second-last in completion percentage on rhythm throws and attempts when he wasnotpressured. His work habits werequestioned by his coaches. The lack of structure around him hid real flaws in his game, flaws that were exposed in the opening two weeks. The Bears’ first two games were littered with pre-snap penalties. Williams missed receivers. He held on to the ball too long, passing up open targets. Just as when he was a rookie, Williams tried to do too much. It’s fair to wonder if an improvizer could cut it in the league’s most melodic offense. And those questions will still linger despite Sunday.The NFL is a rhythm league. Even the best quarterbacks – Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes – rely on the flow of the offense to get them rolling, saving their individual magic for must-have-it-plays. For the first time against a lackluster Cowboys group, Williams found the right blend between giving himself over to the offense and creating plays out of structure.Still, it’s only one game and the Cowboys defense is reeling. In Dallas’ last two outings, they’ve given up 891 yards, 720 of them through the air, and eight passing touchdowns. They pressured Williams at the lowest rate of his career on Sunday and conceded 19 “open-window” throws, the highest from any defense of this season to date.But in Chicago, perspective is optional. The Bears haven’t made the playoffs since 2020. They’ve had one winning season since 2013. Williams is the third quarterback they’ve drafted in the first round since 2017, and Johnson is the fifth head coach over that span. Hope here isn’t about rationality.Johnson recognizes there is still work to be done. “It will be fun for tonight, and we’re on to the next one,” Johnson said post-game. “We’re behind the eight-ball here. We’re 1-2, and we’ve got to get back to .500.”But Sunday wasn’t about standings. It was about what it looked like when the pieces fell in place. About the promise offree hotdogs from The Wieners Circle. About Williams playing aggressive, mistake-free football.For a franchise defined by the quarterbacks it never had, Williams has finally given the Bears some hope.MVP of the weekView image in fullscreenIsaiah Rodgers had the game of his life on Sunday.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APIsaiah Rodgers, CB, Minnesota Vikings.In a single half, Rodgers became the first player in NFL history to record a pick-six, a fumble returned for a touchdown, and two forced fumbles in the same game, as the Vikings steamrolled the Bengals 48-10, the most lopsided loss in Cincinnati’s history. Rodgers snagged an 87-yard pick-six and added a 66-yard scoop-and-score in the Vikings’ 48-10 win. He added another punchout for garnish.Good chance Isaiah Rodgers wins NFC Defensive Player of the Week 😏CINvsMIN on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/7LnLZMMd2P— NFL (@NFL)September 21, 2025By half-time, Rodgers had outscored 13 of the 18 teams in action across the early slate. The 27-year-old – who has a 4.28 second 40-yard dash – is one of the quickest players in the league, and he showed off his wheels in the open field on both takeaways. “He’s begging me to return kickoffs,” Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said in preseason. After an impromptu showing on two defensive plays, maybe O’Connell will give him a try.Video of the weekNothing beats a thicc six. And what better way for a defensive lineman to score than by blocking a potential walk-off field goal and returning it for a touchdown? Enter: Jordan Davis.GET YOUR CARDIO BIG FELLApic.twitter.com/rXTz9S1orf— NFL (@NFL)September 21, 2025The Eagles’ defensive tackle spiked a last-second field goal effort from the Rams, returning it 61 yards to the house. Davis hit 18.59 mph on the scoop-and-score, the fastest speed a 330lbs player has ever reached as a ball-carrier, according to Next Gen Stats. “I haven’t run that quick since the combine,” Davis said post-game. It’s the second time in two weeks the Rams have lost on a blocked field goal.Philly put together an impressive second-half comeback to beat the Rams 33-26. But for the third-straight week, the Eagles’ offense looked anaemic for much of the game. They tried to bully the Rams’ defensive front, lining up in heavy personnel groupings and pounding away with the run. It was a dud, with the Eagles finishing with just 33 net yards in the first half. In the second half, though, Philly discovered the forward pass, and Jalen Hurts and AJ Brown diced up a shaky Rams secondary. Despite their talent, the defending champs have cracks on offense. Their passing game is stilted, the play-calling uninspired. But the second-half offered a blueprint moving forward: throw to Brown.Stat of the weekView image in fullscreenJustin Herbert performed when it mattered on Sunday.Photograph: Gregory Bull/AP3-0.The Chargers are perfect through three games for the first time in 23 years, back when Drew Brees was the team’s quarterback.We may have to redefine “Chargering,” because this year’s Chargers are not like the versions that have gone before. They play tough, stout defense. They can run the ball. And with Justin Herbert, they have a quarterback playing brilliantly. Herbert was put under siege by the Broncos in a 23-20 win. Playing behind a reshuffled offensive line, Herbert was sacked five times and pressured on more than half of his dropbacks. But Herbert strapped on his cape in the final stages. His final line may not look impressive at first glance – he had one TD and one interception on Sunday – but he completed 12 of 15 pass attempts for 123 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter, delivering the kind of signature moment an MVP candidate needs. With two minutes remaining, Herbert climbed through a collapsing pocket, held off a defender and threw a touchdown strike to Keenan Allen, while on the move and with pressure in his face. Then, Herbert marched the Chargers down the field for the game-winning field goal.JUSTIN HERBERT ARE YOU SERIOUS ‼️DENvsLAC on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/fyD04i1mES— NFL (@NFL)September 21, 2025Herbert looks as if he’s ascended to a different level. And thanks to a quirk in the schedule, all three of the Chargers’ wins have come in the division. Already, they have a hold on the AFC West, including having three tiebreakers.Elsewhere around the leagueView image in fullscreenBrowns kicker Andre Szmyt celebrates an unlikely win with teammates.Photograph: Gregory Shamus/Getty Images-- The Green Bay juggernaut came to a halt in Cleveland. The Browns toughed their way through a 13-10 upset over the Packers, scoring all 13 points in the fourth quarter. Late in the game, Cleveland’s star-studded pass-rush took over, beating up on Green Bay’s injured offensive line. For all the (deserved) fanfare around the Packers’ defense, the team continues to be undone by special teams errors, penalties and costly turnovers. On Sunday, those concerns finally caught up with them. A late Jordan Love interception gave Cleveland the ball inside the Green Bay five-yard line, handing life to a Browns offense that couldn’t get anything going for three quarters and they tied the game at 10-10. The Browns then blocked a potential game-winning field goal, putting them in position to hit a game-winner of their own. In a tough division, it was one the Packers couldn’t afford to cough away.BROWNS BLOCK THE POTENTIAL GAME-WINNING FG 😱(via@NFL)pic.twitter.com/0rhR1t22KD— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport)September 21, 2025-- The Browns and Eagles were not alone: the Jetsalsoblocked a field goal in the final minutes of their game against the Bucs,returning it for a touchdownto give them an unlikely 27-26 lead with less that two minutes to go. Still, this is the Jets. Baker Mayfield led the Bucs down the field for another late win, with Chase McLaughlin nailing a 36-yard walk-off field goal. It’s the first time in NFL history a quarterback has led a team to three successive game-winning drives to open a season.-- The Chiefs got their first win of the season with a 22-9 victory over the Giants. Patrick Mahomes still looked strong – he pulled off some trademark beautiful throws – and the defense is as well drilled as you’d expect from coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. But this was hardly a beatdown of a limited Giants team, and we’ll have a better idea of where this KC team really stand when Mahomes and Co face the Ravens next week. There was also a hint of discord as Travis Kelce had a,let’s call it animated, discussion with Andy Reid on the sideline for the second week in a row. “I love Travis’ passion, man,” said Reid after the game. “I’m OK with that. We didn’t have enough of it in the second quarter. It wasn’t where we needed it to be, so, within reason, he knows when to back off the pedal and knows when to push it too.”-- Tory Horton scored the Seahawks’ first punt return touchdown in 10 years as the Seahawks pummelled the Saints 44-13. It was a game of special teams, with the Seahawks scoring on Horton’s 95-yard punt return, blocking a punt and returning a kickoff 60 yards. Thanks to the special teams dominance, Seattle scored on all of their opening seven drives before calling off the dogs in the second half. The game also featured perhaps the saddest field goal in NFL history. Trailing 38-3 as time expired in the first half, Saints coach Kellen Moore opted to kick a field goal to cut Seattle’s lead to a mere32. It was a white flag moment in the game, and perhaps for the entire Saints season.-- The Patriots turned the ball over five times in a 21-14 defeat to the Steelers, gagging away a winnable game. The Patriots almost doubled the Steelers’ yardage total, but couldn’t escape drive-killing mistakes. They had three consecutive turnovers on three possessions, all in Steelers territory. And two of those turnovers robbed them of points, with Drake Maye throwing an interception in the endzone and Rhamondre Stevenson fumbling on the goalline. For much of the game, the Steelers’ offense struggled to take advantage, stalling out on five-straight drives after scoring on Pittsburgh’s opening two possessions. But Aaron Rodgers delivered down the stretch, leading a long touchdown drive to hand Pittsburgh the win.-- The Texans are 0-3 after a 17-10 loss to the Jaguars, and are already a long shot to make the playoffs. With the Colts streaking away with the AFC South, Houston must rely on other fringe playoff hopefuls slipping up to leave the door open to a wildcard berth. Sunday’s loss was another ugly showing. Despite fielding a championship-level defense, the Texans’ offense remains a mess. The offensive line still cannot protect CJ Stroud. And when there is no pressure, Stroudhas started to see ghosts. Against the Jaguars, he missed open targets, fled clean pockets and threw two rough interceptions. The Texans have the Ravens, Bills, Seahawks, Niners, Broncos, Chiefs and Colts (twice) on the schedule. It could be a long slog of a season.Explore more on these topicsChicago BearsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had a contract with Red Bull until 2030. The team’s parent company, as is normal in such cases, has not confirmed any figures.The announcement was made the day after Red Bull securedtheir second consecutive victoryunder Horner’s replacement, Laurent Mekies, at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.Horner led Red Bull from the relatively humble beginnings of what had been the Jaguar team to extraordinary success, with eight drivers’ and six constructors’ titles. But his final year and a half in charge was marked by controversy and a decline in the team’s form.At the start of 2024, accusations of inappropriate behaviour were made by an employee against Horner –he was cleared by an investigation– and caused no little unrest within the team. That was followed by the loss of a number of key personnel, including the enormously successful designer, Adrian Newey, the sporting director, Jonathan Wheatley, and the head of strategy, Will Courtenay.Although Max Verstappenwent on to win the title, their car was increasingly off the pace and there was open dissent against Horner fromVerstappen’s father, Jos, who had called for him to be removedamid a power struggle between the principal and Red Bull’s parent company.Fears that Verstappen might leave the team, with the car proving to be even further off the pace this season, are believed to have played a central part in Horner’s dismissal, which was orchestrated by Red Bull GmbH’s chief executive officer of corporate projects and investments, Oliver Mintzlaff.It is reported the agreement will allow Horner to return to work in F1 as early as next spring although Red Bull have not confirmed this. He is believed to want to return to the sport as soon as possible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However Alpine’s parent company, Renault, has repeatedly dismissed suggestions the team is for sale.“Leading Red Bull Racing has been an honour and privilege,” Horner’s statement read. “When we started in 2005, none of us could have imagined the journey ahead – the championships, the races, the people, the memories.

Although the Chiefs picked up their first victory of the season, their offense once again looked sluggish in the first-half against a poor Giants team. Kelce finished the game with four receptions for 26 yards.For just one game Caleb Williams finally gave the long-suffering Bears hopeRead moreKelce was not in the locker room when reporters were free to ask questions to players so he did not comment on the matter. But Reid said he was not worried about the incident.“I love Travis’s passion, man,” said Reid, who has won three Super Bowls alongside Kelce at the Chiefs. “I’m OK with that. We didn’t have enough of it in the second quarter. It wasn’t where we needed it to be, so, within reason, he knows when to back off the pedal and knows when to push it too. That’s the part I love about him. The guy is all-in. Sometimes, I have to be the policeman. He’s an emotional guy.”The Chiefs lost their opening two games of the season, a notable downturn for a team who have won their division every year since 2016. Last week in their loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, who also beat them in last season’s Super Bowl, Kelce yelled at Reid and threw his helmet to the ground in the second quarter.Kelce, one of the greatest tight ends of all time, will turn 36 this season and looks to be past his peak at an age when mostNFLplayers have long since retired. However, he looked cheerful as he left the field on Sunday night, and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes insisted Kelce and Reid have a good relationship.“He’s a guy that loves it,” Mahomes said after the game. “That’s what’s made him so great. I know [Reid and Kelce] love each other. That’s what you want out of the greats.”Kelce and Reid were involved in a similar incident during the Super Bowl in February 2024.Kelce barged into Reidafter being taken out of the game in the first-half as the Chiefs’ offense failed to make headway against the San Francisco 49ers, whom they went on to beat. The confrontation caused Reid to stumble and Kelce later admitted his behavior was out of line.“I can’t get that fired up to the point where bumping Coach and it’s getting him off balance and stuff,”he said. “When he stumbled, I was like: ‘Aw, shit’ in my head … If he would have cold cocked me in the face right there, I would have just ate it.”Explore more on these topicsTravis KelceNFLUS sportsKansas City ChiefsShareReuse this content"

The veteran guard, who finished the regular season ranked third in scoring with 20.2 points per game, shot 12 of 23 (52.2%) from the floor, including 4 of 6 from three-point range in her first-ever semi-final game.Aces’ peerless A’ja Wilson wins record fourth WNBA MVP awardRead more“I think what you guys see is just me trying to just be a kid in the playground,” said Mitchell, whose scoring tally was the second-highest in franchise history.Odyssey Sims had 17 points, while Natasha Howard finished with a double-double (12 points, 11 rebounds). The Fever finished the game hitting 50% from the floor (34 of 68), while the Aces shot just 29 of 71 (40.8%).“We wanted to come in and be the aggressor right away to make sure that we were dictating on the defensive end, and we were dictating from a pace standpoint,” Fever coach Stephanie White said. “We knew that they were going to make runs. They made a big one in the third and we responded with a big one. It’s one game, it’s a long series ... But to come in here and to be able to steal this one was big for us.”The victory spoiled A’ja Wilson’s celebrationafter she became the WNBA’s first playerto win four MVPs in her career. The 29-year-old, who was also named the AP Player of the Year, finished with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Wilson shot just 27.3% (6 of 22) from the field. Jackie Young led the Aces with 19 points, while Dana Evans came off the bench to score 14 points and Chelsea Gray chipped in with 13.Las Vegas hadn’t lost at home since 2 August, when the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx handed the Aces the worst home loss inWNBAhistory, a 53-point beatdown. From that point, the Aces closed the regular season on a 16-game win streak before defeating the Seattle Storm in the opening round.The win was even more impressive, considering the Aces came into the game without a single player on the injured list, while the Fever had six. Already shorthanded without Chloe Bibby (left knee), Caitlin Clark (right groin), Sydney Colson (left knee), Sophie Cunningham (right knee) and Aari McDonald (right foot), Indiana added Damiris Dantas to the list, as she was in concussion protocol.Explore more on these topicsWNBAIndiana FeverLas Vegas AcesBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Eyebrows had been raised by the way Manchester City approached the second half of theircommanding derby winlast week, sitting off, allowing United the ball and picking them off on the break. But their performance indrawing at Arsenal on Sundaywas on a different level entirely: just 33% possession, the lowest any Guardiola side has ever registered in a league game. By the end they had four central defenders, two holding midfielders and a full-back on the pitch.But even that doesn’t get to the heart of how strange this was. In the previous five seasons there have only been 10 occasions when City did not have more possession than their opponents in a Premier League game. Only once before in the Premier League has City’s possession under Guardiola dipped below 40% – when they registered 37% inbeating Arsenal 3-1 in February 2023, a decisive game in that season’s title race as it pulled City level on points with Arsenal at the top, although they had played a game more. That fixture, though, was an extreme version of the United game: City sitting deep, looking to strike on the break and, as it turned out, scoring twice in the final 20 minutes to seal their win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If they ended that game in 2023 with more defenders than they had started, it was only because of the ill-starred experiment with using Bernardo Silva at left-back. It was not a full-on retreat into the bunker. Sunday’s game was, at least until the decisive moment of injury-time when City, bafflingly in the circumstances, were undone by a ball played in behind their defensive line. Perhaps it’s unreasonable to expect a team so used to playing on the front foot to be able immediately to man the barricades.There was an odd sense of the game mirroring the sides’ clash at the Etihad last season. On that occasion it was Arsenal, with a half-time lead, who retreated and looked to stifle the second-half before succumbing in injury-time. The major difference then was that Arsenal had been reduced to 10 men by the dismissal of Leandro Trossard just before the break. And even then there was a sense that their retreat had been so extreme that they had courted the equaliser they eventually conceded. Why, then, would Guardiola do it with a full 11? Was the memory of last season’s5-1 mauling at the Emiratesweighing so heavily on him?Guardiola is not a dogmatist. He has always evolved. But even by his standards Sunday was a radical departure. He insisted after that the approach had been forced on him by “one of the best teams in Europe” but, given no Guardiola side has ever played remotely like that before, does that meanArsenalare by far the best side he has ever faced? Or is it an admission that he does not trust this squad to play the possession football with which he is so associated?Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreWhen he has changed before – a full-back tucking in as an additional midfielder, fielding four central defenders, having John Stones step out – it has always been with the intention of establishing control, of creating the platform on which the carousel could turn. This, though, was about survival. And what made it all the odder was that in the first-half, it was the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta whoseemed a little over-cautious, favouring the functional over the players who could have tried to expose a City side who, impressive as they have looked against United and a Napoli reduced early to 10, have lost twice already in the league this season and were potentially vulnerable.Caution is back at the highest level of football. The progressive, pass-heavy style that has been hegemonic over the past 15–20 years is yielding to a more physical game centred on crosses, set plays and giving nothing away. Even Guardiola is moving on from the paradigm he did more than anybody else to establish. Yet on top of the table, five points clear,are Liverpool, who began the season by reducing the amount of cover they had in midfield. As Arsenal and City fret, Liverpool blithely get on with scoring more than the opposition.It’s true that looking shaky in two-goal leads and relying on late winners is not sustainable, and true also that Arsenal, having played Liverpool (away) and City, have probably had the tougher fixture list. But still, as all the likely top three make stylistic tweaks, Liverpool’s is an extremely healthy position as their new signings settle.The uncertain journey into a post-Pepist world goes on.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

As hisManchester Citystay extends to 10 seasons, he relies ever more on the principle that big players can win big matches. Hence his late-career conversion to employing a wrecking ball striker in the peerless Erling Haaland. As for his former assistant Mikel Arteta, Arsenal looked stuck in the weeds of over-thinking. Benching Eberechi Eze, who tortured City in last season’s FA Cup final, till half-time was just too clever by half. Arteta’s recent talk of using rugby strategy, of thinking of substitutes as finishers, in the style of South Africa’s “bomb squad” is all very well. Even if the substitute Gabriel Martinelli scored the equaliser from an Eze long ball, a talented, capable squad playing one-dimensional fare is far less explicable. This is not the City who previously dominated the Premier League. They showed their own limitations, particularly once Haaland, brilliant as attacker and defender, was removed.John BrewinMatch report:Arsenal 1-1 Manchester CityView image in fullscreenPep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta showed their tactical limitations during the 1-1 draw between their teams.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters2Grealish gives Liverpool a scareJack Grealish knows he has a point to prove atEverton. After being cast aside at Manchester City and allowed to depart on loan, the winger’s career faced questions. He took the opportunity to join an Everton side heading into a new era at Hill Dickinson Stadium and with a new, more attacking strategy under David Moyes. Having someone of Grealish’s quality almost feels like a luxury at a club more accustomed to finishing in the bottom half but the England international is backing up his natural ability with hard work. He had the better of Conor Bradley for much of the Merseyside derby, helped set up the Everton goal and was repeatedly fouled as Liverpool did what they could to stop him. With an international break not too far away, Grealish will once more be a serious contender for a call-up. It would be merited.Will UnwinMatch report:Liverpool 2-1 Everton3Shaw accepts Keane criticismIn the aftermath of victory over Chelsea, Luke Shaw admitted that Roy Keane’s criticism of him that “he doesn’t even want to tackle” during Manchester United’s 3-0 defeat at Manchester City hurts. The defender said: “Sometimes you have to take it on the chin. I wasn’t at my level at all. I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me. The most important thing is knowing how good I can be. The manager knows that. The managers who I played with in the past know that. I’m always in the team and I’m always playing, so there must be something that the managers believe in. I’m not getting any younger now and I need to be consistent.”Jamie JacksonMatch report:Manchester United 2-1 ChelseaView image in fullscreenLuke Shaw tackles Chelsea’s Andrey Santos during Saturday’s much-needed defeat of Enzo Maresca’s team.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA4Exasperated Emery looks for identityUnai Emery had seen enough. With 30 seconds remaining Aston Villa’s manager stormed down the tunnel, presumably in search of his side’s missing identity. No matter that Matty Cash had scored Villa’s firstPremier Leaguegoal of the season, a 1-1 draw against a Sunderland side reduced to 10 men when Reinildo was sent off for violent conduct in the 33rd minute was not good enough for the Spaniard. “We are not like a team we want to be,” said Emery. “I’m disappointed. We need to get our confidence back, collectively and as individuals. My worry is that we are not playing with our identity.” If something is wrong at Villa Park, Régis Le Bris is doing an awful lot right at Sunderland. This was the promoted side’s eighth point from five games and Le Bris was evidently delighted by his supremely organised 10-men team’s willingness “to suffer” before Wilson Isidor’s equalising half-volley.Louise TaylorMatch report:Sunderland 1-1 Aston Villa5Brighton handle Baleba with careFabian Hürzeler removed Carlos Baleba at half-time after 45 minutes in which Tottenham dominated midfield but conceded two well-taken Brighton goals. The explanation given was not injury but fatigue. Hürzeler proceeded to deliver a sermon on the pitfalls of husbanding talent when players become subject to transfer speculation. Baleba was linked during the summer transfer window with a £100m-plus move to Manchester United. “When a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep. Even if he’s not saying: ‘It affects me,’ maybe deep inside of him there is something,” said Brighton’s manager. “It’s also part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and to make the next step as a team.” Baleba had lost possession eight times, completing just 17 passes. “There are waves in the development,” said Hürzeler. “It’s not always linear. He’s not a machine.”John BrewinMatch report:Brighton 2-2 Tottenham6Midfield leads West Ham’s problemsIt was obvious that West Ham had to fix their midfield last summer. It is absurd that they focus on other positions first, signing Mads Hermansen to be their new goalkeeper and replacing Emerson Palmieri with El Hadji Malick Diouf at left-back. Priorities were skewed. It was only after West Ham lost their first two games that they brought in new midfielders. Even then, though, Graham Potter and the club’s recruitment chief, Kyle Macaulay, chose questionably. Mateus Fernandes has done well since joining from Southampton but Soungoutou Magassa has been restricted to two substitute appearances. The France Under-21d international has not played much senior football, is adapting to the English game and has joined a team short of leaders and quality. It is not fair to expect a 21-year-old to make an immediate impact. He has potential and may come good in the long run but he feels like a bonus signing.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:West Ham 1-2 Crystal Palaceskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Down on the south coast on Sunday, they saw their team eke out a third successive 0-0 draw away from home, making it 270 minutes of goalless football on the road after stalemates atAston Villaand Leeds. Across those trips to Elland Road and the Vitality Stadium, Newcastle mustered just 12 shots. Nick Woltemade, who looked so imposing on debut against Wolves at St James’ Park, was kept quiet by Bafodé Diakité and Marcos Senesi in the middle of the Bournemouth defence. “That wasn’t necessarily an easy watch all the way through but I think they can see the commitment from the players,” Howe said, somewhat guardedly, after the game.Billy MundayMatch report:Bournemouth 0-0 NewcastleView image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou was soaked at Burnley but should have felt some inner warmth after Nottingham Forest showed some spirit.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/PA8Postecoglou plan is taking shapeAfter losing to Arsenal, Ange Postecoglou was asked when his trademark Ange-ball style might be discernible in his newNottingham Forestteam. “Wednesday,” was the unequivocal answer from the straight-talking Australian. In reality, he was three days out. A much-changed Forest side collapsed to a chaotic late defeat at Swansea on the day in question. The players who turned out at Burnley on Saturday, however, exhibited exactly the kind of verve and vigour in attack that Postecoglou demands. He stressed there was still work ahead, especially around finishing, but believes already that Forest look “a different team” to the one he inherited from Nuno Espírito Santo. Forest are winless in three games under Postecoglou so far, but the early signs of progress are there.Dominic BoothMatch report:Burnley 1-1 Nottingham Forest9Wolves’ bleak start continuesThis time last season, Wolves had also failed to win any of their first five league matches, but the difference this time is the fixture list. Gary O’Neil could point towards the difficulty of a bruising set of opening fixtures as mitigation given their first five games were against teams who went on to finish in the top seven:Arsenal, Chelsea, Nottingham Forest, Newcastle and Aston Villa. The schedule this season has been kind by comparison but Wolves are worse off, pointless after Leeds stormed to a comeback win at Molineux on Saturday. Wolves, also beaten by Manchester City, Bournemouth, Everton and Newcastle in the league this campaign, travel to Tottenham next weekend after a Carabao Cup third-round tie at home to David Moyes’s side. “A win would give us confidence,” Vítor Pereira said. “We need to improve, I need to improve.”Ben FisherMatch report:Wolves 1-3 Leeds10Sessegnon flourishing back homeIt’s easy to forget that Ryan Sessegnon is still only 25. The full-back emerged as a teen sensation in 2017-18, scoring 15 goals in the Championship on the way to promotion withFulham. His career has not been simple, blighted by injury and an inability to break through at Tottenham. After rejoining his childhood club last season he has been rebuilding and is starting to show what a player he is. Sessegnon has started every Premier League match so far this season and against Brentford he was a constant offensive threat, either driving with the ball or with his deliveries. An irresistible whipped cross tempted Ethan Pinnock into making contact and an own goal that sealed the game. His combination play with Alex Iwobi was key to the Cottagers’ success. The result will reaffirm supporters’ belief that Fulham can look upwards this season, something that – fingers crossed – will apply to Sessegnon personally too.Paul MacInnesMatch report:Fulham 3-1 BrentfordPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool56152Arsenal58103Tottenham Hotspur57104AFC Bournemouth51105Crystal Palace5496Chelsea5587Sunderland5288Fulham5189Man City54710Everton51711Man Utd5-2712Leeds5-3713Newcastle50614Brighton5-2515Nottm Forest5-4516Burnley5-3417Brentford5-4418Aston Villa5-4319West Ham5-8320Wolverhampton5-90Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballArsenalManchester CityEvertonManchester UnitedAston VillaBrighton & Hove AlbionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has expressed a desire, having now won four successive 200m world titles, to surpass Usain Bolt’s recordwith a fifth at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing in 2027.But the American’s mind has wandered even further. “I have a strong blueprint of what I want my last year in the sport to look like,” he says. “I’ve looked pretty far into the future.”World Athletics Championships: USA dominate table again as GB suffer worst finish since 2003Read moreLyles rules out a tilt for the 2032 Games in Brisbane, when he will be 35, making Los Angeles in 2028 his Olympic swansong. The plan is for a final year “somewhere in between 2028 and 2032”, racing at three meets in countries he’s never been to, “so that I can touch a lot of bucket list things”.There will also be a few competitions “close to home” and then one final flourish. “The last race would be at my own track meet, where I’d be able to do any and everything that I want.”He laughs at this thought, a glimpse at the glee Lyles exudes when he is in world-beating form. It’s a contrast from his presence in Japan for the Olympics four years ago, when he was managing depression and finished third in the 200m behind winner Canadian Andre De Grasse.In a celebratory mood in downtown Tokyo, Lyles takes a question about his advancing years in good humour. “Uh oh, I’m getting up there aren’t I,” the 28-year-old says, chuckling again. “Last year in Paris was the halfway mark for me, literally turning 26 to 27 in Paris, I was like, ‘OK, I’m on the other half of the hill’.”He says he thinks about his age regularly, in order to make the most of his time in the sport. “If I really push everything I want out of every year and month and week and day that I have, I don’t think I’ll ever regret any of the years.”View image in fullscreenLyles blitzed the field to win the men’s 200m final in Tokyo.Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty ImagesThis sustained commitment is just about holding the next generation at bay. In the 200m final in Tokyo, Lyles was the second oldest behind only Britain’s Zharnel Hughes. The pair are now outliers increasingly swamped by youth.Twenty-four-year-old Oblique Seville rumbled to 100m gold in Tokyo, and his countryman Kishane Thompson is the same age. Another Jamaican, Bryan Levell, won bronze behind Lyles at 21, and Letsile Tebogo, the 200m Olympic champion, is still just 22.Then there are those next in line, including Gout Gout. Lyles knows the Australian better than most, having been connected through the Adidas stable, and the American has not been shy about sharing his opinion of the 17-year-old, the youngest to compete in the 200m in Tokyo, but unable to progress past the semi-finals.Whether the teenager lives up to his potential, the man with eight world championship golds says, is up to him. “He’s obviously so young, very talented, but there’s so many people who have been talented in our sport that unfortunately haven’t been able to hit that upper echelon,” Lyles says. “It’s more about, what’s the path he’s going to take, who’s the team that he’s going to take with him, and how much work are you going to put into not just being athletic, but knowing that you’ve got to be a businessperson and you’ve got to be it young.”Despite Gout’s burgeoning profile, his pre-meet exposure for Tokyo was restricted toone media opportunity. The Australian was generous with his time following his elimination, but his light international schedule this year and a patient approach by his coach Di Sheppard and manager James Templeton – as well as Gout’s commitment to his final high school exams next month – has frustrated an athletics community hungry for more of the Brisbane teenager.“That’s the hardest part about being such a young talent, you have to grow up so much faster than everybody else,” Lyles says. “When people get to come to you and they’re like, ‘hey, we need this of you’, unfortunately you don’t get to say ‘I’m only a teenager’. Because once you sign the contract, once you’re on the track, you’re no longer a teenager, you’re now a businessman.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He says he does not have to balance his true self with the showman fans recognise, because those personas are one and the same. “That’s why I have a lot of people who do – and don’t – like me,” he says, that laugh erupting again.2:38‘The future of sprinting is hazy right now', says US sprint king Noah Lyles – videoBut he is serious when talking about what comes next for the sport. “The future of sprinting is hazy right now. There is so much talent, there is so much room for growth and there are so many new personalities coming up, but I feel the way that the sport is right now, nobody knows which direction to go in.”Golden 5,000m kick gives Cole Hocker solace after being ‘robbed’ in 1500mRead moreHe says it is not just about who will emerge as the next great performers on the track, and that the uncertainty extends to “everything involving athletics”. World Athletics has scheduled a new event next year, the Ultimate Championship, to make up for the absence of a global major in 2026, but Lyles has yet to commit to racing there. The Netflix series Sprint, featuring Lyles and other top sprinters, found an audience but it has not replicated Formula One’s success in cultivating mass appeal through Drive to Survive. There were also high hopes forMichael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track, until it fell into financial ruin.Lyles,a long-time cheerleader for the sport, says a fear of backlash among athletes and a sometimes-poisonous fan culture is holding the sport back. “Somebody was asking me to give some advice to Letsile [Tebogo] and I was like, ‘to be honest, you’ve just got to be yourself’,” he says.“We want to come out here and be showmen and give our greatest performances, but we also want to be ourselves, and I think that sometimes we’re not allowed to be ourselves out of fear of how people will perceive us, knowing that this is just a sport.

There have been one or two key errors but we’re talking about 50 Premier League games, every one high octane. They are there to be enjoyed and right now referees are playing their part. Let’s hope that continues.Even one of the major talking points from the weekend was not a wrong decision in terms of the laws but a question of how to manage it. That is a reference to Darren England’s booking of Kiernan Dewsbury‑Hall for taking a quick free-kick in the Merseyside derby, a decision that apparently baffled Jack Grealish. It’s one that is worth looking at.Pep Guardiola is leading a strangely defensive new approach to the Premier LeagueRead moreWhat you find with free-kicks is that normally in the defensive third or the middle of the park, teams want to play. So the ball is put down and, provided it is not moving, away we go. In and around the penalty area with attacking free‑kicks, players want more ceremonial stuff. They want it stopped. They want to set the wall up. They want to be in the right position.As a referee, you would normally just say: “Do you want to go fast or slow?” And they’ll say: “No, we’ll wait for the whistle, ref.” So that’s it. You stop the game then. You’re in control of that situation. The ball’s placed, you put your spray down, you march the wall back 9.15 metres, remind everyone about using their arms so they don’t handball it and the players will want to take a free-kick on your whistle.At Anfield the free-kick in question for Everton was just inside the Liverpool half. England was setting everything up and making his way towards the penalty area. Then the free-kick was taken while he had his back to the ball and he cautioned Dewsbury‑Hall for unsporting behaviour.I don’t know what was said between the referee and the Everton players; he could have been telling them to wait for the whistle. But my view is that’s a situation you can manage. In that situation, I’m getting Everton to take the free-kick again. If you do that, you wouldn’t have too many complaints, would you?View image in fullscreenKiernan Dewsbury-Hall was booked for taking a free kick too quickly against Liverpool.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersWhat happened on the same afternoon at Fulham is testimony to the good start in terms of officiating. We saw some strong refereeing from Michael Oliver and a good video assistant referee intervention which led to an in-stadium announcement.Let’s start with the VAR intervention which led to Fulham having a goal overturned, after Rodrigo Muniz was adjudged to have fouled Nathan Collins in the buildup. It was a really good intervention because Oliver can’t see the action from his position. Before Muniz takes possession he flings an arm back. It’s not a violent act but he catches Collins in the face which draws blood. Then he spins away, turns and scores.After Jarred Gillett, the VAR, recommends a review, Oliver goes to the monitor and looks at it. Oliver quite clearly sees something he didn’t see in real time and disallows the goal. It’s a fair call because Muniz’s arm catches Collins and the defender can’t then challenge for the ball.Oliver then comes back on to the pitch and explains his decision to the crowd. They get to understand why a referee has done what they’ve done. We’re always looking for more communication – it’s really important – and the game has evolved to take it in. It is important that people understand the decision-making process. There’s nothing worse than leaving the ground and not knowing what has happened, so these announcements are a strong addition and a really good communication tool for spectators in the stadium and fans watching on TV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The situation occurs when King goes down in the box apparently under a challenge from Jordan Henderson. Simulation, in refereeing terms, is a decision that has to be taken very, very quickly and has multiple factors. Is the player avoiding contact? Is the player initiating contact? Is he exaggerating contact, or are they just throwing themselves to the ground in the hope of winning the penalty?King was already going to ground, then he made contact with Henderson and Oliver was in the right position to spot this: directly behind play on the edge of the area, with a clear view. If you’re a young referee and you’re learning your trade, the position of the referee in this instance is exactly the place you want to be. Oliver issues a yellow card to King for simulation because, while there is contact, King does try to deceive the referee into awarding a penalty. Oliver was quick, decisive and very positive.Chris Foy is a former Premier League referee and will be writing regular columns for the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsFootballRefereesLaws of footballcommentShareReuse this content"

The three minutes were completely correct because there were only three moments where a substitution was made. There was no time-wasting because that’s not what we do and there was no treatment of injuries, one goal scored. Then you come to three [minutes]. Where in many other games when we need a goal, there’s a lot, a lot, a lot of time-wasting going on, I can tell you.”Slot revealed immediately after the derby that Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, Mohamed Salah, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai would not feature in the Carabao Cup tie against Southampton on Tuesday as he manages their workloads. On Monday the Dutchman confirmed Liverpool will field “a completely changed lineup” to the derby in the third-round tie. Recent signings Alexander Isak, Giovanni Leoni and Giorgi Mamardashvili are expected to start.“We can go through all of them – Wataru Endo and a few more,” Slot said. “These are the players that need a game and we’re happy that we have one. If we wouldn’t have had one, we probably would have arranged a friendly in this week for these players because they need to play games as well to keep them ready whenever we need them.“We’ve used quite a lot in the last three games because we thought we needed to keep this energy throughout all the three games – but not all of them. And the few we haven’t used, it’s definitely the perfect moment for them to get playing time.”Slot also confirmed Liverpool will pay tribute to Matt Beard on Tuesday after thedeath of the club’s former women’s manager. “It’s very important for us to pay tribute, for what he meant for this football club. This football club is not only the men’s team, it’s also the women’s team and he had an enormous impact on women’s football here with Liverpool,” Slot said. “But apart from that, it’s also his family that’s going through such a hard time at the moment.“He did great things for this football club, for the women’s team, back-to-back league titles, came back to [the] new women’s team when they were playing one division below, so that tells you probably how much he loved the club as well. The Melwood staff and everyone that worked with him liked him so much – and that’s probably even a more important legacy to leave behind than the trophies you win.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotEvertonRefereesnewsShareReuse this content"

David Sullivan, West Ham’s largest shareholder, is considering his options afterdefeat against Crystal Palace on Saturdayand is widely expected to sack Potter soon. No decision has been made and, as it stands, the former Chelsea manager will be in charge for the trip to Everton next Monday.The feeling inside and outside the club is that Sullivan’s lack of clarity over his next move has provided Potter with a reprieve. West Ham have held informal talks with Nuno about taking over but sources have cautioned thatthe former Nottingham Forest managercould be too expensive. There are also indications that the is prepared to wait for another job should West Ham prove unwilling to agree to his terms.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreSome figures around Sullivan are pushing for him to turn to Bilic and ask the Croat to step in until the end of the season. Bilic, who has been out of work since leaving the Saudi Pro League club Al-Fateh last year, managed West Ham between 2015 and 2017. He is open to returning and there is a feeling that the 57-year-old could be a galvanising force.Bilic has assessed West Ham’s squad and is thinking about his backroom team. There is a possibility of him asking the former West Ham captain Mark Noble to help him. Noble became West Ham’s sporting director after retiring, but has shown little indication that he is interested in coaching. Bilic will also consider asking the former West Ham defender James Collins to be part of his backroom staff.View image in fullscreenSlaven Bilic was manager of West Ham between 2015 and 2017.Photograph: ReutersGary O’Neil, the former Wolves manager and West Ham midfielder, is interested in replacing Potter, who has recorded six wins from 25 games since being appointed last January. Sullivan will not hire a manager who does not have Premier League experience.The decision to retain Potter after the Palace game is not seen as a sign of faith in the 50-year-old. Sources have indicated that West Ham, who are 19th after four defeats from their first five league games, do not want to make a change without having a replacement lined up. Potter may be given until the international break next month, by which time they will have had trips to Everton and Arsenal.He has struggled to implement his style and has failed to organise his defence. West Ham, who wereknocked out of the Carabao Cup by Wolveslast month, have conceded seven times from corners this season. There is bewilderment at the team’s lack of organisation. It is also felt that West Ham’s recruitment was not good enough this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arne Slot’s champions have already established a five-point cushion at the top of the table after an unblemished start to their title defence.Aftera 2-2 draw at Brentfordand then a2-1 defeat at Manchester United, Chelsea are seven points off the championship pace. Liverpool secured the title last season with four matches to spare and then broke their transfer record twice this summer, signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen, in a deal which could rise to £116m, before spending £125m on Alexander Isak on deadline day. In all, Liverpool spent more than £400m on new signings.Pep Guardiola is leading a strangely defensive new approach to the Premier LeagueRead more“If they continue in this way I think it is impossible to catch them, not just for us, but for all the clubs,” Maresca said. “They have been doing a fantastic job since last year, and the players they have decided to buy shows the intention of the club to go again for the Premier League and the Champions League, and that is quite clear.”Chelsea, winless in three matches after alsolosing to Bayern Munich in the Champions Leaguelast week, face Lincoln in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday. Cole Palmer is set to be unavailable following his first-half withdrawal with a groin problem in the defeat at Old Trafford on Saturday. Maresca is hopeful the 23-year-old will not need an operation on the injury which has restricted him to just two league starts this season, but admitted the club are staging a meeting to determine the best route forward for their star player.Asked whether Palmer will need to have an operation on the injury, Maresca said: “The medical staff, they didn’t mention to me about surgery. I don’t know if in the next days or the next weeks, but I don’t think so, to be honest. But we need to protect Cole, 100%. Because of the Club World Cup, and we never stopped, we need to manage and protect different players, and Cole is one of them.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer looked in pain when he went off against Manchester United and his fitness will have to be managed carefully.Photograph: Paul Currie/Shutterstock“Now we have a meeting with the medical staff and decide the best solution for him. It is not an injury which is black and white. It is an injury which on some days you can be better and the pain disappears, and sometimes you can be worse so that is why we have to manage it day by day.”Maresca is set to use a number of academy players for the tie at the LNER Stadium against a side who are third in League One. The gulf between the two teams ensuresChelseaare the overwhelming favourites to progress to the next stage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 62-year-old corporate lawyer brought the energy, ideas and self-certainty that helped transformArsenalfrom drifting in the immediate post-Arsène Wenger years to sustained title challengers under Mikel Arteta. His perceived wisdom was less well received.“Tim has ideas and opinions on every subject and they are always right,” another club source said, with some sarcasm. “His absence will certainly be felt, although he may not be missed. He was very forceful. I never had a problem myself. It will be one less person speaking at meetings I suppose. Other big voices like Steve Parish and Todd Boehly may come to the fore.”Lewis was particularly forceful in urging the Premier League to strongly enforce its profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) and associated party transaction (APT) regulations, projecting Arsenal as leaders of the self-sufficient elite against state-funded clubs with theoretically unlimited means. This led to repeated clashes with executives from Manchester City and Newcastle, among others.Such simmering ill-feeling led to a minor diplomatic incident at the Etihad Stadium last September when Lewis left the directors’ box having apparently failed to shake hands with his hosts after City’s last-minute equaliser. Unsurprisingly, some City executives struggled to disguise their feelings of schadenfreude at Lewis’s absence, after an 18-year association with the Kroenke family,during Sunday’s visit to the Emirates Stadium.View image in fullscreenVinai Venkatesham (left) will represent Tottenham in Premier League meetings after the departure of Daniel Levy (right) from the club.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersAfter Lewis was appointed executive vice-chair two years ago, a move that triggered thedeparture of Arsenal’s chief executive at the time, Vinai Venkatesham, he became particularly vocal at Premier League meetings. In addition to taking a strong line on PSR and APTs he pushed successfully for rules limiting the amortisation period of players’ contracts to five years, in response to the new Chelsea ownership handing out eight-year deals, but was unable to persuade the requisite 14 clubs to close other perceived financial loopholes such as the sale of property assets to related companies.Levy pursued many of the same objectives by very different means, earning the grudging respect, rather than resentment, of others. Although he often drove the hardest of bargains as in his transfer negotiations, few of his peers knew what he was thinking until the time came for him to speak.“I doubt there’ll be much impact felt from Daniel’s absence at the meetings themselves,” one said. “He was very careful not to antagonise people and would say very little. He was always very polite, never aggressive. He preferred to do his lobbying in private, as he didn’t want people to know what he was up to.“The boardroom changes at Tottenham and Arsenal have got people talking, but I’d be surprised if it makes a substantive difference to the Premier League, as the instructions from the owners won’t change. Both clubs are run very prudently and I’m sure that will continue. They’ve both been big advocates of PSR and will vote for the new squad cost controls which are being proposed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that was then and this is now, and now even their actual fans aren’t sure they want to watch any more. There were 11,048 people at Montilivi this Saturday, out of the city centre and to the south beyond theFree City of Braavos and Kings Landing. There were at the start anyway; by the time Girona FC, the last and briefest of the great disruptors, conceded the fourth goal of another miserable afternoon most of them had already gone. The few who stayed chanted for the board to resign, just about audible over the catchiest club anthem in La Liga being belted out of huge speakers hung from scaffolding stands.It was the fifth time in a row Girona’s supporters had seen their team lose here going back to May, a summer break, a new start, offering no break at all; instead, they were bottom of the table and had been battered again. Sevilla had come and scored two, Rayo Vallecano three, now Levante had four. They had gone to Villarreal and let in five. Girona,owned by Manchester City, the best of Spain’sother teamsa year ago, Champions League anthem blaring out just a few months back, have a single point from when they drew 1-1 with Celta de Vigo, and that’s nothing special: Celta draw 1-1 with everyone, their last five gamesallfinishing with the same scoreline.Lorenzo Pellegrini strikes to settle derby but his future may lie beyond RomaRead moreThis isn’t the way it’s supposed to be.

There was almost a kind of relief when they were defeated by Real Madrid that February, as if they had been released, real life intervening so they no longer had tocling to an illusion, expectations weighing on them. “This,” the coach Míchel Sanchez said that night at the Bernabéu, “is not our league” but the Champions League would be, an extraordinary, historic third place taking them into Europe, starting at the Parc des Princes.Which was where, a year ago almost to the day, the Paris Saint-Germain coach said they were the “most enjoyable” team to watch in La Liga playing “wonderful football”, with a “great manager”. He wasn’t wrong either: it was not just what Girona did, it was how they did it. “Playing well needn’t be unusual,” Míchel said. Champions League football was the reward. There was a promise too: Cristhian Stuani, the club’s greatest ever player but 37 andnot expected to appear much, would start with the captain’s armband. “Coming here reminded me of [promotion against] Tenerife and the second division years,” Míchel said. “We’ve done this with wonderful days.

A last-minute own goal from Paulo Gazzaniga meant they lost 1-0 in Paris, the first in a catalogue of moments when they didn’t so much shoot themselves in the foot as point a bazooka at it and blow the thing to bits. They scored two own goals, missed a penalty and had a goal disallowed in a 3-2 loss against a Feyenoord side who had only taken two shots on target. There was another own goal against PSV and two more penalties conceded, againstLiverpoolandArsenal. They had been unlucky, opposition coaches kept insisting – Arne Slot came and said so, Mikel Arteta did too – but they finished 33rd in the table. Only Young Boys and Slovan Bratislava won fewer games.That wasn’t the worst of it either: back in Spain, Girona were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by fourth-tier UD Logroñés. InLa Liga, they found themselves slipping towards trouble, the unexpectedness part of the problem, eventually avoiding relegation by one point. Now, the fear is that they do it over again, a dreadful start not simply a fluke. It is not just that they have not won in five games this season; it is that they have only won two of their last 21.On one level, this is the classic overachiever’s story, the team that took them into the Champions League taken apart with a crushing inevitability, soon slipping back to where they belong. At the end of the season in which they finished third, Artem Dovbyk, Aleix García, Eric García, and Savinho were among the players to leave, their top scorer, top assister, top passer, top dribbler and top tackler all gone. Five of the seven outfield players with the most minutes had left, leaving a huge hole, and it is hard to identify an unqualified success among the replacements. Six ofthissummer’s departures only came 12 months earlier, ditched already. Miguel Gutiérrez and Yangel Herrera left too, and theywouldbe missed. Nor was the business sorted in good time, Míchel complaining that the uncertainty affected everything, minds elsewhere as they team was left behind. “For someone, this year’s project hasn’t started; I don’t know if the club thinks the first nine points aren’t important, but they are to me,” he said.And yet there is something else, something deeper, a little less tangible – and it ate at him. On the eve of that PSG game, he had insisted the Champions League was there to be enjoyed, that they would always have Paris – yes, he really said that – but it was La Liga that would define them. The Champions League could only be positive; it would not be a distraction nor alter their focus. But that was precisely what happened, Girona blinded by the lights, dizzy new heights. It was, Míchel became increasingly aware, as if the Champions League was all that mattered, the league abandoned until suddenly, with Europe gone, it began to look dangerously like that would slip from them too. That he was increasingly prepared to say so spoke of his desperation, a coach losing control.After defeat against Betis, he declared they had hit “rock bottom”, but there was further to fall. “I don’t feel represented by these players; that’s hard to take, very painful,” he said. He had seen “a dead team on the pitch and I need a team with passion,” he said. As he left the press conference room after a 1-1 draw with Leganés in week 33, he said something even more striking: turning towards the press officer, he muttered: “I want to die, mate”. The coach committed to a style, to playing, to enjoyment, insisted that competing came first. “We lack soul; this isn’t a football question, it’s an emotional one, a mental one,” he said; it was about pressure or a lack of it, about application and ego. A failure to see where they really were,whothey really were.View image in fullscreenCristhian Stuani’s goals were crucial in keeping Girona up last season.Photograph: Javier Borrego/AFP7/ShutterstockMore eloquent than anything he said was what he did; in those final weeks, he turned to the old guard, to Stuani and Portu, to those he could trust, those who cared, to rescue them. Stuani scored the only goal in wins against Mallorca in week 34 and Valladolid in week 36 which saw them safe, just. Stuani, at 38, scored four of Girona’s last five goals of the season (seven of the last nine), Portu got the other. Stuani finished as top scorer, with less than a third of the minutes.Gladbach’s late rally could earn Polanski chance to save their season | Andy BrassellRead moreSomething was broken, the most fundamental thing of all. Everything they had done had disintegrated, the dream damaging them. This was not so easily fixed, and the fault lines were ever more public. Fans couldn’t be expected to back them if they didn’t leave their skin out there, Míchel said. When they conceded five to Villarreal he insisted: “We’re playing with people’s pride. Today I felt we weren’t a team.” Then this Saturday, it happened again: two red cards didn’t help, and in truth they have had worse performances, but by the end, it was another bad day, another four goals conceded. The team that was so much fun not worth watching any more, not really a team at all. Bottom of the table, without a win, goal difference -13.“I’m the most fearful person, but I fight fear with work,” Míchel said, the place empty now. “Everything is dramatic, lamentable, terrible, but I see green shoots. We need a reset. I see a lack of humility. They’re not playing in the Champions League Girona side now. If anyone thinks they are, they’re wrong. Fight for your team, that’s what we’re asking for. We have to leave our egos behind. There are players who at two down thought, ‘bah, this is shit, I’ve played in the Champions League, I’ve won at Barcelona … ’ No. You’re doing as badly as I am. Get rid of your ego now, mate. I have. I’m the worst coach in La Liga.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid58152Barcelona513133Villarreal56104Espanyol51105Elche5396Real Betis6297Athletic Bilbao5098Getafe5-199Sevilla51710Alaves50711Valencia5-2712Atletico Madrid51613Osasuna50614Rayo Vallecano5-1515Celta Vigo6-2516Levante50417Oviedo5-7318Real Sociedad5-4219Mallorca5-5220Girona5-131Explore more on these topicsLa LigaSportblogEuropean club footballGironafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Roma tried to get rid of him in January, offering him to Inter as a makeweight in their unsuccessful bid to sign Davide Frattesi. They pushed even harder in August, contracting intermediaries to find him a new home. Talks were held with teams including West Ham and Besiktas, but none were able to strike a deal.How had it come to this? Pellegrini was once a beloved club captain. A Rome-born Roma supporter, who joined the club’s academy before his 10th birthday, he was the heir to Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi, the latest in a line of homegrown captains.European roundup: Ferran Torres at the double as Barcelona cruise past GetafeRead moreA story foretold, until this script was rewritten. Popular in his younger years, Pellegrini had more recently become a scapegoat for disgruntled elements of theGiallorossi’sfanbase. There was not one incident that turned supporters against him, but rather a slow buildup of grievances. Some were straightforward if subjective: a perception that his performances had plateaued at a level below what should be expected from one of Roma’s best-paid players.Others were built on hearsay and misinformation. AfterDe Rossi was firedas Roma manager four games into last season, Pellegrini’s car was set upon by supporters who accused him of conspiring against his former teammate. Shouts of “take off the armband” were accompanied by demands to know “how many more do you want to get rid of?”Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowLecce 1-2 Cagliari, Bologna 2-1 Genoa, Verona 1-1 Juventus, Udinese 0-3 Milan, Lazio 0-1 Roma, Cremonese 0-0 Parma, Torino 0-3 Atalanta, Fiorentina 1-2 Como, Inter Milan 2-1 Sassuolo, Napoli v Pisa (Monday 7.45pm)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Pellegrini had also been blamed forJosé Mourinho’s sacking. On the day he was let go, the Portuguese left a ring Roma’s players had given him for his 60th birthday in Pellegrini’s locker, reportedly with a note reading: “I hope you can win a lot in the future, and I hope you can become a better man.”Ultra groups made it clear whose side they were on in this breakup, hanging a banner outside the training ground declaring Pellegrini to be Roma’s “weak ring”. But did the player deserve any of it? His opinion was indeed sought by owners before each manager’s sacking, but in both cases he had defended their work.In an interview with the newspaperIl Messaggero, Pellegrini said he had called Mourinho to clear the air, saying: “He was told some things about me that were absolutely not true … we chatted for a long time.” Likewise, after De Rossi’s sacking, he described reports of his involvement as “pure science fiction.”View image in fullscreenThe departing José Mourinho left a note for Pellegrini that read: ‘I hope you can win a lot in future, and I hope you can become a better man.’Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPANone of which seemed to change the dynamics of Pellegrini’s situation at Roma. Gian Piero Gasperini took over as manager in June knowing a player who had once been considered as one of the club’s greatest assets was now a potential liability.The manager defused one tension by implementing a new policy whereby the captain’s armband would be worn by the player with the highest number of appearances for Roma, effectively stripping Pellegrini of the role (Stephan El Shaarawy and Bryan Cristante would now be ahead of him) without making an explicit decision to do so. He had taken the same approach at Atalanta.Pellegrini underwent two surgeries during the summer – the first on his hamstring, the second to fix a deviated septum. Gasperini prepared a Roma team without him. TheGiallorossiwon their first two games of the season 1-0, at home to Bologna and away to Pisa, before losing by the same score to Torino.Those, though, were just a warm-up. Sunday was this season’s first big landmark: the derby against Lazio, a game a new manager can not afford to lose. Nobody could question Gasperini’s credentials, after his work establishingAtalanta as Europa League winnersand regular Champions League qualifiers over the past decade, but plenty of Roma fans still needed to be won over by a man they disliked as a rival.Gasperini acknowledged his dilemma about how to reintegrate Pellegrini on the eve of the game. The player was back to full training, meaning decisions had to be made. “Can I get the old Pellegrini back by myself?” he asked. “Is that OK for the club? Is that OK for the fans? This is a potentially high-level player. But if he is unpopular with the fans now, I can’t do it. If he’s unwanted by the club now, I can’t do it.”He sounded uncertain. Perhaps that was only a bluff. A day later, Pellegrini was in the starting lineup to face Lazio, sitting in front of Cristante and Manu Koné to support the attack in a 3-4-1-2.Maybe Gasperini knew his history. Pellegrini had scored three times before in the Rome derby, all of them gems:a spinning backheel in 2018,a spectacular free-kick in 2022andanother top-corner finisheven as his future was being discussed at the start of this year. All of them at the same end, the Tevere, Lazio’s Curva, rubbing it in the face of their rivals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neither side started especially well, but Lazio looked slightly the more dangerous side until an error in possession by their left-back Nuno Tavares allowed the ball to run to Matías Soulé inside the area. He played a square pass to Pellegrini, who finished first time into the bottom-left corner.View image in fullscreenPellegrini’s shot, seven minutes before half-time, nestles in the bottom corner to give Roma three points against Lazio.Photograph: Fabrizio Corradetti/LaPresse/ ShutterstockToo overcome to celebrate, Pellegrini stretched his arms out until Cristante and Evan Ferguson arrived to embrace him. As he walked back to halfway he gestured a kiss towards Roma’s supporters in the Curva Sud. “There’s one constant to all of this,” Pellegrini said at full-time. “I love Roma.”Perhaps those fans can find their way to loving him again, too. His goal was enough to decide this derby, giving Roma their first win as the “away” team in the ground they share with Lazio since 2016.TheBiancocelestipushed for an equaliser and nearly got one from their own homegrown vice-captain, Danilo Cataldi, who whipped a shot against the post in injury time. But they also lost their heads, Reda Belahyane earning a red card for raking his studs down Koné’s calf and Mattéo Guendouzi another for berating the referee at the end.It was a game low on quality, between teams still working out who they want to be under new managers – or a returning one in Lazio’s case, Maurizio Sarri back in the dugout after a year away. Gasperini was explicit pre-game, saying he has no intention of changing his fundamental man-to-man, high-pressing approach. But he also acknowledged he is still working out which pieces fit where from the squad .A returning Pellegrini creates a problem. Gasperini has said he believes Cristante and the 20-year-old Niccolò Pisilli do their best work when allowed to play closer to goal. They cannot all fit at No 10.Still, these are easier problems to contemplate after a derby win and with nine points from four games. Gasperini’s Roma are a long way off the rampaging brilliance of his best Atalanta sides, but they have kept three clean sheets. Ferguson and Matías Soulé – 20 and 22 respectively – are showing enough up front to believe a bright future may not be far off.The question of whether their former captain will have a part in it remains open. At full-time on Sunday, Pellegrini went under the Curva Sud to celebrate with Roma’s fans. Nobody could tell him to take off the armband any more.PosTeamPGDPts1Juventus44102Napoli3593AC Milan4594Roma4295Atalanta4686Cremonese4287Cagliari4278Como4279Udinese4-1710Inter Milan44611Bologna40612Torino4-7413Lazio40314Sassuolo4-3315Verona4-4316Genoa4-2217Fiorentina4-3218Parma4-4219Pisa3-2120Lecce4-61Explore more on these topicsSerie ASportblogEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the inclusion of anchoring, which would cap that spending at about five times the bottom side’s income from the league, is thought to be in the balance. Last season, income for the bottom club, Southampton, was £109.2m. The league gives each club an equal share of broadcast and central commercial revenue and further payments according to finishing position and how often a team are televised live in the UK.Manchester United hit £666.5m record revenue but lose £33m amid turmoilRead moreVotes on both proposals are expected at the next club meeting in November with a view to replace the profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) next season.Sixteen clubs voted in favour of anchoring last year, with Manchester United, Manchester City and Aston Villa voting against and Chelsea abstaining, but several clubs who backed the proposal now have doubts.The biggest issue is understood to be concerns that if the principle is established, the EFL could follow, with significant implications for relegated clubs in receipt of parachute payments. The Premier League pays between £20m and £49m a year to former members for up to three years, but if Championship spending were tied to the income of the 24th team in the division, relegated clubs would have their spending on players restricted.The Premier League and EFL have harmonised many of their financial regulations in recent years, with further alignment regarded as a possibility. The EFL is a strong opponent of parachute payments, claiming they distort the competitive balance of its competitions, and could introduce anchoring as a means of reducing their effect.Manchester United and City have led the way in opposing anchoring and are understood to have received support from smaller clubs more recently owing to concerns about the parachute payment issue.The Professional Footballers’ Association has written to the Premier League threatening legal action in relation to anchoring proposals and has engaged Nick De Marco KC, who successfully challenged theEFL’s attempts to introduce salary capsin League One and League Two four years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sotogrande.’ From that to sitting at a Ryder Cup dinner, 19 years later is pretty cool.” Next stop, Bethpage.Lowry has told his close friend that he envies him, in the nicest possible sense. The 38-year-old looked on with smiles, but green eyes, asMcIlroy won the Masters– completing a career grand slam – and produced heroicsto win a second Irish Openthis month. “I said to him the other day, I am starting to get really jealous,” Lowry says. “I also said to him that I hope Irish people realise how lucky they are to have Rory at that level, coming back to play the Irish Open every year.‘My time in the sun’: Rory McIlroy on Ryder Cup hopes and Masters gloryRead more“He says: ‘Yeah, but how lucky are we to have that support?’ I was very jealous of the Masters, I was very jealous that Irish Open Sunday. I am happy for him, of course I am, but I want to achieve stuff myself.“I want it so badly. I want everything, I want to achieve it all. If I was to pack it all in now, would I be happy with what I have? I have had a pretty good career. But do I want more? Absolutely. That is the reason to get up in the morning.” McIlroy thinks Lowry can be overly hard on himself.Lowry laughs when contemplating any interviews where McIlroy is not a key topic for discussion. He jabbed back on the Saturday evening at Augusta, when his pal’s Green Jacket quest was a mistimed line of questioning. “I get it, I totally get it,” Lowry says. “But I have just come off the course. The last thing I want to do is talk about another player doing what I am trying to do the next day.” Which is fair enough.By 2007, Lowry and McIlroy were part of the Ireland side that triumphed in the European Amateur Team Championship at Western Gailes. Lowry, who beat Victor Dubuisson in the final, can reel off the others in that team without effort. Lowry and Ireland defended successfully in 2008.“All these guys were great players,” Lowry says. “I never thought I was better than any of them. Amateur golf in Ireland was really popular because of Rory. I learned a lot from that, even playing in front of decent crowds.“I had always looked at others as being better than me. That helped me. I wouldn’t say I played with a chip on my shoulder, but I played with that fear of not being good enough.”That sense still lingers despite Lowry sitting at the top of the game. “All the time,” he says. “You play with a fear of failure. The reason I get up and work every day is because I am afraid to fail. A fear of not being good enough. I don’t go to practise because I think I am good enough. I never play with loads of confidence.View image in fullscreenThe careers of Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry (right) have been linked closely and they enjoyed success for Europe in the 2023 Ryder Cup.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA“In that 2007 team, I was number four, five or six. I wasn’t even close to the top, I wasn’t part of any Walker Cup conversation. I took a lot of confidence from Western Gailes, went home and won the Irish Close Championship and started doing well abroad.“I don’t think I ever realised how good I was and I was still so young. Enter tournament, play, if I didn’t win I just moved on to the next week. Then I get an invite to Baltray in 2009 and bang, there you go.” Lowry won that Irish Open when still an amateur.McIlroy is the golden boy of European, never mind Irish, golf but glances through time link him intrinsically with Lowry. The pair diverged in 2007, when McIlroy made his Open debut and turned professional, but they return to the Ryder Cup arena this week as hugely influential members of Team Europe. They possibly have a point to prove together; at Whistling Straits in 2021,a comprehensive Friday defeatby Tony Finau and Harris English was a miserable experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You want to go and win. It’s the same as qualifying for the Masters; there’s no point doing that then missing the cut.”That lastRyder Cupon US territory wounded all in European colours. Lowry watched his compatriot and close friend Pádraig Harrington criticised heavily for his approach to captaincy. “Brutal,” is his assessment of what Harrington endured. “He has had such an amazing career, is such an amazing man, that it was harsh enough on him.”Ryder Cup home crowd could turn on USA team at Bethpage, claims Luke DonaldRead moreThe 38-year-old dismisses any notion of a Covid-affected away game hampering Europe in Wisconsin. “You don’t make excuses. If you are standing there making excuses you are in the wrong game. It drove me on. Since then, my golf has been very consistent. I wanted to right that wrong and even more so this time, going away again even though we are now a totally different team.”Lowry was married in New York. Any sense the Bethpage experience has him quaking in his shoes would be completely wrong. “We go there a couple of times a year. I am completely in love with New York, nothing but good experiences.“This is an opportunity. A lot of people dwell on negatives; how tough it will be, how bad the crowd might be. How amazing an opportunity do we have here? We could write ourselves in history. I havewon an Open, a Ryder Cup, my national open.

The poll of more than 3,700 adults also showed that lack of trust was the biggest barrier to adoption.Labour cosies up to US tech firms with little thought of downsides | Heather StewartRead moreJakob Mökander, the director of science and technology policy at TBI, said the UK’s main hope of becoming an AI superpower was through establishing itself as a world-leading adopter of the technology. The poll findings endanger that goal, he said.“You can be an AI superpower in two ways – either leading in AI development or adoption,” Mökander said. “The UK will not lead in development, that will be the US and China, but it can lead in adoption. But the UK will not become an AI superpower in those terms unless the government manages to build broad public trust in the technology.”The UK government has made AI a cornerstone of its economic growth strategy, with Starmer saying this year: “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers.”Among voters, however, there are concerns over AI’s impact on the economy and jobs in particular. Organisations including TBI, theInternational Monetary Fundand theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmenthave forecast that AI, the term for computer systems that can perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, will have a significant impact on the labour market. TBI has forecast that it could displace between 1m and 3m private sector jobs in the UK, adding that the ultimate number of losses will be lower as the technology creates new roles.However, sections of the job market that are expected to feel the impact of AI, such as graduate recruitment, have yet to show a serious impact from AI,according to recruitment agents.TBI’s poll findings also show a divergence between those who have used AI and those who have not, with more than half of people who have not engaged with the technology seeing it as a risk. Among regular AI users, however, only a quarter of that cohort see it as a threat.Mökander said work needed to be done on making AI trustworthy via regulation and then illustrating its potential benefits, such as reducing NHS wait times or giving working people more time at home with their families, because it makes their jobs more efficient and means fewer hours in the office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then the government needs to shape healthy public attitudes by educating people and having positive campaigns.”TBI, which receives significant funding from the tech tycoon Larry Ellison, issued the poll findings in a report published on Monday, in which it made five recommendations to build public trust in the technology: increasing public use of AI; highlighting helpful uses of AI; measuring AI’s beneficial impact in relatable ways; responsible regulation; and launching programmes to build AI skills.A UK government spokesperson said public trust was a critical factor in using AI, adding that initiatives had been launched to build AI skills and increase adoption.“About 10 million workers are expected to use AI in their day-to-day roles by 2035, so it is vital our workforce has the skills and confidence to use it,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectorThinktanksTony BlairEconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)Keir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Now, a cache of emails, training documents and reports sheds light on how Palantir helps Ice with investigations and on-the-ground enforcementJohana BhuiyanMon 22 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 09.01 EDTShareView image in fullscreenComposite: Rita Liu/The Guardian/Getty Images/Just Futures LawOver the past decade, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) has amassed millions of data points that it uses to identify and track its targets – from social media posts to location history and, most recently, tax information.And there’s been one, multibillion-dollar tech company particularly instrumental in enabling Ice to put all that data to work:Palantir, the data analytics firm co-founded byPeter Thiel, the rightwing mega-donor and tech investor.For years, little was known about how Ice uses Palantir’s technology. The companyhas consistently described itselfas a “data processor” and says it does not play an active role in any of its customers’ data collection efforts or what clients do with that information.Now, a cache of internal Ice documents – including hundreds of pages of emails between Ice andPalantir, as well as training manuals, and reports on the use of Palantir products – offer some of the first real-world examples of how Ice has used Palantir in its investigations and during on-the-ground enforcement operations.The documents, which were obtained by immigrant legal rights group Just Futures Law through a Freedom of Information Act request and reviewed by the Guardian, largely cover Palantir’s contract with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the investigative arm of Ice that is responsible for stopping the “illegal movement of people, goods, money, contraband, weapons and sensitive technology”.The documents span the period of 2014 to 2022, illustrating Palantir’s work with both Democratic and Republican administrations. But experts say the insights are especially alarming in light of the second Trump administration’sunprecedented investmentin Ice. As the agency chases aggressive deportation quotas, Ice is set to gain even more personal data fromfederal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, as well as from new tools such asfacial-recognition software made by Clearview AI.Palantir recentlywon a $30m contractto build the government a new platform called ImmigrationOS that will service Ice branches beyond HSI, and aims to “streamline” the identification and deportation of immigrants. While the documents are largely limited to HSI’s operations, it’s easy to see how the tools could be of use to other branches of Ice.“We’ve always known what the tools Palantir built are capable of. We now have the receipts for that,” said Jacinta González, one of the original organizers behind the No Tech for Ice campaign and the head of programs at digital rights non-profit MediaJustice.The documents reveal how deeply embedded Palantir’s tools were in HSI’s day-to-day operations,helping its agents to investigate and arrest people using a searchable super-network of government and private databases.They show the HSI team used Palantir platforms and apps to track air travel, analyze information like driver’s license scans and track people’s locations using cell phone records.In an example that highlights the vastness of the data Ice has access to: one March 2020 training document detailed how Palantir software allowed Ice agents to search across data from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (Sevis), which at the time contained 4.9 million records “of non-immigrant students, exchange visitors and their dependents” dating back to 2016. Another told Ice agents they could enhance their investigations by using phone numbers or names extracted from phones the agents unlocked using technology from Cellebrite, an Israeli forensic software companythat has had a contract with Ice since 2019.“Palantir is the corporate backbone of Ice that the agency is relying on for surveillance and deportations,” said Hannah Lucal, a data and tech fellow at Just Futures Law. “Palantir has been used in Ice’s day-to-day operations for data surveillance around deportations and that’s been true for over a decade.”Palantir spokesperson Lisa Gordon said the company has been working with the Department of Homeland Security since 2012 and the company “focuses on supporting the agency’s investigations and operations – including but not limited to everything from stopping drug trafficking cartels to disrupting human trafficking networks”.Ice did not respond to a request for comment.A custom-built app for field operationsOne of the most revealing elements of the documents relates to Falcon, a desktop and mobile app Palantir custom-built for Ice.Palantir won the contract to build Falcon in 2014, and designed it to help agents at HSI better communicate with their teammates and analyze data they collect. Ice stopped using Falcon in 2022 infavor of an HSI-built tool called Raven.The documents show Ice agents used Falcon to help run on-the-ground operations and report back. The app allowed agents to track their own teammates’ and subjects’ locations, and record and share real-time information from in-person encounters such as field interviews or scans of people’s licenses.View image in fullscreenA Palantir training document shows how its app Falcon could be used to track someone’s GPS location.Photograph: Courtesy of Just Futures LawOne document showed that agents could use Falcon to search for people’s names, known locations, vehicles or passport information against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other federal databases like the Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) – a vast database that holds biometric and personal information on anyone who has been encountered or arrested, detained or deported by any DHS agency – on the go.For example, in January 2019, Ice’s investigative unit was preparing for an anti-human-trafficking operation at the53rd Super Bowl in Atlanta, which DHS haddesignated a high-level security eventthat could require “extensive federal interagency support”. HSI was expected to deploy “dozens of agents” for enforcement operations throughout the weekend in teams that would rely heavily on Falcon, emails between Ice agents show. The agents’ tasks included “performing field interviews, analysis, blueforce tracking, command center functions”, one HSI special agent wrote.In addition to collecting and analyzing field interviews, the agents used Falcon for “blueforce tracking”, a military term for tracking someone’s GPS location. Training documents show Ice agents could also use Falcon to track a person’s location, including their “route and movement”, hour by hour using cell phone tower records.In advance of the Super Bowl operations, Ice officials dispatched a Palantir employee to Atlanta to refresh local agents on how to take advantage of Falcon’s capabilities while in the field. When reporting back from the training, the Palantir representative wrote in an email that “agents seemed pretty excited about the ease and power of Falcon Mobile to support the operation” and particularly the “ease of the driver’s license scanning”.View image in fullscreenOfficers from the Metropolitan police department, FBI and Homeland Security Investigations monitor a high school football game in Washington DC on 12 September.Photograph: Pablo Martínez Monsiváis/APIn another case, Ice touted the use of Falcon to find a target’s location in a February 2018 gang “takedown” operation in New York. Falcon was used to plan several aspects of the operation, including mapping out the gang’s organizational structure. When one of the targets was not at the initial location, Ice agents used Falcon “to develop information for another address in Manhattan based on a tip the target was with family members”, the document reads.Embedding with Ice agents and helping them find new ways to use Palantir products was a big part of certain employees’ jobs, according to Olive Ratliff, a former Palantir employee who worked at the company from 2021 to 2022. Palantir engineers acted as consultants, helping customers figure out how to use apps like Falcon, and were incentivized to find new use cases “that the client hasn’t thought of yet” that would make Palantir products more integral to the client’s work. “Palantir’s whole business model is about upselling. That’s the only way that they grow,” Ratliff said.A vast and powerful datasetThe documents also reveal the breadth of information that Palantir enabled Ice to access, allowing them to track people across multiple databases, at times at the request of other government agencies.Both the Falcon app and another Palantir-built platform, Investigative Case Management (ICM), enabled Ice to access a network of federally and privately owned databases of people’s information. Ice agents were encouraged to upload as much data as possible from field operations into Falcon and to share it with other Ice officials. “Importing data from sources not ingested into Falcon is a great way to add data that bolsters your investigation,” a Palantir training guide reads.View image in fullscreenFalcon was used to plan several aspects of a 2018 gang ‘takedown’ operation, including mapping out the gang’s organizational structure.’Photograph: Courtesy of Just Futures LawOne guide detailed how to import digital files from phones that agents had confiscated at US borders, or obtained in the course of arrests and had unlocked using Cellebrite technology. The guide indicated agents could search for phone numbers and names extracted from those phones to see whether they came up in databases already accessible via Palantir platforms. If an Ice agent confiscated someone’s phone, saw messages between that person and another number, and wanted to check whether the recipient’s name or number came up in other databases, they could search Sevis, for instance, which at the time included nearly 5 million records on student visa holders and their dependents.“With more than 7,000 agencies worldwide conducting 1.5 million legally authorized investigations annually, we provide targeted evidence extraction and digital investigation capabilities under strict legal oversight,” said Cellebrite spokesperson Victor Cooper.Emails also show Ice used Palantir products to track individuals across various databases at the behest of other agencies. In emails from June 2020, an agent in an HSI office in Arkansas asked for technical support tracking whether someone being investigated by another government agency had boarded a flight. The emails show the agents expected to be able to search for this individual across two DHS databases: the Advance Passenger Information System (Apis), which includes “pre-arrival and departure manifest data on all passengers and crew members”, and a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) border crossing database that tracks people, cargo and vehicles crossing through US ports of entry and exit.“We received a request to locate a person from a partner agency who has had extensive international travel,” the email read.Ice agents were also encouraged to import information from databases not connected to the Palantir tools, including subscription-based services like the investigative platform Thomson Reuters Clear, which collects information from data brokers like Equifax; news articles and social media posts; CBP border crossing data; and local, state, national and international law enforcement offices including the FBI’s National Crime Information Center.Data collected in the ICM platform was, in some cases, made accessible to agents in other parts of Ice, including units within CBP, the Transportation Security Administration and the US Coast Guard, emails from July 2019 show. A unit of immigration officers charged with arrests and removals, known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO, was also in some cases given access to Palantir platforms. ERO officers who were on HSI taskforces were required to “document all investigative activity” related to the taskforce in Palantir’s ICM platform, a policy memo published in 2016 shows.Experts fear that the Trump administration will start to use the vast database network powered by Palantir to supercharge its deportation machine – which has already removed more than 216,000 people in the first nine months. While Palantir did not contract with ERO before, the company will now be working with this unit under the $30m contract.“We actually get to see Palantir providing these directions for very intense data surveillance,” Lucal of Just Futures Law said. “As the administration is doing this work to consolidate systems of state surveillance even more than it already is, Palantir stands to profit from that.”Experts warn that, in light of the Trump administration’s threats to crack downon “far-left” groups, the scope of application for Palantir’s tools could only grow. Already, a new report from theIntercept revealed HSI subpoenaed and received informationfrom Google about international students who were being investigated over their pro-Palestinian activism.“Now [with access to more federal databases] Ice can use this type of surveillance apparatus on anyone – not only anyone who is undocumented but anyone who this administration wants to criminalize and anyone who the administration wants to put under surveillance,” said González of MediaJustice.“Time and time again, you’re seeing Ice act in ways that are incredibly violent and aggressive. It does have a chilling effect. When you know they have a technology that can track relationships, your conversations, and your organizing activity, that can be a silencing force.”"

Should we believe them?David ShariatmadariMon 22 Sep 2025 02.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 16.51 EDTShareWhat if I told you I could stop you worrying about climate change, and all you had to do was read one book? Great, you’d say, until I mentioned that the reason you’d stop worrying was because the book says our species only has a few years before it’s wiped out by superintelligent AI anyway.We don’t know what form this extinction will take exactly – perhaps an energy-hungry AI will let the millions of fusion power stations it has built run hot, boiling the oceans. Maybe it will want to reconfigure the atoms in our bodies into something more useful. There are many possibilities, almost all of them bad, say Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares in If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, and who knows which will come true. But just as you can predict that an ice cube dropped into hot water will melt without knowing where any of its individual molecules will end up, you can be sure an AI that’s smarter than a human being will kill us all, somehow.This level of confidence is typical of Yudkowsky, in particular. He has been warning about the existential risks posed by technology for years on the website he helped to create,LessWrong.com, and via the Machine Intelligence Research Institute he founded (Soares is the current president). Despite not graduating high school or university, Yudkowsky is highly influential in the field, and a celebrity in the world of very bright young men arguing with each other online (as well as the author of a 600,000-wordwork of fanficcalled Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). Colourful, annoying, polarising. “People become clinically depressed reading your crap,” lamented leading researcher Yann LeCun during oneonline spat. But, as chief scientist at Meta, who is he to talk?And while Yudkowsky and Soares may be unconventional, their warnings are similar to those of Geoffrey Hinton, the Nobel-winning “godfather of AI”, and Yoshua Bengio, theworld’s most-cited computer scientist, both of whomsigned up to the statementthat “mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war”.As a clarion call, If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies is well timed. Superintelligent AI doesn’t exist yet, but in the wake of the ChatGPT revolution, investment in the datacentres that would power it is now counted in the hundreds of billions. This amounts to “the biggest and fastest rollout of a general purpose technology in history,”according to the FT’s John Thornhill. Meta alone will spend as much as $72bn (£54bn) on AI infrastructure this year, and the achievement of superintelligence is now Mark Zuckerberg’s explicit goal.Not great news, if you believe Yudkowsky and Soares. But why should we? Despite the complexity of its subject, If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies is as clear as its conclusions are hard to swallow. Where the discussions become more technical, mainly in passages dealing with AI model training and architecture, it’s still straightforward enough for readers to grasp the basic facts.Among these is that we don’t really understand how generative AI works. In the past, computer programs were hand coded – every aspect of them was designed by a human. In contrast, the latest models aren’t “crafted”, they’re “grown”. We don’t understand, for example, how ChatGPT’s ability to reason emerged from it being shown vast amounts of human-generated text. Something fundamentally mysterious happened during its incubation. This places a vital part of AI’s functioning beyond our control and means that, even if we can nudge it towards certain goals such as “be nice to people”, we can’t determine how it will get there.That’s a problem, because it means that AI will inevitably generate its own quirky preferences and ways of doing things, and these alien predilections are unlikely to be aligned with ours. (This is, it’s worth noting, entirely separate from the question of whether AIs might be “sentient” or “conscious”. Being set goals, and taking actions in the service of them, is enough to bring about potentially dangerous behaviour.) In any case, Yudkowsky and Soares point out that tech companies are already trying hard to build AIs that do things on their own initiative, because businesses will pay more for tools that they don’t have to supervise. If an “agentic” AI like this were to gain the ability to improve itself, it would rapidly surpass human capabilities in practically every area. Assuming that such a superintelligent AI valued its own survival – why shouldn’t it? – it would inevitably try to prevent humans from developing rival AIs or shutting it down. The only sure-fire way of doing that is shuttingusdown.What methods would it use? Yudkowsky and Soares argue that these could involve technology we can’t yet imagine, and which may strike us as very peculiar. They liken us to Aztecs sighting Spanish ships off the coast of Mexico, for whom the idea of “sticks they can point at you to make you die” – AKA guns – would have been hard to conceive of.Yudkowsky and Soares present their case with such conviction that it’s easy to emerge from this book ready to cancel your pension contributionsNevertheless, in order to make things more convincing, they have a go. In the part of the book that most resembles sci-fi, they set out an illustrative scenario involving a superintelligent AI called Sable. Developed by a major tech company, Sable spreads through the internet to every corner of civilisation, recruiting human stooges through the most persuasive version of ChatGPT imaginable, before destroying us with synthetic viruses and molecular machines. It’s outlandish, of course – but the Aztecs would’ve said the same about muskets and Catholicism.Yudkowsky and Soares present their case with such conviction that it’s easy to emerge from this book ready to cancel your pension contributions. The glimmer of hope they offer – and it’s low wattage – is that doom can be averted if the entire world agrees to shut down advanced AI development as soon as possible. Given the commercial and strategic incentives, and the current state of political leadership, this seems a little unlikely.The crumbs of hope we are left to scrabble for, then, are indications that they may not be right, either about the fact that superintelligence is on its way, or that its creation equals our annihilation.There are certainly moments in the book when the confidence with which an argument is presented outstrips its strength. A small example: as an illustration of how AI can develop strange, alien preferences, the authors offer up the fact that some large language models find it hard to interpret sentences without full stops. “Human thoughts don’t work like that,” they write. “We wouldn’t struggle to comprehend a sentence that ended without period.” But that’s not really true; humans often rely on markers at the end of a sentences in order to interpret them correctly. We learn language via speech, so they’re not dots on the page but “prosodic” features like intonation: think of the difference between a rising and falling tone at the end of a phrase such as “he said he was coming”. If text-trained AI leans heavily on punctuation to figure out what’s going on, that shows its thought processes are analogous, not alien, to human ones.And for writers steeped in the hyper-rational culture of LessWrong, Yudkowsky and Soares exhibit more than a touch of confirmation bias. “History,” they write, “is full of … examples of catastrophic risk being minimised and ignored,” from leaded petrol to Chornobyl. But what about predictions of catastrophic risk being proved wrong? History is full of those, too, from Malthus’s population apocalypse to Y2K. Yudkowsky himself once claimed thatnanotechnology would destroy humanity“no later than 2010”.The problem is that you can be overconfident, inconsistent, a serial doom-monger, and still be right. It’s important to be aware of our own motivated reasoning when considering the arguments presented here; we have every incentive to disbelieve them.And while it’s true that they don’t represent the scientific consensus, this is a rapidly changing, poorly understood field. What constitutes intelligence, what constitutes “super”, whether intelligence alone is enough to ensure world domination – all of this is furiously debated.At the same time, the consensus that does exist is not particularly reassuring. In a 2024 survey of 2,778 AI researchers, themedian probability placedon “extremely bad outcomes, such as human extinction” was 5%. Worryingly, “having thought more (either ‘a lot’ or ‘a great deal’) about the question was associated with a median of 9%, while having thought ‘little’ or ‘very little’ was associated with a median of 5%”.Yudkowsky has been thinking about the problem for most of his adult life. The fact that his prediction sits north of 99% might reflect a kind of hysterical monomania, or an especially thorough engagement with the problem. Whatever the case, it feels like everyone with an interest in the future has a duty to read what he and Soares have to say.If Anyone Builds it, Everyone Dies by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares is published by Bodley Head (£22).To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

By blurring truth and criminalising dissent, he is dismantling the US’s free-speech order from withinMon 22 Sep 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 19.26 EDTShareAt Sunday’s memorial for the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump paid a peculiar tribute. Having quoted Mr Kirk’s words of forgiveness, he put aside the script. “That’s where I disagreed with Charlie,” hesaid. “I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them.” It was a stark and clarifying admission. Mr Trump does not seek to criminalise hate speech so much as to criminalisespeech he hates.The US is beingdraggedinto a state of emergency. Speech is framed asterrorism. Satire is rebranded asenemy propaganda. Employerspunishworkers for personal posts. The predictable result is a chilling climate of surveillance and reprisal, in which citizens learn to keep quiet. The assassination is not just being used to police manners; it is being used to reconstruct the public square so that dissent equalsdisloyalty, and disloyalty is treated as a security threat.Hannah Arendtwarned of the existential peril in blurring the line between truth and lies: then truth doesn’t stand; it becomes optional. Mr Trump’s reportedfalsehoodsabout paracetamol and autism will harm mothers, stigmatise families and erode trust in medicine. But in Trumpland such costs are outweighed by the political payoff of pitting supporters against thescientific“establishment”.His assault is twofold. First, speech is being weaponised through partisan media, online influencers and harassment networks that seek to capture attention while corroding the conditions for open dialogue. Second, state power is weaponised by cowingsocial mediaplatforms, threatening networklicencesand politicising information. Handing TikTok to rightwingbillionairesis a morbid symptom of democratic decline.“Authority is to be controlled by public opinion, not public opinion by authority,”saidthe US supreme court. That defines the first amendment: citizens, not the state, decide which ideas survive, with narrow limits likefraudordefamation. By presuming to define “truth”, Mr Trump subverts self-government. Hate rallies thrive in Trump’s America because,since 1969, speech is unprotected only if intended and likely to incite “imminent lawless action”.The US is a free-speech outlier. Other democracies accept broader, more collective trade‑offs to protect vulnerable groups, maintain public order and prevent incitement andharassment. Eachcountryis different but the bargain is similar. Speech is presumptively free, yet words are considered acts with foreseeable harms. Words can mobilise mobs, direct harassment and orchestrate violence. The point isn’t to shield anyone’s feelings, it’s to make coexistence possible.Mr Trump has inverted the American model. Rather than robust exchanges under neutral rules, he selectively rewards allies whiledegradingthe conditions of honest debate. All this while the infosphere is saturated with viral lies, making it easier to justifypunitive state action“to keep order”. That is how an emergency becomes a system.The answer is not the censor’s pen nor a free-for-all. It requiresresilientdemocratic plumbing; social mediaplatformsmade accountable for publishing harms; and properly defining dangerous conduct. The aim – particularly in the US – must be to preserve free expression as the bedrock of self-government while dismantling the machinery that warps attention toward outrage and partisan mobilisation. Mr Trump’s speech was disgraceful. When power learns to hate its opponents, democracy will fail.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We must stand upJoel SwansonWhat is happening to Judith Butler – a Jewish intellectual – in the name of fighting ‘antisemitism’ is outrageousMon 22 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTShareAmid all the other breaking news consuming the United States this month, the University of California, Berkeley, arguably the nation’s most elite public university,gave the Trump administrationa list of 160 names of faculty, staff and students, as part of an investigation into “alleged antisemitic incidents”.While all the names on this list are significant, one name in particular that UC Berkeley handed over to the Trump administration stands out: Judith Butler, the eminent queer theorist, literary theorist and philosopher, and one of the most famous public intellectuals in the United States today.In addition to Butler’s name representing one of the most high-profile academic scalps demanded by the Trump administration in its campaign against higher education so far, Butler’s name is also notable for another reason: Butler is proudly and publicly Jewish,and has written extensivelyabouttheir Jewish identityandhow it informs their politics. In the name of “fighting antisemitism”, the Trump administration is publicly making an example out of arguably the most famous Jewish public intellectual in the country today.As a professor of Jewish studies, whose work intersects with gender and queer theory in substantial ways, I teach Butler regularly in my classes, both their writings on gender performativity and on Jewish politics. I never endorse Butler’s perspectives on Jewish politics, and when I teach their writings against Zionism, I am always careful to present them to my students alongside opposing perspectives. In truth, while I find their writings on gender highly valuable for my work, I have considerable differences with them on issues of Zionism and Middle East politics.None of that matters right now. If we are going to defend the Jewish community in the United States, we have to stand up for Professor Butler.Butler, whocompared the legal allegationsagainst them to Kafka’s famous novel The Trial, likened the public targeting to the McCarthy era, writing that the practice of universities forwarding names to the federal government was a “well-known practice from the McCarthy Era … We should not be naive. Will those of us named now be branded on a government list? Will our travel be restricted? Will our email communications be surveilled?”Butler is right to compare the current climate of higher education to the McCarthy era, but this comparison works for more reasons than the obvious ones. Like the current campaign against “campus antisemitism”, McCarthyism was also an antisemitic campaign against Jews who did not fit into the prevailing politics of the day.During the McCarthy era around the 1950s,a survey conducted by the American Jewish Committee found that more than half of all Americansassociated Jews with the act of spying on behalf of the Soviet Union. Indeed, out of 124 people interrogated for perceived links to communism by the senator Joseph McCarthy’s notorious Senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs in 1952, an overwhelming79 of them, two-thirds, were Jewish.The antisemitic campaign did not end there. The representative John Rankin, a stalwart supporter of the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee (Huac) and McCarthyism,delivered a speech on the floor of the House of Representativesin which he openly listed the names of Jews whom he suspected of being communists. Rankin went so far as to accuse these Jews of changing their names to hide their Jewish identities.As he said: “One is Danny Kaye. We found his real name was David Daniel Kaminsky. Then there was Eddie Cantor. His real name was Edward Itzkowitz. Edward G Robinson, his name is Emanuel Goldenberg … There’s another one here who calls himself Melvyn Douglas, whose real name is Melvyn Hesselberg.” Not terribly subtle.The Jewish musician Larry Adler, blacklisted from Hollywood as a result of suspected communist ties,reported receiving a letter from Huacbeginning with: “Dear Kike.” And those US senators most vocally opposed to McCarthyismreceived antisemitic hate mail from angry constituents, one labeling a lawmaker a “henchman of the Jew Deal … some crackpot fronting for the Jews”.The law the Trump administration is using to deport foreign students for suspected antisemitism, theMcCarran-Walter Act, even has its roots in McCarthy-era antisemitism. It was initially used to block eastern European Jewish immigrants from the US, including Holocaust survivors, because of suspected links to communism.According to the professor Michael Kagan of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, the Pennsylvania representative Francis Walter, champion of the law, “was a virulent antisemite. He just sort of thought Jews and Communists were overlapping groups.”The parallels between the antisemitism of the McCarthy era and the current day do not end there. Then, as now, too many American Jewish organizations decided that the way forward was not to fight for the rights of all Jews, but to throw leftist Jews under the bus in the name of respectability politics.As historianAviva Weingartenhas demonstrated, during the McCarthy period, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) “endeavoured to banish communists from the ranks of the Jewish community and its offices” so as to combat any public link between Jewishness and leftism in the minds of the American public. The AJC evenfinanced and promotedthe spread of anti-communist literature to prove their patriotic American bona fides. Likewise, the AJCexpelledthe leftist Jewish People’s Fraternal Order in 1949, ultimately leading to the latter organization having toshut down. And in the early 1950s, organizations including the ADL and the AJCinvestedin a large publicity campaign designed to promote the image of the American Jew as a loyal, patriotic American citizen and capitalist; the groups evendiscussed approachingParamount Pictures to produce a movie in which a Jewish American secret agent fights international communism.The McCarthy era was a time of great antisemitism in US history. But instead of standing together as a Jewish community under threat, too much of the organized Jewish community decided that it was better to rid themselves of meddlesome leftwing Jews to win entrance into mainstream American culture for themselves.Today, they are on the verge of making the same mistake. Too many American Jewish organizations likethe AJCandthe ADLhave cheered the Trump administration’s crackdown on higher education in the name of “fighting antisemitism”, ignoring the way in which this crackdown isfalling heavily on Jews deemed to have the wrong politics.Judith Butler’s politics on Israel-Palestine are controversial, and I may not always agree with them. But they are part of a rich tradition of Jewish dissent, going back to Baruch Spinoza and running through such Jewish luminaries as Kafka, Freud, Rosa Luxemburg and the “non-Jewish Jew” Isaac Deutscher. We may not always agree with all of these thinkers, but part of having a rich Jewish intellectual community means making space for them. We are all worse off when we cast out the dissenters.Butler rightlycompared their treatment by the Trump administration to the McCarthy era. Just as back then, the government wants to claim the scalp of a high-profile dissenting Jew, in the name of enforcing a conformity of acceptable Jewish politics. But the American Jewish community made the mistake back then of casting out dissenters for the sake of respectability, rather than standing up and declaring that Jewish socialists are also a rich part of the Jewish communal tapestry. Let’s not make the same mistake again. Standing up for Jews on campus means standing up for the rights ofallJews.Joel Swanson is professor of Jewish studies at Sarah Lawrence CollegeExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS universitiesFreedom of speechcommentShareReuse this content"

I recently talked to one young female college president who told me, point blank, that “university presidents have no business speaking out on public issues”.The chancellor of my own university, the University of California at Berkeley – the very place where the “free speech movement” began in 1965 – still hasn’t explained why Berkeley last week handed over to the regime the names of 160 students, lecturers, and faculty members who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Some are here on visas and terribly vulnerable. Others lack tenure and are vulnerable in different ways.It’s not just university presidents. Whatever happened to America’s religious leaders?During prior crises of conscience, such as the struggle for civil rights, the voices of the nation’s religious leaders were loud and confident. They brimmed with moral power. Today, we hear only the strident voices of the religious right.What happened to America’s business leaders? They’ve never been especially reluctant to speak out on public issues.For years Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, has acted as a self-appointed spokesperson for American business, sometimes reminding CEOs of their social responsibilities. This time? Utter silence.Other CEOs have gone over to the dark side, competing to suck up to the tyrant-in-chief, eager to lavish him with praise, gush over his accomplishments, even hand him gifts of solid gold bullion.The leaders of America’s legal community? “I want to keep my head down,” the senior partner of a large firm told me. “We have too much to lose.”The leaders of the media? They’re busy consolidating their ownership over ever more of the nation’s media and dare not upset Trump’s FCC and its Trump toady Brendan Carr.What of their responsibility to protect free speech? They’re far more interested in maximizing the value of their shares of stock.And whatever happened to the nation’s political leaders? Where are their voices in this time of democratic crisis?Most Republicans are zombies and most Democrats wimps.Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, won’t even endorse Zohran Mamdani for New York mayor – even though Mamdani is among the most popular young politicians with young voters.We have to wait for Ted Cruz – Ted Cruz! – to sound the alarm about the FCC’s attack on freedom of speech?The sad fact is that, like so much else Trump’s reign of terror has revealed, it is showing us a reality we should have known years ago but many of us didn’t want to see: America’s leadership class no longer leads. It hides.Its obligations to the common good – to the freedom of speech, freedom to assemble, freedom from government arrest and imprisonment without due process, freedom to vote and participate in our democracy, freedom from arbitrary and capricious government decisions – have disappeared.Instead, people in positions of significant responsibility have succumbed to greed, small-mindedness, insularity, and cowardice.During a crisis like the one we’re now in, these so-called leaders have abdicated their moral responsibility.It’s not all bad that America no longer has a leadership class.True leadership doesn’t necessarily require high office. It doesn’t require a fancy title. Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela, and countless others who have moved the world held no formal positions of power. Their power came from their moral authority to tell the truth and mobilize others.The disappearance of America’s leadership class at a time like this means that therest of ushave to be leaders.Youmust be a leader.We are the leaders we’ve been waiting for.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Instead, I’m facing Trump’s new sanctionsJoshua SchroederI appear to be the first attorney targeted in a scheme that calls on federal agencies to accuse lawyers of unethical conductMon 22 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareOn Memorial Day weekend 2025, a woman frantically called to tell me her husband was being removed to Laos late that night, with only hours of notice. Though I’m a solo practitioner with limited resources, I took the case pro bono because my values drive me to help indigent clients. I was aware of the government’s catch-me-if-you-can scheme to move detainees around without notice to escape court oversight, but I felt prepared for the challenge because I’m also an independent legal scholar who published apractice guideto help lawyers navigate habeas corpus actions for immigrant clients.Though I secured an order from the northern district of Texas explicitly preventing my client’s removal from the United States, he was nevertheless put on an international flight around 1am on Memorial Day. After a restless night making calls and sending emails, I went on a hike to refresh. My client surprised me with an exasperated call from Guam, where he had been deplaned and detained, possibly because of my actions that night. It was a small victory – he remained in a US territory. I rushed to file for a new order in the district of Guam to help ensure my client was not going to be made stateless, indefinitely imprisoned or removed in a way that defied human rights treaties.Facing the specter of conditions in El Salvador’s Cecot facility and the plight of other immigrants having been removed without notice, I had previously secured aclass actionagainst removals for my own district around Los Angeles, and I wanted to extend such protection to this client. I knew President Trump had issued aproclamationattempting to justify removals after the fact, but I used my best judgment and skills to ask the court to enforce the actual law as written. The government nevertheless proceeded to take my client out of the United States. So I was taken aback when the government asked the judge to punish me for my efforts via a motion for sanctions – which is a novel strategy by the administration to go after immigration attorneys personally by attempting to ruin their record or fine them.I was now a target.Sanctions are viewed within the profession as raising ethics concerns and questions about an attorney’s judgment; they can render you ineligible for any number of professional roles, such as professorships and judgeships.I therefore planned to contest the motion quietly and alone, thinking the law favored me. Nevertheless, I was troubled that my actions to advocate for my client could be construed as unprofessional – because my calm and focused demeanor in court is starkly in contrast with the performance put on by the Trump administration, which has bled over to the Department of Justice and bucked all tradition of an independent and dignified DoJ.Trump officials move to punish lawyer who tried to block client’s deportationRead moreShortly afterwards, a reporter informed me I appeared to bethe first attorney targetedin alarger schemein which federal agencies were instructed to formally accuse attorneys of unethical conduct to try to disable them and dissuade further litigation. The reporter intended to run an article, hoping for my input. I did not want to become a story in my client’s case, and I asked the journalist to use only my client’s initials to help protect him, as I did in court filings. But the government put his full name in their filings, apparently to punish him for attempting to assert his rights in court. Though the underlying case was dismissed, my client’s appeal remains very active and may have further motivated the government to pursue me.In the US, we believe our government is one of laws and not of men so we can be treated fairly. Due process, ie notice and an opportunity to be heard, is fundamental to our sense of fairness. We expect our day in court to explain things and to avoid errors and miscarriages of justice. Similarly, we expect to have our say in the laws that govern us.We all rely on the stability of laws and policy to live out peaceful lives in our country. US policy during the Vietnam war brought my client and his family to the US in early childhood, so he feels as betrayed as we all do by the current instability. Yet the US supreme court routinely ignores and even overturns court precedents to support Trump’s sweeping edicts through court orders with little or no reasoning, affecting all our rights without the debate or notice demanded by our normal democratic legislative and judicial processes. Lower courts and attorneys are left in a quandary as dangerous precedents are being set that are extendable to all Americans, not just immigrants.My scholarship traces the supreme court’s unceremonious erosion of individual rights, and it’s now accelerating because all rights are tied to immigrant rights. While most Americans believe racial profiling by Ice was only recently made legal, the court actually endorsed itinthe1970swith an operating zone that includes most major US cities. As the military supports Ice’s reckless and violent roundup of immigrants – sometimes including citizens – the government is foreshadowing an era of control without redress.Our founders and framers enshrined immigrant rights in our founding documents, thereby securing America’s economic vitality. Now as then, we must decide whether to stand together or fall.Joshua Schroeder is a first amendment attorneyExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionUS justice systemcommentShareReuse this content"

Well, fashion trends are a stark rejoinder to thatMon 22 Sep 2025 12.26 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 19.30 EDTShareWake up babe, a new trend just dropped.According to the websiteKnow Your Meme, it’s been five years since the “wake up babe” format – which sees the phrase pasted over an image of a man waking up his girlfriend to announce a new internet talking point – really took off. I first encountered it at the height of what might be called “core fever” in fashion. A new look seemed to be arriving on social media feeds every week, driven by gen Z’s love of blink-or-miss-it microtrends. “Wake up babe, there’s a new aesthetic,” seemed an apt and amusing way to sum up the times.The idea of “core” in fashion dates back to 2014, whentrend-forecasting agency K-Holedescribed a bland and anonymous aesthetic they saw on the streets of New York as “normcore”. Now a descriptor that is applied to everything from fromgen Z’s cult style icon Adam Sandlerto characters in video games, the suffix has since been joined by what feels like thousands of things – from “corpcore” (meaning a corporate, businesslike look) and“clowncore”, to one of my favourites, the anything-goes “weirdcore”.These microtrends aren’t just dizzying – they are part of the acceleration of fast fashion, with brands producing cheap, throwaway items to appeal to a fleeting moment. In 2025, this cycle has slowed down somewhat, but fashion hasn’t kicked the habit entirely. Just look at the recent “medievalcore”, an online aesthetic that takes its cue from an era more than 600 years before the invention of the iPhone. This is a style that focuses on long skirts, corsets and pretty chainmail headbands; it has been spotted across festivals this summer.It’s already been given the celebrity seal of approval, with the likes ofChappell RoanandMillie Bobby Brownwearing chainmail on the red carpet. Therewas even a knightat Burberry’s February show, such a novelty thatAnna Wintour had her picture takenwith it. But even if brands such as Di Petsa, Conner Ivesand Christian Diorbrought it to the catwalk, the trend has mostly spread online. More than 20,000 videos on TikTokfeature the hashtag medievalcore, 22,000 posts on Instagram, andPinterest reporteda 110% rise in searches for medievalcore at the end of 2024.View image in fullscreenThe Burberry Knight during London Fashion Week in February 2025.Photograph: Justin Ng/AlamyIt’s not the first time contemporary culture has been seduced by this period. See the 1960s, when models such as Pattie Boyd wore minidresses with trumpet sleeves, the Beatles and the Stones wore velvet tunics and Paco Rabannemade dresses from chainmail. Or think of thePre-Raphaelites – painterswho depicted 19th-century working-class young women such asJane MorrisandElizabeth Siddalas medieval ladies, as a way of exploring sensuality, sex and passion in the rigid Victorian era.As with most “cores”, it’s easy to trace a line between the trends we gravitate towards and the world we live in. There is a sense that young people raised in a digital world might want to regress to a time that feels deeply un-modern – when animals could be put on trial, and women would pluck their eyelashes to draw attention to their forehead. Or there’s an argument that medievalcore, an aesthetic in opposition to being current, is a rail against the recent“clean girl”or “that girl” looks, which emphasise a rigidly understated – and typically thin, white and blond – take on femininity.But I think that medievalcore actually says more about this moment in fashion, which is less about trends and more about escapism; dressing up as characters and entering a different world. It’s a point of view that mirrors outside interests – such as the growth of gaming culture. Gamers are used to creating outfits for avatars – perhaps this dress-up mentality is spilling over into fashion. Look at the way Halloween has become so much more of an event in the UK in recent years.View image in fullscreenChappell Roan performs onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, 11 September 2024.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty ImagesA lot has been written about the decline of subcultures and how young people no longer form these real-world communities in their day-to-day lives. But fashion trends are a stark rejoinder to that – they exist offline as much as online. Much like 30 years ago, when wearing a band T-shirt signalled to people who liked the same band, this is a signal that the other person wearing a corset is in the same online bubble as you.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Accordingto a 2023 reportby the American Library Association, 54% of gen Z and millennials had visited a library in the preceding 12 months. Orcottagecore, which sees people fetishise the countryside by wearing milkmaid dresses and posting pictures of cabins, but could also have influenced young people togo outside more. It certainly coincides with hiking and even fishing becoming more popular.Medievalcore has a chance to join this elite tier because it has history and characters around it, from Joan of Arc to Eleanor of Aquitaine and Caterina Sforza, and the fact it focuses on a time that was really, really long ago. This allows those involved to create a world around a look, one that could provide community – and certainly brings the escapism that the more lasting “cores” have. Microtrends might not be the best for the environment, or for fashion in general, but they do have value, because for the very online they can provide a place to play.Lauren Cochrane is a senior Guardian fashion writerExplore more on these topicsFashionOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

For their sake, we must hope Your Party’s hotheads give way to calm strategistsMon 22 Sep 2025 11.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 14.53 EDTShareThe left traditionally faces four formidable enemies: wealthy interests, the political elite, the mainstream media and itself. Over the past few days, the latter hasstormed back with a vengeance.When the independent MP and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the former Labour MP Zarah Sultana announced the birth of a new leftwing party, the surge of interest shocked even its founders. More than 750,000 people signed up in support of an unchristened, nonexistent party.Polling suggestednearly a third of Britons would vote for an alliance with the Greens; among under-35s, support rose to 52%. That media outlets spent more time mocking its placeholder name, Your Party, than seeking to understand this phenomenon tells its own story. In today’s Britain, “legitimate concerns” means kicking out migrants, not taxing elites to rebuild crumbling services.Alas, a deeply unattractive public row in recent days appeared to detonate the whole project. Sultana seeks the co-leadership of a new party, and her camp felt she was being frozen out by Corbyn’s advisers and the four independent MPs who won on a platform opposing Israel’s genocide and tackling economic misery at home. Corbyn’s team believe that he remains the politician most able to galvanise the grassroots. The independents feel that, having crushed the Labour machine when Keir Starmer was securing a landslide, they represent a mass base that must be respected and given a major role.Fearing being sidelined, Sultanaunilaterally launched the membership schemeunder her allies’ control. Threats of legal action on both sides followed, as well as accusations of sexism by Sultana. Social media filled with despairing posts, mostly younger voters who know where Britain is headed and thought their lifeboat had been scuppered by friendly fire.Thankfully, a miscalculated game of chicken appears to have drawn to a close, and plans to launch a new party have resumed.Sultana has halted legal actionand rightly warned that “the stakes are too high for failure to be an option”. We must hope that hotheads on all sides give way to calm strategists.A grassroots initiativeis constructively calling for a new elected committee to take over the proceedings. Given the scale of both opportunity and danger, a leftwing implosion would be tragic – and unforgivable.Conditions have never been better for a force to Labour’s left. Starmer wooed the membership to become leader of the party as a socialist, then swerved right and launched an assault on Labour’s left flank. As prime minister, Starmer has done everything his party’s right has desired: attacked social security , bashed migrants , refused to hike taxes on the rich. The result? Having ejected a despised Tory government a little more than a year ago,only 11% of voters approveof the government – 72% disapprove.Meanwhile, polling consistently shows mass support for leftwing policies such as hikingtax on the richandpublic ownership. The Greens, meanwhile, have elected theextremely impressive Zack Polanski, whose eco-socialist pitch is cutting through. An alliance between a new left party and the Greens could replace an imploding Labour.None of this erases the challenges. Any viable left coalition must recognise British Muslims as essential to its base. They have been politicised by western bloodbaths in mostly Muslim lands such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Palestine; by the hardship that disproportionately strikes their communities; and by endemic, mainstreamed Islamophobia. Strong community networks – so rare in atomised Britain – make for formidable ground campaigns.But some tensions cannot be wished away, including the tension within such a coalition between socially conservative and progressive values on issues such as trans rights. However, the two most prominent British Muslim politicians – the Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the former Scottish first minister Humza Yousaf – have been steadfast pro-LGBTQ allies, unlike most Christian Tory MPs. Muslims were voting Labour when it passed gay rights legislation. Many voters at the time – Muslim or not – didn’t support equalising the age of consent or scrapping Section 28, but decided they had other priorities. Any left alliance must fiercely confront Islamophobia, oppose the slaughter of Muslims abroad and champion the rights of all minorities. That’s not only moral; it’s strategic. Younger voters will walk away otherwise – and the electoral coalition will collapse.Failure now would be criminal self-indulgence. Economic insecurity defines millions of lives. Fascism is resurgent across the west. Authoritarianism is hardening at home: witness themass arrest of peaceful anti-genocide activistsunder Labour’s anti-terror laws. Starmer’s indulgence of anti-migrant politics – and his refusal to address the economic roots of despair – only legitimises Farageism. A united left with a compelling message would drag the political conversation away from punching down at migrants, to take on the wealthy elites actually responsible for Britain’s decline. That would force Starmer and Farage alike on the back foot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Left movements have arisen across the west in the past few years for structural reasons: an economic order that delivers falling living standards, rising insecurity and a collapsing public realm, fused with a murderous, catastrophic foreign policy. All politicians should therefore have humility. They are riding a wave, and should see themselves as custodians of a movement that lifted them up. If they end up wrecking rather than facilitating that potential, then millions desperate for radical change will not forgive them.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynOpinionZarah SultanacommentShareReuse this content"

When you have two worlds, you always have to say goodbye to oneMon 22 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 19.44 EDTShareLast school holidays, I took my daughter to Hong Kong, my birthplace and home for the first eight years of my life.I had taken her plenty of times before, but every visit had been fleeting. Accommodation is expensive, so we usually stay just enough to share a meal or two with close family.The reason for an extended stay came when my grandfather died last year. My grandmother had just lost her husband of seven decades, and as she is in her 90s herself, there couldn’t be too many years left. I felt an urge to spend as much time as I could with her and an even greater urge for my nearly seven-year-old daughter to know her.My ‘Chinglish’ has a cringe-inducing ocker accent – but I’m determined to pass it on to my child | Monica TanRead moreSo I decided to take the school holidays off work and take my daughter to stay in in the spare bedroom of my grandmother’s small apartment. While I knew two weeks wasn’t that long, it was all we had. I started to plan playdates with my cousins’ children and activities for my daughter, such as Cantonese classes.As we got closer to the trip, the excitement waned and I started to wonder if I had romanticised it. My cousins had not replied to any of my messages. There were no Cantonese programs for children her age. My daughter was disappointed there would be no hotels with small fridges, supposedly the best part of any holiday. On top of that, it was typhoon season so it would be wet, hot and humid. What would we even do for two weeks?But I need not have worried. Two weeks was just enough for us to establish a routine. We started every day with breakfast with my grandmother, then a swim in the pool downstairs. We went out for lunch and wandered the streets, buying gifts for her teacher and friends.We weren’t time-poor so we could take the scenic route including the ferry across Victoria harbour. The weather gods were kind to us – nothing we couldn’t manage with rain gear. And my cousins came good too. There were plenty of playdates for the children, all planned at the last minute, the Hong Kong way. Meeting my cousin’s children for the first time was a real highlight.My daughter made new friends easily. We met kids of similar ages at the building’s shared pool and nearby playgrounds. In particular, she bonded deeply with a little girl from the same building who went to an international school and spoke English with a transatlantic accent. They met nearly every day of our stay.Two weeks flew by.On our last night, we went out to celebrate. We explored the dark alleys and steep staircases of Sheung Wan to find a trendy gelato/cocktail bar. Over desserts and drinks, my daughter started to cry. She was missing her dad and brother as well as her friends. But she didn’t want to leave her new friend, her pet turtles (we bought them on our first night), hertai pau(great-grandmother) and our favourite sushi train restaurant (a big Japanese subculture in Hong Kong).She was torn. I recognised it immediately: the feeling of longing to be in two places at once, the heaviness of having to leave.When you have two worlds, you always have to leave one.That night, I stayed with her until she fell asleep, promising to print our photos, write letters to her friend and return again soon.The next day, as we prepared for our night flight home, we did all of our lasts (last breakfast, last play date, last sushi train lunch). She was stoic in her goodbyes – to her new Hong Kong bestie, totai pau, totai pau’s carer who looked after us too.It was me fighting back tears in the taxi to the airport. My daughter held my hand and told me not to worry, repeating my words to her the night before.It has been two months since our trip. She has given her souvenirs away as presents and spoken glowingly of Hong Kong. But the turtle updates are slowing, as are the messages from her friend. I have reverted to speaking to her only in English.But then there are moments when I catch her telling her dad a story from Hong Kong, teaching her brother the two ways to say thank you in Cantonese. I think how wonderful it is to have two worlds, and despite having to leave one (for now), we hold the experiences, memories and connections. We learn to make room for the best of both worlds.Lucille Wong is a Melbourne writerExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyHong Kong holidayscommentShareReuse this content"

Apparently, it’s inevitable the role will go to a candidate with similar claims to Rayner in terms of that much-vaunted quality, authenticity. WhetherBridget Phillipson or Lucy Powell, the next deputy leader will also be a woman from a working-class family from the north of England.In reality, each of their journeys to Westminster (via, crucially, Oxford) differ wildly from that of Rayner and, by extension, from the lives of the majority of working-class women. Those who have pursued these rare routes of social mobility are undoubtedly impressive, but they remain a small minority. I am one of these women, and I am happy to admit it.In any case, representation cannot stand in for meaningful policy change. Working-class women have rarely had it so hard. The two-child benefit cap persists in facilitating child poverty in the UK. It is working-class women whobear this burden. These same women compensate for our as yet unreformed and failing social-care system and are far more likely to fall victim toinsecure, poorly paid employment. Earlier this year, theJoseph Rowntree Foundationwarned that economic growth alone would not be enough to change things for those (disproportionately women) living in relative poverty. So far, this government has done too little to help them.Who should be Labour’s deputy leader? Whoever can tell a good Labour story – and take the fight to Reform | Polly ToynbeeRead moreWhen we consider those women most affected by these issues, the narrowness of our conceptions appears all the starker. Why, when we talk about working-class women in Britain, do we almost never talk about migrant women struggling to make ends meet, Black women living in some of the poorest areas of the UK, or women from Pakistani or Bangladeshi communities, disproportionately likely to experience poor health and poor housing? The reality is, when we talk about representing working-class women in Britain, we’re usually only talking about a narrow few.So bleak is the state of such discussions right now that the dominant appeals to working-class femininity don’t only erase the experiences of working-class women of colour, but threaten to actively do those women harm. When far-right figures call for the “safety of women and girls”, let us be clearer about whom exactly they’re talking about. These are real-life women and girls from working-class communities, whose sexual abuse has been cruelly packaged into the most convenient of political footballs, now kicked daily to justify racist abuse.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner in Downing Street, 26 March 2025.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersThese calls have prompted violent disorder in Rotherham, Epping and now the streets of central London. Those who sanction or ignore this encourage cruel racial scapegoating of ethnic communities. It is women with nothing, seeking asylum in the UK, who are placed at the greatest risk. Those who claim to march in the interests of materially disadvantaged young women fail to mention that they are only interested in protecting white women.If the deputy leadership candidates claim to speak for working-class women, they must begin to actively speak up for those who do not look or sound like them. We must broaden our understanding of what it means to be a working-class woman, beyond the white, conventionally socially mobile faces that dominate and artificially define.Politicians are not the only ones with a role to play. White women from working-class communities must not let their identities be weaponised. We must push back and stress solidarity born of material struggle. The phrase “working-class woman” refers to all kinds of people, united by inherited, systemic economic disadvantage. This is precisely what those appealing to a selective definition for political gain are desperate for us to forget.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a British official, I led a review of the humanitarian situation in Gaza in 2008 when the then government ofIsraelhad just imposed a blockade. I advised UK ministers that this was not in line with international humanitarian principles, that we wouldn’t accept this in other humanitarian contexts, and we should not do so in this case. The UK government ignored my recommendations on securing independent access for humanitarian aid for Gaza.Now that famine has been officiallyconfirmed in Gaza– a first in the Middle East – children are wasting away while truckloads of life-saving aid sit across the border. The international community must act decisively and urgently to break the blockade. Neither airdrops nor a sea route can provide a sustainable solution at scale to address immediate suffering or needs over the coming years, given the level of destruction. All options must be considered now, including a humanitarian lifeline across the Egypt-Gaza border at Rafah, under the mandate of the United Nations or an international “coalition of the willing”. Israel’s restrictions on aid entering Gaza can be challenged and circumvented. It will be politically contentious, but we do have precedents.In 2014, the UNsecurity council authoriseda cross-border humanitarian mechanism for Syria. It allowed UN agencies and their partners to deliver life-saving assistance to millions of Syrians without the consent of the government in Damascus. This mechanism was a lifeline for civilians caught in a brutal conflict. It was grounded in international humanitarian law and the UN’s responsibility to protect civilians when states are unable – or unwilling – to do so. It showed that even in a divided security council, consensus is possible when the humanitarian imperative is clear.But Syria is not the only example.In Sudan, during the 1980s famine and civil war, Operation Lifeline Sudan was launched as a collaborative effort between the UN, NGOs and both warring parties. It enabled humanitarian access that allowed aid to reach civilians in both government- and rebel-held areas, despite the absence of a formal peace agreement. It was one of the earliest examples of negotiated cross-border access in a conflict zone.Following Cyclone Nargis in 2008,international aid was initially blockedby the-then Myanmar government. As the British official overseeing UK humanitarian assistance, I visited Yangon alongside international partners. Intense diplomatic engagement – led by regional countries – established a coordination mechanism involving the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and the UN that allowed aid to flow. The lesson: international mechanisms can overcome political barriers when lives are at stake.The situation in Gaza today is no less urgent.In December 2023, the UN security councilagreed Resolution 2720. It demanded that all parties to the conflict facilitate the use of all routes to Gaza for humanitarian assistance. Now, international efforts remain focused, rightly, on persuading Israel to open border crossings. However, given Israeli intransigence, the prospects of a sustained shift seem bleak. The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt is the only alternative route for humanitarian access that can operate outside Israeli control. Yet, with Israel in control of the Gaza side of the border, access through Rafah is now at a virtual standstill. Aid convoys are stuck. Medical evacuations are denied. Humanitarian efforts to save lives are blocked.An internationally mandated humanitarian mechanism working in close cooperation with Egypt could change that. It would need international management on both sides of the border. And arrangements to consign emergency supplies to UN and international NGOs on the ground to distribute aid through established humanitarian channels. With upgrades to the infrastructure at the border, it would enable the movement of supplies at scale with transparent oversight. It would demonstrate international resolve to uphold the principles of humanity, neutrality and independence. It would help Palestinians to stay in Gaza with dignity.Undoubtedly there will be many critics and naysayers, not least those committed to annexing occupied Palestinian territory. In the face of mass suffering and famine, will the international community simply continue to issue statements? The international community and the UN security council have a responsibility to act when civilians are in grave danger. To fail to act is to be complicit in the atrocities that are being committed in Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Australia’s new declaration will help protect themMon 22 Sep 2025 03.29 EDTShareThe phone call every humanitarian worker’s family dreads came to Zomi Frankcom’s family in April 2024. An Australian, Frankcom was in Gaza with World Central Kitchen, feeding people in the middle of a catastrophe. She and six of her colleagues were killed in an instant, their vehicles targeted in what Israel’s government later described as a grave mistake. Showing immense strength, Frankcom’s family felt strongly that her death must lead to the protection of others. Humanitarians workers, they said, “can’t be brave at any cost”.Zomi Frankcom’s death was outrageous and unacceptable. But, shockingly, it was no anomaly. Rather, it is a part of a brutal global trend. In conflicts from Ukraine to Sudan, and even during disputes where there is no formal conflict, the sense is that lives of humanitarian workers are expendable. The consequences for taking them are not significant enough to stop.Australia joins UK and Canada in formally recognising Palestinian stateRead moreThe crisis is global. According to theAid Worker Security Database, 2024 was the deadliest year on record, with 385 humanitarian workers killed across 20 countries. Tragically, 2025 is on track to be just as bad, with at least 265 humanitarians killed already. Emblems of neutrality – including the red cross and red crescent of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement – seem more frequently viewed as targets than shields.This violence is a catastrophic erosion of international humanitarian law but it is not, yet, getting the attention it deserves. While the deaths of international aid workers like Frankcom rightly cause global outrage, the vast majority of victims are local staff and volunteers whose deaths, while just as brutal, attract less attention. In fact, more than 96% of humanitarian workers killed are nationals of the countries in which they work. It makes the IFRC – a federation of national societies with staff and volunteers based at home – particularly vulnerable.The very latest to die was Honelegn Fentahun of the Ethiopian Red Cross. In August he succumbed to injuries after being kidnapped while returning from a mission to deliver an ambulance. The irony is painful.Other stories are even worse. In March,15emergency workers were brutally killed and buried in the sand in Gaza. Rifaat Radwan, a 23-year-old who had stopped studying to volunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulance service, was one of them. In all, eight were ambulance workers from the PRCS, a member of the IFRC.A video found on one of the deadshowed all were wearing their uniforms when attacked.As Jagan wrote in horror in April, their red vests became their shrouds.In all, since 7 October 2023, 31 PRCS colleagues have been killed while on duty. But this is not just about Gaza. The IFRC’s member National Society in Israel, the medical aid and disaster relief service Magen David Adom, has had six members killed on duty since 7 October 2023. Elsewhere too the numbers are growing. The IFRC network has lost people in Iran, Sudan, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The numbers are so awful, and growing, that the IFRC has started amemorial pageand asupport fund for families.But words of condemnation and care for families after the fact are not enough. That is why on Sunday, at the United Nations general assembly in New York, Australia’s government formally launched a new declaration for the protection of humanitarian personnel.View image in fullscreenZomi Frankcom’s brother Mal Frankcom (left) and Australian’s foreign minister Penny Wong (right) at a ceremony in New York honouring aid workers who have been killedPhotograph: Lukas Coch/EPAJust published online,the declaration is a commitment to concrete action. It obliges states – in line with their existing legal obligations – to conduct full, prompt and impartial investigations into attacks and use national and international legal mechanisms to hold perpetrators to account. It demands work to ensure humanitarian activities are not criminalised and to prevent the harassment and arbitrary arrest of humanitarian workers. It urges efforts to counter the misinformation and hate speech that targets aid organisations and puts their staff at risk. And it requires assessments as to whether exported weapons could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law, and refrain from authorising such exports where there is an overriding risk.Led by the Australian government, championed by a dedicated group of countries including Switzerland, Jordan and Indonesia and supported by humanitarian organisations such as the IFRC, ICRC and UNOCHA, the declaration is the result of months of close collaboration. A “Group of Friends” – committed governments – will come together to promote implementation of the declaration by governments around the world. This is a shared mission, uniting the world’s humanitarians with governments committed to upholding the international rules-based order; committed, to put it more bluntly, to uploading dignity.Most importantly, the declaration is a chance to reverse deadly trends and end the culture of impunity. Humanitarian workers dedicate their lives to helping others. This should never cost them their own. We urge all nations to join this declaration in New York - to stand together to protect our protectors, to stop attacks on aid workers and reaffirm the principles of humanity that should unite us all.Andrew Colvin is the CEO of Australian Red Cross.

I’m a cleaner, and I was emphatically told this by an elderly client. I was, I confess, rather prone to giving her dogs a few too many treats. It’s a sensible thing to do when you’re visiting a new client with dogs that don’t know you – making anything with teeth think of me as an unalloyed good thing is something I believe in.Only – as their owner pointed out to me – it wasn’t kind. After I left, this pack of rather large and difficult dogs weren’t as receptive to training. Why didn’t I play with them instead? It would have been just as effective. The answer, of course, was that I took the easy option. I wanted their owner to think I was wonderful, to see how her dogs loved me. I wasn’t, in fact, thinking of being a good thing for the dogs. I just wanted the adoration without putting in the work.But her words got me thinking about what it means to be truly kind. Being nice is all about how you wish to be viewed, whereas being kind means doing what is right – never mind the optics.Nice is telling your friend her speech is fantastic – being kind is pointing out that it’s filled with bad jokes, none of which will work with the intended audience. Nice is ignoring the letter from school about nits because your daughter has curly hair that is impossible to untangle without hurting her – being kind is carefully combing through it every night for a week to ensure her head is free from the itching, even if she hates it.Being nice can be actively harmful too. When it’s disingenuous, it’s a superficial kind of action. It leads us to do hurtful things because our focus is on ourselves and how others perceive us.It’s difficult, especially for women. So many of us have been conditioned to people-please: be nice, don’t rock the boat, don’t upset. Nice people smile a lot; they make you feel good in the moment but their niceness can blind you to ulterior motives. How often do people comment on how nice someone was, how charming only to discover too late they were a terrible human? Ted Bundy was nice, he was handsome and charming. Monsters often are.But nice also harms us. I know a lot of women my age (myself included) who havesaid yes to dates we didn’t want, to meals we didn’t enjoy – even to marriage proposals – simply because we were taught that it mattered that other people thought we were nice girls.Kind people, on the other hand, often cause scenes. They stand up for what’s right, they put themselves out, and do not worry about their personal inconvenience. They rarely concern themselves with how people see them. Their energy goes on doing the right thing, no matter how difficult that might make things for themselves.How did I react after being admonished by that elderly client? Well, I started to care less about how other people saw me, which was surprisingly freeing. Instead, I started to concentrate on doing therightthing. It was difficult and went against instincts I didn’t even know I had. But I began to be more upfront and honest about things.I found I was better placed to give constructive criticism – not by being rude or abrasive but by gently making suggestions. For example, it became easier to tell people they would never have the results they wanted from my services unless they were prepared to put in some work themselves. Sometimes, this wasn’t received as well as I’d hoped, but it paid dividends within a few weeks. Asking people to ensure the house was reasonably tidy allowed me to clean more efficiently, and freed up time to spend on the unpleasant tasks they disliked. Cleaning the oven, for example.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palestinians need unfettered support – and nowMon 22 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 10.53 EDTShareWelcome, but behind the curve. That is the summary of the coordinated recognition of a Palestinian state byCanada, Australia and Britain. The emphatic gesture is a historical moment where the record is not written, but corrected. Palestinian statehood has always existed, and recognising that fact confers credibility on the recognisers, and not the Palestinian claim to their inalienable rights.As part of the shifting tide against Israel, even in theUnited States, recognition of a Palestinian state enshrines what the Israeli state seems committed to erasing once and for all – the legitimate claim of Palestinians to their own land. Naming and insisting on Palestinian statehood is vital. As the activist Arab Barghouthitold the Guardian last week, the recognition protects the idea of a Palestinian state, because the Israeli government is “bragging about the fact that they are killing the idea of a Palestinian state. And diplomatically, when countries like Britain and France and Canada recognise Palestine, that means something.”Now, more proof that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. How can western governments still refuse to act? | Steve CrawshawRead moreSuch gestures are important, especially for a cause that is fundamentally about a people’s right to exist in sovereignty on their own land. Keeping that notion alive, even if Israel never reverses course, resists theIsraeli government’s driveto have full and final dominion over Palestinians without condemnation or acknowledgment of the erasure of Palestinian rights, and confers status, respect and international treaty relations upon the Palestinian state. And there is weight to Britain, a member of the G7 and a permanent member of the security council, along with France, going up against US and Israeli propaganda that conflates Palestinian recognition with rewarding Hamas.But the road to this recognition has been ignoble in action and flawed in rationale. As far as the British government is concerned, belatedness and timidity have been defining features of its response to the situation in Gaza over the past two years. The government cannot escape the cloud of Keir Starmer’s words in those early days,when he said thatIsrael has the “right” to cut off power and water from Gaza. Nor the ignominy of refusing to back a ceasefire in November 2023, forcing members ofthe shadow cabinet to resign their rolesin order to vote for an amendment to the king’s speech call for a ceasefire.But the failures are not only historical, they are current and, indeed, concurrent, with the recognition. The government thatspeaks of the intolerable urgencyof the situation in Gaza is the same that received the Israeli president in Downing Streetearlier this month, a man whose declaration that there is “an entire nation out there that is responsible” for the 7 October 2023 attacks has beencited by a United Nations commissionas inciting genocide. It is also the same government that has deployed its full forceon many hundreds of peaceful protestersobjecting to the banning of Palestine Action. And despite the suspension of sales and licences for offensive weapons to Israel, British firms have stillprovided thousands of military items, including munitions that comprise bombs, grenades, torpedoes, mines and missiles.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer issues a statement from 10 Downing Street confirming the UK will recognise a Palestinian state, 21 September 2025.Photograph: 10 Downing Street/PAAnd it is only the force of public opinion that has dragged the government to even that partial suspension. Whether it issanctions against far-right Israeli ministersfor inciting violence against Palestinians, or the move to recognise a Palestinian state, the government has always moved too slowly, and even then producing only half-measures and confusing statements. That is inevitable when its responses do not come from a place of political duty, but pressure and calculation. These calculations never quite yield the desired result of projecting a government in command of the situation, because it is constantly trying to reconcile two things that cannot be joined together – placating public opinion, while still not making a meaningful rupture with the Israeli state.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cynic in me asks: why now? | Rokhaya DialloRead moreThe result is that the announcement of the intent to recognise a Palestinian state had already been weakened by its bizarre conceptualisation, framed as it has been around certainconditions that Israel must meet, including a ceasefire and permitting aid into Gaza, to head off the recognition. Palestinians either have an inalienable right to statehood and self-determination or they do not, and linking that right to the compliance of their occupier maintained a wildly unrealistic, if not fantastical, notion that Israel has any interest at all in pursuing a two-state solution when it is hurtling persistently in the other direction. It is clear now, two years into a genocide, that the Israeli government is not one that can be threatened, urged or scolded into ceasing its violation of Palestinian human and political rights.Which is why Palestinian statehood cannot be a phantom lever: a recognition that is not connected to anything, something that ends up being a fig leaf for western governments to say that they have taken big steps, and therefore catch a break. It cannot be something to roll out as a firm talking point when pressed, and to absolve themselves of the further action that must be taken. It must be more than an end in itself.It cannot be high-octane but low-stakes signalling, unaccompanied by any tangible measures that would stop genocide and the invasion and re-settlement of Gaza: a second ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, and the looming annexation of the West Bank. Backing it up must be some form of sanctions, trade embargos and international isolation. And, even then, those measures would only be a start on the road to withdrawing global legitimacy from the Israeli state on the basis that it has long become an outlaw.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians flee amid an Israeli military operation, Gaza City, 21 September 2025.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersRecognition of a Palestinian state is a big step on the part of countries that have withheld that right for too long, and we will hear a lot of “better late than never”s over the next few days. But the potential import of the move has been diminished by the colossal events over the past two years: war crimes and atrocities that the world still has failed to respond to proportionately.Is it better late than never? I don’t know. Too many have been killed, maimed and starved for that phrase to be anything but a glib line that resigns us to a politics in which the lowest expectations are the best that can be hoped for. If the next steps are all to be better late than never, then the sum total of all this high historic action, as far as it will change the fate of a single Palestinian on the ground, is zero. For this to be the important move that it can be, it must be followed by steps that meet the moment in action, over and above the political pronouncements.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesOpinionKeir StarmerIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelLabourMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Now, for his biggest European show, the artist talks us through his disturbing new worksMon 22 Sep 2025 11.06 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 14.53 EDTShareHistory weighs on Kerry James Marshall, though not all that heavily. When he talks about the hefty subjects of his art – from slavery to civil rights – he does so with a disarming, disquieting lightness. Maybe that’s because at almost 70 years old, and at the peak of his popularity, he’s seen it all.Marshall grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, just a few blocks away from where the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, a white supremacist attack that killed four young black girls, took place in 1963. When his family moved to Los Angeles, they ended up right in the middle of the 1965 Watts riots, a six-day uprising fuelled by growing racial tension in the poorest part of the city.I set my own goals. They don’t tell me what I’m supposed to like and not likeAll of this has undoubtedly fed into his journey to becoming arguably the US’s greatest living painter. Today, seated in the galleries of the Royal Academy in London, where his jaw-dropping, large-scale, colourful paintings are going on display for a major show, he reels off a list of traumatic, shocking events from his youth. Beatings, murders, injuries, robberies, “and that’s not even half of it,” he says with a smile, chuckling.“I came this way against the odds, given the time that I entered art school and the way people told you that you’re not supposed to do this kind of stuff,” he says. “That had no effect on my ambition, because I set my own goals. They don’t tell me what I’m supposed to like and what I’m not supposed to like. I don’t accept that.”View image in fullscreenPicnic time … Untitled (Blanket Couple), 2014.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and David Zwirner, London/© Kerry James MarshallFrom the start, Marshall’s vision has been knowingly defiant. The cultural environment he emerged into after graduating from art school in the late 1970s was one heading full bore into conceptualism, and still trying to deal with the afterglow of abstraction, pop and postmodernism. He ignored all of that, and chose instead a notably classical take on figuration. Yet what he did was startlingly modern: he used the language of classicism to elevate ordinary, everyday and – crucially – black subject matter to the level of Titian, David or Velázquez.Think of the giant paintings that line the walls of the world’s great art museums:Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People,Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa,Rubens’ Massacre of the Innocents. Big, important paintings on big, important themes. And then look at Marshall’s 1993 masterpieceDe Style. It’s on the same enormous scale, and given the same prominence and heft, but this isn’t a scene from the Bible, or a pivotal moment in history. It’s a barbershop. It’s someone getting their hair cut while a couple of customers wait their turn. It’s a snapshot of everyday black life, heightened and celebrated.Marshall’s work sets out to prove that scenes of black life “can be as grand and spectacular” as anything from the history of art. “The significance in part was that you couldn’t walk by that thing and say you didn’t see it. You couldn’t pretend you didn’t notice it. It was there, and it was there in a big way.”De Style became his first painting to be bought by a museum when it was purchased by the Los Angeles County Museum ofArt. It’s astonishing, saturated with ultra-intense colour, bright reds, vivid yellows and deep, mesmerising blacks. It’s clever and assured, joyful and celebratory. And it cemented Marshall’s place at the forefront of American painting.Yet he seems wary of embracing the outwardly political nature of his painting. “I’m not making pictures because I want to be a ‘political artist’,” he says. “I’m making pictures because I like what pictures do. I like seeing them. I like making them.”His priority, he says, is people, especially the ones that inhabit his canvases. “There’s nothing more interesting than other human beings,” he says. “There’s no set of patterns, no combinations of colours, no textures. Human beings are more interesting to other human beings than anything else you can find and encounter on the planet. And making pictures of human beings still remains as fascinating an enterprise as anything you could do.”View image in fullscreenComplex reality … Abduction of Olaudah and His Sister, 2023.Photograph: © Kerry James Marshall. Image courtesy David Zwirner, London. Photo: Kerry McFateThat attitude feels a little hard to square with the subject matter as you walk through the Royal Academy show, his biggest ever in Europe. Early works deal with the absence of black figures from art history; other paintings look at the civil rights and black power movements. A central gallery is dedicated to images of theMiddle Passage, the journey that took enslaved Africans across the Atlantic to the US. These are heavy, powerful topics, and painting them in his grand, colourful, precise style feels like a political move.“I’m not interested in how people interpret the work, because I’m not providing people with an open-ended canvas in which they can say anything they want to say,” says Marshall. “I’m very particular about the things I want them to know about the particular image I’m making. These are very straightforward. These aren’t difficult things to interpret. Being obscure is not an objective that makes much sense to me.”Kerry James Marshall review – astonishing visions of black America, from bar-room boozers to families in spaceRead moreAnd there’s the point. You don’t really need to talk about political motive or narrative intention when you see a work likehis portrait of rebel slave Nat Turnerbrandishing a bloodied axe, his master’s severed head left rolling on the bed in the background. It is, indeed, very straightforward.Which makes his new series, painted just in time for this show, all the more unsettling. The works see Marshall tackle the “sensitive” and “polemical” (the Royal Academy’s words) history of black involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. The opening work depicts two African children being abducted from their homes by black figures, ready to be shipped across the ocean. It’s a bright, vibrant, verdant but deeply shocking painting, based on the story ofOlaudah Equiano, an 18th-century writer who was abducted from Nigeria as a child before buying his freedom and settling in London.“Olaudah had been passed on through a network of people,” says Marshall. “He got exchanged over four or five times. He didn’t see a white man until he got on the boat. That’s the slave trade too. It’s not just the boats. It’s not just the trip across the Atlantic. It’s everyday people who wanted some value from whatever was transpiring during the slave trade, people who participated as freelancers to get what they could. They didn’t care any more about abducting children than anybody else.”So why does he think people choose to ignore these sorts of stories?“Because they don’t fit the narrative of white people evil, black people good. It doesn’t fit.”The reality is more complex?“It’s always more complex than that. Always.”So what, I wonder, does painting it achieve?“It makes it available,” he says. “Pictures can be a catalyst for investigating or taking a look at areas of history that people tend to not find their way to.”This is what I always wanted – to be counted among the artists I admiredOn a basic level, these works are Marshall fighting for nuance in a society that he sees growing more divided by the day, pushing viewers to take responsibility and own their circumstances. “Human beings are much more complicated than any of us would like to recognise,” he says. “It’s easier to create boogeymen and scapegoats. And it’s also easy not to take responsibility for being a part of any of that. It’s always somebody else. I think this is critical: in all of the works I do, black people have agency.”It’s agency that got him where he is today. Before we part, I ask him if being here at the Royal Academy makes him feel as if he’s “made it” as an artist, like he’s written himself properly into the art history he has loved for so long. “This is what I always wanted,” he says. “I always wanted to be counted among the artists that I admired.”And like he said, he’s here against the odds, against centuries of societal repression, millennia of conflict. “Violence is at the root” of humanity, he says. “The opportunities to be killed are many and various, and we’re lucky to get to be as old as we get to be sometimes. We’re lucky to be alive.” He laughs his warm laugh. “We’re lucky to be alive.”Kerry James Marshall: The Histories is at theRoyal Academy, London, until 18 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designRoyal Academy of ArtsPaintingArtExhibitionsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We’d had one of the biggest records in the world – Never Gonna Give You Up with Rick Astley. Rick’s manager rang and said: would I like to go for lunch with Granada TV? We had a very pleasant lunch with David Liddiment, head of light entertainment, but I didn’t really understand why he wanted to meet me.Night-time television was relatively new. I’d seen a few things, but thought: “Who’d want to watch Elvis Costello talking about Irish politics at 1am when you’ve been for a curry and 10 pints?” I said: “What you should do is take a film crew to a nightclub.” David said: “Could you do that?” I said: “Sure.” I’d grown up watching Ready Steady Go! I knew I needed a co-presenter. I’d seen Michaela Strachan because my kids watchedWide Awake Club. When I was introduced to her, I thought: “She’s bubbly. She’d be great.”I twisted my ankle and the physio said, 'You can't walk.' I said, “Not only have I got to walk, I’ve got to dance!”Although the idea was to go out live from real nightclubs in the middle of the night, for some reason we did a pilot at 2pm on a Saturday at Mr Smith’s in Warrington. The dancers made the turntables jump. The cameramen wanted the lights up full and complained it was too loud. Michaela and I had no idea what the other was saying. To say it was a disaster is an understatement. The worst thing you can try to do is create two hours of nightclub entertainment on a Saturday afternoon where nobody’s had a drink. How David ever commissioned a series based on this pilot, I still don’t know.When the series went out for real, we were beamed live at 1am via satellite. But Granada decided it was too expensive, so we’d tape it, the tapes would be biked back to Granada, and it would be broadcast an hour later. At one point it was so cold driving over the Peak District, the tapes had to be thawed out with a hairdryer. The audience were just regular punters. We’d say: “If you’re here with somebody else’s wife, stand apart.” The police watched to find criminals who’d jumped bail and would turn up and arrest them. It was chaotic.Some sections were so outrageous we got warned by the authorities: people drinking custard out of condoms at 1am was not acceptable. But we didn’t dream this up. This was what was happening in nightclubs up and down the country. There were downsides. Driving home at 3am in my bright red Porsche, I got so fed up with being stopped by the police, I bought a Land Rover on the grounds it would never do more than 70mph. Bugger me, the next Saturday night, they pulled me over at 3am and went: “We’ve just been watching you on television.”View image in fullscreenThe Hitman and Her visit the Discotheque Royale in Manchester.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockMichaela Strachan, presenterI was doing the Wide Awake Club on Saturday mornings and a show called Michaela on Sundays singing The Wheels on the Bus for preschoolers. I hadn’t asked TV-am if it was OK for me to present this late night adult music show in case it got in the way of me presenting children’s TV – I doubt these days you’d be allowed to do both – and hadn’t signed the contract. They called it The Hitman and Her in case they’d had to replace me with another her.I twisted my ankle just before the pilot. The physio said: “There’s no way you’re going to be walking.” I said: “Not only have I got to walk, I’ve got to dance.” No wonder Pete seemed so stressed. We were given a run of six weeks that lasted four years. It was hugely successful. The viewing figures got up to 1.3m. I’m astonished how many people still say: “I remember you from The Hitman and Her.” I think: “Who were all these people watching at 2am?”Timmy Mallett and Michaela Strachan: how we made Wide Awake ClubRead moreMuch of it we would not get away with now, like Clothes Swap, where people would swap clothes behind a sheet and we’d drop the sheet on purpose. Get Your Gums Around These Plums was bobbing for apples in custard. There was a suggestion of a game where the bloke was blindfolded and had to feel different girls to see if he could guess which one was his girlfriend. Thank God one of the female researchers said: “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”I quickly learned to look after myself, otherwise you’d get your bum pinched. Even the dynamic of Pete and me was quirky. He gave me the most backhanded compliment. He said: “Do you know why you work on this show? It’s because you’re attractive, but not attractive enough to make other women hate you.” In other words: you’ve got enough of the girl next door for people to think that you are their friend rather than a threat.People say: “You should bring it back.” It was a lot of fun and has become iconic but some of it was incredibly tacky. Let’s not bring it back and analyse it in today’s world because I don’t think it would be so fondly remembered.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the broadcaster hits 70, we look back on the highlights – and lowlightsMark LawsonMon 22 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 07.06 EDTShareFor more than two decades, the BBCTelevisionService was the only option for UK viewers. Until 22 September 1955, when a commercial rival, Independent Television, started at 7.15pm with fanfares and speeches from a launch jamboree at London’s Guildhall, continuing with playlets from Oscar Wilde and Noël Coward, then a middleweight boxing bout.Over the subsequent seven decades,ITVhas screened shows that are unforgettable, wrongly and rightly forgotten and, in some cases, now-unforgivable. Here, as a 70th birthday card, are the most significant shows from each year, reflecting the shift from regional franchises to a single ITV Studios with dozens of independent production companies.1955 – Take Your Pick!Because it was funded by advertising rather than the licence fee (£3 per year at the time), ITV was able to be more commercial in gameshow prizes, which, on the BBC, had to be token. (Crackerjack,launched in the same year, gave pencils to winners and cabbages to losers!) On the first British show to offer cash prizes, finalists had to take their pick from boxes numbered one to 10, potentially winning a booby prize, a cash gift of £80 (about £1,800 now) or the “star prize” (car/package holiday).1956 –The OutsiderView image in fullscreenPrestige … Jane Birkin on Armchair Theatre – Poor Cherry.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockEarly regional franchises were awarded on the “quality” of their programme proposals, usually taken as code for “public service”. This meant high-end drama, including Armchair Theatre, a long-running (until 1974) prime-time slot for single plays. The majority were originals but, perhaps aiming for prestige, it began with a revival of a 1923 theatre piece, The Outsider, though, less conservatively, it was written by a woman, Dorothy Brandon.1957 – Jim’s InnHow nakedly commercial ITV could or should be was much debated. Initially, some regions broadcast an “advertising magazine” – mini-dramas packed with actors pushing products. Among the most successful was Jim’s Inn, set in a mock pub where the presenter, Jimmy Hanley, tried to flog stuff. Such programmes were outlawed in the 1963 Television Act and “product placement” illegal for 54 years.1958 – William TellIn the year that Pope Pius XII declared St Clare of Assisi the patron saint of TV – some pious Catholics placed an icon beside their aerials to boost the signal – this was an early international co-production. Lew Grade (uncle ofMichael Grade) had failed to win a franchise but his Incorporated Television Company sold shows to the networks, including this tea-time adventure series for which 14th-century Switzerland was recreated in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.1959 – Probation OfficerFact-based drama become a key ITV brand and this pioneer, fictionalising real cases from Probation Service files, was billed as a “dramatised documentary series”. Early ITV schedules had been dominated by half-hour dramas, but Probation Officer popularised the one-hour prime-time slot.1960 – Coronation StreetView image in fullscreenUnusually female-led … Violet Carson as Ena Sharples on Corrie.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesFive years after the BBC tried to spook ITV with soap opera – diverting 20 million radio listeners from the new service by killing young bride Grace in The Archers –ITV launched a TV soapthat has often rattled the BBC with its popularity. Made in the north of England about the north of England, it was also unusually female-led, with stand-out early characters including Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed), although William Roache as Ken Barlow was there then and remains now.1961 – SurvivalThe ratings hit this year was The Avengers, but at least as influential and more enduring was this wildlife series, which ended up running for 40 years. The title initially reflected Darwinian competition among animals but presciently came to imply extinction and conservation as well.1962 – Police5Lew Grade took over a failing Midlands franchise to create ATV, which found a canny way to fill five-minute gaps that were left because US imports tended to be shorter than ITV slots. Viewers were invited, pre-CCTV, to identify wrong ’uns from identikit and witness statements. “Keep ’em peeled,” said hostShaw Taylorfrom Scotland Yard at the end of each episode, pointing to his eyes. The grass-your-neighbours format peaked with the BBC’s Crimewatch UK (1984-2017) but Police 5, which ran until the early 90s, was the first guvnor.1963 – Ready Steady Go!View image in fullscreen‘The weekend starts here!’ … Stevie Wonder on Ready Steady Go! in December 1963.Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns/GettyThe era of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones spawned much pop music TV. A year ahead of the BBC’s Top of the Pops, this Friday evening live music and interview show spread the catchphrase: “The weekend starts here!”1964 – 7 UpView image in fullscreenNot long now till 70 Up! … 7 Up.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesNow nine years old, ITV had more competition (BBC Two launched this year) and was thinking about growing up. Regional franchise Granada optimistically signalled its own longevity by starting a project that might last for nine decades, revisiting 14 seven-year-olds at seven-year intervals. Apart from Coronation Street, this is the longest surviving ITV franchise – and the network has already trailed 70 Up for 2026.1965 – ThunderbirdsView image in fullscreenA cultural powerhouse … Thunderbirds.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesOnly 32 episodes were made of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson’s weird but watchable super hero puppet show – featuring electronic marionettes with visible strings – but reruns, homages and parodies make it a cultural powerhouse.1966 – Weavers GreenBBC and ITV shared thebiggest TV event – England’s still only ever football World Cup victory – but less memorable is a soap set around a veterinary practice. Unlike several ITV soaps that lasted decades, it was over by Christmas, though looked to the future by using lightweight video cameras rather than cumbersome film for its Norfolk location scenes.1967 – News at TenInitially, ITV news was short, regional and moveable to maximise advertising space. The national half-hour bulletin, produced by Independent Television News (ITN), went for 10pm to avoid the 9pm-ish BBC main news and allow time for mid-evening movies. At a time when actors read the BBC news, ITN employed journalists (including Alastair Burnet andReginald Bosanquet, and laterAnna FordandTrevor McDonald) who became at least as famous as the presidents and prime ministers.1968 – The Big MatchIn the 1967 contest for licences, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) gave Friday-Sunday in the capital to London Weekend Television and the rest to Thames. Each launched a show as a direct challenge to the BBC – LWT’s The Big Match kicked Match of the Day while Magpie, also starting in 1968, challenged Blue Peter (born 1958).1969 – On the BusesAlongside one of ITV’s most shameful commissions – Curry and Chips, with Spike Milligan playing a cosmetically assisted Indian – comedy was better represented by this London-set show, which made a star ofReg Varney, about drivers and “clippies” (conductors) on the capital’s distinctive red double-deckers.1970 – KateThe recent reshuffle had created a new Leeds-based broadcaster called Yorkshire. Its first slate included Kate, a Wednesday 9pm hit about a newspaper agony aunt. Phyllis Calvert, a British movie star, made her TV debut, confirming the medium’s rising status.1971 – Upstairs, DownstairsView image in fullscreenPosh and retro … Lesley-Anne Down and Jean Marsh on Upstairs, Downstairs.Photograph: LWT/AllstarLWT – despite a partial takeover at the time by the Australian republican Rupert Murdoch (later blocked by regulators) – went posh and retro with Upstairs, Downstairs, a story of aristocrats and their servants starting in 1903 in the super-rich Belgravia part of the transmission area.1972 – Emmerdale FarmView image in fullscreenWhat a survivor … Annie Sugden, played by Sheila Mercier, in  Emmerdale Farm.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockDespite schedules including a supersoap, Coronation Street, and a subsoap – Crossroads – the network responded to government permission for more daytime hours with a lunchtime “continuing drama” intended by the network Yorkshire to flaunt the possibilities of colour television by filming in the county’s beautiful rural parts. It’s another longtime ITV survivor, though now in prime-time and (since 1989) just called Emmerdale.1973–Divorce His, Divorce HersThe network Harlech had secured the Welsh licence partly with the promise that the cultural king of Cymru, Richard Burton, and his wife, Elizabeth Taylor, would appear on screen. Eventually they did, in a “made for TV movie” about a divorce: the husband’s viewpoint on Sunday, the wife’s the next night. The performances felt authentic … perhaps because the couple divorced the next year, though they would remarry and redivorce within 24 months.1974 – The World at WarThe idea of an ITV giant, the Thames programme controller Jeremy Isaacs, The World at War had started late the previous year. But it was in the first half of 1974 that the magnitude and magnificence of this 26-part series became fully apparent – using archive and interviews to depict the second world war from its 1930s origins to its 1960s aftermath to an audience full of survivors and relatives of the dead.1975 – The SweeneyView image in fullscreenIt has influenced all cop shows since … Dennis Waterman and John Thaw in The Sweeney.Photograph: ShutterstockBecause all the regional licensees were contractually required to reflect their patch, Thames included the capital’s underside in a show that has influenced all cop drama since. Named after rhyming slang for the CID’s rapid reaction force, the flying squad (Sweeney Todd), the show was defined by loudness – shouting, squealing tyres and the stripes on fat ties.1976 – Bill BrandIt now seems remarkable that 13 Monday prime-time slots were given to Trevor Griffiths’ dense epic about the Westminster disillusionment of a new Labour MP from the north of England, played by Jack Shepherd. Yet it described a tension in the Labour party between ideological purity and governmental compromise that continues now.1977 – The ProfessionalsView image in fullscreenThe Sweeney on speed … Martin Shaw, Gordon Jackson and Lewis Collins in The Professionals.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/LwtEssentially The Sweeney on speed, this was a classy example of the popular TV trope of the secret police unit licensed to do anything to stop bad guys. The agents were Bodie (Lewis Collins), who had left the SAS because it was a bit soft, and Doyle (Martin Shaw), an ex-copper who calmed the regulator by expressing qualms about extreme methods.1978 – The South Bank ShowCurrently being celebrated for braining-up British radio through 27 years of In Our Time,Melvyn Bragggreatly boosted ITV’s IQ during 32 years of the finest British television arts series, including landmark chats with Harold Pinter, David Hockney, Victoria Wood, Martin Amis, Miriam Makeba andOlivier Messiaen.1979 – MinderThames continued as an anti-London Tourist Board with another Cockney classic, featuring criminals too petty for The Sweeney. George Cole played Arthur Daley, a hapless chancer, with Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, his ex-boxer bodyguard.1980 – Death of a PrincessMargaret Thatcher cited the BBC’s Yes, Prime Minister as her favourite show; this was among her least. ATV’s drama-documentary fictionalised an apparently true story of a princess executed for adultery in Saudi Arabia, where political reaction led to the banning of British Airways flights and the cancellation of trade deals. Condemning the show, the Thatcher government seemed to lament that it lacked Middle Eastern censorship powers. That ATV lost its ITV licence in the 1982 reshuffle was officially a coincidence.1981 – Brideshead RevisitedView image in fullscreenProvocative …  Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews in Brideshead Revisited, which remains among the greatest ever TV dramas.Photograph: AlamyThe north-west franchise Granada openly aspired to be a BBC beside the Manchester Ship canal, most provocatively parking its tanks on the lawns of the country house classic adaptation with this 13-part version of Evelyn Waugh’s 1945 novel about Catholic nobs. From Jeremy Irons’s mournful narration via a cameo from Lord Olivier to the honeyed photography, it terrified the BBC, as planned, and remains among the greatest TV dramas.1982 – WolcottView image in fullscreenSadly didn’t even transmit … George Harris as Winston Wolcott in Wolcott.Photograph: ShutterstockThe only annual entry in this list that didn’t transmit. A 13-part series had been announced following an impressive critical reception for the previous year’s pilot with George Harris as the first lead Black detective on British TV. However, the producing company, ATV, lost the Midlands contract in the 1981 franchise round (which, incidentally, inspired Jilly Cooper’s 1988 novelRivals, now a Disney+ sensation) and so a pioneering project ended.1983 – Auf Wiedersehen, PetATV replacement Central had a starry opening slate including Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, mainly written byDick Clement and Ian La Frenais,which followed a group of British “brickies”, “chippies” and “sparks” who, unemployed in the UK, worked on German building sites. Launching stars Kevin Whately, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, it should be viewed by all historians of the UK’s relationship with Europe.1984 – The Jewel in the CrownView image in fullscreenAwe-inspiring … Art Malik and Tim Pigott-Smith in The Jewel in the Crown.Photograph: Granada TVGranada’s stalking of the BBC continued with another high-end filmed book: a 14-parter adapted from Paul Scott’s novels about the fall of the British Raj rule of India. Stance and casting might now be considered Anglocentric but the show steered great careers – Charles Dance, Tim Pigott-Smith, Geraldine James, Art Malik – and it is hard not to feel awe at the ambition and funding British television could then have.1985 – Widows IIA year, rare at the time, of female power. Cilla Black became British TV’s most important woman through LWT’s matchmaker flagship Blind Date; four major female comedians –Dawn French,Jennifer Saunders, Ruby Wax and Tracey Ullman–starred in the Central sitcom Girls on Top;and the second series of Widows, a feminist twist on the gangster drama established Lynda La Plante as one of TV’s key writers.1986 –Hot MetalHaving briefly owned LWT, Rupert Murdoch, as a rightwing newspaper baron, was the clear target, with rival print tycoon Robert Maxwell, of this spirited two-season sitcom from David Renwick and Andrew Marshall in which Robert Hardy, through pioneering split-screen, played both the owner and editor of a tabloid, a good joke about editorial independence.1987 – Inspector MorseIn what seemed like overreach then but prescience now, the producer Kenny McBain persuaded ITV to give two hours to adaptations of Colin Dexter’s books about a depressive, real ale-drinking, crossword solving Oxford detective, giving John Thaw a very different TV police career after The Sweeney. Morse, which ran until 2000, still leaves clear DNA traces on all detective dramas and a sequel, Lewis (2006-15) and prequel,Endeavour(2012-23), make it, at 33 years on air, British TV fiction’s greatest dynasty.1988 – Death on the RockA show Thatcher liked even less than Death of a Princess, the This Week documentary examined the alleged “execution” of three IRA members in Gibraltar. The Foreign Office made unsuccessful attempts to have the film banned but it was almost certainly no accident that in the next ITV licence round, Thames lost London to Carlton, a company with a young David Cameron as head of PR.1989 – Agatha Christie’s PoirotView image in fullscreen‘C’est magnifique!’ … David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThe two oldest broadcasters fought over England’s most popular novelist, with the BBC favouring Miss Marple and ITV Hercule Poirot. David Suchet meticulously caught every Belgian-Anglo vowel and moustache twitch in dramatisations of all 70 Poirot stories over 24 years.1990 – Who Bombed Birmingham?World in Action had screened investigative documentaries since 1963 but achieved its greatest success with a drama-documentary that freed six innocent people suspected of being IRA terrorists from jail and remains a gold standard of the genre known as “faction”, using performers to engage audiences with reporting.1991 – Prime SuspectView image in fullscreenWhat a star … Helen Mirren as DCI Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockHaving feminised robbers in Widows, Lynda La Plante did the same for cops with Helen Mirren – another example of the level of star TV could now attract – as senior detective Jane Tennison, solving cases while fighting misogyny and alcoholism. Seven series over 15 years make this a signature crime franchise.1992 –GladiatorsView image in fullscreenDo you feel the power? … it’s Gladiators.Photograph: ITV/RexHighest-bidderfranchisesforced surviving networksdownmarketto pay for their licences. A symptom of populist desperation was Gladiators, an arena entertainment game in which pseudonymous characters – Wolf, Jet, Falcon – competed in bone-cracking challenges.1993 – CrackerView image in fullscreenCareer-best stuff … Robbie Coltrane and Geraldine Somerville in Cracker.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesJimmy McGovern refreshed the police procedural by focusing on criminal psychologist Fitz (Robbie Coltrane’s career-best role) who gets results despite or because of his own personality disorders.1994 – Charles: The Private Man, The Public RoleJonathan Dimbleby secured from the heir to the throne the then most candid royal interview, including, most shockingly to monarchists and clerics, an admission of adultery. Diana, Princess of Wales, retaliated next year with a Panorama heart-spill – obtained, we now know, by interviewerMartin Bashirthrough nefarious means – which led to divorce,Diana’s presence in a fast car in a Paris underpassin 1997 and incalculable mental consequences for the couple’s sons.1995 –Band of GoldView image in fullscreenStar-making … Barbara Dickson, Geraldine James, Ruth Gemmell and Cathy Tyson in Band of Gold.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockKay Mellor(1951-2022) showed her special talent for tragi-comedy about northern English working-class women – see also Fat Friends and Playing the Field – in this returning series about sex-workers in Bradford, with a cast including Geraldine James, already a star, and Samantha Morton, becoming one.1996 – HillsboroughSomehow both forensic and emotive, Jimmy McGovern’s docudrama about the 97 fatalities from incompetent policing of overcrowding at a Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup in 1989 stood as both a memorial and a court of public opinion.1997– Cold FeetView image in fullscreenA cast supreme … Cold Feet.Photograph: ShutterstockGranada’s domination of ITV drama in this period (four of the past five entries) continued with Mike Bullen’s tender but sometimes tough examination of young couples navigating love, infidelity, cancer, unemployment with a supreme ensemble cast: Helen Baxendale, Hermione Norris, James Nesbitt, Fay Ripley, Robert Bathurst, John Thomson.1998 –Who Wants to be a Millionaire?SinceTake Your Pick! on opening night, ITV had pushed for ever bigger contest prizes and reached the long-desired seven figures withChris Tarrantpresiding over a quiz that required players to risk huge losses to win big.1999 – Pride of Britain AwardsAt a time when ITV hits and red-top newspapers each reached tens of millions, tie-ups made sense. The Sun often seemed to have an inside track to Coronation Street and the network collaborated with the Daily Mirror on this honours system for regular Britons.2000 – At Home With the BraithwaitesITV was disappointed that rights to the National Lottery went (from 1994-2017) to the BBC, but the underbidder got the better content than the rotating balls in this sparkling four-season drama about the domestic and moral consequences for a family that wins £38m. The series debut ofSally Wainwright, who has become a key TV dramatist, though largely on the other side (Happy Valley, Last Tango in Halifax.)2001 – Harry Hill’s TV BurpView image in fullscreenBrilliantly silly … Harry Hill’s TV Burp.Photograph: ITV/AvalonFrom Denis Norden’s It’ll Be Alright on the Night (from 1977) through to Clive James on TV (LWT, 1992-98), television had been increasingly hungry to eat itself, ridiculing clips from mainly foreign shows. Hill took broadcast cannibalism to its highest levels by focusing on British TV, often from the previous week, with a combination of silliness (puppets, pranks) and real critical acuity.2002 – I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here!With financial pressures collapsing the regional structure to make ITV a single broadcaster, there was economic canniness in a show that could fill two to three weeks of prime-time for the cost of flying fading celebrities to eat animal genitalia in the Australian rainforest and paying the presenting fees of Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, who became ITV royalty. For quizzers: the first winner was DJ Tony Blackburn.2003 – The Second ComingBoth Channel 4 and the BBC turned down Russell T Davies’s story of a young Mancunian, played with his special intensity by Christopher Ecclestone, who believes he is Jesus Christ returned to Earth on a mission to save the world from Armageddon. Theologically serious and unnervingly convincing, it has dated only in the Jesus 2.0 being a video store worker.2004 – The X FactorA year after fantasising about finding a Messiah, the network identified one who was real (with some cosmetic help) in Simon Cowell, whose pop contest show began his long domination of ITV schedules. NB quizzers: Steve Brookstein.2005 – The Jeremy Kyle ShowThough there was muttering about quality, no one could doubt ITV’s quantity: now four channels and a thriving morning schedule, including Jeremy Kyle’s Anglicisation of US confrontation shows in which former friends and warring families faced off over sex or money claims, with a lie detector on hand to identify (in theory) liars. The show was cancelled in 2019 after the suicide of a recent contestant, althougha coroner found“no causal link”.2006 – See No Evil: The Moors MurdersView image in fullscreenSensitively done … Maxine Peake and Matthew McNulty in See No Evil: The Moors Murders.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockThe story ofchild killers Myra Hindley (Maxine Peake) and Ian Brady (Sean Harris) was told with dramatic sensitivity in an early collaboration between two masters of true crime drama: writer Neil McKay and producer Jeff Pope, whose later collaborations includeAppropriate Adult,The MoorsideandFour Lives.2007 – Britain’s Got TalentView image in fullscreenRiding on success … Anthony McPartlin, Declan Donnelly and Patsy May in Britain’s Got Talent.Photograph: Tom Dymond/Thames/RexThe network’smost successful producer – Simon Cowell – and favourite presenters – Ant & Dec – formed a power throuple in this variety contest for acts ranging from opera singers to trick-performing dogs. One of the former – Paul Potts – won the first series; one of the latter – border collie Pudsey – the sixth run (of 18 so far.)2008 – Moving Wallpaper/Echo BeachA sudden ITV executive desire not to be known mainly for talent shows and bushtucker trials is the most plausible explanation for arguably its strangest ever prime-time show. A half-hour comedy about the making of a soap called Echo Beach was immediately followed by an episode of that show. Hard now to believe it really happened.2009 – The ChaseBack to business as usual with an ingenious quiz in which civilians compete against a terrifyingly knowledgable professional quizzer called The Chaser. Still running today, it was crucial in securing Bradley Walsh a contract to present all TV shows if possible.2010 –Downton AbbeyView image in fullscreenShe never even watched an episode … Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess Grantham in Downton Abbey.Photograph: Nick Briggs/APCombining echoes of earlier ITV posho-shows Upstairs, Downstairs and Brideshead Revisited with his own 2001 movie Gosford Park, Julian Fellowes created one of TV’s most prolific and profitable franchises (six TV series, five specials, three movies) by suggesting the Edwardian aristocracy were surprisingly kind and liberal and persuading Britain’s greatest actor –Dame Maggie Smith– to do TV as the Dowager Countess, although she claimed never to have watched an episode.2011 – Long Lost FamilyThe digital possibilities of social media reconnection drive a tear-jerker that, with appropriate psychological support, reunites separated relatives. Key to its continuing success is the emotional intelligence, deepened by crises in their own lives, of co-hosts Nicky Campbell andDavina McCall.2012 – The Martin Lewis Money ShowAs “austerity” gave way to a permanent “cost of living crisis”, financial advice was vital. With a natural broadcasting manner and an astonishing ability to digest small print and identify big savings, Lewis is an exemplary public service expert.2013 – BroadchurchView image in fullscreenAn enduring crime show … David Tennant as DI Alec Hardy and Olivia Colman as DS Ellie Miller in Broadchurch.Photograph: Kudos/ITV/Rex/ShutterstockCurious for a cast including an actor who had played the lead in Doctor Who (David Tennant) and another who soon would (Jodie Whittaker), Chris Chibnall’s series confirmed that an enduring crime show needs a beautiful location – Dorset’s Jurassic Coast – and a sense of the reality of death: Tennant and Olivia Colman, as contrasting glum/warm detectives, investigated the long consequences of a child murder over three series.2014 – The Lost Honour of Christopher JefferiesAfter the murder of young architect Joanna Yeates in Bristol, her landlord, the schoolteacher Christopher Jefferies, was suspected by police and effectively convicted by print and TV media. He was completely innocent and Peter Morgan’s drama, directed by Roger Michell, has a superb Jason Watkins in a warning story of someone beaten with the wrong end of the stick.2015 – UnforgottenMaking cold cases hot, Chris Lang’s scripts begin with the chance discovery of a corpse that soon links with a disparate range of people who think they have got away from it or with it. DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and DI Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) were perhaps more empathetic than homicide detectives can reasonably be, and Walker handed over to Sinéad Keenan for the fifth and sixth seasons.2016 – VictoriaView image in fullscreenIn full fig … Jenna Coleman as Queen Victoria.Photograph: Gareth Gatrell/ITV PlcThe 90th birthday year of the former British monarch seems to have sparked monarchical drama with the launch of both Peter Morgan’s The Crown (Netflix) and Daisy Goodwin’s glossy bio-drama of the woman whose 63-year reign Queen Elizabeth II had just overtaken. The decision to concentrate on the youth of a figure known for being old paid off in Jenna Coleman’s sparky performance.2017 –Little Boy BlueView image in fullscreenWhere he showed his genius … Stephen Graham in Little Boy Blue.Photograph: ITVNews-based drama supremo Jeff Pope wrote this gruelling but moving four-parter about the investigation into the gun murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in Liverpool in 2007. As the homicide cop in charge, Stephen Graham gave notice of his genius for hyper-realistic acting.2018 – Gemma Collins: DivaWith audiences fragmenting, networks needed to be a broad church but worshippers of Broadchurch may have regarded as the work of Satan this reality show featuring a vivid influencer which screened on ITVBe, a niche channel for younger women.2019 – Good Morning BritainThe year 2019 was pivotal in British politics with Boris Johnson becoming an unelected PM, then an elected one and pledging to “get Brexit done”. This period was also the television zenith of another PM – Piers Morgan – who, perfectly counterweighted by co-host Susanna Reid, made the breakfast sofa a nervous perch for all authority figures.2020 – The Masked SingerView image in fullscreen‘Take it off! Take it off!’ … The Masked Singer.Photograph: Vincent Dolman/Bandicoot TV/ITV/PAFuture historians will enjoy the fact that just before the UK population was forced into masks by the pandemic, the latest TV hit was based around face-coverings with contestants belting out a number while elaborately disguised as a hedgehog, sausage or dressed crab with the revelation (to audience chants of “Take it off!, Take it off!”), sometimes exposing an impressive level of celebrity.2021 –StephenTwenty-two years earlier, ITV had screened The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, which was excellent but depressing as the racists who killed the 18-year-old schoolboy escaped justice. The sequel told a more rewarding story of the fight by Stephen’s parents, Doreen (Sharlene Whyte) and Neville (Hugh Quarshie) to achieve some convictions, having the luck to find an antiracist cop in the London police force: DCI Clive Driscoll (Steve Coogan).2022 –DI RayView image in fullscreenSleuths on the loose … Parminder Nagra as DI Ray and Peter Bankole as DS Kwesi Edmund.Photograph: Justin Slee/ITVWith storylines and casting unimaginable when ITV began, this very 21st-century police procedural starred Parminder Nagra as senior detective Rachita Ray.2023 –Changing EndsView image in fullscreenSassy … Oliver Savell as Alan in Changing Ends.Photograph: Ollie Upton/ITVAlan Carr’s sassy autobiographical sitcom about the football-phobic, homophile son of the Northampton Town FC manager in the 1980s featured the comedian as onscreen narrator, which underlined the body-snatching uncanniness of Oliver Savell’s perfect performance as the young Alan.2024 –Mr Bates vs the Post OfficeView image in fullscreenThey said it couldn’t be done … Mr Bates vs the Post Office.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockWise voices said it was no longer possible, given competition from global streamers, for UK networks to get vast nightly audiences for a local British story. Wrong: about 10 million tuned in live to Gwyneth Hughes’s four-parter about the subpostmasters who variously took their own lives or went through imprisonment, bankruptcy or divorce after a dodgy Fujitsu computer system falsely implicated them in fraud. Aged 69, ITV could still kick like it used to.2025 –I Fought the LawView image in fullscreenThe perfect birthday gift? … Sheridan Smith as Ann Ming in I Fought the Law.Photograph: Anastasia Arsentyeva/ITVSheridan Smithalready had a distinguished ITV CV – 2012’sMrs Biggs, 2014’sCilla– but even her talent for total emotional and physical immersion in a real person’s life was surpassed as Ann Ming, who, after her daughter’s killer escaped justice on technicalities, successfully campaigned to remove the 800-year-old “double jeopardy” law so that he could be tried again. (This also proved vital in the Stephen Lawrence case.) A performance that should surely win Smith a second Bafta best actress trophy gives ITV a perfect 70th birthday present.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionITVI'm a Celebrity ...Russell T DaviesDavid TennantTV comedyMonty PythonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result left many people in a state of shock and denial, unable to process exactly what went wrong.No one was more shocked thanKamala Harris, whose inner circle had been confident on election night that they’d eked out a win during the whirlwind campaign. Cupcakes with “Madam President” toppings were ready to go; champagne on ice. “It says a lot about how traumatized we both were by what happened that night that [my husband] Doug and I never discussed it with each other until I sat down to write this book,” Harris reveals in her new memoir, which functions as a political postmortem.I don’t know if Harris found writing 107 Days cathartic, but reading it certainly wasn’t. Instead, the book, which unfolds in strictly chronological order, is a frustrating slog. It seems likely to alienate her critics further and provides no closure or hope for her supporters.Harris has always been accused of sounding phoney; criticism she brushes off in the book as sexism. When Charlamagne Tha God, host of popular radio show The Breakfast Club, observed that she came off as “very scripted” on the campaign trail, she retorted that it was actually “discipline”. The memoir was Harris’s opportunity to go off-script. Instead she sticks to her talking points.You can almost feel her teeth grind as she recounts the many mishaps, attributable to Biden, that her campaign was forced to firefightWhich isn’t to say there aren’t some real insights. One of the most compelling sections describes her gloomy birthday celebrations, 16 days before the election. Harris had expected Doug to do something special – she’s a big birthday person – but he was so beaten down from the campaign that he shrugged the day off. The frustrated pair ended up fighting. This is one of the few moments Harris shows the emotional toll of an intense campaign. It humanises her; the book would have benefited from more of this kind of material.There are occasional glimpses of how Harris really feels about Joe Biden; her bitterness at the impossible lot he handed her. You can almost feel her teeth grind as she recounts the many mishaps, attributable to him, that her campaign was forced to firefight. The moment the outgoing president was photographed putting on a “Trump 2024” cap during a 9/11 commemoration event, for example. Or when he seemed to call Trump supporters “garbage”. You sense real anger that he didn’t allow her to shine as vice-president.But while Harris doesn’t refrain from criticising Biden, she doesn’t go full-throttle either, remaining guarded on some of the key questions that still trouble people. There was no “conspiracy at the White House to hide Joe Biden’s infirmity”, she says, insisting “there was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern”. While she admits she had concerns about him, she maintains he was fully competent. Given that CNN’s Jake Tapper, in his bookOriginal Sin, has convincingly detailed Biden’s decline, this feels very hard to believe. What else isn’t she being fully honest about, you wonder?Harris was indisputably put in a very difficult situation when Biden dropped out. But if he had stuck to his promise to be atransitional president, if she’d had more time to campaign – would it have made a difference? Was Harris the right person to fight Trump? Gavin Newsom, the California governor who is a likely Democratic contender for 2028, clearly didn’t think so. After Biden bowed out, Harris started working the phones for endorsements. The notes from her call with Newsom, she writes, just say: “Hiking. Will call back.(He never did.)”And Harris herself seemed to have some initial doubts about her chances. Frazzled, she called her pastor for wisdom at the start of her campaign, and put him on speakerphone as he reassured her inner circle: “He talked about Queen Esther, who saved her people when they were threatened. ‘You were born for a time such as this,’ he said, and I teared up … It grounded us all.” From that point on, Harris insists she was the right woman for the moment.Her own book, however, makes it clear she still has blind spots about what went wrong. While a JanuaryYouGov pollsuggests Biden’s unconditional support for Israel significantly affected Democratic voter turnout, Harris is largely dismissive of Gaza. Of demonstrators who turned up at campaign stops she asks: “Why weren’t they protesting at Trump rallies?” Can she really not understand? Because Trump was not in power at the time, and she was. Because President Biden made it clear he had no real empathy for Palestinians. Harris doesn’t seem to have much, either.It’s not just those upset about Gaza who will bristle at this account. The former vice-president’s characterizations of peers such as Pete Buttigieg (talented but too gay for the America to accept as herrunning mate), and Josh Shapiro (an egoist) are not particularly juicy, but have already causedbad blood. As for any Harris supporters hoping 107 Days might bring closure or optimism, they will also be sorely disappointed. It may be time for the holdouts to finally take those Harris signs down, because the woman who kept telling voters “we’re not going back” fails to chart any kind of path forward for the United States. In the end, she seems just as helpless as the rest of us.107 Days by Kamala Harris is published by Simon & Schuster (£25 in the UK; $30 in the US).

But the times they are a-changing, because leading characters of pensionable age are all over the place nowadays, whether solving crimes inThe Thursday Murder Club; turning the tables on swindlers inThelmaorThe G; wrestling with unreliable memories inThe Fatheror Familiar Touch; or preying on other inmates or staff inThe HomeorThe Rule of Jenny Pen.Not long ago, the screen was monopolised by smooth-skinned teens and twentysomethings, but now it has been infiltrated by creased faces imbued with the sort of personality that can only be accrued over decades of experience and with minimal recourse to cosmetic surgery. And not just as non-player characters but in starring or pivotal roles in the narrative; no longer to be condescended to and patted on the head simply for lasting the course, but as people just like the rest of us. Real people!View image in fullscreenIn her 40s … Beulah Bondi as Lucy Cooper and Victor Moore as Barkley Cooper in Make Way for Tomorrow (1937).Photograph: THA/ShutterstockWhich is not to say older characters are never stereotyped. Recent examples tend to be one of three kinds: feisty, frail or fiendish. Feisties hatch plans, solve murders and fight back against injustice, sometimes with the help of younger relatives who teach them how to use the internet. Frails are on a downward slide into dementia but their condition is treated with sympathy and respect, as is the plight of their relatives and carers. Meanwhile the Fiendish are egomaniacal miscreants who exploit, terrorise or kill. I sometimes wonder if it might be better to be a Fiendish than a Frail, though I would probably incline more towardsMonty Python’s Hell’s Grannies, handbagging pedestrians out of the way, than, yuck, sucking the essence out of young people’s eyeballs.As a woman now in her 70s, I am particularly alert to signs of representation of my generation in the cinema, and naturally I don’t recognise myself in any of these categories. But then, like most people my age I suspect, I don’t see myself as old. I am, though, ever on the lookout for ageing role models. One is forever being wrongfooted by classic Hollywood. It’s a shock to realise Beulah Bondi was still in her 40s when she played old Ma Cooper in Make Way for Tomorrow – of course the Great Depression would have aged people, but this was ridiculous. Gloria Swanson was 50 when she played Norma Desmond inSunset Boulevard, depicted as terminally over the hill – though of course Billy Wilder’s film is itself an acerbic commentary on a film industry that scrapped its figureheads as soon as they were past the first flush of youth.People are now living longer, and there are more of us refusing to be shunted aside. In 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics, 18% of the population of the UK were aged 65 or over. In 2041 this is projected to increase to 26%. More than a quarter! We all like to see ourselves represented in the cinema, proving there are still aspirations, fears and existential crises in the old carcass yet. And our favourite film-makers are getting older alongside us, so it makes sense that more ageing boomers are turning up on screen and actually doing stuff rather than being wheeled on as token grandparents.View image in fullscreenThe puppet master … John Lithgow as Dave Crealy in The Rule of Jenny Pen (2024).Photograph: Stan Alley/IFC Films and ShudderNow that the golden age of the mature female sleuth (Miss Marple, Jessica Fletcher, the Snoop Sisters) has passed, and that Judi Dench has now effectively retired from acting and the late Maggie Smith is no longer able to give her masterclass in withering epithets in Downton Abbey, we are obliged to look elsewhere for our doughty role models.Helen Mirrenshouldn’t be required to shoulder all the burden on her own, as she shuttles between an unusually broad range of pensionable personae: from royalty to military intelligence to KGB agent to assassin to cockney crime matriarch to Barbie narrator. And anyway, who among us would dream of referring to Mirren as “elderly”?Sometimes a smidgeon of Captain Tom-type sentimentality is allowed to creep in to a film, as happens in the otherwise admirably unromanticisedThe Great Escaper, based on real events, in which Michael Caine, egged on by Glenda Jackson in her last film role, absconds from his East Sussex care home to attend D-day commemorations in France. Only rarely are real-world concerns, such as trying to keep warm when your winter fuel payments have been cut, addressed on the big screen, least of all in The Thursday Murder Club, in which the intrepid seniors live in suites in a huge country mansion, a long way from neorealist dispatches such as Umberto D (1952), in which the aged protagonist gets behind with his rent and is kicked out of his digs.The aged are often cast as harbingers of doom. Young gerontophobes, terrified of getting older, see their elders as unattractive, even monstrous, not to mention responsible for having reduced the world to its current parlous state. Hence, perhaps, the zombie-like hordes in the 2022 Spanish horror film The Elderly, in which their lethal aggression seems linked to global warming. In the similarly themed German film Old People, from the same year, pensioners turn savagely on younger folk in what appears to be a worldwide conspiracy. Taking a cue from Spinal Tap’s David St Hubbins, we should probably call this subgenre Night of the Assisted Living Dead. Of course the bloodthirsty oldies are metaphors – symbols of the older generation’s selfishness, or of relatives’ guilt at consigning Grandpa to a care home – but it doesn’t stop you wondering why their young victims don’t just push them over. Because as everyone knows, our bones are brittle, and once we’ve fallen over we can’t get up.View image in fullscreenVeteran rockers … Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean, in Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.Photograph: Kyle Kaplan/APMeanwhile, those of us of a certain age are not just searching for desperately needed laughs but hoping to rekindle the spirits of our younger, sprightlier selves when we reunite with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer (average age 78) as the veteran rockers of Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.There is serious Oscar buzz around 95-year-old June Squibb’s fearless performance inEleanor the Great(Scarlett Johansson’s feature debut), as well as 75-year-old Amy Madigan’s bonkers one inWeapons.More than six decades after the actor himself enlisted in the US Marine Corps, 86-year-old Scott Glenn stars as an ex-soldier in the action thriller Eugene the Marine, which recently premiered at the Oldenburg film festival. Ian McKellen (86) plays a famous artist who goes head-to-head with a forger (Michaela Coel) in The Christophers, a black comedy from Steven Soderbergh. Morgan Freeman (88) is coming up in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. Charlotte Rampling (79) plays a formidable virtuoso in Arnaud Desplechin’s Two Pianos. And Samuel L Jackson (76) shows no sign of slowing down, having made five films last year, with another three coming up. Obviously we should be grateful these skilled veterans are still getting meaty roles instead of being put out to pasture. But might it also be a sign that the younger generation aren’t yet fit to fill their shoes?In any case, the golden agers keep on coming, and they are legion. As one of the characters in Old People says, paraphrasing Leviticus: “Thou shalt honour the old, for they are great in number. And one day you will all be like them.”Explore more on these topicsFilmOlder peopleSpinal TapHelen MirrenMichael CainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it can’t mask the frontman’s brutal honesty. He talks about childhood trauma – and partying with Post MaloneHuw BainesMon 22 Sep 2025 00.01 EDTShareWhen Ian Shelton was growing up in Enumclaw, a small town near Seattle, coming home from school was a constant step into the unknown. “I was living in fear of the next fucked-up experience,” he says. Sitting in a store room above the London venue his band Militarie Gun will later fill with shoutalong aggro-pop energy, the singer is jetlagged but animated as he puts himself back there, his sandy hair peeking from beneath the hood of his sweatshirt. “Twice, my bus pulled up as an ambulance pulled away from our house,” he continues. “There was never a point when you were safe from things getting worse.”Shelton says his childhood was defined by addiction. His mother was a relapsed alcoholic, meaning rehab, AA meetings and spells in jail. Often, it fell to him to look out for his younger siblings. “There was a huge question mark over what every day would bring,” he says. This feeling created an anxiety that Shelton thrashed out at hardcore shows, having been sucked in by Bay Area greats Ceremony as a 15-year-old. He began to write his own kitchen-sink compositions, too. “That fear needs a release,” he says. “I found music. I wrote a song that was just my mom’s name. At the time, there was a domestic violence incident and a restraining order – and I channelled my anger into a diss track.”It’s 4am and Post Malone’s just handed me a Bud LightShelton started out in straight edge youth crew bands, but his compulsion to create grew into hardcore projects that showed formal daring and lyrical brutality, from the iPhone-recorded screeds of S.W.A.T. to the searing power-violence of Regional Justice Center, named after the facility that housed his brother, Max, following his arrest on drug-related assault charges.Against this backdrop, the melodic, crossover-ready indie-punk of Militarie Gun’s new record God Save the Gun is a change of pace. And yet its meticulously sculpted refrains can’t mask Shelton’s in-your-face candour. “Things you’ll never remember, I’ll never get to forget,” he barks on God Owes Me Money, a gritty anthem about making his trauma work for him.But then you listen to B A D I D E A, which opens with the words: “I’ve been slipping up.” You realise Shelton’s sights aren’t trained on his family. In a grimly ironic twist, they’re actually trained on the puffy-eyed, sloppy alcoholic he became after the success of Militarie Gun’s 2023 debut Life Under the Gun. “The finger has to be pointed at me,” he says. “The things you’ll never remember, things I’ll never forget? There are people I’ve hurt who feel the same.”Shelton formed Militarie Gun in Los Angeles in 2020, playing every instrument on their noisy, hooky first EP. As soon as the pandemic allowed, he started touring relentlessly, with a rotating lineup cohering around guitarists William Acuña and Kevin Kiley, bassist Waylon Trim and drummer David Stalsworth.Further EPs followed, on Denver hardcore institution Convulse and Seattle’s Alternatives Label, but then Militarie Gun signed with Loma Vista, home to Iggy Pop and Sleater-Kinney; and to Jay-Z’s Roc Nation management company. When their single Do It Faster featured in a Taco Bell advert, it was heard by rapper Post Malone, who the band partied with after his show at the Louvre in 2024. “I felt like I was inAlmost Famous,” says Kiley. “It’s 4am and Post Malone’s just handed me a Bud Light.” Shelton adds: “I’ve had a lot of those experiences and it’s fun bringing people into that chaos. Like, ‘Isn’t this fuckingweird?’”Having sworn off drinking for most of his life, the anxiety-stricken boy that was still inside Shelton in his 30s found it a welcome lubricant in room after room full of strangers. “I was more outgoing,” he says. “It helped me be present. I was more comfortable on camera – I could be a guy in a band trying to sell a record.”Having seen so much during his youth, he couldn’t reconcile any of this with what he thought rock bottom looked like. Instead, his own words tipped him off. When he played a demo of the Wonderwall-adjacent Daydream to his ex, he noticed he’d mumbled its second verse. “Been drunk every day for a month,” ran one of its lines. “I didn’t think to change the lyrics,” he says. “But I made them harder to hear. So there would be no questions.”Shelton is now six months sober. God Save the Gun isn’t a recovery record, but it makes it impossible to view his about-face outside the context of his upbringing – the kid who held it together for his family, now holding it together for his band. “I don’t have the ability to moderate,” he says. “Alcohol is one of the only things that made me feel normal, but I disappointed people. That’s a place I wasn’t willing to go.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It felt like the world had gone a bit mad, that we lost a moral compass, that a layer of humanity was being stripped away by what was happening here.”Tennant is one of more than 1,600 people who has settled out of court with the publishers of the now defunct News of the World over the phone-hacking scandal, which closed Britain’s biggest-selling Sunday newspaper and shone a light on the cosy relationships between some parts of the media, government and police in the UK. He is cautious when talking about his experience. “I get very confused as to what I am legally allowed to talk about,” he admits.View image in fullscreenWhistleblower … Tennant plays journalist Nick Davies.Photograph: ITVIt was all quite some time ago, too. The drip-drip of stories in the Guardian about illegal news gathering by Rupert Murdoch’s tabloid; the collapse of the “rogue reporter” defence that sought to pin the blame for wrongdoing on the News of the World’s royal editor, Clive Goodman; the public revulsion about the hacking of the phone of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler; the trial of Rebekah Brooks (cleared and still head of Murdoch’s papers in the UK) and Andy Coulson (jailed after being forced to resign as both editor of the News of the World and, later, as David Cameron’s spin chief).The News of the World closed in 2011, with Murdoch apologising to a parliamentary committee – “the most humble day of my life”, the media mogul said. The Crown Prosecution Service shuttered its investigation in 2015 and Tennant received his apology and payout three years later. An old story, then.And yet it isn’t, say Tennant and Jack Thorne, the scriptwriter who, along with Stephen Graham, won an Emmy last week for the Netflix hitAdolescence.View image in fullscreen‘We’re in a world where so much harm is happening and it’s our job to engage’ … screenwriter Jack Thorne.Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images for BFITennant and Thorne are talking via video-call (Tennant is filming the second season of Rivals “in the middle of a field, God knows where”) to promote The Hack, their new ITV drama series.It follows the saga through the eyes of Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter who pursued the story and Dave Cook, the police detective who investigated the axe murder of the private investigatorDaniel Morgan. Figures associated with the News of the World were allegedly involved in attempts to interfere in the police investigation. Tennant plays Davies and Robert Carlyle, best known for playing Begbie in Trainspotting, takes on the role of Det Ch Supt Cook.Thorne, 46, says he did not initially think there was something interesting to be told about “a group of journalists behaving badly that got found out”.It was only as he read into it more that Thorne realised it was “something that involved a lot more groups of people, at least after it came out”.“How that worked, in terms of that relationship between politics, the police and the media, is really, really interesting,” he says. “And that thing of celebrating journalism that was brave enough to stand up to its own industry – which is not something I’d be capable of in my industry – was fascinating to me.”View image in fullscreenRichard Pepple as DI Graham Twyler in The Hack.Photograph: ITVHe adds: “It’s not about these powerful bodies – the press, the police and politics – conspiring together. I think there was a complacency, more than that.“There was a complacency in the journalism, and then there was a complacency in the way those other bodies looked at that journalism.“They said, ‘OK, this is how much we understand, and this is how much we choose to understand. And, because we’ve got our own things going on, we’re going to keep on that path’.”The scandal is key to understanding how we ended up where we are today, he says. It was a kind of “destruction of journalism” – or, at least, the model in which the so-called legacy media were able to assume a certain level of trust among the public.It is also an unfinished story, say Thorne and Tennant.The fallout led to a public inquiry chaired by Sir Brian Leveson that looked at the culture, practices and ethics of the British press.There was supposed to be a second part that would have examined the relationship between journalists and the police, including criminality and corruption. The Conservative government stopped it in its tracks. Keir Starmer appears equally uninterested.“We only heard half of it,” says Thorne. “And Leveson should have been given the ability to go back in and look at criminality in particular, which could have led to a whole number of different conclusions, which would have maybe changed the media landscape for the better.”Tennant, 54, adds: “I don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t still happen. I think it was inconvenient. I think the first one cost five and a half million, which is a lot of money, but it’s the sort of money they bat around quite freely in other circumstances.“So I don’t think that’s a convincing or compelling argument to why it didn’t happen. I don’t know what pressure was exerted where, but I certainly feel that the government, at the time, felt it was inconvenient, and that was a tragedy. I don’t know why the government now is continuing to ignore it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tennant agrees.View image in fullscreenFamiliar face … Toby Jones as Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ITVThe drama makes much of the fears of the victims of phone hacking to put their heads above the parapet and challenge the News of the World.Tennant says it was not a difficult decision for him to get involved in the dramatisation of a most acutely painful period for Murdoch and his chief lieutenants.“Maybe I was foolhardy, and maybe I’ll come to regret that, but I think we’re being very fair,” says Tennant, who has been criticised in the pages of the Sun for some of his comments in support of the rights of people in the transgender community. “We’re being pretty objective, I think. It’s been told from Nick’s point of view, and clearly Nick had a particular agenda, but neither do we paint Nick as someone who got it all right, necessarily.”He adds: “I just knew I wanted to tell the story. It wasn’t something that I spent a lot of time worrying about.”As a victim of hacking, Tennant believes he was ideally placed to empathise with Davies’s disbelief that the authorities, and the rest of the British media colloquially known as Fleet Street, were willing to turn a blind eye to what was going on.“I felt it was very easy to plug into that sense of moral bewilderment over what is happening, and that people are getting away with this,” says Tennant. “And indeed, you know, Nick’s tenacity that he stuck with this story, while the rest of the world couldn’t seem to get annoyed.“His sense of moral outrage was so great, and he knew that this was awful, and yet the rest of the world didn’t seem to catch up.“It’s an oversimplification but also a truth to say that it took the gross violation of Milly Dowler’s phone to really make the world suddenly go, ‘Oh, hang on. This is an awful thing to do to people. This is stealing people’s privacy. This is awful and wrong. And hang on a minute. We should have been shouting about this earlier.’”The real events behind The Hack: a timeline of scandal, cover-ups and collapseRead moreBoth Thorne and Tennant are big consumers of news. Tennant, an occasional buyer of a physical newspaper, says he tries to start the day with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Both men pay subscriptions to news websites.Thorne says he finds it “immensely troubling” that truth is now so contested in Britain. He describes it as a “refusal of fact”.“My dad has bought a copy of the Guardian every day since 1962 so he’s a die hard,” says Thorne. “I’m a subscriber to the Times, Telegraph, Guardian.

The Faloduns at the centre of Cursed Daughters share tales of heartbroken women across the generations who just can’t seem to hold on to a man. There’s Fikayo, whose husband left after he tired of tending to her chronic illness; Afoke, who seduced her younger sister’s boyfriend; Feranmi, the matriarch of the family, who got pregnant by a married man and received the curse from the man’s first wife. Again and again, the narrative is interrupted by these tales about grandmothers and great-great-grandmothers; eventually, it feels almost as if the novel is haunted by the stories themselves.Nigerian-British novelist Oyinkan Braithwaite splashed on to the literary scene in 2018 withMy Sister, the Serial Killer, a taut debut about sisterhood, jealousy and murder. Cursed Daughters, her second novel, swaps true crime for a more atmospheric spookiness, but it shares a lingering fascination with the dark secrets that might bind the women of a family together. The Falodun curse forms an ominous, ever-hovering presence for the three main characters – Monife, Ebun and Eniiyi – as they grow up, fall in love, and attempt to defy the supernatural forces that seem to hold their family in thrall.In 1994, 19-year-old Monife meets gentle, light-skinned Kalu, whom she nicknames Golden Boy. He’s the perfect man, she believes, to break the curse. “There was not a single shred of doubt in her mind that they would be together for ever,” she thinks at one point, in a moment of dramatic irony. We know their relationship doesn’t end well: the novel begins in 2000, as Monife drowns herself at a beach. Monife and Kalu’s love story unfolds throughout the novel with an inexorability that eventually becomes a tad predictable, especially when we meet Kalu’s rich, beautiful and cruel mother.Paranormal trappings aside, the true family curse may just be these women’s inability to reckon with their pastMonife’s death casts an eerie shadow over the lives of the other two protagonists. Monife’s cousin Ebun gives birth to a daughter on the day of Monife’s funeral – a daughter whom, she notes with growing unease as the years pass, looks and acts exactly like Monife. Twenty-four years later, that daughter, Eniiyi, falls in love with Zubby, a light-skinned boy she rescues from drowning. Their connection – instant, visceral – feels otherworldly, and Eniiyi begins to have strange visions of Monife, uncanny intrusions that force her to reckon with the notion that she may be a reincarnation of her dead aunt.Braithwaite braids these three women’s stories into a narrative that unfolds gracefully even as it leaps backwards and forwards in time. But despite the novel’s decades-spanning scope, its story feels oddly static, even claustrophobic. Cursed Daughters spends much of its time establishing the preternatural similarities between Monife and Eniiyi – the same-shaped scars on their thighs, the same relationship dynamics with their (very similar) boyfriends, the same recurring image of a black bird of prey. But all these details seem to signify, with little variation, is that the family is, well, cursed. Elsewhere, one finds a similar heavy-handedness. “What if the trauma of losing the love, stability and social standing that came with marriage had left epigenetic markers on generation after generation of the Falodun women?” wonders Eniiyi, who happens to be an aspiring genetic counsellor.But Eniiyi’s musings do gesture at a meaningful idea: paranormal trappings aside, the true family curse may just be the Falodun women’s inability to reckon with their past. After Monife dies, her room is kept just as she left it – except for the water damage that seeps through the ceiling and warps the door and walls, an evocative symbol of unprocessed grief. One sees lingering family trauma in the way Monife’s mother can’t let go of her ex-husband – she resorts to arcane rituals in an attempt to lure him back – and in the way Monife overreacts to being left alone at a party by Kalu. “How could he understand how easy it was for a person who purported to love you to abandon you?” she thinks, reminded of her father’s sudden withdrawal. It’s these emotional responses, these ways one learns to love, that also form a family’s inheritance – a resonant truth that deserves more development in this novel about intergenerational pain.Cursed Daughters by Oyinkan Braithwaite is published by Atlantic (£18.99).

Both the death of Christine McVie in 2022 and Lindsey Buckingham’s earlier firing, in 2018, were assumed to have made any reunion impossible.“Without Christine, no can do,” Stevie Nicks told Mojo last year. “There is no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac back together in any way. Without her, it just couldn’t work.”She added that Buckingham’s health,after emergency open-heart surgery in 2019, would preclude him from “the kind of touring that Fleetwood Mac does”, going out for 18-month stints, “even if I thought I could work with Lindsey again”.The Mail reported that Rowling is planning a two-day celebration for her 60th with a James Bond theme. Blondie previously played at a party thrown by the author in 2017.Despite there being little chance of a full Fleetwood Mac reunion, it does appear there has been a rapprochement between Buckingham and his former bandmates. He and Mick Fleetwood play on a new single by Miley Cyrus, Secrets, released last week.And he has participated in a teaser campaign for a new reissue of Buckingham Nicks, the sole duo album he and his original bandmate made prior to joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975, sharing joint Instagram posts riffing on the release.Apple is producing a new documentary on Fleetwood Mac, the first to be authorised by the band. Directed by Frank Marshall, who also made the Bee Gees film How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, it will feature new interviews with the surviving members.Rowling’s most recent book is The Hallmarked Man, the latest under her Robert Galbraith pen name.Explore more on these topicsFleetwood MacPop and rockJK RowlingnewsShareReuse this content"

They include Season’s Greetings, in which a little boy plays while breathing polluted smoke. It had appeared on the side of an unassuming garage near the Port Talbot steelworks in 2018. Brandler purchased it from the garage owner. Weighing 5.5 tonnes, it is 2.2 metres high and 2.5 metres wide.The other murals are Heart Boy, in which a little boy paints a large pink heart, and Computer Robot, which depicts a child with a robot.Brandler understands that they were displayed in an exhibition seen inItalyand Switzerland and he has been seeking the final loan payment as well as the murals’ return.He said that an initial two-year contract was extended for a year with a monthly loan fee: “Within a few months, they were late paying the loan fee and they got to the stage where they were always about six weeks behind paying the loan fee. They’re now four months behind on the last payment. The show finished on 6 June … I still don’t have the final payment [and] I haven’t got my Banksys back.”Brandler doubts their assurances that he will be paid because another London dealer and leading Banksy specialist, Acoris Andipa, claims the Italian company owes him £45,000 for curatorial services and that, despite repeated assurances from them, he has been chasing them for over two years. Andipa told the Guardian: “I don’t know what we can do. I’ve had my lawyers on them.”Brandler said he had contacted the Italian embassy and the insurance company, Lloyd’s of London, to put in a claim. In a statement, Pietro Folena and Vittorio Faustini of Metamorfosi said: “Metamorfosi is a well-established and prestigious company that organises major exhibitions in Italy and around the world in collaboration with and with the support of leading museums.”They argued that, over the past three years, they had “always paid the monthly instalments”, apart from the last one as they said they were awaiting invoices and tax documentation.They said that they had tried repeatedly to return the murals, beginning on 3 June – three days before the exhibition closed – when they asked Brandler for the relevant address.They have an email, dated 5 June, in which Brandler acknowledged storage problems and proposed that they keep them until October at no additional cost. When asked about the email, Brandler highlighted that he was still owed the last payment relating to the murals’ display.Metamorfosi said: “This shows that Metamorfosi immediately initiated the procedures for returning the works …“We also confirm to you that we are organising the return and that it will take place by the end of September … In [an] email of 29 August, Mr Brandler states that he will not accept delivery of the walls unless he receives payment. This, as you understand, further strengthens our position …“As for matters relating to our dealings with Mr Acoris Andipa, these are commercial matters that have no bearing on the issue raised.”Explore more on these topicsBanksyItalyEuropeArtnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the US government, not your neighbours, not someone on social media. It is the government doing it now.”“And that’s where we all have to come together, because authoritarian regimes, fascist regimes have to degrade our freedoms more and more over time until we’re living the smallest, the most frightened, the most secretive lives.

This complexity isn’t mainly literary; it loops back to the dilemmas and survival mechanisms of an assertively independent life.Malmude was born in Manhattan in 1940 to parents of Ukrainian Jewish and German Lutheran extraction. He studied engineering at Queens College, but, against his father’s advice, switched to English and classics after one semester. Poetry became a serious passion. After graduating, he worked as a carpenter in the Bronx. His education in practical poetics, to coin a useful phrase, forged ahead at the Poetry Project at St Mark’s Church in Manhattan, where he met, among others, the poetLarry Fagin. Fagin published Malmude’s first book, Catting, in 1972, in the distinguished and well-namedAdventures in Poetryimprint.Having produced two further collections, Malmude relocated in 2002 to Limerick, Maine. This would appear to be the setting of Red Carpet’s title-poem, my choice fromMiles Champion’s eloquent arrangement of work composed by Malmude between 1958 and 2023.Red Carpet is a love poem, perhaps a love song, both skittish and serious. It plays with simple-seeming devices, the list and the refrain, and is structured in a form Malmude has made his own, the unpunctuated quatrain. These decisive shapes, however, contain a mass of uncertainties. The speaker is cautious: he looks, listens, guesses, an outsider to the blessing, he suspects.The quatrain structure and the brevity of each line give the refrain (“caused me / to believe / I was her first / true love”) ample space to express hesitation. This helps the list of reasons arouse readers’ own speculations. The shy delicacy of “looking into / her ways / then averting / my gaze” may be true to life, but how, if the narrator is in earnest, does “the story / of women laughing / as a boy / listens in” lead him, even if he is the boy, to assume himself to be “her first / true love”?The questions around the story being told and the evidence being gathered intensify. We sense the pressure to tell, and to withdraw from telling, when the inter-refrain narrative occupies two quatrains instead of one: (“the illusion / of looking in on / a concealed / world // the story / of women laughing / as a boy / listens in”). Those two stanzas (five and six) increase the suspicion I’ve felt from the beginning – that the loving woman might be the speaker’s mother. I don’t think the question is answered, but it becomes unimportant, even trivial.Malmude is a master of lineation. In stanza 11, “I am not / absolute / she compares / me to others …”, the sentence-refit of “me to others” suggests pained recognition of not always coming well out of the cramped comparison. But the poem by now is rebuilding uncertainty into confidence. It has moved on from doubt to “a feeling / of mystic superiority”, and these lines (stanza 12) mark a kind ofvolta. The turn is a redirection towards the self-confidence of the unconditionally loved – which might even carry them through intimations of being loved only on conditions. The inter-refrain “narrative” now stretches over five stanzas (11-15) and introduces a chorus of corroborations – “so do I” and “so do we” being the charmingly book-ended lines of stanza 13.After the funny-sorrowful image of the leaf “falling off” comes a harsher scene which may suggest the drowning and decimation of the Indigenous population around Lake Sokokis, near Malmude’s home in Limerick, and may revise the celebratory “red carpet” into a history-bloodied river. The line-breaks again are notable: “Canoeing / into / a whirlpool / of the motionless // caused me / to believe / I was her first / true love …” Time seems to stop, and death and love coalesce while the canoe is still whirling.One last quatrain takes up the story, and the narrator is finally anchored. But where? The “deep happiness” that is “turned inside out” may be at risk of evaporation. Or it may declare itself and be carpentered into the glory of the captured moment.Reading Malmude’s collection is a joyous experience. In every poem the solidity of craft amounts to more than formalism: it’s a matter of unfeigned, compressed creative energy that teases or argues outright with form and sentence-level sense. The poems are complex, yet they take the influences of theNew York SchoolandLanguage poetryand blend them without setting up class barriers or courting difficulty for difficulty’s sake. The voice has its own self-trained body: it doesn’t join in with the in-talk of any in-crowd. Perhaps that’s why the poems have evaded various lit-crit filters. What matters now is that they’re widely and attentively read.Two poems from Red Carpet are introduced by Miles Champion and read by Steve Malmudehere.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It marks his first film as a director since 2019’s The Lion King. His credits also include Iron Man, Elf and Chef.He hasrecentlyspoken about the film’s theme of parenting and how he hopes it will resonate with fans. “As Star Wars fans who are my age, who grew up with the original films, grow up and have kids of their own, I think it’s nice that there’s a hero that is going through what they’re going through,” he said. “Just like when they were young they [could] relate to Luke Skywalker, now they can relate to Mando.”The Mandalorian and Grogu is set to be released in May 2026, a summer which will also see the release of Supergirl, Toy Story 5,Scary Movie 6, Minions 3 andSpider-Man: Brand New Day.The release of the trailer follows theunveiling of the first imagefrom Star Wars: Starfighter, another new movie currently in production.

What we’ve really enjoyed about the streaming space is we’ve been able to experiment. It’s harder to do that in the movie space. And now I think that that’s why it feels so good to be able to move into a Mandalorian movie as we’re coming off of three seasons of a very successful show. We’ve actually built an audience for that, and we gave the young audience an opportunity to enter Star Wars at a different place and not feel like you have to have seen everything. It can become their Star Wars. And that, I think, is the fun storytelling challenge.”Explore more on these topicsStar WarsPedro PascalJeremy Allen WhiteSigourney WeaverScience fiction and fantasy filmsThe MandalorianDisney+newsShareReuse this content"

Shot in lyrical black and white, Stéphanie Barbey and Luc Peter’s documentary astutely conveys these feelings of anxiety and isolation. The film centres onthe so-called Dreamers, migrants who were brought to the US as children without papers. Carlos, the main subject, is one such case: originally from Mexico, he crossed the border at the age of nine with his three brothers and his parents. Now in his late 30s, Carlos has spent all of his adult life in America, yet there is no legal pathway for him to citizenship.A tragedy looms large. Jorge, one of Carlos’s siblings, was deported to Mexico after a minor driving offence, leaving behind his partner and his son. The enforced separation haunts every intimate gathering; scenes of festivities are intercut with Carlos’s various phone calls to Jorge, emotional conversations punctuated with loaded pauses and lulls. Not only has this family been torn apart, but those who remain in the US are also on unsteady ground. Fears of arrest, detention and deportation are always at the back of Carlos’s mind, rendering ordinary day-to-day activities mentally taxing.The city ofChicagoemerges as a central character in the film. The camera glides through the metropolis, taking in the towering skyscrapers and overpasses, as well as the multiculturalism embedded in the urban landscape. This emphasis on space further drives home the paradox of existing in America as someone whose movements are severely restricted; for the undocumented, there are no open roads. Carlos might be surrounded by indicators of wealth and prosperity, to which he contributes as a tax-paying resident, yet he himself is not free.Dreamers is onTrue Storyfrom 26 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMigrationChicagoDream ActreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hernandez plays Carrie, a version of herself, opposite deadpan cameos from various microbudget directors.In the fictional part of the film, Carrie’s father has died; he was a quack doctor who attempted to market an alternative healing machine as part of a pyramid-selling scam, but who also had many friends and followers who were bowled over by his charm. The lawyer executing his will tells Carrie there won’t be any money left after all her dad’s debts are paid, but she does inherit the rights to the healing machine, and there is even a prototype in a safety deposit box for her to try out.Over and above this, there is a factual level to the film: Hernandez’s real-life father, Dr John Hernandez, was in actuality an alternative medicine evangelist who achieved a certain amount of fame on local TV. Does Carrie in her grief – or Hernandez in hers – want to somehow overturn her natural suspicion about her dad’s apparent delusions or even charlatanism? Is this film the way to do it? A way to keep faith with her grief by somehow believing her dad’s views?Carrie’s various conversations with people connected to her father are quietly bizarre. Film directorJoe Swanbergplays an engineer who had a contract to manufacture the machine; film-maker James N Kienitz Wilkins plays the lawyer, while a dope-smoking enthusiast who wants to buy the patent off Carrie is played by cult writer Caveh Zahedi, creator of YouTube series The Show About the Show.In its deadpan indie realism, Invention is a little like something by Shane Carruth, creator of the time-machine mysteryPrimer– although Carruth might have wanted to make the machine actually work.Invention is at the ICA, London, from 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

As this is the 28th film instalment (eat your heart out 007) of the bestselling manga centred on a crack sleuth forced to inhabit a child’s body, you will need to be some kind of precocious genius yourself to hack an intelligible path through the thicket of characters and byzantine skulduggery served up here.Retired Tokyo cop Kogoro (voiced by Rikiya Koyama) witnesses a former colleague murdered at their rendezvous point, and he heads up to Nagano to follow up on the dead man’s investigation. It seems the helmeted assassin was trying to suppress information related to an assault in the mountains 10 months earlier, as local policeman Yamato (Yuji Takada) was pursuing an armed-robbery suspect before being shot by a third party. The Nagano police reluctantly accommodate Kogoro nosing around, but he forbids young Conan (Minami Takayama) from lending his considerable talents. The pint-sized Poirot manages to get on the scene anyway under the pretext of a visit to a nearby radio observatory.The intrigue often takes place in several layers, with Conan eavesdropping on Kogoro and the unfolding manhunt through a pair of AR glasses, as he simultaneously milks his police contact (for some reason masquerading as a waiter) for information. Add in the PSB also bugging the mini-Maigret, the vengeful father of a suicidal biathlete and the subtleties of Japanese plea-deal policy and, unless you’re a Detective Conan initiate, you will be thoroughly lost.Director Katsuya Shigehara, making his debut in the series, doesn’t so much tease out the suspense of the investigation, as dump it in avalanches of exposition as overwhelming as the ones the suspect uses to cover his tracks. But somehow this blend of hardcore procedural and Scooby-Doo amateur sleuthing gets by on sheer energy alone, rolling up different-toned vignettes – noirish requiem, heavenly hallucinations, AstroBoy-type action sequences, educational segments – in anime’s unmistakeable style. The beautiful credits sequence, dashing around a hyper-real crystalline snowscape, caps off this instalment’s jazzy panache.Detective Conan: One-Eyed Flashback is in UK and Irish cinemas from 26 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeMangaCrime filmsJapanScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like other film-makers inspired by this indie classic, Liam Calvert regrettably falls into the trap of focusing solely on the all-in-one-night conceit at the expense of other narrative components with his directorial debut.A Night Like This follows Lukas and Oliver, two strangers who share a nocturnal adventure on Christmas Eve inLondon. Each is saddled with his own demons. Lukas (Jack Brett Anderson), a gay man from Germany, struggles with his acting career, while Oliver (Alexander Lincoln) juggles singing aspirations and a failing nightclub. Such life baggage ought to be the glue that binds these two lost souls together but this attempt at intimacy is built primarily through stilted, expository dialogue, riddled with cliches about failures and familial traumas.The visuals are similarly uninspired, with the many lengthy conversations between Lukas and Calvert unfolding primarily in dully functional repetitive shot/reverse shots. The lack of depth in the writing is reflected in the flat lighting as well, rendering indoor compositions oddly uncinematic. Moreover, as they encounter various characters – a lounge bar owner, a homeless teenager – you can’t help but notice the dominating whiteness of the casting which, for a film that prioritises queer experience, feels like a glaring misstep, considering how diverse London really is. Nor does it help how the city has been photographed, largely in wide shots that resemble touristy postcards. Having said this, emotional sparks occasionally do fly between Lincoln and Anderson, but their on-screen rapport is sadly not enough to temper the largely inert film-making on display.A Night Like This is in UK cinemas from 26 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsDrama filmsLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

The pair talk about an urgent, explosive showMon 22 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 07.49 EDTShareIn the late 1980s, fresh from being kicked out of school,Sleaford Modsfrontman Jason Williamson dreamed of becoming an actor. He was looking for a way to escape the narrow-minded confines of his home town, Grantham – and treading the boards seemed like the best possible way.“Essentially I just wanted to be famous,” he says now, “but then I started to fall in love with the process of it all.”Williamson had always enjoyed “shouting about” in school productions and Christmas plays, “but obviously the schools I went to didn’t really concentrate on that sort of stuff”. His dad told him that applying for theatre studies at Grantham College “wasn’t really the thing you do” so he found himself working in a chicken factory instead. After eventually returning to school to study drama up to A-level, Williamson began applying to various acting schools. The string of rejections that followed left him feeling “broken”.Yet almost 40 years on – and over a decade since Williamson did find fame through Sleaford Mods – his stage dreams are set to be realised. Williamson will be appearing inEdgecity: Monologues from the Streetat Newcastle’s Live theatre this month. “There’s no rehearsing,” says Williamson. “I’m just going on stage each night and reading from paper, which should be interesting.”Is he feeling nervous?“I will be on the night,” he admits. Williamson has done a little bit of screen acting in recent years, with cameos in Landscapers and Peaky Blinders, but this is different. “I worry about my eyes. I can’t read stuff that’s right in front of me so I’ll probably trip over something. That might add to it, though.”View image in fullscreen‘It didn’t have to make sense – words kept us going’ … gobscure.Photograph: BishIt should help that the pieces Williamson will be performing are not wildly different to the lyrics he spits out for Sleaford Mods. They’ve been written bygobscure, an outsider poet and playwright from the north-east of England whose experiences of being homeless, disabled and sectioned inform all six of Edgecity’s monologues. The three selected for Williamson to perform are mini-explosions of fragmentary language – full of vivid imagery, historical references, non sequiturs and amusing wordplay. As one section of Die Like Chekhov reads: “a minister for death metal to be appointed and given responsibility for playlists in westminster dining rooms / national no poetry day, silent film of poet laureate picking litter on the m62 / child seeing any adult wearing a tie gets to cut it off ... carefully.”“It’s full of a kind of nonsense, but without it being nonsense,” says Williamson. “There are lines like ‘lily white spray across glass’ which perfectly describes a sign outside a model agency. And I love that the UK is pronounced ‘yuck’. Lots of stuff really rang true. There’s a desperation in it and a hopelessness that really reminded me of early Sleafords. If anything it’s a lot darker.”Williamson was once labelled “the bard of broken Britain” for his lyrics, which captured the disillusioned national mood during peak Tory austerity years. (Their track Jobseeker contained the winning line: “So, Mr Williamson, what have you done in order to find gainful employment since your last signing-on date?’ ‘Fuck all, I sat around the house wanking.’”) It’s a label that could be applied to gobscure, too, whose work addresses the bureaucracy, hypocrisy and short-termism that has plagued Britain over the previous decades.The playwright, who is in their late 50s, describes their fragmentary style as “broken word” – although the three pieces not being performed by Williamson have stronger narrative threads.Cocoonfollows a homeless narrator as they break into a library to sleep upon a pillow of literature, whereasYu Cant Start Revolutions Sitting on Yr Arseis full of scenarios taken from gobscure’s own life during periods of homelessness, such as the time they were refused assistance because they were wearing “designer” shoes. “I had this one pair of shoes, which I had bought for a tenner down in Leeds market,” says gobscure. “They were completely knackered but the social worker interviewing us fixated on them. They decided that because we had these shoes, we weren’t eligible for help. The result of not getting that help was that a lot of bad stuff happened to us, which ended up costing the state a fortune.”gobscure, who often uses plural pronouns to reflect their “broken mind”, has spent time in psychiatric hospitals (the Edgecity script refers to it frequently as “sick-chiatry”) – and blames the enforced medication regime in such places for a plethora of health issues. “How long have you got? We’ve had heart attacks, I can’t process oxygen properly, the long term consequence is basically that our health isfucked.”One thing striking about the Edgecity script is the importance placed on literature – there are references to Chekhov’s Sakhalin Island, Virginia Woolf’s Orlando and Dickens’ Bleak House. gobscure recalls a story from 20 years ago, in which they’d been sectioned and then discharged to the street. “We went to a homeless hostel, with a broken arm in a sling, and the so-called support worker there actually said to us: ‘What do you need books for? You’re homeless.’”View image in fullscreenSleaford Mods on stage in Glasgow in 2023.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The ObserverThese pieces might dream big, but they certainly don’t shy away from the grimmer realities of homelessness; in Yu Cant Start Revolutions Sitting on Yr Arse, one passage deals with the hassle of needing the toilet with no fixed abode (“used to crap in carrier-bags in our garage tie the shit/e tight inside another carrier. a third in summer”). “It’s a very real thing,” says gobscure. “I know plastic is evil. Unfortunately, if you are homeless, plastic is incredibly useful. And those cheap flimsy biodegradable bags … you want sturdy ones, you know?”Was it hard to write while under the pressures of homelessness? “No, no, no, no … that was the easiest thing in the world. It’s just having a pen, or a knackered mini-disc recorder that someone was throwing out. It was just little notes or scraps. And, you know, sometimes we couldn’t understand what we were saying. But it didn’t have to make sense. Words was the thing that kept us going. It was everything else that was hard.”Williamson experienced his own brush with homelessness when he was younger – “only for three or four months sofa surfing, that was as close as I got,” he says, “but it got quite tight, it was horrible, a nightmare to be honest.”These days he volunteers atthe Friaryin West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, a charity aiming to end homelessness locally, although he says direct experience isn’t really what drew him to the script. “I’m more drawn to the idea of anyone that just bleeds on to paper,” he says. “I love this kind of first-hand stuff. You can tell straight away that it’s original and it’s real.”gobscure has spent a life writing, but it’s only in the last few years that their work has gained serious recognition, thanks in no small part to an artist’s residency at Live, which is one of the few theatres in England outside of London that focuses purely on new work. Live’s artistic director Jack McNamara says that gobscure is “one of the most genuinely radical north-east writers I have come across”.I get a good example of their creative process right at the end of the interview, when gobscure pulls out a piece of tape that says “fragile” on it. Through a series of folds in the word, they transform the meaning: from “fragile” to “agile” and then to a snippet of French (“le”). Finally, gobscure lands on “frag” – fragging being a term used to describe blowing up a fellow soldier or commander with a fragmentation grenade.“I’m not advocating violence,” they say. “It’s just showing that language is alive. It’s not nailed down. It keeps mutating and changing. So break the binaries!”Edgecity: Monologues from the Street is at Live theatre, Newcastle, 25-27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStagePolitical theatreSleaford ModsTheatreNewcastleLive theatre, NewcastleSpoken wordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the wake of the UK’s largest ever far-right rally, as the St George’s cross increasingly becomes a racist dog-whistle, this depressingly timely production is a rallying cry against unquestioned nationalism. A theatrical vendetta against Shakespeare’s Henry V, English Kings Killing Foreigners is a scrappy, headstrong two-hander interrogating theatre’s role in politics and protest. “All the flags,” Nina Bowers waves her hands, “isn’t it a bit National Front?”Shakespeare’s propagandistic history play has come to symbolise a bastion of English heroism, with the plucky “warlike Harry” mightily defeating the French. But as Bowers and Philip Arditti point out through energetic debates and playful sketches, the 1599 play champions colonialism, imperialism and extreme anti-foreign sentiment. This isn’t a new idea, with several productions, such asHeadlong’s remarkable 2022 rendition, engaging with the texts’ extreme xenophobia. But hurling Shakespeare’s band of brothers into the centre of their set-less stage, Bowers and Arditti claw passionately at the text, tearing it apart and asking whether there’s any acceptable way they can piece it back together.How huge London far-right march lifted the lid on a toxic transatlantic soupRead moreStarting at Camden People’s theatre last year, this show was created in response to the two Globe Ensemble actors’ experiences of performing Henry V. With smatterings of wittily toe-curling audience interaction, they unpick the text through a new, imagined production. They play heightened versions of themselves, with Arditti as a Shakespeare fanatic, while Bowers finds the Bard boring. When their show’s lead kicks the bucket, they’re both up for the role. What does it mean to cast a non-English actor as the king? A mixed-race actor? A queer woman? Does anything change if the performer’s identity has no impact on the rest of the story being told?Frequently very funny and at times deliberately uncomfortable, this is a smart, clear-eyed debate. Dramatically reserved until the final act, its pulse really starts to race as the show moves from telling us of the play’s harm to making us feel it. Switching out the context of the chorus’ prologue to the second act, where “All the youth of England are on fire,” they suddenly illuminate the words’ violence anew. In prompting us to reimagine this 400-year-old play, the pair ask what responsibility a theatre has in the shows it stages, wondering if and how a British history play can be reshaped to avoid being yet another production of an English king killing foreigners.At Soho theatre, London, until 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

A sweet slice of disco-infused pop, it is about the moment that Deacon Blue’s career took off, in the wake of their debut album Raintown, a point rammed home by the stageside screens, which show the band in their youth: a veritable riot of white denim, leather jackets and questionable millinery. “We seemed to do it all and it all seemed so easy,” sings Ricky Ross, his voice echoed by that of co-vocalist Lorraine McIntosh, as indeed it was then.You can’t really blame Deacon Blue for re-asserting how successful they were. They are the kind of band pop histories generally overlook – squeezed out of the late 80s narrative by the rise of acid house and Madchester at one extreme and Stock Aitken Waterman at the other – but they were, by any metric, both huge and inescapable: when they play their 1989 hit Fergus Sings the Blues, you find yourself automatically imagining it coming out of a radio, so omnipresent was it on BBC Radio 1 at the time.Nevertheless, you could hardly describe Deacon Blue as forgotten. The Great Western Road made the Top 3 and Brighton Centre is packed, part of a tour that exclusively inhabits the UK’s arenas. Their latter-day resurgence might rest on the fact that Ross has minted a songwriting style that, while musically indistinguishable from the band’s purple patch – and thus matching his and McIntosh’s voices, pretty much as they were in the questionable millinery years – lyrically seems intent on growing old with their audience. The Great Western Road’s title track and Mid Century Modern affectingly ruminate on time’s passing, their melancholy flecked with the-best-is-yet-to-come optimism.View image in fullscreenHard-bitten stories of Glasgow life … Lorraine McIntosh sings with Deacon Blue at Brighton Centre.Photograph: Jamie CarterThere’s also some politics, which comes as a surprise, but probably shouldn’t: beneath the glossy production, Raintown’s hard-bitten stories of Glasgow life carried an implicit critique of Thatcherism’s impact on the city. Tonight, Ross talks about the world being in “deep shit” and offers a glancing reference to welcoming migrants to the UK, while the brooding Your Town, from 1993’s coolly received attempt at post-Achtung Baby reinvention Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, plays out with the faces of Trump, Farage and Putin glowering from the screens.‘I’d been singing the wrong word for 30 years’: Deacon Blue on how they made DignityRead moreThere’s something heartening about the audience cheering this stuff, but they’re really here for the hits: Chocolate Girl, When Will You (Make My Telephone Ring), Dignity. You can occasionally pick out the influence of Prefab Sprout on Deacon Blue’s sound – and on Raintown’s title track, the Blue Nile’s drizzly urban angst – but refitted for broader appeal, made brawnier and more unashamedly poppy. It was too crowd-pleasing in approach to be critically acclaimed, but nearly 40 years on, even a dedicated naysayer might be forced to concede it worked: as Real Gone Kid hits the pop bullseye dead-on, those crowds are very much still being pleased.Deacon Blue play Utilita Arena, Birmingham, 22 September; Leeds First Direct Bank Arena, 23 September and Bournemouth International Centre, 25 September.Then touring.Explore more on these topicsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

We chart her best – and most controversial – music videosAlim KherajMon 22 Sep 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 22 Sep 2025 10.04 EDTShareOnyx – Throw Ya Gunz (1992)Onyx: Throw Ya Gunz – videoThe first music video Diane Martel directed was for the debut single by hardcore hip-hop group Onyx. Filmed predominantly in South Jamaica, Queens, and allegedly featuring real guns, it’s a grimy and energetic video, yo-yoing between the group performing on a beach and aggressive closeups shot in dimly lit basements. Martel, a young white woman who had directed two documentaries, might have seemed like an unlikely choice, but according to Onyx member Fredro Starr, she properly mucked in. “She would be getting on the floor, like getting dirty with it,”he said in one interview. “She made that video. If you wasn’t a director who was willing to get dirty, that video wouldn’t have came out like that. I gotta give her the props.”Mariah Carey – All I Want for Christmas Is You (1994)Mariah Carey: All I Want for Christmas Is You – videoMartel directed a number of videos forMariah Carey, including Dreamlover, The Roof, and the remix video for Heartbreaker. The clip for this festive behemoth, however, was actually filmed before Carey had even written the song. Co-directed by Carey herself and shot at farm in upstate New York, it was made to look like Super 8 in post-production, with Carey getting so cold during filming that her hair froze. While Carey has said that she didn’t “love every shot in this video”, it does exemplify what Martel called her “minimalist work”, putting artists “front and centre” in her videos: “They have to perform because there is not a lot else going on.”Method Man – I’ll Be There for You / You’re All I Need to Get By ft Mary J Blige (1995)Method Man: I’ll Be There for You / You’re All I Need to Get By ft Mary J Blige – videoWhile her videos often prioritised simplicity, Martel’s approach for this Grammy-winning partnership between Method Man and Mary J Blige was more cinematic, incorporating a loose narrative about a man being pursued by police. The romance embedded in Method Man’s lyrics is captured in the more grounded shots of the rapper and Blige silhouetted against a backdrop of an industrial cityscape, their appearance a reminder that love helps you overcome life’s challenges.Christina Aguilera – Genie in a Bottle (1999)Christina Aguilera: Genie in a Bottle – videoMartel directed two music videos for Christina Aguilera, including the one for her indelible debut single. Here you can see the director’s emphasis on performance in action, a then 18-year-old Aguilera serving up tight choreography and a bare mid-riff as she shimmies into pop stardom. Nipping at the heels of Britney Spears’s … Baby One More Time, both song and video were a lightning rod for controversy. But Aguilera’s offering wore its sexuality more boldly and with more maturity than Spears. This was likely by design: “Even if there’s a sexual fantasy involved,”Martel said in 2003, “it doesn’t have to be a lazy, exploitive mess.” It’s a philosophy she perhaps didn’t always stick to, but one in practice here.Eve – Who’s That Girl? (2001)Eve: Who’s That Girl? – videoBy the early 2000s, you can see Martel becoming more adventurous. While her work still primarily spotlighted what shedescribed in 2013as “the artist doing it”, the video for Eve’s Who’s That Girl? demonstrates how she was experimenting with different technologies, aesthetics and set design. From the appearance of a tiger, the various CGI backdrops and a strange, animated vignette to the highly saturated colour palette and overblown lighting, this video feels like it wrote the style guide that Hype Williams would later follow throughout the 2000s.NERD – Lapdance (2001)NERD: Lapdance – videoIf Eve’s Who’s That Girl? was Martel expanding herself, this NERD video feels reminiscent of her earlier work with artists such as Onyx and Redman. “I try to stay true to the genre of music in terms of the lensing, framing and lighting,” shesaid in 2006, something that feels particularly true of the video for the solo cup-waving frat rap of Lapdance. The chiaroscuro lighting suggests depravity, Pharrell and the gang cavorting with scantily clad women at a testosterone-fuelled house party. Martel and NERD even made an explicit version of the video, featuring nudity and eye-rolling girl-on-girl action, something of a precursor to the infamous video for Blurred Lines.Justin Timberlake – Like I Love You (2002)Justin Timberlake: Like I Love You – videoMartel clearly understood the role a good music video could play in introducing an artist to the world. “Yes, it’s a sales tool,” shesaid in 2003, “but it’s also a visual presentation of the artist’s poetry and culture, interpreted by the director.” This mentality is on full display in the Like I Love You video, which helped reposition Justin Timberlake as a solo star. The simplicity of the video (“none of my videos are conceptual, even the conceptual ones,” she once said) provides ample room for Timberlake to prove he’s no longer a curly-haired teenybopper as he dances with a virility that accentuates his maturity. And the many close ups of his face? Proof that Martel understood the video’s target demographic.Stacie Orrico – Stuck (2003)Stacie Orrico: Stuck – videoNarrative wasn’t usually a priority for Martel, but she leaned into it while making the video for Stuck, the underrated single by Stacie Orrico. The story plays out like something from a teen drama, Orrico lamenting her ongoing attachment to an ex-boyfriend who cheated on her. Martel captures the teenage frustration and longing of the song by repeatedly isolating Orrico, be it through the window of a school bus, the fence of a basketball court or by placing her alone in her bedroom. Doing so lends the story credibility, resulting in a video that has timeless appeal.Robin Thicke – Blurred Lines ft TI, Pharrell (2013)Robin Thicke: Blurred Lines ft TI, Pharrell – videoIt’s the song and video that launched 1,000 think pieces, many of which rightly highlighted the predatory lyrics and the issue of how women were often objectified in music videos. For her part,Martel saidthat she was simply trying to make something that would “sell records” in the internet age. In that respect she delivered: the song became one of the best-selling singles of all time. The video is also typical of Martel’s minimalist style. Inspired by the work of George Balanchine, Richard Avedon and, incredibly, Benny Hill, the video is set against a white wall, Martel employing meme-able props, nudity, exaggerated movements and oversized graphics to draw the eye.‘Audiences can smell fakeness a mile away’: the creative directors behind pop’s biggest starsRead moreWas it sexist? Martel didn’t think so, suggesting that it actually skewered the queasy message of the song. “I wanted to deal with the misogynist, funny lyrics in a way where the girls were going to overpower the men,”she said at the time. Later, in 2021, when writer and model Emily Ratajkowski, who starred in the video, alleged that Robin Thicke had sexually assaulted her on the set,Martel confirmed the story, saying she shut down the shoot until Thicke apologised. “We kept on and Emily was phenomenal,” she added. “She’s really the star of the video. She’s fully mocking him and the male gaze with her beautiful shape and ferocious energy. She’s playful, not seductive. And quite hilarious.”Miley Cyrus – We Can’t Stop (2013)Miley Cyrus: We Can’t Stop – videoIf Martel’s work for Aguilera and Timberlake’s softly suggested each star’s sexuality, she chucked subtlety out the window for We Can’t Stop. The aim, she said, was to “make a trippy, fucked-up video that was like a giant selfie” while catering to “a new generation of kids that are overstimulated as viewers”. Why that meant including numerous shots of Miley Cyrus sticking her tongue out is unclear, but the scenes of twerking, dancing bears and hedonistic partying certainly captured the yolo ethos of the early 2010s. And if it (hyper)sexualised Cyrus, so what? “Some songs are about sex, some moments in careers are about sex,”Martel said in 2013. “If it’s called for, we go there … I’m comfortable with sexuality, so that maybe helps performers. We are talking about music videos.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockChristina AguileraRobin ThickePharrell WilliamsMariah CareyJustin TimberlakefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He suggests forming them by dropping them into a wine glass of polenta, swirling the glass to coat each malfatti, then poaching. I made them for my parents’ first visit to our new home, and encouraged everyone to get involved by swirling their own; I also made them for weaning (with a little less salt) and got my daughter, Alba, involved as soon as she was old enough to hold a wine glass. They’rethatgood. But now, with not one but two toddlers to contend with, I make life a lot easier by turning them into fritters, and use up the insane quantities of chard from the garden at the same time. This is my homage to Russell’s original.Malfatti fritters with chard and sage butterPrep20 minCook20 minServes2-3350g chard100g parmesan, grated (a vegetarian one, if need be)250g ricotta100g flour1 mediumegg1 tsp sea salt flakesOlive oil, for frying25g salted butter15 sage leavesWash the chard, then put it in a microwaveable bowl for which you have a lid (I use a Pyrex bowl with a snugly fitting plate on top). Cook on high for two minutes, stir, then return to the microwave and cook for another two minutes.Drain the chard, then, once it’s cool enough to handle, squeeze to remove most of the excess water. Tip the chard into a food processor and chop into small pieces – you don’t want a puree, but neither do you want any great big lumps. Add the parmesan, ricotta, flour, egg and salt, then blitz briefly until everything’s just combined.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large, nonstick frying pan. Turn down the heat to medium, then, working in batches, fry heaped tablespoons of the malfatti mix for two to three minutes on each side, until evenly golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll, and repeat with the remaining malfatti batter (keep the cooked fritters warm in a low oven, if you wish).Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small frying pan on a low heat, then add the sage leaves. Turn up the heat to medium, and fry for two to three minutes, until the leaves are lovely and crisp and the butter has browned. (Do watch this, though, and adjust the heat so the butter doesn’t burn.)Serve the malfatti fritters drizzled with the sage butter. They need very little else alongside, but sparkling water or wine would work well.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkQuick and easySnacksFoodCheeseStarterEggsVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We opened our restaurant,Trattoria della Gloria, in Milan in 2023, and instinctively refused to spend every night selling a remote and often fictional past. Instead, we explore and experiment with ancient gestures, methods and pairings to create “new old things”. That is, dishes that our grannies could have made, but didn’t.Green beans carbonara (pictured top)Italy is no country for sauces – most of our meat, fish and vegetable dishes are usually served by themselves, or with just olive oil and little else. Italian sauces do exist, but they are held in captivity by pasta dishes. Carbonara, say, has become a very serious matter, calling for nothing but guanciale (cured pork cheek) and pecorino romano. It’s good, but it’s actually a very recent “tradition”: as a child in north Italy in the 1990s, I had never even heard of guanciale, and our carbonara was just fine.Prep30 minCook30 minServes4, as a side orlight lunch200g guanciale, or unsmoked pancetta1 egg plus 3 egg yolks100g grated pecorino romano, or parmesan, plus extra to finish800ggreen beans, tailedSea salt andblack pepperCut the guanciale (or most likely pancetta) into 5mm strips or cubes and put them in a cold, nonstick frying pan. Turn on the heat to low, then slowly heat up the meat (with no oil), tossing or stirring every now and then, for about eight minutes in total, until the fat starts to melt and the pieces of pork first turn translucent and then go crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried guanciale/pancetta to a plate lined with paper towel, and take the pan off the heat, reserving the very hot fat.In a bowl, whisk the egg, egg yolks, grated cheese and plenty of black pepper for a minute, then pour the hot fat over the top and mix it in very well. The result is essentially a hollandaise with cheese and pork fat (instead of the usual butter).Fill a large pan with water, season with salt, bring to a boil, then add the green beans and cook for six to nine minutes, according to how done you like them.Drain the beans, then divide them between four plates. Taste the sauce and add salt, if need be (unlikely); if it looks a little too thick, loosen with a spoonful of the bean cooking water. Pour the sauce all over the beans, top with the crisp guanciale and more grated cheese and black pepper, then serve.Leftover bread tiramisuView image in fullscreenTommaso Melilli’s leftover bread tiramisu.Savoiardi or boudoir biscuits are often hard to find, but you need them to make tiramisu. That’s why I gave up on them years ago, both at home and at the restaurant, and now I use leftover bread instead. The original name for french toast waspain perdu, meaning “lost bread”, which makes thistiramisu perduto.Prep25 minCook15 minRest20 minAssembly10 minServes86-81cm-thick slices1- to 2-day-old sourdough, crusts left on500ml whole milk100g caster sugar, plus 20g extra for dusting200ml brewed strong coffee500g fridge-coldmascarpone500ml fridge-coldwhipping creamCocoa powder,for dustingHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the sourdough slices on a deep tray, cover with the milk, dust with the 20g caster sugar, then roast for about 15 minutes, until just golden. At this point, the bread should be rising like a very rustic cake. Take it out of the oven and leave to cool to room temperature for about 20 minutes.Once the bread has cooled, pour the coffee all over it and gently turn the slices so they soak up the coffee entirely and you don’t end up with any chewy corners.Meanwhile, make the mascarpone cream. Whisk the mascarpone, 100g sugar and 100ml whipping cream for 30 seconds, then add the remaining cream and beat again, this time slowly, for about 10 minutes, until the cream turns stiff but is still smooth.Using a large spatula, spread half the cream mix over the bottom of a deep, roughly 24cm x 35cm x 5cm glass dish. Using your hands, drain the bread and use it to cover the layer of cream. Dust with cocoa powder, then cover the bread with the remaining cream. The tiramisu doesn’t really need to rest, but an hour in the fridge will be fine. Just before serving, dust with more cocoa powder.Tommaso Melilli is chef and co-owner ofTrattoria Della Gloriain MilanExplore more on these topicsFoodItalian food and drinkPastaDessertMain courseVegetablesSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"
