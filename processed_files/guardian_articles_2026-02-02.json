To include Netflix’s contributions could break calculators.)Lover, Liar, Predator tells the stories of several women who were coerced, abused and raped by a man called Aaron Swan over his decades-long career. He was 17 when he approached Natalie at a party. She was 17 too but, as a devout Christian with a very protected upbringing, effectively younger and highly vulnerable to his charms. He put pressure on her to give up her virginity. She got pregnant and they married. He was “demeaning and unkind” to her, insulting her looks, claiming to be in love with his ex and subjecting her to violent, unwanted sex (“I endured whatever was required … I thought that’s what sex was”) for years.By 2009 he had moved on to Jenni, whom he started grooming on Facebook when she was 16. He was 24. Her mother tried to put an end to the relationship and eventually involved the police, who told her and Jenni that he had an ex-wife and was a registered sex offender since his conviction for possession of child sexual abuse imagesfive years previously. However, the teenager was convinced by his protestations of innocence and moved in with him. They married, though he was serially unfaithful. She was soon pregnant and Natalie’s experience repeated itself in another home, with the added horror that Swan raped Jenni’s best friend, Shannon, when she stayed over after a night out.View image in fullscreenAaron Swan and Jenni.Photograph: BBC ScotlandHe then met 18-year-old Robyn at work and the pattern repeated. His abusive behaviours escalated as time went on and he used various threats – from suicide to “making your life a living hell” – to deter his victims’ occasional attempts to get help. It wasn’t until 2024 that Swan was convicted of six charges, including rape, domestic abuse and sexual assault.This was in large part due to the women’s solidarity. They had become aware of each other’s existence, and helped one another see Swan’s true colours. As his terrorism of Jenni increased, she got back in touch with Shannon to apologise for believing Swan when he said their sex was consensual. The women went to the local police station and reported their rapes by him together.Meanwhile, Swan’s sister enrolled Robyn on a 12-week course for women who suspected they were in abusive relationships. At the end, Robyn discovered that the woman who had created the course was Natalie, Swan’s ex-wife. His sister had told her how desperately worried she was about his new girlfriend, and Natalie suggested this as a way of showing her the truth.All together, their testimonies worked: Swan was ordered to serve a minimum of six years’ imprisonment, and his name was added to the sex offenders’ register indefinitely with non-harassment orders granted for all parties involved.Documentaries like this are sometime criticised for simply logging the problem, rather than addressing it and proffering solutions. But they do raise awareness (never mindAdolescence– I would put a package of these films together and send one to every school in the country), and perhaps prompt those lacking in experience and consequently sympathy to imagine possible answers to that vexed question: “Why don’t they just leave?” To imagine being scared in your own home, all the time. To imagine not knowing from one second to the next when your partner is going to “turn”. To imagine having your self-esteem chipped away over years by someone who brutalises you inside and out. To imagine having no safe space.All the women describe the impossibility of leaving a man who had been carefully stripping them, more or less since childhood, of the psychological and practical wherewithal to do so. Add the failures of police to take seriously physical violence, let alone the more intangible forms of coercing and controlling a victim, and the inability of the criminal justice system to put effective curbs on perpetrators’ behaviour if and when it does come to their attention, and you have a world that could hardly be more designed for predators.

It’s surely the end for Peter Mandelson, finallyJohn CraceThe only question now is how it took this long for Labour’s greedy, reckless Prince of Darkness to meet his reckoningMon 2 Feb 2026 12.11 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 19.00 ESTShareThis is the end, beautiful friend, the end. There have been many Peter Mandelson resignations. Twice from the cabinet,once as the UK ambassador to Washington. But the announcement late on Sunday night that Mandelson wasresigning from the Labour partysomehow felt more final.In the past, there had always been get-out clauses. Unexpected routes back to the centre of power. Not this time. Somewhat late in the day, the establishment had closed every door. For the first time in decades, Mandy was truly on his own. You might ask what had taken everyone so long. Mandelson hadn’t exactly made much effort to hide his tracks.The silence was overwhelming. With the release of further Jeffrey Epstein files revealingeven closer and possibly incriminating ties between Mandelson and the disgraced financier, all of his lordship’s – we can still call him thatfor now– former friends have melted away. Over the years, Tony Blair has spoken up for any number of corrupt dictators. For Mandy, Tony was nowhere to be seen. Bad line. Wifi is down. Not sorry.How the depth of Peter Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein came to lightRead moreNothing from George Osborne, who found himself on the same yacht as Peterin Corfu. Surely he might have had a good word. They seemed to be having a nice enough holiday bromance at the time.Keir Starmer is now wishing he had never heard of Mandy. Struggling to come to terms with it being less than a year since he had thought it was an inspired move to send Britain’s most accomplished sycophant to blow smoke up Donald Trump’s bum. The president would love a man who was impressed with all the gold, the bullshit and the tackiness. Hell, Mandy is the one man on the planet who would have genuinelyadored the Melania film.Maybe we could all overlook his friendship with Epstein? Now Starmer finds his judgment in the spotlight as he seeks to obliterate all ties. He is looking for ways for Mandelson to bepermanently removed from the House of Lordsand not allowed to use his title. He also wants him to testify before the US Congress.Other UK politicians have followed suit. Kemi Badenoch also demanded an investigation into Mandelson. Ed Davey wanted a police inquiry. It turned out there was more to Peter than even they had imagined. They had all believed in the empty shell theory of Peter. That reduced to his core was a nothingness. No values, no sense of self. Just pulsating need. A little boy who could never have enough.But there was also betrayal. Mandelson had his own code of honour. One calibrated to his own rich list. For decades now, many of us have been wondering just what the oligarchs and the Epstein elite got out of their relationship with Mandy. But now we know.There was a quid pro quo. Or a dollar pro quo. Because the Epstein files appear to show three payments of $25,000 to Mandelson back in 2003-04. We don’t know what the money was for and Peter, the man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing, claims to have no memory of that. Maybe people paying Peter $75k for the pleasure of being Peter is totally normal. He wanders round with a card reader. “$5k for me to say you are utterly marvellous,” he whispers. I’m sure it’s all been properly declared to HMRC so maybe they have a view.Mandelson thought the super-wealthy were his cash machine. The passport to the life he should have had. Take his husband, Reinaldo,emailing Epsteinin 2009 for money for an osteopathy course. And when he had received $10,000, he checked in hopeful that the course fees of £3,250 had been paid separately. Because every penny counted. Surely even this was a low point for Mandelson. A point at which his morality had been utterly corrupted.Or not quite. Because we now get to the quo. In 2009, Mandelson was serving in Brown’s cabinet as business secretary. Only it now turns out that Mandy thought he was serving Epstein. Pressing “forward” on sensitive cabinet documents to Epstein. He even gave the convicted child sex offender advance warning of the €500bn bailout to save the euro.It didn’t end there. Epstein also wanted help with proposed UK taxes on banker bonuses. Mandelson volunteered advice and suggested the director of JP Morgan should be “mildly threatening” towards the then chancellor, Alistair Darling. Mandelson had been asked to pick a side. His greed, his envy, didn’t even make him have to think twice. If it was a choice between betraying his colleagues and his country or keeping in with the people who paid for his luxuries, it was a no-brainer. Those holidays weren’t going to pay for themselves.The strange thing is that it has taken until now for some of the details to emerge. Mandelson has always been reckless. He has just always believed his charm would be enough to get him through any complications. He evengave the impression he cared more about himself than Epstein’s victims. Now he has been laid bare. One day Mandelson may even come to recognise himself for what he is. For now, he is on his own. Peter’s friends have all but melted away.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonThe politics sketchJeffrey EpsteinLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.‘This train isn’t going to stop’: shocking Sundance film shows promises and perils of AIRead moreThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.It is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.Because, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.It’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.On This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.But surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.It will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.Less than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.But this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.Explore more on these topicsDarren AronofskyAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fifa’s ticketing process has been met with demand and controversy. Security concerns for fans traveling to the US have risen.We asked readers to share their experiences of buying World Cup tickets – or deciding not to. These are some of the stories we received.Tickets, travel and Trump: How the 2026 World Cup is shaping up six months from the finalRead more‘The price was high but that’s reality for North American sports’When President Trump placed aggressive tariffs on Canadian exports, I completely swore off travel to the United States. So, when Fifa selected me during the “Domestic Exclusivity” phase, I leapt at the opportunity to buy tickets to a match in Canada. Each step of the online process was somewhat confusing, including a counter-clockwise circular countdown with imperceptibly slow movement and multiple login requests. Nevertheless, after a 90-minute wait, I was able to purchase tickets for my family to Canada’s last group game. They cost $270 (Canadian) each. The price was high, but that’s just the reality for North American sports today. There are tickets at that price and above for every NFL or NHL game. The price of the hotel I booked outside Vancouver was far more shocking.John, Winnipeg, Canada‘They’re not getting a cent of my money’I went to the World Cup in Germany in 2006 when I lived in the UK, and always wanted to go to another in my lifetime. I now live in Australia, and being conscious of the fact that I’d be receiving a decent tax rebate from the Aussie government, had decided to spend that on flying me and the missus to the World Cup taking in some games in the US and Mexico and was registered for tickets and a rough itinerary planned. However that decision all changed as I watched the clown show, clusterfuck of the Trump/Infantino White House press conferences, alongside the news of the appalling treatment of immigrants and tourists in the US. I’ve basically decided that not a cent of my money will go to making the tournament a success for either of those odious pricks. Instead I’ll spend the money on taking in the Ashes, the Rugby World Cup and a few decent gigs/music festivals in the Australia, helping the local economy here.Adam, 53, Brisbane, Australia‘Do I think it’ll be worth it? No’I spent $14,400 on tickets to nine games (a total of 32 tickets). Six group games, two round of 32 and one round of 16.I am expecting that the majority of my tickets will be taken by friends and family traveling from the UK – I only intend to attend two to three games personally. Do I think it’ll be worth it? No. I think it is crazy to spend $500 per ticket for a football game, especially given so many of the group games will be between countries that would not have qualified for a 32-team World Cup. However, with games “local” to me, it still feels more accessible than 2030 or 2034. I attended the World Cup in 2010 and spent £800 on tickets in total, including the quarter-final, semi-final and final. I went to Brazil 2014 (but was only able to get tickets for one game) and Russia 2018, but skipped 2022. Prices for 2026 are out of control but the risk of waiting in the hope ticket prices crash (as they did for the Club World Cup) closer to the time was not a risk I was willing to take.Tom F, Long Island‘Still the most pure form of the sport around’I bought four tickets for a group game in Philadelphia. I got selected in the Fifa lottery and the process itself to buy the tickets was pretty straightforward. I wanted tickets for a New York game as it’s closer to me but the Category 3 & 4 tickets were not available and the Category 2 tickets were too expensive. I ended up paying $155 each for four tickets. It’s a big outlay but unfortunately any event in the States is just going to be expensive.I have had a bit of buyer’s remorse at times about getting the tickets but it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a World Cup game. Despite all the ridiculousness around it, once the games start it is still the most pure form of the sport around.Obviously the situation with ICE is worrying. I work in construction so I’ve met a lot of Colombian & Ecuadorean people who would love to go to these games but, can they be sure they will be not be hassled going to game even if they are in the USA legitimately? Will fans from those countries want to travel even though they are some of the teams who have bought the most color to recent World Cups? Even neutral Latin & Central Americans would probably love to see it but will they want to deal with the hassle of going to a game? And that’s before you get to the question of cost.John, Irishman living in New York‘I spent $70,000 on tickets’I have bought 62 tickets. Spent approximately $70,000. I do think it will be worth it as they can be resold. It’s also, in my opinion, the best sporting event and only comes around twice a decade. Yes, there were obstacles, but all challenges in life are opportunities.Sameer Somal, entrepreneur, New YorkView image in fullscreenMetLife Stadium will host the World Cup final.Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters‘Basic safety and dignity are on the line’Miami is absolutely not ready for a World Cup. The city has no real public transportation, the roads are a mess on a normal day, and the infrastructure is nowhere near capable of handling an event of this scale.And honestly, I’m not buying tickets. Fifa is a corrupt organization that has never cared about fans or human rights – only profit. The last World Cup proved that.To make things even worse, the atmosphere in the US under the Trump administration is frightening. Brown people – including myself – live with the fear of being targeted simply because of our skin. It’s hard to celebrate a global event when basic safety and dignity are on the line.Antonio Gomez Berumen, Miami‘Don’t think I will take the risk’Living in Toronto, it’s been a life’s dream for me to attend a World Cup match and I was very excited with the prospect of a World Cup happening in the US, Canada and Mexico. Two things have tempered my optimism: first, Donald Trump and the current state of the United States. It is quite evident that the current dispensation does not want outsiders in the country – more so, outsiders who look like me (brown and Indian). At this current stage, I don’t think I will take the risk of going to the US to watch a match. That leaves very few matches to be held in Toronto. I have signed up for all the Fifa draws so far, waiting in queue for hours only to be told that I have been ‘entered’ in a draw. Till now, I have not heard any positive news. I would love to watch a football World Cup match – any match, honestly – and I understand that it may not be cheap which is why I’ve started trying from so early. But I am getting frustrated and I don’t think I will be able to get tickets after all – I don’t think I can afford the astronomical prices that I see floating around.Angikaar Choudhury, 35, Toronto‘Once-in-a-lifetime experience’I bought myWorld Cup 2026tickets during the Early Visa Draw. In total I’ve spent over $7,000 so far. The process was stressful – at one point I waited almost 40 minutes just to get into the system, and by the time I got in, many of the major matches like the semi-finals and the final were already gone. The prices in general were quite high, but I still wanted to secure the games I cared about. Even with all the difficulties, I’m really excited. I’ll be in the US for my summer holiday, and I can’t wait to attend the matches in New York and Miami. For me, this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime experience.Cansu, Türkiye‘Impossible to support’I won’t be buying tickets. Even though travel would be very easy for me as an American citizen, and both of my sisters live in host cities (NYC and Dallas), so lodging wouldn’t be an issue. And yet, I’m just so disgusted with the Trump administration and the way“Johnny” was cozied up to him, and with the extortionate ticket prices, and the looming threat of ICE – it’s just impossible to support. And it’s really upsetting, because I have a five-year-old son and this should be a core memory for him. But in the end I think I’ll save up the money and use it to take him to a game at the Emirates instead. Although, I wouldn’t completely rule out one of the Mexican venues next summer …Alex, Montana‘London 2012 was so much simpler’This has been beyond stressful. Between family and friends we’ve had about 10 accounts across the UK and USA trying in the presale draws and got nothing.We did manage to get extremely lucky that our credit card company (Wells Fargo) had a draw so we had about 15-20 devices trying to login and my husband got us four tickets for the round of 16 in Houston for $2,000. Our kids will be six and 10 and we can only hope we get really lucky and England will be playing. We’re still trying to get tickets for the Kansas City quarter-final as it’s the closest game to where we live (a 10-hour drive).Major major obstacles, London 2012 was so much simpler!Claire, Colorado‘Easier to find the Aurora Borealis’I naively thought getting at least one pair of World Cup tickets would be as manageable as getting tickets for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Surely, I thought, If I could manage to figure out the IOC’s ticketing system and attended a ton of Olympic events with face value tickets, then surely purchasing one pair of tickets to a local World Cup would be somewhat achievable. I was wrong. I was very wrong.I applied for every single ticketing opportunity and failed each time. It’s been easier to find the Aurora Borealis in our neighborhood than it is to find someone who managed to win the World Cup lottery – not one of my friends/family/co-workers/neighbors/community members managed to snag tickets.I admit the frustration of being unable to attend a local World Cup game has dampened my enthusiasm for the event a bit. I still haven’t given up hope and have joined every available promotional contest and event to try to get a pair of those tickets. And I have also been keeping an eye on the secondary market in case some fair priced tickets magically pop up. But I’ve also come to accept that if it doesn’t happen, then it doesn’t. I’ll be perfectly happy to enjoy the World Cup in the comfort of my home, at my local sports bar, or at a neighborhood watch party – the places where all the real local fans will be this World Cup.Rex, Richmond, CanadaView image in fullscreenChristian Pulisic’s United States will look to make a mark on home soil.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images‘We still think it will be worth it’My family and I bought tickets. We spent $800 for four tickets, and plan to buy two more (for which we have budgeted another $800).The ticket lotteries had us stressed that all the tickets would be gone by the time the general sale started. So when my mother-in-law was drawn for one of the pre-sale right-to-buy contests, we bought tickets right away. Since my mother-in-law, who is older, was the one who won the drawing, we needed to coach her over FaceTime on how to buy the tickets. She was quickly getting overwhelmed, especially because the ticket prices seemed to be changing but the second (as other more tech savvy winners bought up the cheap seats). We needed tickets on [26 June], since that was the date we were all able to get off work and school. The game ended up being Egypt-Iran. It is exciting to get to see Mo Salah play in person, but I would be lying if I wasn’t a bit disappointed to not get France or Brazil, or another “bigger” footballing country.With all of that said, we still think it will be worth it – seeing high-level football like the World Cup is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for football fans in a non-footballing country like the US. I completely understand why my fellow American soccer fans are willing to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to see games.Paul, Illinois‘Once-in-a-lifetime adventure … squashed’After surviving a health scare, it has been a dream of mine to go to a World Cup final. For Qatar 2022 I wasn’t well enough and I wasn’t too keen on the chosen location for the World Cup. I’d pencilled in 2026’s final in New York as my plan. I was organised, I booked accommodation two years in advance to be in New York over the final.Everything was in place, we just needed tickets. We knew these would be expensive and have managed to save about $1,000AUD each for final tickets. We’d probably even go to $1,200AUD each if we had to and we based these estimations on the last final in Qatar with the cheapest final tickets there being $900AUD. Then [in December], the prices came out. Cheapest ticket for the final is roughly $6,250AUD each. Or $13,000AUD for the both of us. We don’t have that kind of money.What was a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, a dream after years of illness and not being able to work has been squashed by Fifa’s insistence of making as much money as possible, of Infantino’s disregard for the real football fan that puts their entire life savings at risk. It’s disgusting. We will go to New York. We will have a great time in a great city. We’ve booked the flights and accommodation. But we won’t be going to the final I’ve dreamt of purely because Fifa and Infantino need to make more money on top of all the money they already have. We are devastated.Jon Hewitt, 42, Australia‘No idea if this strategy will work’I have purchased some tickets, but not as many as I’d like. I’m frustrated about how Fifa is handling their ticket offerings for those who use a wheelchair.[Regarding hospitality seats] I asked On Location whether I could buy a wheelchair seat [space], and they said I had to buy a regular seat, then call them and let them know I wanted a wheelchair space, and they would try to accommodate. But their email specifically said, “please note, while we will do our best to accommodate your request, this is not a guarantee.” So I have to spend $2,000-$5,000 on a ticket, and they can’t even guarantee that I can use it. (I am unlikely to buy Hospitality seats because of the cost, but I’m still disappointed that the option doesn’t exist for those with accessibility needs.) I asked Fifa Collect if I could exercise a RTB to get a wheelchair seat. Their response was “Unfortunately we do not handle this. After you buy your ticket you should address to Fifa Ticketing direct in order for them to assist you.” So once again, I’d have to spend a lot of money up front, with no guarantee that I’ll get a usable seat. I actually had a RTB but ended up selling it because it was useless to me.I have had two shots at buying tickets, the Visa pre-sale and the Early Access Draw. In both cases companion seats (a regular seat next to the wheelchair space) were all gone early. By the time my purchasing time slot came up, there were still wheelchair spaces available for many of the games, but no companion seats. I think that’s because Fifa lets you buy up to three companion seats for each wheelchair seat. So the companion seats were sold out much more quickly than the wheelchair seats. By letting early buyers get three companion seats, those seats run out by the time later buyers get online, forcing wheelchair users to attend games on their own.[As of 22 January] I have continued to ping Fifa about how to get a companion seat next to a wheelchair seat. They finally responded that I should just purchase two wheelchair seats: one for the wheelchair user, and one for the companion. I have no idea if this strategy will work, but that’s what I’ve done for the upcoming Random Selection Draw. We’ll see.Jeff, 67, Santa Cruz, CaliforniaExplore more on these topicsFootballWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the case of last night’sGrammys, we hardly need musicians to reiterate that what ICE is doing is morally reprehensible. And yet the sheer force and variety of these statements was bracing, making it clear that the issue should remain paramount in any context.“No one is illegal on stolen land, and it’s just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,”Billie Eilishsaid, reiterating a phrase popular at anti-ICE protests as she won song of the year for Wildflower. “I feel really hopeful in this room, and I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter. ‘Fuck Ice’ is all I want to say, sorry.”Winning the first of two R&B awards for Folded, Kehlani also called for a pan-industry stance: “Together we’re stronger in numbers to speak against all the injustice going on in the world right now … I hope everybody’s inspired to join together as a community of artists, so I’mma leave this and say: fuck ICE.” Winning best new artist,Olivia Deansaid: “I’m up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant – I’m a product of bravery and I think those people deserve to be celebrated,” with all the class and subtle power of her music itself.Bad Bunny and Kendrick Lamar win big in Grammys ceremony filled with anti-ICE sentimentRead moreAnd Bad Bunny’s speech was simply extraordinary, charged up with clarity and humanism: “ICE out. We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,” he said, adding: “The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. Please, we need to be different. If we fight we have to do it with love. We don’t hate them … that’s the way to do it, with love. Don’t forget that, please.” For a person who had to rule out doing US concerts last year for fear that his fans would be seized by ICE agents, extending love to those agents is a striking example of Benito Ocasio going high when they go low.While there were a smattering of anti-ICE statements on the Golden Globes red carpet from Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and more, along with some lapel pins, this was a much more full-throated protest. Hopefully the Oscars will bring similar energy.Olivia Dean is anointed as Britain’s biggest new pop starThe best new artist category has anointed some major British legends over the years – the Beatles, Tom Jones, Sade, Amy Winehouse, Adele and Dua Lipa among them – and based on the strength of songwriting and performance on her breakthrough second album The Art of Loving, it feels like Dean is on the same career trajectory. She was an absolutely deserving winner in a strong field here, edging out the likes of Addison Rae, Sombr and Leon Thomas, thanks to her evocation of human feeling in all its caprice and wonder. The Art of Loving is almost a concept album, with every possible type of love-emotion given voice by Dean: from the playfully neggy flirting at a relationship’s outset to the accusatory, disbelieving hurt at the end. That skill, and the lightness with which she wears it, has swept her to pop’s top bracket. Released in September, The Art of Loving was ineligible this year, so expect her back on stage to collect more flowers next February.2:02Grammy awards 2026: Bad Bunny and Kendrick Lamar win big as musicians take aim at ICE – videoCould Kendrick Lamar soon become the greatest Grammy winner ever?The Recording Academy adores artists who pair cerebral musicianship and lyricism with commercial heft, and has anyone done that better thanKendrick Lamarin the last decade? He won another five awards last night – all four rap categories (including for his guest spot on Clipse’s Chains and Whips) plus the biggest one of all, record of the year for his Vandross-sampling SZA duet Luther. That takes Lamar’s tally to 27, at the age of just 38. Lamar was certainly deserving of every win here, with his album GNX exhibiting every facet of his personality from impish provocateur to ruminative romantic.The Dalai Lama won his first GrammyDalai Lama expresses ‘gratitude and humility’ at first Grammy winRead moreI’ll never forget one of the trippiest moments at Glastonbury, when Patti Smith got theDalai Lamaon stage and got the crowd to sing him happy birthday while he cut a cake with an enormous knife: definitely one where anyone microdosing mushrooms worried they’d actually macro-dosed. But having cropped up at the world’s greatest music festival, the 90-year-old has now gatecrashed the world’s greatest music awards, winning his first Grammy for Meditations: The Reflections of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, in the best audiobook category. If he set his words to a few Goa trance chords, you never know, those new age or dance/electronic categories could be his for the taking in 2027. The win already puts him in the top 10 oldest winners ever, though there’s some way to go before he beats 97-year-old bluesman Pinetop Perkins.Justin Bieber blew mindsOn the performance front, Sabrina Carpenter did Manchild with her usual brilliant high camp, holding a dove while dressed up like an airline pilot about to get a message from HR regarding appropriate uniform standards; Bruno Mars and Rosé took a great guitar-heavy stomp through APT; Lady Gaga mashed synths and donned an exploded wicker hat. There were heartfelt tributes to Ozzy Osbourne, D’Angelo and Roberta Flack (though only a spoken tribute to Brian Wilson, which seemed to underplay him a little, even if it came from Bruce Springsteen). But the performance of the night was byJustin Bieber, performing Yukon, one of his greatest songs and one of a handful of highs on his album Swag. Dressed in just a pair of shorts and socks and with a full-length mirror alongside him, it was as if he’d just rolled out of bed at 11am – confected anti-glamour, but brilliantly done. He built up the song’s riff live on guitar, looped it alongside drum pads and then let it all run in the background, letting him focus on delivering the vocals: on record they’re tight, but here they were loose and jazzy while retaining the funk.View image in fullscreenBrilliant high camp … Sabrina Carpenter performs during the 68th annual Grammy awards.Photograph: Chris Torres/EPAChick Corea extended his recordAmerican jazz fusion pianistChick Corea, celebrated for work with Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock and dozens more over the years, is the most garlanded jazz musician at the Grammys and has extended his record even after his death in 2021, now with 29 awards (third only to Georg Solti and Beyoncé in the overall list). The latest is for best jazz performance, a live rendition of Windows recorded in 2020 but released last year, taken from his final tour: a trio with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade. Windows is a composition from 1966, originally played with Duke Ellington’s son Mercer; more than half a century on, Corea still had the same bird-like inquisitiveness and instinct: it’s a gorgeous and deserving winner, far from a sentimental posthumous nod. It was a good night for sideman McBride: as well as this nimble trio, he showed his capability for much grander playing, his Christian McBride Big Band winning best large jazz ensemble album for Without Further Ado, Vol One – that takes his own winners tally to 11 overall.Chris Stapleton is contractually mandated to win best country performanceInmy pre-Grammy predictionsI thought that Stapleton just couldn’t end up winning this categoryagain, with a one-off song for the F1 movie that didn’t even trouble the country charts let alone the Hot 100. Plus its wild-eyed lyrics feel at odds with his reputation for emotional complexity: “No one’s accusin’ me of sanity / I ain’t everybody’s cup of tea,” he sings, despite sounding like he’s making himself an Earl Grey at the time. But here we are: that’s wins in four of the last five years for Stapleton, and 12 Grammys overall.The Cure won their first Grammy – and their secondThe Cure’s Wish (1992) and Bloodflowers (2000) were each nominated for best alternative music album, but the band had never won a Grammy until this year, when they won two: Songs of a Lost World in the aforementioned category, plus best alternative music performance for Alone. These are richly deserved wins, for an album and song that had a sombre, valedictory feel: bidding goodbye to love, to life, to a whole chapter of human history. The band missed the ceremony to say another farewell, attending the funeral of their multi-instrumentalist Perry Bamonte who recently died aged 65.View image in fullscreenLola Young with Shania Twain at a Grammys afterparty.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images​While there weren’t any British nominees for the main four categories, record, song or album of the year, other Brits did very well lower down the categories: most excitingly, Lola Young beating Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Lady Gaga and Chappell Roan to win best pop solo performance with Messy. Pop has longbeen focused on relatable woes but Young reinvigorated the trope with a song that really itched with the frantic feeling of one’s life slipping out of grip. FKA twigs won best dance/electronic album, Cynthia Erivo won best pop duo/group performance with Ariana Grande for Wicked’s Defying Gravity, and Yungblud won best rock performance for his live take on Ozzy Osbourne’s Changes. While giving a heartfelt tribute to Ozzy alongside a weeping Sharon Osbourne, he added: “Rock music’s coming back, watch out pop music, we’re gonna fucking get yer!” Raye was also given a special award for social change for Ice Cream Man, her song about experiencing sexual harassment from a record producer.Vampires defeated demonsThe Recording Academy and the Oscars-deciding Academy are sometimes united when it comes to best score awards, particularly when it comes to Ludwig Göransson, who did the double for both Black Panther and Oppenheimer, and could well do the same for Sinners after triumphing last night. But it was a surprise to seeSinners win best compilation soundtrack for visual media:KPop Demon Hunters, which produced two of the biggest pop groups last year in Huntr/x and Saja Boys, seemed the surefire bet. But in a music industry fearful of AI and determined to underline human-made music, perhaps it’s not surprising that the Academy rejected an animated performance – even if the very human vocal performances were brilliantly done – and Huntr/x duly also lost out to Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in the best pop duo/group performance.Is Cirkut pop’s new superproducer?Grammy awards 2026: list of winnersRead moreCirkut, AKA Canadian musician Henry Walter, won his first producer of the year award, welcoming him into a (notoriously all-male) club alongside the chief architects of modern pop sonics such as Greg Kurstin, Max Martin and Jack Antonoff. A protege of Martin alongside Dr Luke, working on hits such as Katy Perry’s Part of Me and Rihanna’s You Da One, he was in on the ground floor of the Weeknd’s career and co-crafted his two Daft Punk collaborations. He went on to co-produce huge hits such as Miley Cyrus’s Wrecking Ball, but started to edge away from his mentors. Initially his sound was fairly generic and stayed out of the way of its singers (such as Ava Max) but tracks like Sam Smith and Kim Petras’s Unholy lurched around with a trashy neo-electroclash aesthetic, and perhaps that was what earned him a call-up from Lady Gaga: he produced the whole of the excellent Mayhem, which also won best pop album last night. Having also co-produced three tracks on Charli xcx’s Brat, he’s adept at making pop’s edgier artists chime with the mainstream. The danger is that he will end up smoothing off their rough edges, but this win will give him more of a chance to craft an auteurish production style of his own.Explore more on these topicsGrammysGrammy awards 2026Pop and rockICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Billie EilishBad BunnyOlivia DeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brown has also asked the cabinet secretary toinvestigate the alleged leaks to Epstein.MPs lined up in parliament on Monday to express fury over Mandelson’s apparent willingness to share British government papers with the disgraced US financier.Gordon Brown asks top civil servant to investigate Mandelson ‘leak to Epstein’Read moreThe SNP and Reform UK have reported Mandelson to the police for misconduct in a public office. Emily Thornberry, theLabourchair of the foreign affairs select committee, also said she believed his actions should merit a criminal inquiry.The Metropolitan police confirmed it had received a number of reports relating to alleged misconduct in a public office and was considering whether to launch a criminal investigation.Commander Ella Marriott said: “The reports will all be reviewed to determine if they meet the criminal threshold for investigation. As with any matter, if new and relevant information is brought to our attention we will assess it, and investigate as appropriate.”In at least one email forwarded to Epstein – sent from a redacted address – an email address for “John Pond” was copied in, which the Guardian understands was the code name used by advisers when forwarding to Brown’s secure email account.Emails forwarded to Epstein from the very top of the UK government include:A confidential UK government document outlining £20bn in asset sales.Mandelson claiming he was “trying hard” to change government policy on bankers’ bonuses.An imminent bailout package for the euro the day before it was announced in 2010.A suggestion that the JPMorgan boss “mildly threaten” the chancellor.One former adviser described the conduct as “treacherous” and said they hoped the police would investigate. “You can imagine the sense of betrayal that those of us who worked every hour of the day during that crisis are feeling,” they said.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer, right, with Peter Mandelson, left. The prime minister is likely to face renewed questions over his judgment in appointing Mandelson as US ambassador.Photograph: Carl Court/APThe emails are part of a vast cache of disclosures relating to Epstein released on Friday by the US Department of Justice.Earlier this week, documents appeared to show the disgraced financier paid a total of $75,000 into bank accounts of which Mandelson – then a Labour MP – was believed to be a beneficiary. It is also alleged that Epstein sent Mandelson’s partner, now his husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, £10,000 in September 2009to fund an osteopathy course and other expenses.One email, which had the subject line “Business issues”, was sent by Brown’s special adviser Nick Butler on 13 June 2009 with significant detail about policy measures the government was considering and suggesting the government had £20bn in saleable assets.Mandelson forwarded the email to Epstein and said: “Interesting note that’s gone to the PM.” Epstein responded to Mandelson, asking “what salable (sic) assets?” A reply from a redacted email address said: “Land, property I guess.”Four months later, the government announced the plans for the asset sale, hoping to raise £16bn, including surplus real estate.Can Peter Mandelson be stripped of his peerage over Epstein links?Read moreButler, who penned the memo, said he was considering reporting the matter to the police. “We – that is all the people included on this email and many others – worked on the basis of trust, which allowed us to float ideas. I am disgusted by the breach of trust, presumably intended to give Epstein the chance to make money,” he told the Times.Brown said in a statement on Monday that he had asked the cabinet secretary Chris Wormald in September to investigate the potential leaks of market-sensitive information to Epstein during the global financial crisis but had been told there was no evidence available until now.The former prime minister said it was “shocking new information that has come to light” and said there was now a need for “a wider and more intensive enquiry to take place into the wholly unacceptable disclosure of government papers and information during the period when the country was battling the global financial crisis”.In another email from 9 May 2010, Epstein asked Mandelson to confirm a €500bn bailout – which the then business secretary said would be announced that evening. The following day, Mandelson also appeared to give Epstein an early tipoff about Gordon Brown’s resignation.Starmer, who has no direct power to strip Mandelson of his Lords title, is now likely to face renewed questions over his judgment in appointing Mandelson as US ambassador and his closeness to senior Labour figures, including his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and the health secretary, Wes Streeting. Mandelson only resigned his membership of the Labour party on Sunday.No 10 wrote to the Lords authorities on Monday and said that the upper chamber should urgently modernise its disciplinary procedures to strip him of his peerage.But a Lords source said there was little guidance or work undertaken about how the reforms of the disciplinary procedures should take place, despite it being included in Labour’s manifesto.Government insiders hope the senior politician will choose to stand down from the Lords of his own accord, but a No 10 source admitted they had received no assurances from Mandelson that he would voluntarily resign.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson, left, as the newly appointed secretary of state for trade and Industry in 1998, with then chancellor Gordon Brown, right.Photograph: Adam Butler/Associated PressIn another 2009 email, which has enraged his former colleagues, Mandelson said the Treasury was “digging in” on potential new taxes on bankers’ bonuses. Two days later, Epstein asked whether Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan should call the chancellor, Alistair Darling. In the reply Mandelson said he should “mildly threaten” the chancellor.The BBC’s economics editor, Faisal Islam, said he understood from conversations with the late former chancellor the call had subsequently taken place between Darling and Dimon – as well as other senior bankers – to lobby him on the new bonus curbs.The former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson said there had been suspicions about leaks during that period. “Alistair Darling and the official Treasury were always aware that investment banks had an inside track to No 10. But the brazen nature of that inside track is rather breathtaking,” he said.How the depth of Peter Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein came to lightRead moreThe chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, told the Commons on Monday that “no government minister of any political party should have, nor ever should behave in this way.”He suggested Mandelson had lied on his disclosures to government before his appointment as US ambassador. “The key thing, though, is when someone lies in their declaration of interests, there must be a consequence,” he said.There is no precedent for removing a specific person from theHouse of Lordsand it would require primary legislation. The last time that happened was during the first world war, when it was applied to a group of peers who had sided with Britain’s enemies.No timeframe has been given for the Cabinet Office review, and No 10 would not say that it should be made public. The review could include examining documents in the National Archives and speaking to Mandelson and other contemporaries in No 10 at the time he was in correspondence with Epstein.A government spokesperson said: “It is rightly for the police to determine whether to investigate and the government stands ready to provide whatever support and assistance the police need.”The FCA declined to comment. Mandelson has been asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinPeter MandelsonLabourHouse of LordsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

However, by nightfall, Reuters reported that Israel had permitted 12 Palestinians to re-enter the territory, according to Palestinian and Egyptian sources. A further 38 had not cleared security and would wait on the Egyptian side of the crossing overnight, it said.In terms of those exiting, Israel permitted five patients escorted by two relatives each to cross to the Egyptian side, the sources said. That brought the total number entering and exiting to 27. Palestinian officials blamed delays on Israeli security checks. Israel’s military had no immediate comment.Ambulances waited for hours at the border before ferrying patients across after sunset, footage from Egyptian state-run television showed. The crossing had been closed since Israeli troops seized it in May 2024, only briefly opening during a ceasefire in early 2025 for the evacuation of medical patients.About 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care hope to leave the devastated territory via the crossing, according toGazahealth officials. Thousands of other Palestinians outside the territory hope to enter and return home.When Israel took control of the Rafah crossing – Gaza’s only crossing not shared with Israel – it described it as necessary to prevent weapons smuggling by Hamas. The move isolated the territory, cutting off a critical lifeline for Palestinians seeking access to medical care, travel and trade.View image in fullscreenPalestinian patients at hospital in Khan Younis.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAIsrael has made clear that all movement through the crossing after the partial reopening will be subject to joint Israeli-Egyptian security screening and that, for now, only a small number of Gaza’s tens of thousands of wounded and ill Palestinians will be permitted to leave each day.Thousands of civilians have registered with the World Health Organization for medical evacuation. According to Médecins Sans Frontières more than one in five of them are children. The sick include more than11,000 cancer patients.Israeli airstrikes on hospitals have reduced the Palestinian healthcare system to ruins. In March 2025,Israel destroyed Gaza’s only specialised cancer treatment hospital, the territory’s sole provider of oncological care. Since then, doctors have been pushed into makeshift clinics, operating with almost no resources, including the tools needed for diagnosis.Gaza health officials saidthere were about 4,000 peoplewith official referrals for treatment to third countries who had been unable to cross the border.For some, the reopening came too late. Dalia Abu Kashef, 28, died last week while waiting for permission to cross for a liver transplant. “We found a volunteer – her brother – who was ready to donate part of his liver,” her husband, Muatasem El-Rass, told Reuters. “We were waiting for the crossing to open so we could travel and do the surgery, hoping for a happy ending. But she deteriorated badly and died.”The WHO says 900 people, including children and cancer patients,have died while awaiting evacuation.The limited reopening of the Rafah crossing also offers a rare opportunity for families torn apart by more than two years of war to reunite. Many families who fled to Cairo early in the war never expected to remain for so long. In the war’s early months before Israel shut the crossing, about 100,000 Palestinians exited to Egypt through Rafah.“I love Gaza, and I don’t see any other place that feels like home,” said Mohammad Talal, 28, a currency trader whose home in Jabalia in northern Gaza was destroyed. “Going back to live in a tent? I don’t care,” he said. “I can’t wait to take my father into my arms and place a kiss on his forehead.”Israel had kept the Rafah crossing sealed as a bargaining chip, linking its reopening to the return of all hostages taken during the Hamas-led assault of 7 October 2023 – whether alive or dead. That position shifted only last week, when the Israeli military announced it had recovered the remains ofthe final captive, Ran Gvili, a police sergeant killed during the initial attack that triggered the war.The reopening is seen as a key step as the US-brokered ceasefire agreement moves into its second phase. Its first phase called for the exchange of all hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinians held by Israel, an increase in badly needed humanitarian aid and a partial pullback of Israeli troops.The second phase of the ceasefire deal is more complicated. It calls for the installation of a new Palestinian committee to govern Gaza, the deployment of an international security force, the disarmament of Hamas and taking steps to begin rebuilding.The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said the opening of the Rafah crossing “marks a concrete and positive step in the peace plan”, for the wartorn territory. “The EU’s civilian mission is on the ground to monitor crossing operations and support Palestinian border guards,” she wrote online.The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza – a body of Palestinian technocrats tasked with helping govern the territory – welcomed the reopening of the crossing as a symbolic first step rather than a solution. In a statement posted on social media on Monday, the committee described the move as “the beginning of a long process to reconnect what has been torn apart, and to open a genuine window of hope for our people in the Gaza Strip”.The reopening of Rafah marks a tentative turning point after the fragile ceasefire agreed last October, a truce that has proved more nominal than real. Four months on, it has failed to halt the bombardment of Gaza, offering pauses rather than peace.Life in Gaza remains precarious. While airstrikes and gunfire have slowed, they have not ceased. At the same time, storms have compounded the crisis, causing deaths and flooding in displacement camps already stretched beyond their limits.The ceasefire’s brittleness was once again laid bare on Saturday, when Israeli airstrikes killed at least 32 people, including several children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said the strikes targeted militants and weapons infrastructure.Israeli forces have killed at least 509 Palestinians and wounded 1,405 more since the Gaza ceasefire took effect in early October, including hundreds of children.Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, banned from Gaza since the start of the war. Reporting from inside Gaza for international media, including the Guardian, is carried out solely by journalists who live there, hundreds of whom have been killed.Explore more on these topicsGazaEgyptIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Ever”.Nine women have come forward to accuse Gaiman of sexual misconduct, including Scarlett Pavlovich, the former nanny to Gaiman and his wife, Amanda Palmer. The couple, who have a son together, are going through a divorce.On Monday evening Gaiman posted on his Facebook author page for the first time since the allegations broke, save for a book-related post in November, to say he had “learned first-hand how effective a smear campaign can be”.“The allegations against me are completely and simply untrue. There are emails, text messages and video evidence that flatly contradict them,” he said.“These allegations, especially the really salacious ones, have been spread and amplified by people who seemed a lot more interested in outrage and getting clicks on headlines rather than whether things had actually happened or not. (They didn’t.)”Gaiman said he had hoped there would be journalistic investigations that “would take the (mountains of) evidence into account” but he had been “astonished to see how much of the reporting was simply an echo chamber, and how the actual evidence was dismissed or ignored”.He added: “One thing that’s kept me going through all this madness is the conviction that the truth would, eventually, come out.”Since the allegations were published, one of Gaiman’s comic publishers, Dark Horse, has dropped him, while DC Comics, publishers of the Sandman, pulled a planned reprint of his work from its schedule. A stage play of Gaiman’s children’s book Coraline was cancelled a year ago after the claims against him.Gaiman also revealed that, despite the condemnation he has faced and many fans turning against him, he had begun writing again and was close to finishing a new novel.“Thank you again to so many of you for your belief in my innocence and your support for my work. It has meant the world to me,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNeil GaimanAmerican GodsTortoise MedianewsShareReuse this content"

The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to putdatacenters and solar-powered satellites in spaceas a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.The announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”Musk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platformXin an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.Both SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed anexpected value of $800bnfor the company.Despitewidespread backlashto xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.Speculation and leaks about the deal,first reported by Reuters,have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.The news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week thatshowed declining revenuesand a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showedMusk exchanging numerous friendly emailswith the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.He called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.Explore more on these topicsSpaceXXElon MuskInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

I miss you’: how vivid new Epstein emails sealed Mandelson’s fateThe latest revelations and reaction to them may mean he has finally encountered a scandal he is unable to outrunDaniel BoffeyChief reporterMon 2 Feb 2026 14.18 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 19.00 ESTShareIt was the evening of 6 May 2010 and, months after being released from jail for procuring a child for prostitution,Jeffrey Epsteinwas curious as to the result of Britain’s general election.“Well?” he emailedPeter Mandelson, the then de facto deputy prime minister in Gordon Brown’s government.Twenty minutes later, and a few hours before the polls were due to close, Mandelson responded: “We are praying for a hung parliament. Alternatively, a well hung young man.”In an interview with the BBC last month that appeared to be an attempt at rehabilitation after being withdrawn as US ambassador over fresh revelations about his ties to Epstein, Mandelson insisted that he had been “at the edge of this man’s life”.If the implication was that he was insignificant to Epstein, that may be arguable. But some of the millions of fresh emails released by the US justice department seem to make clear that Epstein was right at the heart of Mandelson’s world for a number of years.Taken together, and followed by his resignation from theLabourparty and calls for a police investigation, they appear to be the epitaph for a politician who may finally have encountered a scandal he is unable to outrun.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson receives Keir Starmer at the US ambassador’s residence in Washington DC in February 2025.Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersMandelson’s relationship with the financier was professional and personal – intimate even – with the boundaries between the two blurred to the point of being non-existent.When the Labour peer seemingly believed that his then-partner, now husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva had gained access to his text messages in March 2010, it was to Epstein that he turned for help.“I have had v bad setback with R who has somehow got into my texts,” wrote Mandelson, who by then was already number two in the UK government. “What shall I do? You may need to help. How does he see them?”Epstein responded: “This email is probably compromised as well, lets talk.”On buying a new house and wondering whether he should borrow £4m at a 3% interest rate, it was again Epstein’s advice that he sought.Then there were consultations about how to build his business career when Labour lost the 2010 election. Would taking a place on the board Facebook be a good move, he asked. Got me any “deal(s) yet” he wondered in July 2011.Epstein responded: “Spent the day with Gates, in Seattle, having monstrous fun.”It was, by any measure, an intense friendship.“Need to talk, feeling confused,” Mandelson wrote in April 2009. “Where r u? I miss you”, he emailed on 22 December 2010.The drip-feed of revelations in recent months about the extent of this relationship has cost Mandelson the job he loved and the status he craves. On Monday, the most damning email yet became public.Mandelson appears to have leaked a sensitive Whitehall document to Epstein, who was still under house arrest at the time,detailing the UK government’s tax plansand intention to sell £20bn in assets.He forwarded the document in June 2009 with the comment: “Interesting note that’s gone to the PM.”Emails had already emerged over the weekend that suggested Mandelson had received three payments of $25,000 each from Epstein when he was a backbench MP in 2003 and 2004. Others showed that his partner had received thousands of pounds in 2009 and 2010 when he was business secretary.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson outside No 10 in December 2009, while business secretary.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAMandelson has said he has no recollection of the payments to him.Other emails suggested he informed Epstein of Brown’s intention to resign as prime minister hours before it was made public knowledge and advised him in 2009 that the boss of JP Morgan should “mildly threaten” the then chancellor, Alistair Darling, over a planned tax on bankers’ bonuses. He also appears to have given advance notice to Epstein of a €500bn EU bailout of the eurozone.Keir Starmer said on Monday that heshould lose his title and seat in the House of Lords, and launched an inquiry into his “conduct during his time as a government minister”.Just eight months ago, Mandelson was standing by Donald Trump’s side in the Oval Office, being complemented for “his beautiful accent” as he signed off on a trade deal that would avoid the US president’s “liberation day” tariffs.How did Epstein end up taking such a cataclysmically central role in Mandelson’s personal and professional life?Mandelson worked as a consultant for the media mogul Robert Maxwell, the owner of the Daily Mirror, in the late 1980s. Maxwell’s daughter, Ghislaine, was a social livewire with a taste for the finer things in life, as was Mandelson, and they grew fond of each other.She moved to New York in the early 1990s after her father, who had stolen millions from the Mirror pension scheme, drowned after plunging off the side of his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine.Epstein and Robert Maxwell had been business acquaintances. It seems that a romance blossomed between the late mogul’s daughter and the young financier.Mandelson was introduced to Epstein around 2001 at a summer house in Martha’s Vineyard owned by Lynn Forester de Rothschild and her husband, Evelyn.Still a central figure in the New Labour project despite two resignations from cabinet, in 1998 and 2001, Mandelson had evidently already become close to Epstein by 2003.In a 50th birthday book for him, compiled by Maxwell, Mandelson described Epstein as his “best pal”.View image in fullscreenA screengrab from Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday book shows him talking to Peter Mandelson (left).Photograph: Birthday bookBy 2008, when Epstein was convicted, Mandelson was an EU trade commissioner in Brussels. “You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can,” Mandelson wrote.The relationship certainly did not wither when he returned to the UK to be business secretary in Brown’s government. “Had a long dream about you last night,” Mandelson wrote in March 2009. “Going to GM plants today to try and assure their future.”When there were further troubles between Mandelson and his partner in July 2009, it was Epstein who picked up the phone.“I was immersed in Afghanistan … thanks for talking to Reinaldo,” Mandelson wrote. “It did him (therefore me) a lot of good. You now see the problems. I cannot talk to him about these things at all, he won’t listen. I am doing Sunday media then will call. Thanks again xxx”.Epstein responded: “I as always am there.”Mandelson was elevated further in Brown’s government in 2010 to the role of first secretary, a position that made him de facto deputy prime minister.Eleven days later, he wrote to Epstein to tell him he would be in New York. “Shall I stay at your’s Friday-Sunday this weekend?” he asked.Epstein was concerned about press “issues”. Mandelson responded: “I am in NY peivately [sic]. Sd be ok. Better ‘facilities’ at yours.”How much did the Epstein poison infect Britain? Starmer had better find out, and fast | Gaby HinsliffRead moreTheir mutually advantageous friendship remained undiminished after the election defeat.“Need a Lord on the board,” Mandelson asked of Epstein in one email of that period.“Are you enjoying yourself,” he asked in another on 28 July 2010. “Oh boy,” responded Epstein.In August 2011, Mandelson wrote to Epstein to say he had met a mutual friend at a lunch with Nat Rothschild, the son of Jacob and Serena Rothschild of the banking dynasty.“Mentioned you at lunch and she raced my comment that you are one of my best friends and said you are the nicest and cleverest people she knows and how much you and taught her [sic],” he wrote.In April 2012, Epstein emailed Mandelson. “How are things going? he asked. Mandelson responded that he was at the China Boao forum in Hainan, where he was “trying to make an honest living”. “Trying something new,” Epstein answered. “Indeed,” he responded.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinLabournewsShareReuse this content"

As did Raye, who earlier in the week received the Harry Belafonte best song for social change award for Ice Cream Man.View image in fullscreenLola Young accepts her award for best pop solo performance at the 68th Grammy awards.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersSince it opened in the 90s with a focus on the performing and creative arts, the Brit school has become Britain’s most potent launchpad for global stardom. The list of alumni reads like a who’s who of British talent: Adele, Amy Winehouse, Jessie J, Tom Holland, Leona Lewis, and Loyle Carner are among those who honed their craft within its classrooms.Even artists who never attended the institution have referenced it, such as Ed Sheeran, who in his breakthrough track You Need Me, I Don’t Need You, cheekily rapped: “I will blast and I didn’t go to Brit school.”For Stuart Worden, a teacher at the school since 1994 and its principal since 2012, this year’sGrammyswere “a brilliant celebration” of free arts education. “Those women are fantastic role models of what’s achievable if you give young people access to the arts,” he said.WhileFKA twigswas only briefly at the school, Worden keenly remembers Dean, Young and Raye (real name Rachel Keen) who all joined as 14-year-olds. “They started in year 10, all pretty close together,” he said. “Lola and Olivia stayed for sixth form, Raye left after her GCSEs because she was already on her way and making money from her music.”Dean, who blends soul, jazz and pop styles, is the first British performer to win best new act at the Grammys since Dua Lipa in 2019, and multiple singles from her sophomore album The Art of Loving entered the UK Top 10 simultaneously. Young’s breakthrough hit Messy topped global charts, whileRayeis already a seven-time Brit award winner.“What stood out about all of them was their great work ethic,” Worden said. “None of these artists are overnight successes. They’ve played small venues, they’ve worked on records for years.”View image in fullscreenFKA twigs, who briefly attended the Brit school, picked up an award for her album Eusexua.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersIs it obvious when a student is going to become a huge star? “I don’t think so,” he said. “What Olivia, Raye and Lola have in common is that they all, from quite an early age, wanted to write about the things that matter to them.”The Brit school, he added, aimed to nurture young people to find their own voice. “What do you care about? The next bit is up to them. Raye won a Grammy for Ice Cream Man, which is an unflinching look at harassment. Lola’s song has connected with people because she’s being really honest about the challenges of life, smiling with passion about being ‘messy’. Olivia writes about the complexities of love. They are not manufactured, they are themselves and that’s powerful.”Though there are no classes on how to be a megastar, students are instilled with professional standards and values such as kindness. “If you allow people to be kind and open to emotion, that creates possibilities,” Worden said.The Grammys riled Donald Trump – but the big winners were chosen for their music, not politicsRead moreAll three women are still in contact and work with the school. “I can remember Raye, when she was 14, saying, ‘I’m going to do this, sir’,” Worden said. “And weirdly, she still calls me ‘sir’. We were chatting the other day because she wants some of our students to come and see her new show.” He said alumni felt attached to the school because of the spirit of collaboration it fostered. “Olivia met her bass player Finn [Zeferino-Birchall] in the canteen, Adele met her guitarist here when they were 16.”Former Brit school students have sold almost 300m albums, have racked up more than 70bn streams across online platforms, and won dozens of high-profile awards such as Grammys, Baftas, Oscars, Oliviers and Brits. Students study core subjects alongside their art specialism, with more than 200 shows or events each year.The school prides itself on diversity: 40% of 1,450 students are of global majority heritage, 50% from income-deprived backgrounds, and a third have a SEN diagnosis.Worden said: “We as a country need many different voices in the arts. Giving access to those from low-income or neurodiverse backgrounds creates opportunities that might not otherwise exist.”Explore more on these topicsMusicGrammy awards 2026GrammysFKA twigsOlivia DeanRayeArts in schoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

Birds can’t be Christians, they said. It’s the most complaints we ever got’Interviews by Simon BlandMon 2 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 12.16 ESTShareBob Mortimer,writer, hostThe first time I saw what was to become Shooting Stars wasVic Reeves– AKA Jim Moir – doing The Big Quiz during Vic Reeves Big Night Out live. I’d never seen anything like it. It was full of meaningless questions and had an attitude. I remember thinking: “There must be something we could do with that.”We got lucky. We were doing a Vic and Bob Christmas TV special and thought we might be able to get away with having that “Big Quiz”. It must have had something as the BBC approached us saying: “We think you could do this as a show.”I’d make the prizes myself. The art department would say: ‘We can do that better. You’re making us look really bad’It was the most intense writing we ever did. We’d sit for hours trying to think up true or false questions, but because we loved it we were happy to give it the time it needed.Jim put George Dawes, played by Matt Lucas, in the romper suit, but after that, anything you see him wearing was Matt’s choice. We wouldn’t know what he was going to wear or say. He would come to me before filming and say: “At some point, can you ask me if I like going to the cinema?” I never let him tell me what this was setting up. Then we were genuinely in hysterics on the show because we hadn’t heard it before.Team captain Mark Lamarr was a gift. Being deadpan is in his nature. He’s not easily impressed. Ulrika Jonsson, the other team captain, actually gave a toss about the show, which was unexpected. She wanted to win.View image in fullscreen‘We were genuinely in hysterics’ … Matt Lucas as George Dawes in 1996.Photograph: Sportsphoto/AllstarLots happened that the guests couldn’t prepare for. We’d sabotage their seats. A good chunk of them would say: “My children love it. I had to go on.” Others were on publicity rounds and I suppose their agents chose the wrong show. Larry Hagman, who played JR in Dallas, seemed unsure of what was going on but went along with it. People always say they’re glad they did it. They may be lying.The challenges were fabulous. I remember dropping cheeses on guests. We pretended to put people in a cage with a monkey and they were terrified. We once wanted to bring a horse into the studio but were told we couldn’t in case it bolted. I don’t know where the Dove from Above round came from. We just thought it’d be funny.There’s before and after Shooting Stars. It altered the parameters for the fun that should be had and the imagination that could be used on panel shows. It was one of the few places where you got a little glimpse into what a celebrity was really like.Jim MoirAKA Vic Reeves,writer, hostWe intended Shooting Stars as a one-off but it worked well so we carried on. When we filmed Big Night Out, we wouldn’t show scripts to the crew, which they hated because they didn’t know where to put the cameras. We did the same with Shooting Stars. We’d say: “Something’s going to happen here but we’re not telling you what.”No one knew about stuff until we did it. I put a stink bomb in Stephen Fry’s shoe that absolutely stunk out the studio. I had a stuffed buzzard with a crucifix around its neck and Christians complained saying: “Birds can’t be Christians.” It’s the most complaints we ever got.I came up with the name George Dawes so we could say his mum was Marjorie Dawes, the dreadful dietician in Little Britain. We didn’t hear his songs until the night.Peanuts is my favourite. There’s nothing to it apart from him saying “Peanuts”. We were creased up.Guests would have too many in the green room – knowing they might be in for an ordealBob had seen Ulrika presenting the weather and having a laugh. We thought she looked like she had gravitas. Mark had leftThe Word. I said: “Could you start filming next week?” He said: “Yeah.” It was as easy as that. I got the feeling he didn’t think any of it was funny. Calling him a 1950s throwback was a throwaway comment that stuck. “Ulrika-ka-ka” was Bob trying to do a song echo. We told them to have a go at us: they’d give back as good as they got.A few guests had too many in the green room because they knew they might be in for some kind of ordeal. Bee Gee Robin Gibb would only appear if we promoted his new single, so we paused everything during the show, listened to it, then went: “Right, let’s carry on.” Rubbing my knees came from a kids’ Christmas record where you could hear some old fella rubbing his legs as he sang. I thought it was really funny. It became a regular thing. Same with raising handbags and going “Ooooh!” People still do that but I don’t think they know where it comes from.We needed some sound or word to end rounds so I just said “Eranu” and “Uvavu” and Bob said, “That’ll do.” I saw Paul Shane on Pebble Mill at One doing You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling. He was proper like those old club singers, so I started doing songs in that style. Mark would always guess them right, no matter how disjointed they were.I’d sometimes make the prizes myself. The art department would say: “I can make that look better.” But I’d say: “No.” Same with makeup. I liked drawing lines on my face. They’d said: “You’re making us look really bad.”The show was an antidote to comedy. It was a format people could get their head around – and then we went sideways with it.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeVic ReevesBob MortimerComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shortly after the conclusion of the ceremony’s live broadcast in the US, there he was on Truth Social, calling it “the worst”, “garbage”, “unwatchable” andthreatening to sue host Trevor Noah.Perhaps that was the reaction the Recording Academy wanted. You could, if you wished, divine a certain Maga-baiting intent not just in the decision to give the album of the year award toBad Bunny– a Puerto Rican who attracted criticism from the Trump administration after he was booked to headline the SuperBowl LX half-time show – but the choice of the Buena Vista Social Club, a Broadway hit based on the 1997 album of the same name featuring veteran Cuban musicians, as the best musical theatre album: the latter two weeks after the New York Times reported that Cubans settled in Florida are being deported in record numbers.Then again, neither win was an upset. Bad Bunny might be the first Latin artist to win the album award, but Debí Tirar Más Fotos was both wildly critically acclaimed – it had already been voted the best album of 2025 by Billboard and Rolling Stone, a suitable reward for its frankly head-spinning eclecticism, in which the author leaps dramatically between salsa performed by a live orchestra and house rhythms, bachata and reggaeton, the folky strains of jibaro and gleaming electro-pop, creating a unique musical fusion between the past and the present day and topping it with pointed lyrics about the relationship between Puerto Rico and the US. It was also hugely commercially successful: a US No 1, it sold more than 300,000 copies in a space of two weeks. Meanwhile, Buena Vista Social Club’s win comes on the back of the show itself winning five Tony awards – ultimately, both awards were given on considerable merit, rather than voters trying to annoy Trump.View image in fullscreenQueen Latifah, Q-Tip and Kendrick Lamar backstage.Photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyKendrick Lamar was the most nominated artist of the year and ended up going home with record of the year, best rap album, best rap song and best melodic rap performance – making this the second painful year in a row for Drake, Lamar’s thwarted foe in the decade’s biggest rap beef. Drake’s collaborative album with PartyNextDoor, Some Sexy Songs 4 U, was largely absent from the nominations (just one for best melodic rap performance), while host Noah made a gag about declining to roast Lamar for fear of how he might respond. But as with Bad Bunny, Lamar won on merit: tracks from his GNX album occupied the entire Top Five of the US singles chart when they were released, a reflection of quite how good the album is. A distinct emotional shift away from the self-doubt of 2022’s Mr Morale & the Big Steppers into spectacular swagger, filled with wit and sharp wordplay – likely energised by the beef itself – GNX seemed on the surface far less complex than either its predecessor or the album that’s regularly acclaimed as Lamar’s masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly, but it still displayed a striking musical breadth. There was room for both the experimental abstraction of its title track and the earworm pop melody of Luther, the SZA collaboration that won record of the year (announced by Cher, wrongly and amusingly, as being for Luther Vandross).A Lamar guest spot probably helped Clipse to take home best rap performance for Chains and Whips, but the award underlined the standard set by the duo’s comeback albumLet God Sort Em Out, the strength of their storytelling and their technical brilliance as rappers, qualities that have often felt undervalued in latter-day hip-hop, and displayed in their performance of So Far Ahead at the ceremony. It was a pretty radical shift from this year’s broadly upbeat and celebratory live performances, given how bleak and tough its depiction of life on the margins is, and how many references to drug dealing the lyrics contain.View image in fullscreenBillie Eilish and her collaborator and brother Finneas.Photograph: Ariana Ruiz/PI/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockElsewhere, there were perhaps signs of a certain musical shift in Turnstile’s victories in both best rock album and best metal performance: it’s the first time a hardcore punk band has even been nominated in either category, let alone triumphed, albeit one who dabble in the kind of things that would once have been considered forbidden under hardcore’s hard and fast rules, including flute solos and Auto-Tune. But tradition reigned in the song of the year category, as Billie Eilish’s acoustic guitar-driven Wildflower beat a host of more straightforwardly electronic prospects – despite being released in 2024, it was deemed eligible because the Academy decided it “came to prominence” in 2025 – among them Golden by Huntr/x, the cartoon female trio fromNetflix film KPop Demon Hunters.Anti-ICE protests, brilliance by Bieber and the Dalai Lama’s first win: the 10 biggest moments at the 2026 GrammysRead moreIf the astonishing success of said film seemed to suggest that the K-pop industry might shift its attention away from actual human artists – who have started showing a tendency to complain about some of the more high-handed practices employed by South Korea’s entertainment companies – towards animated characters, theGrammysseemed intent on viewing it merely as a film, rather than a potential future path for pop. Also overlooked in the best pop duo/group performance category, the only award the movie soundtrack took home was best song written for visual media.One other question hung over the 2026 Grammys: how different might the list of nominees and winners have looked had Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl been released a few weeks earlier, and thus qualified for this year’s awards. On the one hand, it was the fastest-selling album in history, the biggest-selling album of the year, and spawned The Fate of Ophelia, which spent 10 weeks at the top of the US singles chart. On the other, it was greeted with a decidedly lukewarm critical reception: even the most ardent Swiftie would have a hard job claiming it among her best efforts. The question of whether overwhelming commercial success would beat out artistic merit in the Recording Academy’s eyes will presumably be answered next year.Explore more on these topicsGrammy awards 2026GrammysPop and rockRapHip-hopPunkBad BunnycommentShareReuse this content"

And how does damp January go then?Moderation, as opposed to abstinence.To be honest, I normally only get to about 5 Januaryanyway (unless there’s a weekend before then). Do you haveany evidence? Whereis this coming from?From Waitrose, as it happens.Nice middle-class evidence then.Go on.Waitrose reportsa “significant softening” of the dry January trend.How soft are we talking?Alcoholsales in January this year, compared to other months, were down just 25%.That still seems like a significant drop, no?It’s less so when compared with, say, January 2022, when alcohol sales were 42% lower on average. And the 2026 data suggests that of the 58% of the UK public aiming to cut back, a significant proportion (31%) opted for a damp January rather than a totally dry one.I still think it might have something to do with all the rain we’ve had this year. Plus, possibly geopolitics. It’s hard not to give in when it’s so miserable out there.This is not just a UK thing:a survey of 1,869 American adultsby consumer research firm Curion in late December found that people are no longer asking: “Can I go 30 days without drinking?”Doesn’t January have 31 days?Hmmm, you could be right. Anyway, people are now asking: “How do I feel when I drink less – and what do I replace it with?”Damp is the new dry?That’s exactly what Pierpaolo Petrassi said.Waitrose’s head of beers, wines and spirits?The very same. And Petrassi went on to say that customers are moving “away from the ‘all-or-nothing’ mentality and instead look towards more mindful ‘damp’ moderation.”Sounds more like a wellness trend than a test of willpower.Exactly. Katie Fellowes …Senior vice-president of strategic insights at Curion?Yes!I’d rather be head of beers, wines and spirits. But anyway ...Fellowes says that people electing for moderation over abstinence are more motivated by health – physical and mental – than diehard Dry Janners.And arealso less likely to fail?Quite. Cutting back rather than cutting out “delivers many of the benefits they want without the sense of punishment,” she says.Do say:“I’ll drink to that.”Don’t say:“Yeah, go on then, and another …”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We don’t blame you – January’s Arctic blasts and grey skies haven’t exactly been tempting us back outdoors. So it makes perfect sense that you’ve been looking for duvets, slippers and pyjamas to up the cosiness factor. Even when you’ve had to travel, you’ve wanted to snuggle down for a nap in a scarf-like neck pillow. Here are the things you loved the most this month.The concealer to tackle January’s dark circlesView image in fullscreenCharlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Radiant concealer£22.40 at John Lewis£28 at Charlotte TilburyIn her roundup of thebest concealers, beauty writer Sarah Matthews chose this Charlotte Tilbury option as her top pick for tackling dark circles. So no surprise it was your top choice too in a month where we’re forced to get up in the dead of night. Rather than just covering dark circles, this concealer contains hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and vitamin C to hydrate, plump and brighten the skin. “If you’re wearing makeup anyway,” wrote Sarah, “why not invest in a multitasker?” It’s pricey per millilitre, though.The luxury duvetView image in fullscreenWoolroom Deluxe wool all seasons double duvetDouble, £258 at Heal’sBedding seems like a wise investment in winter, when you’re so loth to leave your bed. But your favourite was a surprise: not for youPanda’s the Cloud duvet, winner of the test, which Jane loved so much she bought it. No, for you, only luxury would do: Woolroom’s Deluxe three-in-one multi-season duvet. “Its percale cotton cover has a deliciously premium feel,” wrote Jane in her test of thebest duvets. “Its traceable British wool filling is naturally hypoallergenic, temperature-regulating and sustainable.”The slippers you can wear with socksView image in fullscreenRegatta solace slippers£12 at Regatta£12 at Debenhams“I’m a big fan of a mule slipper you can wear at the same time as your chunkiest sock, especially in the depths of winter,” wrote Ellie Violet Bramley in our guide tothe best slippers. And it seems you are too, with this pair among your favourites this month.The lace bodysuitView image in fullscreenMila body£46 at John Lewis“Lace works best when it feels like a secret, so resist the urge to overshare,” wrote Jess Cartner-Morley ina recent column. A long-sleeved black lace bodysuit has “turned out to be one of the most useful pieces in my evening wear wardrobe,” she adds. “I wear it under sleeveless dresses to make them work in winter – I hate being cold, but this is also handy if you don’t love your arms.”The steamer to freshen your clothing (and bed)View image in fullscreenPhilips 3000 Series clothes steamer£29.99 at John Lewis£38 at ArgosIn the second instalment of our newHow I Shop column, Jo Malone picked a clothes steamer as her most-used gadget. “Not only do I steam my clothes,” she told us, “but I like my bed steamed every day so the sheets are fresh and clean.” An appealing prospect in a month where we’ve all been bed-obsessed.The budget hand creamView image in fullscreenE45 Repairing hand cream£5.99 at Boots£5.99 at AmazonOur hands often bear the brunt of winter weather, with cold winds and central heating making them dry and even painful. E45’s simple fragrance-free formula “was immediately cooling and hydrating, like a refreshing drink of water for the hands,” wrote Sarah Matthews in her recent test ofthe best hand creams. It was also less than £10, and your favourite from the piece.The cosy pyjamas for men …View image in fullscreenFlannel pyjama set£27.95 at Seasalt CornwallA matching pair of pyjamas brings an air of respectability to an all-day lounging session. “This pair comes in flannel, so it’s a real winter warmer,” wrote stylist and menswear expert Peter Bevan in his guide to thebest men’s pyjamas. There are four colourways available, although stock is running a little low.… and for womenView image in fullscreenDouble-gauze pyjamas£39.95 at Muji“If I could only wear one pair of pyjamas for the rest of my life, it would be these,” wrote Kate McCusker in her guide to thebest women’s pyjamas. “Putting on the soft, textured cotton is like cocooning yourself in a cloud.” Perfect if you’re spending the whole day in bed.The comfy travel pillowView image in fullscreenTrtl travel pillow£49.99 at TrtlFilter reviewer Pete Wise can never be accused of sleeping on the job while testing products for us, whether he’s throwingsuitcasesoff ladders, jumping on trampolines withreusable coffee cupsor playing arcade games to testtravel pillows. But “it felt weirdly comfortable to wear this travel pillow while playing After Burner Climax at the arcade,” he wrote. “Laying my head to one side while shooting down CGI aircraft was a genuinely dreamy experience.” He also said the “exceptionally soft” fleece was “the most comfortable material I encountered during testing”.The bargain walking bootsView image in fullscreenRegatta Holcombe III£40 at DebenhamsFrom £40 at DecathlonOK, so it looks like some of you are leaving the house. Or planning to, anyway. This pair was chosen by outdoors expert Sian Lewis as her top budget pick in her recent test of thebest women’s walking boots. While they’re not designed for technical or rocky ground, “they come into their own on casual country walks and spring and summer treks,” wrote Sian, and are a great choice for your first pair of walking boots.The corduroy jeansView image in fullscreenBarrel-leg jeans£63 at Nobody’s ChildLooking stylish during cold weather is no mean feat, but the Filter’s fashion writer Charlotte Gornall always pulls it off. She shared her tips onhow to dress while keeping warm– and you loved her suggestion to swap denim for corduroy. “Corduroy jeans are great winter warmers, as the ribbed texture naturally traps heat,” she wrote.Our favourite beard trimmerView image in fullscreenPhilips Beardtrimmer 9000 Prestige£89.99 at John Lewis£89.99 at AmazonAs we shed our pyjamas and head back into the real world, a trimmer “can make the difference between looking likeWorzel Gummidgeand maintaining a well-kept look”, wrote our reviewer Edward Munn in his test of thebest beard trimmers.

Starmer had better find out, and fastGaby HinsliffSerious questions need to be asked about Mandelson, Andrew and what the PM knew when. The credibility of UK politics is on the lineMon 2 Feb 2026 14.41 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 18.58 ESTSharePeter Mandelson did not want, he wrote disdainfully to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, to “live by salary alone”. Not for him the life of the little guy, slave to a mere six-figure salary: he had always aspired to something grander, a lifestyle well beyond his means, to which rich men such as Epstein were so often his passport.First it was his millionaire colleague, Geoffrey Robinson, from whom Mandelsonsecretly borrowed moneyto buy a house he couldn’t afford. In 2003 and 2004 it was Epstein, at least according to files released in the US this week, suggesting the financier paid £55,000 into Mandelson’s bank account, though he now says he can’t find records of it. Five years later, in 2010, the files record Mandelson confiding in Epstein of hishopes for a gigwith merchant bankers JP Morgan, where he could leverage his “networks” to make the really big deals.How lucky, then, that he hadallegedly been so helpful to Wall Street just a few months earlier at the height of the banking crisis: passing on inside snippets of government thinking during the crash, according once again to those telltale files, and suggesting via Epstein (at the time recently released from jail) that JP Morgan should “mildly threaten” the British chancellor, Alistair Darling, to get around a proposed ban on bankers’ bonuses. Meanwhile, the files record Mandelson’s partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva,asking Epstein for £10,000for an osteopathy course and a laptop, which the latter promises to wire over immediately. No such gift was ever declared, and Mandelson insists hehas no recordof it. But what’s striking about the email is its casualness, almost as though da Silva were one of the dreaded wage slaves, filing his expenses.And so the man with a rightful claim to have co-created the modern Labour party has quit it, seemingly before it could quit him. Like the former Prince Andrew, he is now effectively banished from court,facing the lossof his title. There is surely no coming back for either man from an affair that encapsulates everyone’s worst suspicions about the relationship between wealth, power and the suffering in this case of young girls trampled in the process. But exile is not enough. There will be no restoring the public’s shattered trust without a full and formal investigation into both men’s conduct, free to go wherever it leads, no matter how embarrassing for the British establishment. Gordon Brown hasnow calledfor such an inquiry into Mandelson’s conduct.As a gay man, Mandelson has argued he was never likely to witness the side of Epstein’s life described by Virginia Giuffre, who detailed her experience as a young girl of being groomed, abused and passed around Epstein’s powerful friends “like a platter of fruit”. But the money is a different story, leaving a trail that should be easy enough for the relevant authorities to follow. (Though he loftily suggests that the alleged cash gifts require “investigating by me”, the last person who should be investigating Peter Mandelson is Peter Mandelson.)Given the seriousness of the allegations now surrounding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – including those of a woman whocame forward this weekto claim that, when she was in her 20s, Epstein sent her to Britain to sleep with him, a story clearly echoing Giuffre’s – meanwhile, it is astounding that the only professional interrogation he has faced came courtesy of Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis. How hard would it be for British detectives to establish where a man famously guarded round the clock by police protection officers was on the night he is accused of meeting Giuffre?Everyone in British public life should be acutely aware of the dangerous emotions stirred by talk of sex trafficking among the rich and powerful. It’s catnip to conspiracy theorists, who see their wild-eyed imaginings about so-called global elites vindicated, and the combination of this scandal with the white heat of an angry byelection in Gorton and Denton, where Reform UK may well try again to weaponise anger about grooming gangs, is potentially explosive. Under those conditions, nobody should seek to exploit the pain of Epstein’s young victims for their own political ends, includingLabourpoliticians.But there are legitimate questions to be asked not just about Mandelson’s behaviour inside the last Labour government, but about what exactly Keir Starmer and his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, knew when he was appointed US ambassador just last year. His friendship with Epstein was common enough knowledge to come up in vetting. Did they decide, in the end, that the risk was worth it? Do they still think that now, reading emails that heap shame on the Labour party, and can only stoke the anger building against Starmer on his own backbenches?The Epstein files expose just how cheap corruption is in the UKRead moreWith little sign of prosecution pending for the men for whom these girls were procured, meanwhile, all this week’s data dump does is fuel people’s worst suspicions about how the super-rich behave in private, without the release of feeling that justice has been done.Scrolling through these fawning exchanges between Epstein and his famous friends, so many seemingly anxious either for invites to his island or for his money, makes me feel almost grubby by association. I can’t imagine how it would feel reading them as a victim of sexual abuse. How does a mother of daughters not much older than Epstein’s victims, as Sarah Ferguson was, find herself sending gushing emails to the man who regularly settled her debts even after his conviction, ending with the words “just marry me”? Why is Richard Branson making jokes about bringing “your harem” to a man convicted of sex offences? Why did so many people seemingly struggle to believe he did what a court said he had, or live up to their public promises about ending the friendship?Alongside an inquiry that gets to the bottom of Epstein’s role in British public life, the prime minister now needs to demonstrate something more like moral leadership: to offer some sense of catharsis, not just for Epstein’s victims but for all those who have suffered at the hands of men like him.If the political system can’t now articulate and share in the anger the public feels, then it risks leaving the truly corrosive impression that this is just how everyone in power behaves behind closed doors; that the curious inability to seeJeffrey Epsteinfor what he was is more feature than bug of a system looking after its own. For all that we have learned this week, I still don’t believe that to be true. But we are long past the point of expecting people to take that on trust.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And the excuses of ignorance and amnesia are looking a little thinMon 2 Feb 2026 12.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 13.26 ESTShareThe release of documents related to the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein has proceeded like a bankruptcy – first very slow, and then very fast;3m items were dropped by the US Justice Departmentlast Friday.It’s interesting how many figures in public life have maintained they barely knew Epstein at all, since his arrest and death by suicide in 2019. It’s just about plausible from a business associate, I guess; you can imagine those relationships being pretty thin, emotionally speaking, revolving as they were around money.But can you imagine having lunch, multiple times, with someone you barely know? Would you extend an open invitation to your house, in a chatty email referring to an apparently metaphorical harem, to someone you’d only met in a group setting “such as a charity tennis event”, which is what Richard Branson maintains? I don’t know how happy I’d be, sitting in my dressing gown with someone who I barely knew, as Peter Mandelson did; I guess, if I’d recently travelled on their private plane, that might have been an opportunity to deepen the acquaintanceship.The strategy for the names contained within these files must be to keep their heads down and hope that someone more famous, or with a more significant role in government, or whose behaviour was more egregious, takes all the heat. In the UK, that’s currently working for everyone, except for the Andrew formerly known as Prince; his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson; and Mandelson, who announced at the weekend that he’dresigned his membership of the Labour party. He did not want to “cause further embarrassment”, he said, which gives rise to the question: how would it be possible for this to be any more embarrassing?Lisa Bloom on the fight for Epstein’s victims: ‘So many powerful men were enablers’Read moreThe sheer amount Mandelson can’t remember is astronomical. He can’t put his finger on the date, time or circumstance of his standing in a T-shirt and his Y-fronts, consulting what looks like an iPad (not trying to get all forensic, just saying it’s unlikely to be the 90s), alongside a woman whose face has been redacted. He has no “record or recollection” of payments totalling £55,000 from Epstein in the early 00s, and nothing to add to his 2009 email reminding the unaccountably wealthy man that a £10,000 payment to Mandelson’s now husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, should beframed as a loan to avoid declaration as a gift. “Like everyone else, I learned the actual truth about him after his death,” Mandelson told the BBC recently. In fact, that is unlike everyone else, who knew that in 2008 Epstein had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution.It is my duty to remind you that being pictured or mentioned in the Epstein files is not an indicator of any wrongdoing – but also, stepping outside that duty, we’re allowed to say that this stuff stinks. A nurse in the NHS isn’t allowed to takea gift worth more than a box of chocolatesfrom a patient, lest public services be vulnerable to corruption. So how does it not absolutely stink, for the then business secretary of the United Kingdom to go to a convicted American criminal for a loan, which he would have had no problem securing from a high street bank?A photo of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, on all fours over a woman who could be any age (her head is out of shot) but doesn’t look his age, put it that way, absolutely stinks. An email from Sarah Ferguson, sayingshe needs £20,000or her landlord will go to the newspapers – in the nauseating semi-euphemistic, semi-chummy, semi-entitled language of the indigent posh, “any brainwaves?” – stinks.These cash amounts wouldn’t have meant anything to a man worth $578m when he died. Maybe Epstein distributed them out of a surfeit of human generosity, or maybe he thought they engendered relationships that would be valuable to him should his reputation ever be at stake. The bargain-bucket price tag on some consciences is depressing. And everyone, everywhere, still denies “wrongdoing”, but it would be fascinating to hear which bit of this they think is right.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You bet!Jason OkundayeFamous people who speak out are often derided, but throughout time artists have used the platform they have. And if not now, when?Mon 2 Feb 2026 10.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 13.26 ESTShareOne of the most discordant and yet banal things about looking to the US today is how celebrity, its greatest cultural output, largely carries on as normal amid scenes of profound distress. Award ceremonies are televised, bespoke couture is pulled for the red carpet, some new film fills your social media timeline. It feels galling that a country can encompass such a sense of anguish at the same time as such glamour and wonder. And given that we are condemned to witness ICE’s transformation into a lethal, paramilitary force, such an event as the 68th Grammy awards, broadcast last night, feels at once insignificant and more important than ever as all the world watches.The Grammys saw perhaps the most uninhibited and genuinely furious rebuke of ICE and Donald Trump that we have seen so far from celebrity figures – particularly considering that just last month, the Golden Globes was viewed as having largelyignored politics, save for a few “ICE Out” pins worn by stars including Ariana Grande and Mark Ruffalo. Grammy attendees went further. Billie Eilish followed up her call for celebrities tospeak up against ICE, saying that “no one is illegal on stolen land … I feel that we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, our voices do matter and the people matter.” Perhaps most movingly, considering his stated concern around the mass deportation of Latino people,album of the year winner Bad Bunnysaid: “ICE out. We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we are humans and we are Americans … the only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.” These came alongside celebrations of immigration fromOlivia Deanand Shaboozey.There is the blunt question of how consequential any kind of celebrity political activism is. Celebrities speaking on mass platforms can, of course, help to normalise a discourse and unveil what is occurring to those whose engagement with the news may only be through culture. Yet it has always been viewed as a limited approach. In 2024, Saturday Night Live mocked the“teeny tiny statement pin”favoured by celebrities on the red carpet, skewering it for evidencing a commitment to saying something while saying as little as possible. But even when the statements are loud and unequivocal, there is still the same chorus: why should any of us care about what celebrities have to say?2:02Grammy awards 2026: Bad Bunny and Kendrick Lamar win big as musicians take aim at ICE – videoCynicism is warranted, considering how American spectacle has functioned more as a redirection of interest away from atrocity rather than a tool for politicisation: consider the Rafah airstrikes two years ago in Gaza, which occurred asmillions of Americans celebrated the Super Bowl, which had run ads from the Israeli government. There is also the fact thatcelebrity enthusiasm for Kamala Harris– from “Kamala is brat”, to Taylor Swift’s “childless cat lady” post, to Megan Thee Stallion’s rally performance in Atlanta, Georgia – now figures prominently in diagnoses of why the campaign was a complete failure.Anti-ICE protests, brilliance by Bieber and the Dalai Lama’s first win: the 10 biggest moments at the 2026 GrammysRead moreYet in spite of all of this, celebrity voices against ICE feel important. The terror inflicted by ICE is a far more visceral subject than an election campaign.ICE’s expansionhas outpaced mechanisms to check its power, making all forms of resistance more urgent. It is not necessarily that anti-ICE activists need Hollywood’s seal of approval. But Trump evidently does – he recognises that art and culture are crucial frontiers in his bid for domination. It is one that will never succeed, no matter how many acolytes he sends to infiltrate the renamed Trump-Kennedy Center, despite his attempts to make an event ofMelania’s trashy documentary, and even if he’s managed to win over rapperNicki Minaj.Writing on Truth Social after the event, Trump said: “The Grammy Awards are the WORST, virtually unwatchable! CBS is lucky not to have this garbage litter their airwaves any longer”, and added that he wouldinstruct lawyers to sue host Trevor Noahover his joke that “Trump wants Greenland … because Epstein’s island is gone he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton”. He is probably due another tantrum after this Sunday’s Super Bowl half-time show.Clearly, for the Puerto Rican Bad Bunny or the Nigerian Shaboozey, the tyranny of ICE is deeply personal, and they have a right, like anyone, to make their views known. Indeed, Bad Bunny’sNUEVAYoLis a tribute to the Puerto Rican diaspora in New York City, with the accompanying music video criticising anti-immigrant sentiment. So perhaps it is something of a misnomer to reduce this to “celebrity” activism when these people, really, are speaking as artists. Art has always had a core, contested function in politics. And who wants artists to put up and shut up more than Trump?Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsGrammy awards 2026OpinionICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)commentShareReuse this content"

In one, Melania Trump releases aglossy documentary, Melania, an account of her return to the White House. Amazon outbid others to secure the rights to the documentary,spending $75m(£54m) in total, and ticket sales so far suggest that this was, shall we say, not a purely commercial venture.In the other, the Washington Post is set tocut up to 200 jobsearly this month, including the majority of its foreign staff and a sizeable chunk of its newsroom. Both Melania and the Washington Post are backed by Jeff Bezos. His two decisions, to invest in state propaganda and divest from the fourth estate that supposedly holds power to account, reveal much about how capital and authoritarianism join forces to decide what audiences read and see.Trouble is afoot at another legacy US media outlet, CBS News. In July of last year, tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally Larry Ellison and his Hollywood producer son, David,took over Paramount, which oversees CBS News. The former New York Times columnist and, more recently, founder of anti-woke blog the Free Press, Bari Weiss, was parachuted in to run CBS News. She promptly ran into trouble, as she took on veterans of a channel that produces such storied programmes as 60 Minutes, and tried to justify editorial decisions that were seen asslanted in favourof the Trump administration. Weiss is now also expected to makecuts to the newsroom.The telling thing is what will remain in these institutions, what is to be emphasised. Weiss has announced that she has added a host of opinion writers and wants to put “huge emphasis on scoops … crucially scoops of ideas. Scoops of explanation.” In short: more heat, less light. The opinion section of the Washington Post is also of interest to Bezos, whoannounced last yearthat its pages would “be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets … viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others”.America has reached a tipping point on fascism – and on opposition to it | Robert ReichRead moreNot, as a columnist, to be a turkey voting for Christmas, but this fetishisation of opinion writing is a bad sign. Points of view should sit in tandem with domestic and global news coverage. News coverage should not be used for partisan ends or cannibalised for commentary. But, more than anything else, the pivot is a symptom of a rightwing-owned media that no longer seeks to report on the world as it is, but creates the world as it wishes it to be.Trump regime talking points in favour of “domestic terrorists”being deservedly killedon US streets are treated as matters of opinion that simply must be aired. Reality itself has become twisted and contestable. What people have witnessed with their eyes and ears is questioned by rolling commentary of lies and conjecture, given the imprimatur of truth through being shown or printed on credible platforms.But this move from news to opinion is part of something wider. Politics has become a performance of narrative about who is friend and who is foe. It taps into the public’s emotions by agitating and provoking fear. Channelling and emphasising these feelings then becomes the business of the media. All the while, actual power structures remain unchallenged. This is what Walter Benjamin called the “aestheticisation of politics” under fascism.Everywhere you look in this age of tech-mogul-owned media, decisions follow these fascistic tastes. What use is foreign coverage, an expensive and time-intensive effort, when the wider world is viewed as a place of enemies and freeloaders that must either be cut off or brought to heel? Who cares about long-form investigations into abuses of power? Or features exploring the details of people’s lives elsewhere?The impact is a degradation of the very way humans communicate with and about each other. Knowledge about and affinity with others are things to be excised under authoritarianism. So, too, is artistic expression, as with Trump’s takeover of whatwas the Kennedy Centerand theassault on the Smithsonian. What some see as old and venerable US institutions, the right sees as organs of an ancien regime to be repurposed. This is what happens in coups – all that is associated with the values and style of the old order is uprooted.Autocracy slowly grinds and spits out all that is impertinent. Billionaires, who have amassed way more money and power than is healthy for a democracy, own the machines. Those who service them are misfits, useful idiots and attention seekers. This grinding will be sold as pragmatism, simply giving readers and viewers what they want. In a world where legacy media finances are unsustainable and attention spans are frazzled, they will say that reporting is too demanding of institutional resources and audiences.These problems are real – journalism is a struggling industry and technology is degrading our ability to learn and think – but it’s interesting that the solutions to these issues trend towards the introduction of more rightwing voices, the privileging of expression over reporting and the diminishing capacities for bearing witness to a global human experience.It is not an accident that tech moguls entrusted with the solutions happen to be close to, or associated with, those who have links to the Trump administration. And that government is one that has waged war on journalism, with its “fake news”, and is noweven arresting journalists. In no way are the Ellisons or Bezos good-faith stewards of the media, concerned only with the viability of journalism in a changing world. It all stinks to high heaven.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpJeff BezosWashington PostCBSMelania TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The streets were flooded with manure, the unintended consequence of dependence on horses as the major form of transport. In this sea of filth, the infant car industry smelled an opportunity.The Horseless Age, a US car magazine,claimed in 1896 that, with the spread of motorcars, “streets will be cleaner, jams and blockades less likely to occur, and accidents less frequent, for the horse is not so manageable as a mechanical vehicle”. The streets did eventually become cleaner, but not safer. Cars brought huge benefits to society, but also huge challenges. By the end of the 20th century, cars and motorbikes were implicated inmore than a million deathsa year around the world, as well as contributing to pollution and suburban sprawl.This story is often told to show that the inevitable march of innovation brings both solutions and problems. However, there was nothing inevitable about US cities becoming dominated by cars. As the historian Peter Norton describes in his bookFighting Traffic, it was a direct result of lobbying by the US car industry. It campaigned for the removal of public transport, the banning of jaywalking and the redesign of streets. The advent of the car in the US is a useful cautionary tale as we consider the introduction of self-driving cars into our lives – especially in the UK.Waymo, the US self-driving car company, has said that, by the end of 2026,Londoners will be able to ride in their vehicleswith nobody behind the wheel. Their sales pitch is that their vehicles won’t get drunk or distracted, improving the safety and efficiency of how we get around. And if the computing and hardware becomes cheaper, a self-driving ride may eventually cost less than a regular taxi.For the past few years, the company has operatedabout 1,500 driverless carsacross the US. Their safety record so far has been good. Vehicles have not been involved in the sort of life-threatening situations that would turn public opinion against them, but they have got into all sorts of scrapes that are annoying for a city’s day-to-day operation –impeding emergency services,causing traffic jamsand, in one case, running over amuch-loved San Francisco cat. Policymakers are right to question how much of this accumulated US experience is relevant as the cars launch in London.Driverless cars are coming to the UK – but the road to autonomy has bumps aheadRead moreLondon is different from US cities. Much of its road layout predates the arrival of the car. Our roads are more chaotic, with the balance of power tipped a little less towards vehicles. Jaywalking is permitted in London. In 1966, the police tried to crack down on it, butgave up after three months. Our zebra crossings are far from machine-readable; they are designed for micro-conversations between drivers and pedestrians. In some parts of London,such as Exhibition Roadin South Kensington, there are experiments in “shared space”, tearing up the old infrastructures that used to force buses, bikes and cars to stay in their lanes. This introduces uncertainty that slows down drivers but makes navigation harder for artificial intelligence.Another issue is that Londonhas been extremely successfulin reducing the number of cars in its centre, while increasing the number of buses and bicycles. If self-driving cars pull people away from active travel and public transport, they hinder rather than help the city’s wider transport strategy.Big questions remain. How many mistakes, crashes and snarl-ups will people in the UK be willing to tolerate? Should these vehicles clearly indicate when they are driving themselves? Will the technology’s benefits be widespread or concentrated for a lucky few?When they go wrong, will we be able towork out why? Will there be pressure to change the rules of the road to suit the technology?Having runsurveys of public attitudes, my sense is that the public will have high expectations for safety, transparency and equity. We are embarking upon a fascinating social experiment. The minister for local transport, Lilian Greenwood, has said that“government must be in the driving seat”. In the UK, cities will have a say in regulating the technology, which wasn’t the case when it arrived in places such as San Francisco.If London is to become a laboratory, we need to make sure that the knowledge isn’t hoarded by the companies running the tests. As the transport scholar David Zipperrecently pointed out, it is hard to assess the safety of Waymo’s technology when we only haveWaymo’s own datato go on. Self-driving car companies have in the past beenreluctant to share datawith crash investigators and have been cagey about how many peopleare involved behind the scenesas remote operators.The first time you are driven by a self-driving vehicle, it briefly feels magical. Like the Wizard of Oz, the companies involved would rather we didn’t look behind the curtain. But if we want to use technology to improve transport, without storing up more problems for the future, we shouldn’t be pushed around by the hype.Jack Stilgoe is a professor in science and technology studies at University College LondonExplore more on these topicsSelf-driving carsOpinionLondonWaymoMotoringcommentShareReuse this content"

Starmer must make up his mindTom BaldwinThe PM has told Labour it is in the ‘fight of our lives’ against Nigel Farage’s challengers. To win, it must first agree on a line of attackMon 2 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 13.26 ESTShareAfter the past fortnight in which Labour’sinternal bickeringhas once again distracted attention from government decisions that will affect real lives, it’s worth remembering how Keir Starmer briefly lifted his party’s gaze from its own navel to a higher purpose a few months ago.That was back in September, the previous occasion when Andy Burnham’s name was being bandied around, when the prime minister seemed to galvanise Labour’s conference bytelling it“we’ve got the fight of our lives ahead of us” against Reform UK and “racist” policies that would “tear the country apart”. This would be a “different battle”, he warned, because Labour was up against opponents who represented a strain of rightwing politics alien to a Britain that had never faced “a proposition like Reform before”. He has reiterated this view several times since, not least in apre-Christmas interview, in which Starmer said that while he could still “sleep at night” under the Conservatives, that wouldn’t be the case if Nigel Farage’s party was in power.It is remarkable, however, that some of his own party’s staff don’t accept that the stakes are so high or the contrast so stark. Official Labour social media accounts routinely proclaim that the Tories and Reform are “basically the same”. A post last month suggested that these two parties offer only the “same people, same chaos and decline”, while an advertising campaign against Reform titled “Tories: the sequel” isreportedly being planned.No one is suggesting that these officials have deliberately set out to undermine the prime minister and, having had the Conservatives as their main opponent for more than a century, it must be hard to resist settling back into the time-worn grooves of fighting the old enemy. This is especially true whenLabouris presented with such a tempting target as that presented by the recent spate of Tory defections to Reform. Indeed, those of Nadhim Zahawi, Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman mean there are now more former members of Liz Truss’s cabinet in Farage’s ranks than in Kemi Badenoch’s top team.And yet a basic function of any political party is to set out a consistent line on its opponents, and senior government figures privately – if grudgingly – acknowledge that their current one looks rather incoherent. Reform can either be portrayed as an unprecedented peril to the country or as a bunch of political re-treads offering more of the same – but it can’t be both.Polling is belatedly being commissioned to test which part of this badly mixed message works best, alongside other potential attacks that include Farage’s hostility toworkers’ rights, the conviction and jailing of former lieutenant Nathan Gill for taking bribes from an alleged asset ofVladimir Putin’s Russia, or Farage’s support frommega-rich Maga-ish types. Those overseeing the exercise emphasise they will be driven only by data, and become a little irritated by suggestions this is a proxy for deeper divisions. But it does touch on a bigger question about which sections of the electorate Labour is trying to reach.For the past five years the party has focused on what it called “hero voters” – stereotypically older, working-class people who backed Brexit – who are now leaning towards Reform because they think Britain is fundamentally broken. Portraying Farage as “new” and “different” might be seen as ceding the territory of novel and radical change to him.On the other side of the argument are those Labour MPs and ministers who fear the old strategy has opened up the party’s left flank, where implicitly “less heroic”, younger, pro-European graduate voters are switching their support to the Greens and the Liberal Democrats in England, as well as the SNP in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales. Showing that Labour is a bulwark against the existential threat Reform poses to progressive values makes sense if you want to rebuild support within this left-of-centre bloc, as well as address the more immediate priority of holding on to the Gorton and Denton constituency in a crunch byelection this month.For those with long memories, all of this is a bit reminiscent of the mid-1990s, when the Conservatives were struggling to get a grip on Tony Blair. Eventually they came up with the slogan “New Labour, New Danger”, which they notoriously illustrated with a pair of red-tinted demon eyes. Some of Labour’s strategists now say the Tories made a basic error by accepting Blair’s party was “new”, while others attribute the failure of that campaign to Labour not being really very “dangerous”. And so the argument rumbles on.The current situation is further clouded by confused signals about what Reform is trying to achieve. Is the party really trying to be an agent of insurgent change – or does its recruitment of experienced ministers from the last government suggest it is seeking to reassure voters worried about the destruction Farage might wreak? This is why some senior Labour figures still think it’s possible to fudge their attack by saying Reform is dangerous precisely because it is filled with the “maddest and baddest” old Tories. That, however, carries the risk of helping todecontaminate the Conservative party, which, asthe runner-upin more than 200 of the seats – including many of the most marginal – that Labour won at the last general election, may be under-priced at the next.Starmer, who has never been the sort to ignore political expertise or impose his own strategy on those around him, has engaged fair-mindedly with the internal debate because he recognises there are real dilemmas about how to approach Labour’s new rival. But the biggest error would be to treat such questions as a desiccated technical process conducted in the air-conditioned atmosphere of focus groups. The reason why Starmer put some much-needed energy into his party conference four months ago was because his remarks were obviously genuine. “That was me, that was me!”he told friendswhen he stepped off the stage after his big speech. His party could do with an infusion of similarly authentic passion as it embarks on what the prime minister calls a battle for the “heart and soul” of the nation.The time for hesitancy and second-guessing on how to tackle Reform, as well as much else besides, really must be over by now.Tom Baldwin is the author ofKeir Starmer, The BiographyExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionKeir StarmerLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Her popularInstagramseries urges people to make their homes “personal and slightly unhinged”, suggesting what they need is an alligator toilet flush, a decorative stained-glass traffic cone, or a snail-adorned table.The statement makes me feel as if Walters might not see inside many homes (odd, given her job), because all homes are weird! And not cultivated and curated to add a whimsical touch of eccentricity, but properly weird, verging on disturbing. In the room I’m working in, there’s a feather-filled shrine to various dead hens, two candles in the shape of Saint Lucy’s eyes, a stuffed Australian magpie, a wig, three pewter goats and a French revolutionary cockade made from a jam pot lid (an illustrative selection; there’s much more).Other people are similarly well stocked with weirdness: my father has a lifesize wooden sheep. One friend sent me a picture of a purloined “3D printed tentacle” he keeps on a shelf; another admitted to possessing “a dead bumblebee in a box on a little cushion”; my son has a homemade poster on the history of the toaster on display.Reddit records some choice weirdness spotted in people’s homes: casually repurposed coffins, a pet dog’s amputated legAnd that’s the stuff we’re aware of – the real weirdness comes not from decorative choices, but incidental oddities we no longer notice. “No, we don’t have a bathroom door,” for example (I experienced this). “Oh yes, you need to use that chopstick to turn the extractor fan on.” “Watch out for the cat’s special bucket.” “Don’t sit there, it’s where we keep my auntie’s ashes, so she can see the TV.”Unsurprisingly, Reddit records some choice weirdness spotted in people’s homes: casually repurposed coffins, a pet dog’s amputated leg, a bowl of bear penis bones. When my family moved into our current house, we found a forgotten metal box in the loft that said something like “Radioactive material, do not touch” (it wasn’t).Anyone who has ever spent five minutes browsing Rightmove knows that insufficient weirdness definitely isn’t the problem with our housing stock. We’re all weird little animals in our weird little burrows, and none of us needs a stained-glass traffic cone to make us weirder.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHomesOpinionCollectingDesignInstagramSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Gordon Brown understands this. Credibility can’t be pursued at the expense of trustMon 2 Feb 2026 14.12 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 18.59 ESTShareFinally, a Labour prime minister has taken a necessary step.Orderingthe cabinet secretary to investigate Peter Mandelson’s contacts with Jeffrey Epstein recognises an elementary truth: if a cabinet minister discusses private government business with financial interests during a crisis, the state must act.Gordon Brownunderstood this instinctively. Sir Keir Starmer has moved later, and under pressure, but movement alone is not enough. Sir Keir said that Lord Mandelson should be stripped of his peerage while stopping short of legislating to make that happen. That is a choice. And it’s the wrong one to make.The Epstein files make it hard to dismiss the question of misconduct in public office as frivolous. In 2003/04 it appears that as a Labour MP he received$75,000from Jeffrey Epstein. Lord Mandelson says he has no recollection of these payments. Six years later, Lord Mandelson leaked sensitive government information during thebanking crunch in 2009to Epstein, a convicted sex offender, while serving in the cabinet. Emails suggest he advised US bank JP Morgan to “threaten” the UK chancellor, which by all accounts it did, over a proposed tax on bankers’ bonuses. The peer’s lobbying firm Global Counsel later had JP Morgan as a client.Sir Keir’s judgment has been suspect since he hired Lord Mandelson, whose career has courted controversy, to be Britain’s ambassador to the US. The peer was eventuallysackedover his links with Epstein. Yet even when the US Department of Justice released 3m documents from Epstein’s personal files featuring the peer thousands of times there was no automatic expulsion, no legislative action, no institutional reckoning. Once cash flows into a minister’s household while that minister is in office, the argument that there was “no personal benefit” disappears.“Have you permanently stopped the Reinaldo sub?”Lord Mandelson jokes with Epstein in 2010 in reference to money for his husband. This is household-level financial support from a disgraced financier to the family of a serving cabinet minister.The payments, the files suggest, occurred when Lord Mandelson was business secretary. He publiclycriticisedthe Obama administration’s proposed Volcker rules in a New York speech – an intervention that followed a private dinner with Epstein. Worse was to follow. On the evening of 9 May 2010, at the height of the eurozone crisis, emails suggest that Lord Mandelson messaged Epstein that a “€500bn bailout” was “almost complete”. The package was formally announced the following morning after an all-night summit. This was price-sensitive information about a massive and still-confidential rescue, passed to a private financier before markets opened. No trading need be alleged: the disclosure surely crossed the line.Lord Mandelson should leave the House of Lords. His actions warrant investigation. But this is not just about one peer: it is a test for Labour’spro‑business factionsthat valorise proximity to wealth as political maturity. Sir Keir’s Labour party has pursued “credibility” with markets. The Epstein affair reminds us that wealth is not morally neutral. As Balzacwarned, behind every great fortune lies a great crime. Misconduct in public office concerns the abuse of public trust – so vague that it is rarely prosecuted in the UK. A new statutoryoffenceto criminalise improper use of office is on its way. But a party that confuses access with virtue launders power for money.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But throughout his tenure as mayor of London he has positioned himself as a friend to its ravers, rockers and late-night revellers with his oft-relaunched vision of a culturally and economically vibrant “24‑hour city”. Those ambitions have fallen short of their promise, as London, like therest of the country, has seen a steady erosion of pubs, bars and clubs.There is reason to believe that the latest attempt – centred on a new nightlife commissionannounced last week by the mayor, and based on recommendations froma reportendorsed by his office – will be different. The report’s authors include representatives of successful grassroots projects, rather than just industry figures associated with festivals and superclubs. It is unusually alive to local concerns. The debate is not really economic or cultural but political: who controls shared local space? Without councils and residents on side, the plan goes nowhere.That being said, the report usefully challenges stereotypes about nightlife’s supposed association with crime, though its conclusions depend on comparisons that obscure the tensions local councils are asked to manage. For example, comparing nightlife hubs with other busy areas, rather than quieter residential streets, is technically sound but also serves a political purpose. It redirects attention from nightlife-linked crime to crowd management – shifting responsibility away from venues. The proposal to use real-time sound monitoring is more promising, potentially moving the spotlight away from anecdote toward hard evidence.Beyond tax relief, the report points to seed funding for night-time activity that doesn’t rely on alcohol sales. Late-running art spaces or night markets could add social value in areas where the only after-dark options are pubs and bars. Broadening what counts as “nightlife” may also make it easier to win over residents, by grounding venues and events in community use rather than alcohol-led consumption.Althoughdevolution legislationwending its way throughparliamentwould allow the mayor to call in licensing decisions, the report does not argue that this power should be used routinely. Instead, it suggests change is best achieved by working with councils, adjusting the existing system rather than replacing it, and reinforcing the principle known as “agent of change” whereby newcomers – residents as well as venues – are expected to adapt to an area’s established character.This is a sensible approach to take. Councils are better placed than the mayor to hear and settle local disputes. Crucially, there must be a recognition that their authority rests ondemocratic consent. Decisions about shared space are more likely to be accepted when they are made close to the communities affected. Call-in powers should only be used for decisions of exceptional public interest. With thousands of venues across the capital, routine intervention by the mayor’s office would be neither credible nor desirable.London’s night-time economy represents roughly a quarter of the city’s total economic output. But nightlife matters for more than its economic returns; it is also often a cultural and social good. London is a diverse place.Some people want to be in bed by 6pm, some by 6am. The capital should be able to accommodate both. If successful, London would offer a useful test case for other cities wrestling with similar tensions.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In my postwar rural Essex village, we had three butchers, two newsagents, two bakers, two ironmongers, three general stores (one a dairy) plus a potpourri of haberdashery, hair stylists, two sweet shops and an electrical shop that had every plug and wire known to man.There was consternation when the dairy went self-service, but soon everyone was shopping with a basket. Then came the grocery chains – the butchers and bakers disappeared, and the main haberdasher closed. But the village adjusted and other enterprises appeared. The next watershed was out-of-town shopping (driven by local government poverty and the temptation of a new village hall in exchange for planning permission for a superstore) that pulled that rug away.Track your lifetime and see where you were when the changes happened. Then ask yourself one simple question: “Did I support my local high street by using its shops, or did I blithely go to a superstore or online, yet still expect my local traders to be there when I occasionally went into town?”You can’t subsidise every business because people choose to go elsewhere. Do we want to shop and drink locally or not? Please spare the wringing hands and the blame game about this government. If you want a high street, shop there!Michael NewmanShefford, BedfordshireThe decline of the high street predates austerity by decades. If you encircle towns with retail parks that offer free parking, build houses between them and the bypass (which forces people into cars) and make parking in town centres difficult and expensive, you get urban dystopia, with a few shops that provide the things you can’t buy online. Ipswich is a supreme example of this hollowing out.The obvious answer is to turn empty shops and the large buildings they occupy into housing, a change of use that councils perversely seem to resist. Housebuilders (and governments that cosy up to them) won’t like it, of course, because they lose their economies of scale. The solution is simple: penalise landlords who leave shops empty and provide incentives for them and for developers to create the homes (and then customers) that we need.Jeremy WalkerLeiston, SuffolkIt’s no surprise that the future of our high streets is a top issue for communities, but their decline isn’t inevitable – they can adapt and have a bright future. For high streets to thrive they must be reimagined as attractive places that are as unique as the communities they serve.Historic England’sHigh Streets Heritage Action Zones programmedid just this, bringing more than 60 historic high streets back to life across the country, with £95m of government funding. It showed that working closely with local communities to restore historic shops and celebrate high streets can bring visitors back, reduce vacancy rates, attract investment and create new jobs.The blueprint from this regeneration programme can be used to save many more. We are working with local partners to fund pilots to create homes in empty high-street buildings.Claudia Kenyatta and Emma SquireCo-CEOs, Historic EnglandThere is an air of inevitability in what Josh Halliday writes about the decline of high streets (‘You’d be ashamed to bring someone here’: The struggling billionaire-owned high street that shows Reform’s road to No 10, 28 January). Many people I know bemoan the perceived decline of Peterborough city centre, yet don’t visit it. They complain about the lack of shops there, but prefer to go to out-of-town shopping malls.There is an irony here. I reckon that Peterborough’s city centre population is greater than it has ever has been. Empty offices and shop units are being converted into flats and apartments. Indeed, there is a local joke that if you stand still for more than 10 minutes in the city centre, you’ll be converted into flats. Increasing numbers of people are living in the centre, yet communities are not being forged. Presumably all these new city-centre residents have to buy food – perhaps they’re having home deliveries. Let us hope that this lack of community identity is not storing up problems for the years ahead.There are organisations such asPeterborough Positive, our local business improvement district, that are certainly making a difference in our city centre. New and independent businesses are gradually arriving, but it’s a long slog. However, the message is clear and simple: if you want your city centre to thrive, then visit and use the businesses that are trying to prosper.Toby WoodVice-chair, Peterborough Civic SocietyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The Royal College of Psychiatrists revealed postnatal depression harmedup to 85,000 new mumsin England last year.Maternal suicide is one of the leading causes of death among women between six weeks and a year after birth. Perinatal mental illness accounts for 34% of all deaths in this group during this period. Untreated prenatal and antenatal mental illness also affects unborn infants, potentially putting them at risk of premature birth and low birth weight. Parents may find it difficult to bond with their baby once they are born, which can contribute to attachment issues.This should not be happening – and with the right support, it can be prevented and treated. Mothers and their partners must not be left to suffer in silence and should be encouraged to seek help when they’re experiencing mental ill health. An approach that takes into account a person’s biological needs, psychological state and social situation is most effective.Dr Livia MartucciChair, Royal College of Psychiatrists’ perinatal faculty, LondonIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It was midwinter with deep snow, and I arrived to find a robin perched on the stone. It didn’t fly away, but jumped down to the ground and then hopped on to my shoe. I was even able to touch his head. After a while he flew off. My father’s name was Robin Eden.Tom EdenMidhurst, West SussexI was also moved by Amy-Jane Beer’s Country Diary about her sister’s death and the comforting visitations by two birds. At the funeral service of an old friend a few years ago, we filed out of the crematorium to the strains ofThe Lark Ascending, one of his favourite pieces of music. Guess what was the first thing we saw and heard as we entered the crematorium garden?Lesley AtkinsonNewbury, BerkshireHere is another example of birds carrying messages of comfort after the death of a loved one. My birthday was three weeks after my mother died. That night I was speaking on the phone to my sister, telling her how painfully I felt my mother’s absence, when my husband came rushing up the stairs saying: “Quick, come into the garden!” The first nightingale song of the year was the best and most poignant present I could have received and, because of the timing, I had no doubt where it came from.Belinda KingSudbury, SuffolkMy father had a deep respect for foxes. Shortly after his funeral, we spied a very handsome dog-fox stroll down our drive, walk up to his front door behind us and peer through the lowest panes for a few seconds. Then he sauntered off before leaping over a stone wall into a neighbouring field, and was gone.Nick BartonTemplecombe, SomersetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But he faces a challenge to win back supporters who booed him off after his last appearance against Chelsea two weeks ago.Palace failed in a late bid to complete a surprise move for Everton’s Dwight McNeil after submitting a deal sheet just before the deadline, on a loan with an obligation to buy for £20m.

Maybe two, three more players coming in then we have five or six new players all of a sudden.“It feels like two years ago having to teach them how we want to play, how we want to attack. You can see too many misunderstandings right now.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceTransfer windowWolverhampton WanderersnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being a significant increase it remains about 16% of the tournament’s income. At Wimbledon last year, the total prize pot of £50m was 12.3% of the Championships’ £406.5m revenue.Three of the grand slams, minus theAustralian Open, wrote to the players in December offering a meeting on setting up a grand slam player council, but ignored their demands on pay and welfare.In a further indication of the in-fighting,TennisAustralia is not involved in the dispute, as it has aligned with the Professional Tennis Players’ Association, which is suing the other three grand slam governing bodies in New York’s district court over alleged restrictive practices.After a series of meetings in the locker room in Melbourne, a representative of the players wrote toWimbledon, the French Open and US Open last week making clear that any discussions on governance and the creation of a player council had to be accompanied by meaningful talks on pay.“While the players recognise that governance structures can play an important role, they are concerned that prioritising council formation over the core economic issues risks becoming a process discussion that delays rather than advances meaningful progress,” the letter read.A number of the leading female players are understood to have become more disillusioned with the governance of tennis as a result of events at the Australian Open. There is widespread unhappiness at the decision to install extra TV cameras in warm-up and cool-down areas without any consultation, which led to a video ofGauff smashing her racketin what was previously a private space going viral last week after her quarter-final defeat by Elina Svitolina.Many players are also understood to have been aggrieved by Sunday’s announcement from Craig Tiley, the tournament director, that the Australian Open is exploring moving to best-of-five-set matches for women from the quarter-final stage, a radical move that has not been discussed with the players.Explore more on these topicsTennisAustralian OpenAustralian Open 2026Australia sportWimbledonUS Open tennisFrench OpennewsShareReuse this content"

Viktor Gyökeres is the club’s top scorer in the league with six, and Arsenal have scored 17 goals from set pieces – three more than any other club.Arsenal stroll back to winning ways against outclassed Leeds and go seven points clearRead moreArteta, whose side head into the second leg of Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea at the Emirates Stadiumwith a 3-2 advantage, dismissed the criticism after Arsenal became the first team towin all eight of their gamesin the league phase of the Champions League.“I hear completely the opposite: all around Europe that we arethe most exciting team in Europe– the most goals, the most clean sheets,” the manager said. “Maybe I have different sources.”Asked why there was such a disparity of views at home and abroad, Arteta said: “I don’t know which people. You send me the names, the addresses and the email and maybe we can talk but I can’t give you a massive book of all the people.”Arsenal, who have not lost to Chelsea in their past nine meetings, last won the League Cup under George Graham in 1993. They brushed aside Leeds on Saturday to move six points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League and Arteta emphasised the need for his players to maintain momentum by reaching the final.“The big one is to get the team and players and all of our supporters together to enjoy that moment,” he said. “That is what really drives me. [Winning trophies] is a cycle that you want to repeat constantly, and we still have to do that, and some of them, they’ve never done it, so it’s always a first time. I think the group is really convinced that we have the ability to do it.”View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta and Viktor Gyökeres after Arsenal’s win at Leeds, in which the Sweden striker scored.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersIt will be Arsenal’s first home game since a nervy league defeat by Manchester United but Arteta does not anticipate anxiety among supporters if his side make a slow start. “I expect the crowd, like it’s been all season, with us,” he said. “We have had some incredible moments together, and we have an opportunity to go to Wembley all together.”Liam Rosenior, though, did not rule out Chelsea trying to play on recent signs of Arsenal being weighed down by anxiety at home. “We’ll see,” the head coach said, smiling, when the prospect of making the Emirates nervous was put to him. “We’ll see. We’ll go and play our game.”Rosenior believes Chelsea have shown they are capable of rising to the occasion in big games. “Enzo Fernández has won a World Cup, as well as the group winning two trophies last year,” he said. “They can play in big games; they can perform in big games, and it is definitely a big game on Tuesday. My concern is resting. It’s another three-game week. We need to recover. It’s going to be a really physical game.Enzo Fernández seals thrilling Chelsea fightback to shatter 10-man West HamRead more“I don’t have a best XI. I never have done in all of the clubs that I’ve worked with. Why? Because of the demands, the physical demands of the Premier League or Ligue 1 or the Championship now with 46 games. You need a squad, and you need to use the players in the correct way to challenge over the course of the season.“I try and pick the right starting team, but I also try to pick a bench that will give us the right finishing team as well. So far I have to say the substitutes in every game that we’ve played have made a huge impact. It’s not down to my tactical stuff – there’s some part of that – but it’s down to their mentality to come on and help the team.”Chelsea are likely to be without Jamie Gittens after the winger injured a hamstring during Saturday’s win against West Ham. Rosenior is unsure whether Estêvão Willian will be back after the winger returned to Brazil on compassionate leave.Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The disintegration of this global tournament continues, that one line prompting serious concern for the sport’s economy. No further explanation was provided.Pakistan to play Twenty20 World Cup but will boycott game against IndiaRead moreThere’s plenty of untangling required here. When the Board of Control forCricketin India instructed Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh’s Mustafizur Rahman in early January, amid escalating tensions between the two countries, it set off the first boycott of this World Cup.Cue theBangladesh Cricket Board’s refusal to travel to India, citing security concerns and the advice of its government. The explanation didn’t match with the security assessments commissioned by the International Cricket Council and the governing body refused to budge: Bangladesh would not have their matches moved to Sri Lanka, co-hosts of the tournament.Scotland were told to stuff their suitcasesand hop on over.For Mohsin Naqvi, the Pakistan Cricket Board chair, Bangladesh’s removal was an “injustice”,a show of “double standards” that favoured India. He would take the matter to his government. India, of course,did not travel to Pakistanfor the Champions Trophy last year.It was a decision the ICC did not feel the need to explain publicly when it announced, in December 2024, the adoption of its hybrid model for tournaments from now on: Pakistan would not visit India and vice versa.Naqvi, who wants“sports and politics to be kept apart”, is Pakistan’s interior minister. The ICC is led by Jay Shah – the former BCCI secretary, and son of the Indian home affairs minister, Amit Shah. It was during Shah’s reign at the BCCI that India hosted the 2023 men’s 50‑over World Cup when, in the words of the journalist Sharda Ugra, “cricket became a platform for the political ideology of the ruling Bharatiya Janata [Indian People’s] Party”. In the middle of all this, the two countries occasionally play a bit of cricket,breaking viewing recordsin the process.View image in fullscreenIndia and Pakistan haven’t played a bilateral series since 2013, but are always scheduled to meet in ICC events.Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty ImagesIt’s somewhat amusing how important this fixture is when the contest has become such a one‑sided watch, India having lost only once against Pakistan at a men’s World Cup. The present gap in quality between the two teams is vast. But the commercial benefits remain – the match is said to be a key part of the ICC’s $3bn (£2.2bn) rights deal with the media conglomerate JioStar – and so they face one another at every tournament, a legitimate draw be damned. The two sides have conveniently met in the group stage of every ICC men’s event over the past 13 years. It jars when the governing body then states that its events“are built on sporting integrity”.“It’s all about maximising eyeballs and tournament revenue,” Sami Ul Hasan, the former head of media and communications at the ICC, told Al Jazeera last year. “When the ICC plans a global event, organisers do not consider rankings or any other factors. It’s all about making sure India and Pakistan play against each other at least once.”The potential absence of the fixture threatens those revenues, something the ICC hinted at in its response to Pakistan’s call. It said the “decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan”. The statement added: “The ICC hopes that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.”The welfare of the “millions in Pakistan” is a fascinating point to touch on. The Champions Trophy last year marked 29 years since the country had last hosted a global event, yet the hybrid model used by the ICC meant those supporters missed out on watching a final in Lahore, with India’s presence forcing the match to be played in Dubai. Pakistan ended up playing just one match on home soil; they flew out for their India clash and watched rain ruin their meeting with Bangladesh in Rawalpindi. Even if Pakistan’s boycott does not last, Indian supporters will still be denied a contest at home between the two, that fixture designated for the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Meanwhile, those worldwide have watched the game grow toxic courtesy of the jingoism at play. Take Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, comparing their Asia Cup victory last year toOperation Sindoor, a series of military strikes on Pakistan and the Pakistan-administered Kashmir. “Operation Sindoor on the games field,” Modi posted on X. “Outcome is the same – India wins!”Quick GuideSussex hit with points deductionShowSussex have had points deducted before the 2026 season after entering into a three-year framework with the England and Wales Cricket Board - asfirst reported by the Guardian- to tackle the county's financial problems.The club will start the Rothesay County Championship campaign on minus 12 points and will also lose a point in each of the two limited-overs competitions after agreeing an arrangement with the ECB which includes safeguards and controls and closer oversight, and which will remain in place until 2029.Sussex, who finished fourth in the First Division last summer, suffered sustained operating losses in the last financial year and have moved to protect their future while changes are made.Interim chief executive Mark West said: \"We fully understand how disappointing this news will be for everyone connected with Sussex.\"Since taking on the interim role at the end of last season, it has become clear that a combination of internal decisions and wider economic pressures have contributed to the position the club finds itself in today.\"The points deductions will be an unexpected blow to the players and supporters, but we accept the ECB's decision.\"We are sorry - it hasn't been good enough. Our responsibility now is to put things right and ensure the club is in a stronger position going forward.\"The club will be subject to a salary cap and will have to provide the ECB with a three-year business plan \"demonstrating sustainable year-on-year operating profits by 2027-28\" among a series of requirements which must be met in order to avoid a suspended £100,000 fine.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.News of Pakistan’s boycott filtered through duringEngland’s second T20 victory against Sri Lanka in Pallekele, which is one of the venues for the forthcoming tournament. There was a fairly wholesome scene during the rain break as supporters, home and away, danced on the grass banks and stands, the kind of thing you love to see at a World Cup. There will be more of that in the coming weeks and the action itself will drown out a lot of the noise.However, questions persist: are Pakistan open to facing India later if they meet in the knockouts? What does the ICC mean by “long‑term implications”? What does a “mutually acceptable resolution” look like when the answer last time round was that cursed hybrid model? How does a sport end up so reliant on one specific fixture? For now, this tournament is something to be endured.Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026Pakistan cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketInternational Cricket CouncilSport politicsT20 World CupanalysisShareReuse this content"

When Australia were drawn in the same pool as their arch-rivals in December it was widely expected that such a mouth-watering fixture would raise the curtain on the tournament.However, with the first match taking place on Australia’s west coast in Perth on 1 October, organisers have opted to pit Hong Kong – competing at their first World Cup – against the Wallabies in what is sure to be a one-sided affair. The opening weekend of the tournament features just one fixture involving two tier-one nations – South Africa against Italy.Steve Borthwick asks for England fans’ roar in support of grieving Maro ItojeRead moreAustralia’s fixture against the All Blacks will take place on the second weekend of the tournament in Sydney, where a bigger stadium will maximise exposure.England, meanwhile, will begin their campaign in Brisbane against Tonga on Saturday 2 October before locking horns with Zimbabwe – appearing at the World Cup for the first time since 1991 – in Adelaide on Friday 8 October and finishing their pool-stage campaign against Wales in Sydney on Saturday 16 October. Should they progress as expected, Borthwick’s side will have to crisscross Australia with a last-16 trip to Perth on the cards where they could face Italy.Borthwick is planning a reconnaissance mission to Australia but with the Rugby Football Union’s performance operations manager, Charlotte Gibbons, seconded to the British & Irish Lions tour last year, the head coach believes England will leave no stone unturned in their preparations.“With the clarity from this announcement, we can also now start our own planning, to ensure we arrive in Australia ready to perform at our best,” the England head coach said. “Being based across Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney gives us the opportunity to play in three outstanding stadiums in a country rich in rugby and World Cup history.”Wales will begin their campaign against Zimbabwe, Scotland start against Uruguay and Ireland open up against Portugal. Ireland will face Scotland in Perth on 10 October.The 2027 World Cup is the first to feature 24 teams after the decision to expand the tournament and will include what is being billed as “Super Sunday”, with five fixtures taking place on 17 October. The schedule has been designed to be “weekend focused” to maximise global impact and attendance, with three blocks of 12 matches from Friday to Monday in the pool stages before the round of 16. The first tickets are available from 18 February.“We’ve assembled the most compelling match schedule to date, carefully designed to balance player welfare, fan experience and global reach,” the World Rugby chair, Brett Robinson, said.Explore more on these topicsRugby World Cup 2027Australia rugby union teamRugby World CupRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They sold Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace for £35m.Thomas Frank has been down to the bones of his squad because of an injury crisis; the manager was without 11 players for the visit of Manchester City on Sunday. Romero made himself available despite feeling ill but he was forced off at half-time. Spurs were 2-0 down at the time but they battled back to draw 2-2 with two goals from Dominic Solanke.Romero did not hide his frustration when he posted on Instagram. “Great effort from all my teammates yesterday, they were all incredible,” he said. “I wanted to be available to help them even though I wasn’t feeling well, especially as we had only 11 players available – unbelievable but true and disgraceful.”The post was liked by some of Romero’s teammates including Pedro Porro, Djed Spence, Kevin Danso, Gallagher, Pape Sarr, James Maddison and Solanke. Frank actually had 13 established outfield players from which to select. It had been 11 in the 2-0 Champions League win at Eintracht Frankfurt last week.Romero had caused a stir with a post after the 3-2 defeat at Bournemouth on 7 January. “At times like this, it should be other people coming out to speak, but they don’t – as has been happening for several years now,” he wrote. “They only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies.”The 27-year-old deleted the last sentence about the “lies” but the rest of the post stayed up. It was liked by some of his teammates including Porro, who wrote: “Amen. Keep going brother.”Frank sought to defend Romero, who he said had not been fined. But he did say: “When you’re a young leader sometimes you make mistakes. It is good to keep it internal. We had a good conversation [about it] which we will keep internally.”In his latest post, Romero wrote: “We’ll keep showing up and taking responsibility to turn this around, working hard and staying together. All that’s left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us. The fans [heart emoji].”The Argentina defender looked to have been on his way out of Spurs last summer, with Atlético Madrid showing interest in him, after a season that featured a number of controversial comments.There was the repost of a social media message that claimed he was tired because Spurs had not flown him back on a private jet from Argentina duty. There was the complaint that the club’s lack of spending meant they were falling behind Premier League rivals. “You have to realise that something is going wrong – hopefully they [the board] realise it,” he said.There was the moment when Romero thanked the Argentina medics for his return to fitness after injury while making no mention of the physios at Spurs. There was the interview when he said he would love to play in Spain’s La Liga. And he appeared to sign off at the end of it as he paid tribute to the club’s outgoing manager, Ange Postecoglou – just after Frank had been confirmed as his successor. “You paved the way despite the many obstacles that always existed and always will exist,” he wrote.Romero ended up signing a new contract and being named as Son Heung-min’s successor as the captain. It was the definition of a volte-face. Frank can expect more questions about him at his next press conference on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

But, on a freezing Wearside night, they were reunited asSunderlandteammates and duly revelled in taking their frustrations out on Burnley.Sunderland 3-0 Burnley: Premier League – live reactionRead moreDiarra had already created one goal and scored another by the time Talbi registered a spectacular third as Scott Parker’s side extended their winless run to 15Premier Leaguegames. It left Burnley in 19th place, 11 points adrift of safety.In ominous contrast to some recently spirited performances, the body language of Parker and his players seemed to spell surrender. The visitors’ former England defender Kyle Walker described Burnley’s display as “terrible”, saying: “It’s not acceptable. Sunderland wanted it more than us.”His manager did not disagree. “We were just nowhere near it, really,” Parker said. “We looked like a childish team that had no intent. I didn’t see any purpose. We fell way short at the real basics. We were passive in every phase. We’re in a difficult moment.”In contrast, Sunderland are up to eighth, virtually within touching distance of European qualification, but they hadlost their previous game 3-1at West Ham.That disappointing defeat coincided with the rare absence of Granit Xhaka and, with an ankle injury once again sidelining Régis Le Bris’s inspirational captain, home fans wondered how they might respond here. The answer came swiftly and incisively.View image in fullscreenScott Parker admitted his Burnley side were ‘nowhere near it’ during the defeat in Sunderland.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAfter playing a deft one-two with Brian Brobbey, and leaving Maxime Estève looking thoroughly dizzy and disoriented, Diarra took aim. This is where a little luck intervened as his shot took a deflection off Axel Tuanzebe that succeeded in thoroughly wrongfooting Burnley’s former Newcastle goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka.Although Diarra celebrated with a specially choreographed dance it was subsequently registered as an own goal.Significantly Trai Hume had been involved in its preamble. Although the versatile Northern Ireland full-back had, unusually, struggled at West Ham, Le Bris kept faith in one of the few survivors of Sunderland’s promotion campaign last season. Accordingly Hume was handed Xhaka’s armband and a right-sided midfield role.If that seemed impressive management, so, too, did the midfield fluidity and licence to improvise that led to Diarra and Noah Sadiki at times joining the similarly mobile Enzo Le Fée as No 10s operating behind Brobbey.This tactic served to confuse Parker’s defence in a match that already involved Estève and friends being stretched to the limit in an attempt to contain Brobbey’s physicality. It is easy to appreciate why the former Ajax striker once came extremely close to joining Manchester United.Not that Diarra is too shabby a finisher, either. By way of proving the point, a player who missed the first part of the season through injury finally scored a goal of his own before half-time.It all began with a typically excellent pass from Le Fée. When the ball fell at Nordi Mukiele’s feet the right-back’s ensuing cross dropped for Diarra. No matter that his initial shot was blocked, he tried again, unleashing a strike that Dubravka touched but could not quite hold.If the goalkeeper should have done better, Burnley’s failure to mount any sort of real resistance to Mukiele’s cross hardly helped their cause.It also proved emblematic of a wider picture; quite simply Le Fée and co were infinitely sharper and slicker than the team they emerged with from the Championship last spring.View image in fullscreenHabib Diarra fires home Sunderland’s second goal, after creating the first in the ninth minute with a shot deflected past Martin Dubravka.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersBurnley’s failure to properly test Robin Roefs, Le Bris’s goalkeeper, throughout only emphasised why Parker’s players appear so inexorably on course to return to the second tier.The visiting manager switched from a back three to a back four at the start of the second half yet his problem was not formation based.It was more that, an odd cameo from Marcus Edwards aside, Parker’s team offered negligible menace. Quite apart from lacking a player to destabilise Sunderland, their passing radar was alarmingly awry.Although Dubravka saved smartly from Brobbey, his night only deteriorated when Talbi cut inside and curled Sunderland’s third goal beyond his reach from just outside the area. It was a superb finish but, all too typically, Burnley had made no attempt to close the Morocco winger down.“We showed personality with the ball,” Le Bris said. “We needed to react to West Ham and scoring three goals was really important. We were not passive.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Mercedes team principal said that the onus lay with the other manufacturers who had missed an opportunity and that they should get their “shit together”.Therow over whether Mercedes and Red Bullhave stolen a march on the opposition in their engine design has dominated the buildup to the new season and Wolff notably did not rule out other teams protesting against the legality of their engines after they are used competitively for the first time at the Australian Grand Prix on 8 March.Christian Horner targets F1 return as he breaks silence after Red Bull sackingRead moreThe disagreement centres on Mercedes and Red Bull having taken advantage of the regulations in increasing the compression ratio of their engines, set at 16:1 but measured when the car is at rest. It is believed both teams have made use of the thermal expansion of certain components to increase the compression ratio to as much as 18:1 when the car is running – equating to potentially as much as a 0.3sec per lap pace advantage – but remain within the rules when the ratio is measured while the car is “cold”.The other engine manufacturers, Audi, Ferrari and Honda, had written and complained to the sport’s governing body, the FIA, which discussed the issue at a meeting held before the first test.Speaking at the official launch of the new Mercedes car, the W17, which was fast and reliable in thefirst test at Barcelona last week, Wolff bullishly accused his rivals of having missed a trick. “I just don’t understand why some teams concentrate more on others and keep arguing a case that is very clear and transparent,” he said.“Communication with the FIA was very positive all along and it was not only on compression ratio but on other things, too. It is very clear what the regulations say, and very clear what the standard procedures are.View image in fullscreenToto Wolff is bullish about the innovations his team have brought to the 2026 car.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“Just get your shit together. They are doing secret meetings, and sending secret letters and trying to invent ways of testing that don’t exist. Maybe you want to find excuses before you have started?”The meeting between the manufacturers and the FIA did not resolve the issue and if Mercedes and Red Bull do enjoy an advantage they will take it into the new season.The Red Bull technical director, Ben Hodgkinson, has been similarly adamant that his team are within the rules and equally dismissive of their rivals, noting: “Any engineer that doesn’t understand about thermal expansion doesn’t belong in this sport, doesn’t deserve to be an engineer really.”Wolff was just as unwavering in his stance and maintained that the FIA considered the engine adhered to the regulations.“The power unit is legal,” he said. “The power unit corresponds to how the regulations are written. That’s how we see the world today, and that’s what the FIA said. That’s what the president of the FIA [Mohammed Ben Sulayem] said, and he knows a bit about that.”However, when asked if he anticipated a protest in Melbourne after the race, he did not rule out action from rival teams. “The power unit corresponds to how the checks are being done. The power unit corresponds to how these things are measured in any other vehicle. Everything else I can’t judge upon. Let’s wait and see, but we feel robust.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Mercedes GPFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They found “inadequate provision” of mental health beds also contributed to her death.The coroner Joanne Andrews said she would issue a prevention of future deaths report to warn that more children would die unless the inadequate provision of mental health beds was tackled.Ellame’s parents, Ken and Nancy Ford-Dunn, urged the government to increase funding for mental health services to ensure “other families don’t have to experience the worst thing imaginable”.When Ellame absconded she was not immediately followed by staff, because they were not allowed to chase patients out of the ward, the inquest heard. It took 59 minutes for her to be found by police, the jury was told.Support new mothers with mental ill health | LetterRead moreUniversity hospitals Sussex (UHSussex), which runs the acute ward, was fined£200,000 last yearin a separate prosecution over Ellame’s death.Her mental health care was provided by Sussex partnershipNHSfoundation trust (SPFT). Jurors concluded that “poor coordination, communication and accountability” between “multiple agencies” also contributed to Ellame’s death.“Inconsistency in nursing handovers” and a lack of guidance for staff were another factor in her death, they found.The jury foreman said: “The instructions given to agency-registered mental health nurses were inadequate, patient notes were held on multiple systems, with access not freely available to agency staff and inadequately transferred during handover.“UHSussex’s policy for missing patients was not designed for high-risk mental health patients, and the procedure to be followed in the event of absconsion was unclear and not appropriately communicated.”In a statement Ellame’s parents said the devastation of their daughter’s death would be “compounded if no lessons are learnt and no meaningful changes are made, as so often has been the case”.They added: “We therefore call on NHS England and Wes Streeting to increase funding for mental health services so that more young people aren’t left waiting for the care that they so desperately need.“We call on SPFT to create effective specialist provision for young people with mental health needs who are currently still inappropriately placed, like Ellame was, on local paediatric wards that are not set up to provide safe and positive mental health care.”Jodie Anderson, a senior caseworker at the charity Inquest, which has supported the family, said: “Ellame’s inquest has exposed a mental health system in Sussex that is crumbling at the seams.“A lack of specialist beds and a dismissive response to Ellame’s distress left her to languish in an unsuitable paediatric ward. A lack of urgency and professional curiosity was endemic throughout her care.”The family lawyer, Ilaria Minucci of Birnberg Peirce, said: “Ellame’s case needs to remind us that stories like hers are not isolated instances, and that they reflect a crisis at the national level in respect of children’s mental health services that needs to be dealt with urgently.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

After the US attack on Caracas last month to capture president Nicolás Maduro, Trumphalted oil shipmentsfrom Venezuela, making Mexico’s support even more critical.Since Maduro was captured and renditioned to the US, Washington has increasingly turned its attention to Cuba, with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state,openly calling fora regime change in Havana.But after threatening a virtual oil blockade, Trumpsaid on Sundaythat Washington was negotiating a deal with the Cuban regime, though he offered no details on what such a deal would entail.“Cuba is a failing nation. It has been for a long time, but now it doesn’t have Venezuela to prop it up. So we’re talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens,” Trumptold reporterson Sunday. “I think we’re going to make a deal with Cuba.”AfterslammingTrump’s executive order as “an unusual and extraordinary threat”, Cuba’s foreign minister Bruno Rodríguez struck a more conciliatory tone on Monday,saying on Xthat the country “is willing to reactivate and expand bilateral cooperation with the US.”Havana’s sudden willingness to negotiate may be an act of desperation: the Financial Timeshas reportedthat, according to data consultancy firm Kpler, without additional oil supply, Cuba will run out of fuel in the next three weeks.But Trump’s efforts to pressure Cuba on to the negotiating table rely partly on Mexico halting its oil supply, putting Sheinbaum in a difficult position between wanting to appease an increasingly volatile White House and maintain the backing of her leftist Morena party which has long supported the Cuban regime.William LeoGrande, an expert on US-Latin America relations at American University said: “It’s a little hard to see through the fog here to understand exactly how Mexico is going to manage this tension between, on the one hand, its longstanding friendship with Cuba and its desire to help avoid a humanitarian crisis on the island – but on the other hand it needs to maintain a working relationship with the United States on a broad range of issues.”Underscoring the tightrope Sheinbaum is walking, her vow to keep sending humanitarian aid to Cuba drewstrong praisefrom Morena senators and an immediate backlash in Washington.“From the United States Congress, we do not understand President Sheinbaum’s eagerness to continue undermining our country’s policies,” wrote Republican congressman Carlos GiménezMonday on X.“We do not understand her eagerness to continue aiding the murderous and cruel dictatorship that tramples on the people of #Cuba.”As Mexico and the US head towards trade negotiations in July, Sheinbaum will have to continue treading carefully, particularly with the threat of tariffs for sending oil to Cuba still looming large.“It’s leverage that Washington has and we’ve seen Trump do this all the time – use economic coercion to get countries to do what he wants them to do,” said LeoGrande. “So I’m sure that has to be a concern to President Sheinbaum as she’s preparing to negotiate these troubled waters.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumCubaDonald TrumpTrump administrationOilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.“The pause impacts dozens of countries – including Somalia, Haiti, Iran, and Eritrea – whose immigrants often become public charges on the United States upon arrival,” the post continued. “We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused.”Among other countries included was Cuba, from which Rubio’s parents arrived as undocumented immigrants in 1956.An accompanyingstatementon the department’s website said: “President Trump has made clear that immigrants must be financially self-sufficient and not be a financial burden to Americans. The Department of State is undergoing a full review of all policies, regulations, and guidance to ensure that immigrants from these high-risk countries do not utilize welfare in the United States or become a public charge.”The order coincided with the deployment of Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents to Minnesota, where the Trump administration alleges widespread welfare fraud has occurred and has accused members of the local Somalian community as being key perpetrators.The lawsuit claims the suspension amounted to a bar on nearly half of all immigrant visa applications.It said the “public charge” justification was “based on an unsupported and demonstrably false claim that nationals of the covered countries migrate to the United States to improperly rely on cash welfare”.The suit added: “Many applicants for immigrant visas are not eligible for cash welfare and remain ineligible for years.“[The state department] has invented a visa processing-regime that is not grounded in the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act) or its regulations – one that authorizes visa refusals based solely on nationality, without individualized assessment or statutory authority. The result is a blanket deprivation of the case by case adjudication Congress mandated.”Joanna Cuevas Ingram, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center – one of the groups filing the suit –saidthe ban “upends the lives” of people who had overcome multiple obstacles to reunite their families.“These policies exceed the government’s authority, violate the constitution, and strip families and working people of rights that the law squarely protects,” she said.Trump administration moves to deny visas to factcheckers and content moderatorsRead moreBaher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights – another group filing the lawsuit – called the order “base racism … clothed … in obviously pre-textual tropes about nonwhite families undeservedly taking benefits”.“Congress and the constitution prohibit white supremacy as grounds for immigration policy,” he said.Individual plaintiffs include Fernando Lizcano Losada, a doctor and endocrinologist from Colombia, whose application for an employment-based first preference visa (EB-1A) had been approved but is now suspended.Others include US citizens who are separated from their families because their children or spouses have had their immigration visa applications suspended.One of them, Cesar Andred Aguirre, who lives in Long Island, returned to Guatemala with his wife, Dania Mariela Escobar, for her visa interview. But the family was told that his wife would not be allowed to return.Their younger daughter remains in Guatemala with her mother even though she has a medical condition, Turner syndrome, that needs treatment which is unavailable there.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationMarco RubioLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Of these, 39 were recorded in the first four weeks of 2026 alone.However, there is growing concern that official figures may underestimate the true scale of the outbreak. The animal charity Swan Support said 46 dead swans had been found in the borough of Windsor and Maidenhead since 17 January, along with a further 26 in Newbury. Two swans were discovered dead in Windsor on Thursday, with three more found on Friday in theBerkshirevillage of Hurley.bird flu/swan chartWendy Hermon, the operations director at Swan Support, said the birds had been found “spinning around in circles [and] bleeding from the eyes”, as well as appearing lethargic, prompting suspicion that bird flu might be the cause.The charity said some of the recovered bodies had been sent to Defra for testing, but confirmation of bird flu as the cause of death had yet to be received.Since 2021, the H5N1 strain of bird flu has devastated bird populations across the UK. The virus is highly infectious, with scientists saying that a single bird caninfect up to 100others, and that it can be transmitted through faeces, mucus, blood and saliva.View image in fullscreenDavid Barber, the king’s swan marker, during the annual census, known as swan upping, on the River Thames.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/ReutersDavid Barber, the king’s swan marker, who monitors populations of the birds, said: “It has been pretty grim and one of the worst years we’ve had for bird flu. We’ve had 40-plus swans that have died [in the Thames Valley region] but there’s probably double that number.“Unfortunately, [Defra] haven’t come back and confirmed that it’s bird flu – [but] we all know that it’s bird flu.”Hermon praised members of the public for being “amazing” in reporting suspected cases to the charity, which has been collecting the birds and removing them from waterways in an effort to contain the virus. Without such action, she said, “it’s likely that the virus will spread even more” to other bird species.An Apha spokesperson said: “We are aware of reported wild bird deaths in the Berkshire area, and a number of swans have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza.“Members of the public are advised to not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that they find and should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water if they touch wild bird faeces or feathers or after feeding wild birds.”Swan Support echoed Apha’s guidance about not touching dead or sick birds, and hand-washing.Members of the public are encouraged toreport findings of dead wild birds onlineor contact Defra’s helpline on 03459 33 55 77.Explore more on these topicsBirdsBird fluBerkshireAnimalsWildlifeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Many of the country’s rare and endemic species are located in the steppe zone and along Crimea’s coasts and mountains.“This territory that is taken, it’s almost 40% of all the agricultural land of Ukraine,” says Oleksii Vasyliuk, a zoologist and member of theUkraine War Environmental Consequences Work Group. He adds that the country’s largest national parks and reserves, includingone of the world’s oldest steppe reserves, Askania-Nova, are primarily in that zone and have fallen under occupation. “This territory will be inaccessible to us for many decades, or maybe even centuries” because it has been heavily mined, he says.Map of Ukraine showing biodiversity areas within the Russian controlled areaFor that reason, he adds, Ukraine is documenting instances of “ecocide”, in the hope that the international criminal court will recognise Russian crimes against the environment aswar crimeswhen the conflict concludes.The Nikitsky Botanical Garden was long considered the leading botanical research site in Ukraine, according to Volodymyr Hrabovyi, the acting director of the Sofiyivka. The garden housed large collections of rare plants and conducted research to adapt species to changing climates. The first site in Ukraine to grow persimmons,beginning in 1819, the botanical garden had become home to more than 50 varieties of the fruit.View image in fullscreenLarisa Kolder and Volodymyr Hrabovyi, the Sofiyivka’s acting director.Photograph: Cecilia NowellToday, Hrabovyi and his colleagues in Uman have no contact with that research site, or another in Kherson.

Founded in 1796 as an English landscape garden by a Polish noble, Sofiyivka Park is located just a few minutes’ drive from the grave of Rebbe Nachman, an important site for Hassidic Jews that makes the town of Umanhome to one of the world’s largest Rosh Hashanah pilgrimages each year. Today, Sofiyivka is a research institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, though visitors can still wander the cypress- and pine-lined pathways of the park, which is known as one of theSeven Wonders of Ukraine.With some of their colleagues enlisted and serving on the frontlines, and power outages lasting 15 hours a day, researchers at the park inevitably struggle to complete their lab work.View image in fullscreenSofiyivka Park, designated as one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine, was founded in 1796 as an English landscape garden by a Polish noble.Photograph: Cecilia NowellOne of the leading researchers at the laboratory is turning 60, “which means that he can resign from the army”, says Hrabovyi. “He was on the frontline for all these years,” working as a commander of a tank crew, and now “he is happy to return back in a couple of months”.Despite the difficulties, researchers such as Kolder continue vital work to preserve endangered plants in the Sofiyivka laboratory.View image in fullscreenLarisa Kolder with a specimen ofMoehringia hypanica.Photograph: Cecilia NowellIn the microclonal plant lab, she fills test tubes with an agar scaffold and transfers seeds to grow in sterile living conditions under a hood fitted with bactericidal filters.

Today, one of the 80Moehringiaseedlings that put down roots in the Sofiyivka lab is being transferred to the park’s arboretum – the first time the flower will grow in land outside its native region.The significance is not lost on the team. “If the people who do this research disappear, and that material disappears, then the Earth will lose,” Hrabovyi says.Tetiana Burianova and Olha Kotiuzhanska contributed reporting and translation support.This story was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation’s Women on the Ground: Reporting from Ukraine’s Unseen Frontlines initiative.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe age of extinctionBiodiversityConservationPlantsWildlifeEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are being seen as victories for clean energy amid a wider war being waged on it by the Trump administration.The windfarms are considered critical by grid planners as America faces an energy affordability crisis. Together, the four projects will contribute nearly five gigawatts of energy to the east coast, enough to power 3.5m homes.In December, the Trump administration issued anorderhalting the construction of five offshore wind projects along the east coast, citing “reasons of national security”. On 9 January, during a White House meeting with oil and gas executives, the president said: “My goal is to not let any windmill be built. They’re losers.”But in mid-January, federal judges rejected the administration’s claims and allowed construction to resume on four of the five projects. Work began immediately on Vineyard Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind. A fifth project, Sunrise Wind, is also fighting the stop work order and has a court hearing on Monday that industry experts believe will have a positive outcome.Judges across different jurisdictions ruled against the Trump administration. “This is a broad rejection of the administration’s arguments,” said John Carlson, the senior north-east regional policy manager for the climate non-profit Clean Air Task Force.The stop-work order argued that wind turbines could interfere with military radar, but Carlson said it was a pretext to undermine wind power. “All these projects already went through very significant national security reviews,” he said.“He’s losing in court, and I think he will continue losing in court. But that’s not the entire playing field,” Carlson noted.To the wind industry, the court rulings are bittersweet. Trump may be losing the court battle against offshore projects already under construction, but he has succeeded in causing a nosedive in new projects, leaving the industry and its allies longing for the day he leaves office.“This is not the end of what has been an absolute war on wind from the Trump administration,” said Kris Ohleth, director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a nonpartisan offshore‑wind advocacy group. “We’re happy to have the win [in court], but in the broader context, we are a very challenged industry right now.”Critical energy sourceExperts see offshore wind as a critical energy source for north-eastern states. Datacenters are pushing up power bills, and offshore wind offers an environmentally friendly solution to increased energy demand. Grid operators such as ISO New Englandnotethat these projects are vital for winter reliability when other fuel sources are often constrained.On the east coast, wind is the only renewable resource that can be deployed at scale fast enough to meet science-driven emissions reductions targets. “States in the north-east have climate targets that are relatively ambitious for this country, and there simply isn’t another clean resource that can fill the need,” said Carlson.While it has been observed that Trump’s dislike of wind began a decade ago after helost a legal battleagainst a windfarm near his golf resort in Scotland, he has not been consistent on the issue. During his first presidency, his administration actuallysupportedoffshore wind, beforeturning against itin 2019.Studies fromBrown Universityand theCenter for American Progresshave linked growing local opposition to a network of oil-and-gas-funded groups. One such groupsuccessfully petitionedDoug Burgum, the interior secretary, to issue the December stop-work orders.The fossil fuel-funded disinformation campaigns and stop work orders are not only contributing to the energy affordability crisis, but also undermining America’s permitting process, Ohleth said: “It’s completely invalidating the stability there used to be for building in the United States, turning [it] into a cartel system, where you need to please the powers at the top to build something.”Policy whiplash in the US has sent the wind industry into a temporary coma.Following the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which slashed tax credits, BloombergNEF expects only 6.1 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035. This is a big drop from pre-election projections of 39 gigawatts in the same period after Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act spurred wind project approvals with clean energy tax credits.“While the rulings remove near-term legal barriers for specific projects, we do not expect new projects to start construction until there is a fundamental shift in the US policy and regulatory environment,” the BNEF energy specialist Atin Jain told the Guardian.Trump has created risk and uncertainty for the industry that makes it harder to bring projects to fruition. “But I don’t think that means he’s necessarily winning,” Carlson said. “That just means we need to be very thoughtful and innovative in how we move forward.”Looking forward to 2029Experts are already looking forward to 2029. “We are all counting on the fact that there will be a president in office – it could even be a Republican – who doesn’t find offshore wind so repugnant,” Ohleth said.In the meantime, the industry is turning to friendly states, who are the new leaders on clean energy. “We are working with them on transmission reforms, procurement reform, permitting updates, ports and vessel strategy,” Ohleth said. “When the next administration comes in, we will be ready.”Some projects, such as Vineyard Wind, are already supplying power. Others, like Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, will be completed this year.Ohleth expects the Trump administration to continue throwing obstacles at offshore wind. “It’s been one battle after another. But I’m confident that we will win the war,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWind powerDonald TrumpEnergyRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fishers allege that a chemical additive used in tyres is polluting rivers and waterways, killing coho salmon and other fish. If successful, the case could have implications far beyond the United States.How did the case come about?The case was initiated after the apparent solving of a decades-old mystery: what wascausing mass deaths of endangered coho salmonin the Pacific north-west as they returned to streams to spawn. The deaths happened after heavy rain. Before dying, the fish would exhibit unusual behaviour, swimming in circles, their mouths gaping, as if gasping for air. Scientists, suspecting storm runoff, described the phenomenon as “urban runoff mortality syndrome”.It took years for scientists from Washington State University to pinpoint what they now allege is the chemical culprit. In 2020,they published a study in Sciencethat claimed to solve the mystery: they found a toxic substance in leachate from car tyres that killed the fish. Known as 6PPD-quinone or 6PPD-q, it is an oxidation product from 6PPD, a chemical added to car tyres to prevent them breaking down. This transformed chemical, 6PPD-q, leaches into rivers and creeks with, scientists say, devastating results for the protected and endangered species.Who brought the case and why?The case was brought by the Institute for Fisheries Resources (IFR) and the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations (PCFFA) represented byenvironmental group, Earthjustice, after a slew of scientific studies linking mass deaths of coho salmon and harms to other salmon with a chemical tyre additive, 6PPD. The fishers say they depend on the health of salmon populations for their livelihood.Glen Spain, general legal counsel and northwest regional director of the IFR and the PCFFA, said: “The use of 6PPD in tyres has been shown to harm vulnerable salmon populations. Whether or not this should continue will be up to the court.”What is the central question to be answered?Thejudge will determine whether the tyre manufacturersare violating the Endangered Species Act by harming fish species, including coho salmon, protected under the legislation. The fisher’s case is that the tyre companies are violating the act by harming 24 populations of fish species protected under it.What testimony did the judge hear?Edward Kolodziej, a co-author of the 2020 Science study and a primary witness for the fishers, told Judge James Donato that tyres are the main source of 6PPD-quinone in waterways and that road runoff is likely to have high 6PPD-q concentrations. Just one car could do tremendous damage, he said.Four tyres contain enough of the chemical that, after interacting with ozone, could produce enough to 6PPD-q to kill more than 11 million salmon, said Kolodziej.His testimony, which explained how 6PPD-q was discovered, followed a video of a salmon flailing in the water in distress. His team identified a mortality signature for the chemicals in the water when the fish perished, identifying most of them as derivatives of tyre rubber. “It opened up our eyes that there are a lot of abundant tyre rubber chemicals we knew little about,” he said. “Learning more about tyres could explain this case of mortality.”Do all scientists agree?No. Tiffany Thomas, a scientist and defence witness from consultancy firm Exponent, told the court that the findings presented by the plaintiffs’ scientists were based on laboratory conditions rather than real life and were “limited and speculative”.She said 6PPD-q is quick to degrade and has the opportunity to react with different chemicals and undergo physical reactions before reaching the road and water surface.“The data available on 6PPD-q is inadequate to reliably predict the presence, phase, and concentration of 6PPD-q in the streams and rivers in the salmonid populations identified in the complaint,” she said.What are the tyre companies saying?In a statement, Sam Singer, a spokesperson for the tyre companies, said that 6PPD was “critical for tyre safety” as it prevents cracking and degradation. There is “no suitable alternative”, he said. He questioned whether the chemical “even reaches any fish habitat” in the “distinctively different locations” listed in the complaint.He added: “The tyre companies remain committed to working with regulators and are actively participating in regulatory processes to identify a viable alternative to 6PPD. Any alternative must meet established standards for safety.”Explore more on these topicsPollutionSeascape: the state of our oceansFishingConservationEndangered habitatsEndangered speciesMarine lifeexplainersShareReuse this content"

Andrew’s complicity and involvement with Epstein and Maxwell has been well known to us, to Andrew, and to the palace for many years.“Whether he comes to the United States to testify is irrelevant; we hardly need more people over here spinning grand stories.“For the royal family to maintain any level of credibility in the eyes of the survivors ofJeffrey Epstein, the legal team for the king should contact me immediately in a good faith effort to learn what Andrew has done, meet whomever he has done it to, issue a sincere and real apology, and ensure that any victims of Andrew are fairly compensated for this wrongdoing.”The allegation comes as emails in the more than 3m documents published by the US Department of Justice on Friday relating to Epstein appear to show the depth of friendship between the disgraced financier and Andrew’s ex-wife,Sarah Ferguson. The emails also mention princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.In one in 2009, after updating Epstein on her business opportunities, Ferguson appears to write: “Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for.” Another from “Sarah” in 2010 reads: “You are a legend. I really don’t have the words to describe, my love, gratitude for your generosity and kindness. Xx I am at your service. Just marry me.”In 2009, after the crash of a business venture, Ferguson appears to write to Epstein: “I urgently need 20,000 pounds ($27,521) for rent today. The landlord has threatened to go to the newspapers if I don’t pay. Any brainwaves?”The emails also appear to show a lunch was held between Ferguson, her daughters and Epstein in July 2009, after he was released from prison on child sex offences. Epstein sent an email to the “ferg” address asking “where are you?” The reply, from “Sarah”, says: “In Miami. What number shall I call you on now.” She adds she is staying at a house “with the girls”. “I am aiming to get to you for 12:30 for lunch. Does that suit?” and then confirming it will be “myself, Beatrice and Eugenie”.Elsewhere, there are lawyers’ letters about deals to pay off her creditors and an email from Epstein claiming to have helped her financially for 15 years.One from Epstein to a redacted address, sent on 21 March 2010, simply reads “ny?”. The reply, also from a redacted address, says: “Not sure yet. Just waiting for Eugenie to come back from a shagging weekend!!”Another email from Epstein to hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin in 2009 claims “fergie said she could organize tea in the buckingham palace apts. or windsor castle”.‘The Duke’ and ‘The Invisible Man’: key revelations of latest Epstein files releaseRead moreThe former Duchess of York also appears to raise the possibility Epstein had a secret child, congratulating him on the birth of a “baby boy” in 2011, news she says she heard from “The Duke” and offering her “love, friendship and congratulations”. Ferguson appears to complain in a second message to Epstein that he has “disappeared” and it was “soo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply [sic]. More than you will know.”Mountbatten-Windsor denies allegations he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 and working for Epstein, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.A Buckingham Palace statement in October announcing Mountbatten-Windsor would be stripped of his royal titles and moved out of Royal Lodge said: “Their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorJeffrey EpsteinSarah FergusonnewsShareReuse this content"

This is no longer a one in 100 or 200 years event. It happens every few years.”The council leader, Andrew Morgan, said building a new flood wall would cost as much as £9m and would still probably not protect the homes. He said Storm Dennis had hit the terrace hardest, but that homes had been repeatedly flooded since.The council’s chief executive, Paul Mee, said the authority was under no obligation to buy the houses, but it was within its powers and the risk to life and property was likely to increase given the climate emergency.After the cabinet voted unanimously to buy the houses, one of the residents, Paul Thomas, who has lived in the terrace for more than 40 years, said he was delighted.“It’s been horrifying,” he said. “You only get a few months of rest in the summer. When the winter comes, you’re just waiting for disaster. He said his insurance was “astronomical”, but that he was lucky to get any cover at all.View image in fullscreenPaul Thomas.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThomas has relatives living either side of him including two grandchildren. His voice broke as he said the family would probably have to live apart now. “But it’s got to be done and it’s for the best,” he said.Rebecca Chadwick choked back tears as she said: “We’ve lived too long under the shadow of danger. Every weather warning triggers panic. We’ve had six long years trying to get this sorted.”Chadwick, a mother of one, said she had lived all her life in the village and would try to find another home nearby. “It’s a lovely, strong community. I don’t want to move away completely.”Areportfrom council officers on Clydach Terrace said there had been “extensive negotiations” with the owner occupiers, tenants and landlords. A purchase price of £2.5m had been agreed in principle. Additional relocation assistance and incidental and legal costs of about £150,000 are expected.The purchase and demolition will be funded from resources available within the council’s overall flood management and wider capital programme.Explore more on these topicsWalesFloodingClimate crisisCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Paul Dacre, the Daily Mail’s former long-serving editor, has held it up as one of the newspaper’s most important campaigns.ANL denies all the allegations of unlawful information gathering, describing them as “lurid” and “preposterous”. Lawrence is bringing her claims against ANL in relation to five articles published between 1997 and 2007.In a written statement to the court, she accused the publisher of “landline tapping me, blagging me and hacking into my voicemails, monitoring my bank account and phone bills, targeting me with hidden electronic surveillance, and making corrupt payments to serving police officers to steal information about the murder investigations into Stephen’s death whilst pretending to be my friend”.“We had trusted the Mail and worked with the Mail for 25 years,” she said. “I felt like I had been taken for a fool. I still do. I don’t trust them at all any more after what they have done to me.“I am a victim all over again, but by people who I thought were my allies and friends. I am being made to fight when all I have ever wanted is to be told the plain truth and for justice to be done, and an apology. I am angry that I have been made to fight in the courts for over three years for things that could be so easy and simple.”She said she learned that there was potentially troubling information relating to her after being contacted byPrince Harry. “In his email, Prince Harry said there was some information that had come to light and that it was something I would want to know about,” she said.She said she then met the claimants’ lawyers at the Corinthia hotel in London, who told her the information had “accidentally surfaced” about her in 2021 “through a conversation between two private investigators who had worked for the Mail”.One of the key parts of her case is a recording of a private investigator apparently admitting to “blagging” information from Lawrence by pretending to be a journalist from the Guardian.ANL’s lawyers alleged that researchers working on behalf of the claimants had been trying to induce the private investigator, Christine Hart, to provide evidence “with the promise of a book deal”.Antony White KC, the barrister leading ANL’s case, said the Mail ran a “sustained campaign” on Stephen Lawrence’s case, lasting 15 years. He said from the thousands of articles published, five articles are being complained about in the case by Lawrence, which were not complained about at the time of publication.In written submission to the court, ANL’s lawyers said the “serious allegations, which are denied in their entirety, are unsupported by the available evidence”.They said they were a product of an attempt by the claimants’ researchers and legal team to present a case against the publisher “based entirely on spurious and/or discredited information, none of which is before the court in the form of proper admissible evidence”.“In fact, the reality is that the information in each of the articles was obtained by entirely legitimate reporting and based on the sources identified by Associated in its defence and evidence,” White submitted.ANL and Stephen Wright, the author of the articles cited by Lawrence, have “rejected firmly” allegations of making payments to police officers.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsAssociated NewspapersDoreen LawrenceElton JohnPrince HarrySadie FrostSimon HughesPaul DacrenewsShareReuse this content"

In all, 26,696 of the 28,598 resident doctors who took part backed continuing industrial action – a 53% turnout.The Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) highlighted that this was the lowest turnout yet seen in the five strike ballots held as part of the action. It was about a third lower than the 78% turnout in early 2023.The ballot results showed that less than half the BMA’s total number of resident doctor members – 49% – had voted to strike, down 0.7% on their previous ballot.The doctors’ union blamed ministers for the outcome of the ballot. The government was doing too little to tackle the shortage of training places for early career doctors looking to specialise in their chosen area of medicine, and not offering them the 26% pay rise they were seeking, it claimed.“Ministers cannot be shocked that 93% of doctors have voted to strike after being recommended a pay cut this year bythe same health secretary who promised a journey to fair pay,” said Dr Jack Fletcher, the chair of the BMA’s resident doctors committee.“And without thousands more training posts, the bottlenecks in medical training are going to continue to rob brilliant young doctors of their careers.Doctorshave today clearly said that is not acceptable.”View image in fullscreenBMA members on a picket line in July last year at Manchester Royal Infirmary.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWes Streeting, the health secretary, has twice doubled the number of training places he is promising to create – from 1,000 to 2,000 and then 4,000 – to try to meet the BMA’s demand. He and the BMA held what the DHSC called “intensive and constructive discussions” last month on both the key issues, but they did not find a resolution.Fletcher said the strikes could still be avoided. “None of this needs to mean more strikes. In recent weeks the government has shown an improved approach in tone compared with the name-calling we saw late last year,” he said.“A deal is there to be done: a new jobs package and an offer raising pay fairly over several years can be worked out through goodwill on both sides, in the interests of patients, staff and the wholeNHS.”He urged the health secretary to adopt “a responsible approach” in the search for “a timely settlement with no further need for strikes”.Streeting and Keir Starmer, the prime minister, were both highly critical of resident doctors before their last strike before Christmas. Their language hardened doctors’ resolve to keep pursuing their demands, BMA sources say.Almost a quarter of UK GPs are seeing obese children aged four and underRead moreStreeting has consistently called the BMA’s 26% pay claim unaffordable, even if spread over several years. The DHSC said resident doctors’ salaries had risen by 28.9% over the last three years, 22% of which came in a two-year deal soon after Labour’s 2024 election win.It also pointed to fast track legislation to give priority in the allocation of training places to graduates of UK medical schools, which was laid in parliament recently, as evidence of its determination to resolve that issue. But the numbers promised are not enough for the BMA.Each of the five-day strikes that resident doctors have undertaken have brought significant disruption to NHS services and cost the service an estimated £250m.Matthew Taylor, the interim chief executive of the NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, said doctors should “reflect on the impact of further industrial action on patients, the difficult financial backdrop we’re operating in and the generous pay rise that has already been offered to them by the government before staging more walkouts”.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsIndustrial actionNHSEnglandHospitalsHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

In Portland, agents used teargas, pepper balls and rubber bullets on the crowd outside the South Waterfront facility.Portland mayor demands ICE leave city after federal agents teargas protestersRead more“They’re teargassing children. They’re teargassing elderly people. They’re teargassing families,” attorney Matthew Borden said during a hearing on Monday, according toOregon Live.Monday’s hearing was part of an ongoing court case that began in November when the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration on behalf of protesters and journalists. The suit aimed “to stop the Trump Administrations’ retaliatory violence … that has been a sustained feature of the federal officers’ activities at the Portland ICE building”, the ACLU of Oregon said in astatement.At Saturday’s demonstration, one witness said she was about 100 yards (91 metres) from the ICE building when “what looked like two guys with rocket launchers” started dousing the crowd with gas. One of the teargas canisters broke the window of an apartment, Oregon Livereported.“To be among parents frantically trying to tend to little children in strollers, people using motorized carts trying to navigate as the rest of us staggered in retreat, unsure of how to get to safety, was terrifying,” Erin Hoover Barnett wrote in an email to the outlet.In a statement after the incident, the city’s mayor urged ICE agents to leave the city and said: “Through your use of violence and the trampling of the Constitution, you have lost all legitimacy and replaced it with shame.”During another demonstration on Sunday, protesters marched from city hall to the ICE building where they were met with chemical munitions fired by federal officers.The ACLU ofOregonand other attorneys pointed to these events in legal filings submitted to the court over the weekend as part of the ongoing case.“After a small group of individuals stood in the driveway of the Portland ICE Building, Defendant DHS officers emerged deploying flash bangs, detonating large volumes of tear gas at the front and toward the back of the crowd, and shooting munitions from the lower roof down into the crowd,” one filing said, adding that the violence followed “a pattern of retaliatory force”.The filings included declarations from witnesses to the weekend’s protests. One demonstrator said: “It seemed as though the federal agents wanted to hurt the people protesting because they continued to throw teargas at us when we were trying to get away.”The US district judge Michael H Simon said he will rule on whether to issue a temporary restraining order on Tuesday.Teargas has often been used in Portland protests. In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the Portland Police Department (PPD) made use of an excessive amount of the toxic chemical , raising concerns about the effects on health. A subsequent investigation on aJune 2020 incidentconcluded that the city’s downtown was blanketed with gas at more than 50 times the level federal regulators consider “immediately dangerous to life or health”.The Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsPortlandOregonICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)West CoastTrump administrationProtest (US)newsShareReuse this content"

But as part of that process, Lecornu and his government faced a series of no-confidence motions. The government survived the final two votes of no confidence on Monday evening.Lecornu managed to push the budget through only because the Socialist party agreed not to vote against the government, in exchange for some concessions including the suspension ofMacron’s flagship pension changes, which had sought to gradually raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.Hervé Saulignac, a Socialist MP, told parliament that his party had “done its duty” and “avoided the worst”. He said leavingFrancewithout a budget would have been to “add more anguish to the anguish” of the French people.Lecornu had called the budget a “breakthrough”, saying it would boost defence spending by €6.5bn. Although some lawmakers have expressed doubts, the budget aims to bring the deficit down to 5% of the gross domestic product in 2026, from 5.4% in 2025. The French executive was initially targeting 4.6%, but the scrapping of pension changes meant such a reduction of the deficit was not possible, according to the rightwing rapporteur Philippe Juvin.Budget negotiations have consumed the French political class for almost two years after the president, Emmanuel Macron, sparked incredulity by callinga snap electionin June 2024, which delivered a hung parliament. A left alliance won the most seats, but fell far short of a majority. The far-right National Rally party won the most votes and became a force to be reckoned with, but did not have a majority. Macron’s centrist grouping lost seats but were still present.Domestic politics has been largely deadlocked since then, leading to a period of instability and government collapses in Europe’s second largest economy.Broken promises and political crises: how Emmanuel Macron fell from French favourRead moreMacron at first appointed the rightwingMichel Barnierprime minister in 2024, who was brought down by parliament only three months later amid a row over the 2025 budget. Then the centristFrançois Bayroulasted only nine months before he too was ousted over the proposed 2026 budget. Lecornu, a key Macron ally, was appointed last autumn, before resigning and beingreappointedto try to get a budget passed.Lecornu would like to stay in office until 2027, without being ousted. His fragile government is seeking to move beyond the budget on to issues such as a law to protect farmers, and a bill onassisted dying and improved palliative care. But the deadlock in parliament has limited the government’s ability to act on domestic policies.Municipal elections take place across France next month. The presidential election of spring 2027 is now the key focus of national politics.Macron, who cannot stand again for office after two terms as president, is now working almost entirely on foreign policy, pushing Europe to be less dependent on foreign powers, and advocating a harder line in confronting the US president, Donald Trump, over tariffs or theGreenlandcrisis.The far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who was considered to be one of the contenders for the 2027 presidential election, is currently attendinga retrial on appealover the embezzlement of European parliament funds through an alleged fake jobs scam. She was found guilty last year andbanned from running for officefor five years, but is seeking to overturn that verdict and sentence.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronMarine Le PenNational RallynewsShareReuse this content"

It later recovered some ground, but was still down by 3.5% at $4,700 in afternoon trading.Silver fell by as much as 7%, after a 30% slump on Friday, before recovering slightly to $79.60 an ounce.Trump has tapped a new Federal Reserve chair. Has he finally found his yes-man?Read moreThe partial recovery in the metals market helped support the UK’s blue chip FTSE 100 stock index, which breached the 10,300 mark for the first time. It closed at 10,341 points on Monday afternoon, after hitting a new intraday high of 10,345. .Gold and silver had hitsuccessive highs in recent weeks, as investors sought safe haven assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and fears around the independence of the US Federal Reserve.Donald Trump triggered the sell-off on Friday, after he said he would nominateKevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and respected central banker, to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.Warsh will succeed Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, if confirmed by the Senate. Trump said on Friday that he had not asked Warsh to commit to rate cuts.Susannah Streeter, of the broker Wealth Club, said the metals sell-off reflected relief that a “Trump cheerleader” would not be installed at the central bank. “Now financial industry heavyweight Kevin Warsh has been anointed as successor, with deep Fed experience, he’s not expected to be a pushover and that’s sparked this big reversal of safe-haven positions,” she said.Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, described Friday’s sell-off as a “meltdown in the metals space”.View image in fullscreenKevin Warsh.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersThe price of industrial metals, which had swept up in the metals rally, also dropped on Monday, with platinum and copper both falling.Meanwhile, bitcoin also recovered some of its losses over the weekend, rising by 1.8% against the US dollar, although the cryptocurrency still traded below $80,000 and is far off its peak of $125,000 last year.Oil prices fell by 4%, as investors watched signs ofgeopolitical tensions easing between the US and Iran. Brent crude traded at about $65.24 a barrel, down from highs of about $71 last week.But the US stock market opened higher on Monday, with the S&P 500 share index ticking up 0.4%. The dollar, which slumped in the second half of January, rose by 0.43% against a basket of rival currencies.While gold and silver prices are falling , analysts at Deutsche Bank said on Monday that they still expect the metal to hit $6,000 this year.Mohit Kumar, of the broker Jefferies, said the gold sell-off looked like “an unwind” of a “crowded” trade.“Gold was one of the most crowded positions with positioning reaching close to 8 [on a scale of -10 to 10] on our indices last week,” he said. “Last two days’ move has taken the positioning to just above four. Still on the long side but much less crowded suggesting that the bulk of weaker hands have been cleaned out.”Even with sharp falls in recent days, gold is still up by about 65% compared with this time last year, while silver is up by more than 120%.Explore more on these topicsGoldSilverCommoditiesOilBitcoinCryptocurrenciesStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

Any reading above 50 represents growth.The monthly survey of about 650 manufacturers showed new export orders rose for the first time in four years in January, while optimism about the year ahead reached its highest level since before the 2024 autumn budget. Factories reported receiving a higher volume of orders from Europe, the US and China.Reeves plans to refund some visa fees in effort to attract ‘trailblazer’ investment to UKRead moreRob Dobson, a director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the survey, said: “UK manufacturing made a solid start to 2026, showing encouraging resilience in the face of rising geopolitical tensions.”The upbeat survey contributes to the growing evidence that the UK economy has strengthened in recent months. A combined PMI survey of activity within the manufacturing and services sector for January presented the strongest upturn in business activity since April 2024, while official figures showedretail sales performed better than expected in DecemberandGDP rose by an unexpected 0.3% in November.A separate survey from the Institute of Directors, released on Monday, showed economic confidence among its members reach the highest level in eight months in January, rising from -66% to -48%. Although the reading was negative, it was a rebound from near record lows last year, while business directors’ confidence in their own companies increased to 14% in January, from -4% in December, the IoD said.The figures suggested the impact of uncertainty around Rachel Reeves’srecent budgetin late November has now subsided, after on-off tax rumours related to the chancellor’s statement caused investment and consumer spending to slow, according to business surveys.The collection of economic data will add to predictions that the Bank will keep interest rates at 3.75% when it announces its latest decision on Thursday.Signs that the economy is picking up is expected to persuade the nine members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) that they should hold off on a rate cut until they can see more data showing that inflation is slowing. Official figures showed inflation was 3.4% in December, down from the summer’s high of 3.8%, but still some way off the Bank’s target rate of 2% from November.The manufacturing PMI survey showed that “cost pressures are creeping higher”, owing to the rise in employers’ national insurance contributions since April and an increase in the minimum wage, alongside higher costs for commodities such as metals.However, some MPC members have expressed concern about redundancies rising andfigures that showed UK unemployment at a near five-year high at 5.1%, suggesting these factors are enough to curb inflation and increase the argument for lower borrowing costs.The PMI survey showed that the rise in new business for British factories was not enough to stop companies reducing their staff numbers, although the rate of job cuts slowed to its lowest level in 15 months.Traders have put the chance of a move on interest rates at virtually zero, but there is likely to be some dissent within the MPC, and external members Alan Taylor and Swati Dhingra are expected to be in favour of cutting rates. December’s cut from 4% to 3.75% showed a divided committee, with the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, swinging the vote 5-4.Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorManufacturing dataEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That marked an improvement compared with December, when pricesunexpectedly slippedby 0.4% in the weeks after Rachel Reeves’s budget in late November.Prices are now 1% higher than last year,Nationwidefound, with the average price for a home now at £270,873.UK property market ‘on the up’ amid new year bounce in asking pricesRead moreEconomists predict that 2026 will be a year of growth in the UK’s property market, as mortgage rates fall and uncertainty around the budget begins to fade.Nationwide has forecast thatprices will rise by 2%-4% this year, while the consultancy Capital Economics has predicted a 3.5% rise for the year.Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said: “Housing market activity dipped at the end of 2025, most likely reflecting uncertainty around potential property tax changes before the budget.“Nevertheless, the number of mortgages approved for house purchase remained close to the levels prevailing before the pandemic.“Housing market activity is likely to recover in the coming quarters, especially if the improving affordability trend seen last year is maintained.”Reeves announced anew council tax surcharge on housesworth £2m or more but stopped short of more widespread levies on homes, which had been mooted.Gardner said a buyer with an average UK income buying their first home with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 32% of their take-home pay. That is slightly above the long-term average of 30% but below the high of 38% in 2023.But even with signs of improving affordability, Tom Bill, of the estate agent Knight Frank, said the market could still face pressure this year.“Mortgage approvals in [December] were 9% below the five-year average, showing that demand is still fragile,” he said.“The chances of two [interest] rate cuts this year have faded in recent weeks for reasons that include stronger-than-expected UK economic data, which underlines how prices and transaction levels will remain under pressure.”TheBank of England cut interest rates from 4% to 3.75% in December, after official data showed that inflation fell in November to an annual rate of 3.2% from 3.6% in October.That remained well above the Bank’s 2% target, but suggested the worst of the inflation “hump” had passed.However, Megan Greene, a member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) warned last month thatit might not be able to lower interest rates as much as expectedthis year due to strong UK pay growth and expected rate cuts in the US.The MPC is expected to hold its key rate at 3.75% when it meets on Thursday.Alice Haine, of the broker Bestinvest, said households appear more likely to “exercise caution amid rising unemployment and persistent inflation and borrowing costs that, while easing, remain far above pre-pandemic lows”.“Around 1.8m fixed deals are set to expire in 2026, with a larger proportion of that tally attributed to borrowers rolling off low-rate, five-year deals into a much higher interest rate environment, putting pressure on disposable incomes,” she said.Explore more on these topicsHouse pricesHousing marketReal estatePropertyNationwidenewsShareReuse this content"

We meet the font legend and Porsche loverCatherine SlessorMon 2 Feb 2026 11.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 12.16 ESTShareStuffed with a barrage of road signs, artful modernist chairs and all the tools of her trade, Margaret Calvert’s studio occupies the ground floor of her trim terrace house in Islington, London. She still draws by hand, using coloured pencils, ink pens and gouaches, echoes of a simpler time when there were neither computers nor gazillions of Pantone colour options. “There was also no such thing as graphic design back then,” she says. “It was just called commercial art.”Only a handful of graphic designers have had a typeface named after them. One of the earliest was the 18th-century Italian Giambattista Bodoni, whose fonts have conferred on him a kind of immortality. But his efforts were not to everyone’s taste: William Morris was said to have loathed Bodoni’s letters, grumpily raging at their “sweltering hideousness”.The animal in her cattle sign was based on a real cow named PatienceLike Bodoni, Calvert has been inducted into the graphic equivalent of Mount Olympus. The Calvert typeface can be appreciated on the Tyne and Wear Metro, finessing wayfinding from Gateshead to North Shields and beyond. In fact, the black M on a yellow background, instantly signalling Metro, has become a civic and graphic landmark across the north-east. It might even have cheered up William Morris. No “sweltering hideousness” here.View image in fullscreenMost familiar font in Britain … a hand-lettered 1950s road sign using the Transport typeface designed by Calvert and Jock Kinneir.Photograph: Margaret CalvertDesigned in 1971 for the French new town of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, but rejected for being “too English”, Calvert is a contemporary version of a slab serif. (Serif refers to letters with strokes abutting their ends – you’re reading one now). These bold, attention-grabbing typefaces date from the 19th century. Calvert has been described as having “vitality and elegance, avoiding the stiff and mechanical”. The same might be said of the woman herself.She drew from a very early age. “I would have been three or four,” she recalls. “And I can remember drawing on the floor on huge sheets of paper, not with crayons, just with a pencil. It was always a house with a chimney pot and a family standing in front.” She especially enjoyed life drawing. “I think that’s why I’m so fascinated by typefaces and lettering, because I think of a letter’s form as if it were a skeleton fleshed out in different ways.”View image in fullscreen‘Graphic design was thought to be a man’s discipline’ … Calvert today.Photograph: Neil Spence/AlamyCalvert turns 90 this year and – in an extraordinary design and teaching career that began in the late 50s and still continues – has become the embodiment of a national treasure. She’s even been onTop Gear, hurtling down a motorway in a white Vauxhall Insignia with James May in 2010, discussing the technicalities of road signs, her graphic legacy to the nation. Anyone who has ever driven on a British highway will have encountered the sign system she designed with Jock Kinneir as part of the ambitious postwar modernisation and expansion of the nation’s road network, unifying and rationalising what had become a confusing and potentially hazardous array of lettering styles, colours and sign layouts.Lasting from the late 50s to the mid 60s, this was a colossal undertaking, but Calvert and Kinneir’s lucid, legible and eminently elegant signage has attained design-classic status. Officially implemented in 1965, and largely unchanged, it was “a house style for Britain”, embracing modernity with the aim of making everyday things better for everyone. Roads are safer, driving more pleasurable. Design historian Robin Kinross praised the project for highlighting “the role design could play in public life”.Calvert designed many of the familiar warning pictograms, including the silhouettes of a careering deer and cantering horse, inspired by the pioneering photography of Eadweard Muybridge. Farm animals are denoted by a static cow, based on a real one named Patience she encountered growing up at a relative’s farm in Wiltshire. Calvert herself features on the sign for children crossing, as a girl with distinctive bobbed hair leading a small boy across the road, rather than the other way around. Though she is intensely modest, she always means business.Kinneir, who taught Calvert graphic design at Chelsea College of Art in London and later invited her to join his office, described her as “the student who applied herself most rigorously to what she was doing. She kept her head down and worked like a maniac.”View image in fullscreenMilking it  … Patience helps drivers beware.Photograph: Nigel Lloyd/AlamyAptly, Woman at Work is the title of a mighty new tome in which Calvert relates the intertwined story of her life and career. But it also stands as a history of postwar graphic design in Britain. The cover is a version of her famous “men at work” pictogram, playfully altered to incorporate Calvert’s (still) bobbed hair and a skirt. Visually refined, insightful and wryly humorous, it is quintessential Calvert. Considering the longevity and brilliance of her career, it’s also long overdue – but she was happy to wait and pick her moment.“I think the timing is absolutely right,” she says, “because I’m still involved in interesting design commissions.”Among other things, an exhibition in Kyoto beckons, following a popular 2020 show at London’s Design Museum. And Give Way to Design, a documentary by Argentinian film director Patricio Orozco, tracing the history of road signage in Britain from still extant Roman milestones to the legacy of Calvert and Kinneir, will have its UK preview in March.Born near Durban in South Africa, Calvert came to Britain as a teenager, arriving in 1950. While studying at Chelsea, she luxuriated in a nascent swinging London, loving the freedom of art school where “you could just spend a whole week painting a still life”.View image in fullscreenNow you see it … a motorcyclist in his leathers assesses the legibility of a sign during trials in 1958.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesShe seemed destined for a career as an illustrator or art teacher, but then went to work with Kinneir in his cramped mews office in Knightsbridge. “One client described it as ‘A man, a girl and a hole in the wall’,” recalls Calvert. To begin with she did a bit of everything, “including typing, which I taught myself. And I did it really badly. If there’s something you don’t want to do, just do it badly and no one will ask you to do it again.”By 1964 she had been made a partner, and was designing across all scales from luggage labels, posters, letterheads and books, to signage at Gatwick airport and an identity for Britain’s railways, all with the same scrupulous care for supreme clarity and legibility. She hates the word branding, though, saying it reminds her of animals.After Kinneir’s retirement in 1980, she embraced teaching, working at the Royal College of Art for nearly 40 years. “Graphic design was thought to be a man’s discipline,” she says. “So I think it was quite a surprise for people to find me there.” She started out teaching typography to industrial design students. “I got them to redesign the information graphics on parking meters, which some of them took very seriously.”View image in fullscreenThis way! … Calvert’s home studio.Photograph: Margaret CalvertAlthough she became the head of graphic design, her time at the RCA was punctuated by upheavals and imbroglios, with departing heads of department, constant reorganisation and changes to the curriculum. But for her students – many of whom are now successful designers and educators – she was a supportive influence, encouraging critical thinking and exploration of disciplines beyond graphics. One of her former students, Stefan Bufler, a professor of identity design in Augsburg, says she had the ability to “instantly identify any excess baggage that stops an idea from flying”.Transport, the lettering Calvert and Kinneir devised for the road signage commission, is possibly the most familiar font in Britain. It has since migrated into the digital realm, subtly re-conceived by Calvert and Henrik Kubel, another former student. Since 2012, New Transport has been used ongov.uk, the UK government website, its shapes working perfectly within the cybersphere, a testament to its legibility and enduring aesthetic appeal.However, as Calvert memorably describes in Woman at Work, its original gestation was far from straightforward. The very idea of a sans serif typeface (no end strokes) and the use of lower as well as upper case letters (“more legible because you read by word shape”) was challenged by traditionalists.View image in fullscreen‘The battle of the serif’ … the Transport typeface that upset traditionalists.Photograph: Margaret CalvertLaborious trials were undertaken, recorded in archive pictures showing flat-capped men solemnly sitting in an airfield as a car trundles past with a road sign for Oldham and Smethwick strapped to its roof. Ultimately, Calvert and Kinneir – and modernity – prevailed in what she describes as the “Battle of the Serif”. The entire intrigue has the makings of a delicious film drama about Britain’s tortuous relationship with progress, perhaps with the young Margaret played by Jessie Buckley.Apart from the time she used to zip around in a white Porsche 356C (“I bought it for its beauty, but it kept breaking down. It cost me a fortune to run, but I did love it”), Calvert is notoriously unshowy. Much like her work, which does not call attention to itself yet is the essence of human-centred design, easing legibility and movement around everything from transport systems to buildings or websites. “Design for me is a process,” she says. “It’s about improving things. Basically, it’s head, heart and hand.”Woman at Work by Margaret Calvert is published by Thames & Hudson;Give Way to DesignUK preview at the St Bride Foundation, London, on 19 MarchExplore more on these topicsDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I haven’t sort of sat and sung to her, but I sing all the time and everything’s for her now.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.You’re performing your biggest solo concert to date, at the London Palladium. How do you put a set list together?It depends on whether you’re working for someone or for yourself. You have to do what other people want a lot of the time, which is totally fine – most of the stuff I’m asked to do is from my catalogue and I love it. Only one or two songs fill me with dread if I see them on a requests sheet. And to be honest, I always get to them and they’re fine anyway. But putting a show like this together is completely different because it’s about me and my life. The concert is based on ideas we had last year for my Glastonbury set where it was very much music to music, quick introductions, keep it moving. That was right for that gig but this time I am exploring what these songs mean and who I am now. I’m going to talk to the audience in a different way to how I have before. I’ve shied away from singing more than one song from the same show in the past. But I’m playing the London Palladium while carrying my daughter. And Jenna inWaitressgoes through everything while carrying her child. I don’t want to pass up the opportunity to sing songs that really relate to what’s going on so there will definitely be more than one song from Waitress.View image in fullscreenLucie Jones in Waitress at the Adelphi theatre, London, in 2019.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesWhat does the Palladium itself mean to you?I’ve always known that it was the pinnacle. The history that’s in the walls of that building! You walk in and you can almost hear its secrets being whispered. Growing up I listened to Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli’s double album Live at theLondon Palladium. I’ve performed there quite a lot with other artists. Every single time I’ve walked in through the stage door, my stomach’s flippedIt’s rare for a musical theatre star to play Glastonbury. Did you worry that the audience would be too cool for musicals?Not at all. I don’t have that fear any more.Musicalsarecool! And people who say that they’re not cool … well, they’re not our people anyway. I knew that there would be a lot of people who would feel very excited to belt out Defying Gravity in a field. We weren’t even breaking the mould, we were creating a new mould. And, yes, there may be hundreds of thousands of people on site, but there are hundreds and hundreds of things to do at any one moment. So I was slightly concerned that even though there were a lot of people that might have enjoyed it, there might have been something else that they would also enjoy going on elsewhere at the same time. On the first night, I was walking up towards the stage saying to my partner, George: “Fucking hell, what if no one comes?” It’s a total punt! But then instantly it’s like, no, I’m here with the best musical director there is, Jon Ranger, and the perfect musicians for this setting. And my partner and my parents will be there at least. And my makeup artist. So that’s four! But we went out and there was about 5,000 people trying to ram into a tent for 3,000. That’s a real testament to musicals being cool now.View image in fullscreenLucie Jones as Fantine in Les Misérables in 2025.Photograph: Johan PerssonHow has it been returning to Les Misérables, which was your training ground for musical theatre?I played Cosette in 2010. This is my sixth go at Les Mis and I’m playing Fantine, who fights until her last breath for what’s good and right for her child. To be doing it now with my daughter is bonkers. The company have been incredible. The costume department is making sure I’m comfortable. There are quite a lot of fights involved with Fantine. They have to look awful, the audience has to gasp. The fight direction team and the choreographers are constantly working and asking if things feel good and they do. The other night I was on stage at the end of the show for the Epilogue. It’s one of my favourite moments in musical theatre. I’m not a religious person, but we sing the line “To love another person / is to see the face of God”. It’s a three-part harmony and it always takes my breath away, which is not helpful when you’re singing, but it’s a beautiful moment. And my daughter started kicking in that moment. She was really going for it. Having her there with me, in the thick of it all, has changed the way that I do the role.Les Misérables: a musical full of heart and hope that continues to defy its criticsRead moreAs a former Elphaba on stage, what did you make of thesecond Wicked film?The first one was fantastic and the second one is still really magical. There are some incredible performances in it. I think once you’ve seen a world created so beautifully and it’s taken your breath away in such a way that the first movie did for us all, it’s a really difficult task to bring us back in and reboot that to a new level which I think is maybe what people expected. But you can’t – we already know, we’ve gone in and been blown away by it. Let that carry through and bring you into the second movie, I would say. I’ve seen it a couple of times and really enjoyed it.Is there some kind of WhatsApp group for Elphabas?I wouldn’t want to out anything but … there’s definitely communication between us! And it doesn’t just stay with London, you know, it’s worldwide. I was invited into that fold when I booked the job – and it’s continued which is lovely.Lucie Jones is at theLondon Palladiumon 16 February.

Sir Douglas’s writings on the importance of rational self-interest have caused him to be described by his descendant as a lost hero of the Scottish enlightenment: a mix of David Hume, Adam Smith, Dr Livingstone and Walter Scott.Kenneth embarrassingly dresses up in wig and knee breeches as Sir Douglas Weatherford to give excruciating lectures about his hero to uncomprehending tourists. But then a low-rent Game of Thrones-style TV show starts filming in the locality. The tourist centre where Kenneth is employed eagerly throws away all its boring Sir Douglas Weatherford exhibits, repurposes itself as a fan hub and makes Kenneth dress up as one of the show’s silly characters. Kenneth is a powder keg of emotion ready to blow and what makes it worse is that Sir Douglas’s ghost is lurking about the place, full of contempt for his ridiculous and pathetic descendant.I could have done with a lot more of Sir Douglas himself, whose dyspeptic speech at the very beginning is very funny: but that keynote of scabrous satire that he appears to introduce is overtaken by bittersweet sadness as Kenneth takes centre stage. It’s a tender and very sympathetic performance from Mullan.Explore more on these topicsFilmFirst look reviewPeter MullanScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Independently financed horror movie Iron Lung has been smuggled into multiplexes without the usual promotional hoopla, where it was keenly awaited by the massed followers of its Hawaiian writer-director-star Mark Fischbach, better known asYouTubegaming legend Markiplier. Many of us have long sensed culture is making a decisive break with the analogue in favour of the (perhaps terminally) online and Fischbach’s film makes that paradigm shift not just visible but visceral; it feels not unlike spending 12 hours on Twitch with all the curtains closed.Though Markiplier is approaching the horror genre from a notionally fresh angle – by adaptingDave Szymanski’s eponymous space-submarine sim– he lands on the narratively rusty idea of an astronaut straying beyond his depth; this isMoon in dimmer light. Beset by ominous rumbles and mounting doubts about the state of mankind, the begrimed and squalid craft singlehandedly piloted by Fischbach’s straggle-haired convict Simon is indistinguishable from the average teenage bedroom. Our hero staggers round this intergalactic deathtrap completing vaguely specified missions – ram this, repair that, download something or other – like a harassed dad ticking off his Sunday to-do list. In this, Simon proves more proficient than Fischbach’s offscreen self, who is either stumped by or oblivious to the film’s fundamental issues.Hopes that Iron Lung isa new Dark Starare soon sunk by the depressive tone, leaden pacing and near-total absence of spectacle; this is basically a radio-play script that insistently has to tell, because this barebones production has nothing much to show. (The achievement, chiefly entrepreneurial, is almost admirably perverse: Markiplier steering people towards content that makes Solaris seem like Con Air.) Even if you have a major case of Main Character Syndrome to centre yourself for two-plus hours while relegating your co-stars to voices off, Fischbach holds steady before the camera; more money and bigger sets will doubtless come his way. But he can’t pull off the dramatic heavy lifting required to convert a short film’s worth of plot into a watchable feature. At least MrBeast’s stunts get him outside.Iron Lung is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsGamesYouTubereviewsShareReuse this content"

Their omnipresent hits represent the worst of bands who favour stadium-sized grandeur over true ambition. However, I can never truly get behind the idea of trashing Freddie and co when their music helped create one of my most beloved scenes in cinema history.‘Pushes the nostalgia buttons’: why Enchanted is my feelgood movieRead moreEarly in 1992’s Wayne’s World, a bunch of rockers squeeze into an AMC Pacer with custom flames painted on the side. As they drive past the automarts, car washes and beef stands of downtown Chicago, Bohemian Rhapsody plays on the car stereo. The song’s operatic verses are used for laughs (the “Let me go” line becomes a cry for help from a friend who is partied out and might “honk” in the backseat) while the breakdown in the middle creates space for a spot of high-speed headbanging. To me it’s as thrilling a car scene as anything in Bullitt or the Mad Max franchise.At its core the scene, and Wayne’s World as a whole, is about the friendship between Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). They are best friends who, when they’re not moshing behind the wheel, host a show on public access TV. Essentially a pair of irreverent pre-internet YouTubers, they wear ripped jeans and Def Leppard shirts while chatting to eccentrics like the inventor of Suck Kut, a self-hair-cutting device. The DIY show has given them micro-celebrity status, with Wayne dating Cassandra (Tia Carrere), the singer in a band he meets at the Gasworks, a local club.Wayne, switched on and sporting his own merchandise, wants to achieve something big (or “cachunga” in the 90s slang-heavy script) while his spacey co-host is happy to chew on red licorice and ponder on the attractiveness of Bugs Bunny when he dresses as a woman. It’s not clear what precisely Wayne wants in life, but having enough money to buy his dream guitar, a 1964 Fender Stratocaster in classic white, lovingly nicknamed “Excalibur”, would probably help.Enter TV executive Benjamin, played with slippery corporate menace by Rob Lowe. He spots an opportunity to take the scrappy Wayne’s World and make it mainstream, lining his pockets in the process. What ensues is a punk fable that warns of the dangers of accepting a quick buck and what can be lost by selling out.The film is endlessly quotable with both Wayne and Garth breaking the fourth wall to address the audience directly. They praise their heroes with “we’re not worthy” and lovingly refer to attractive women as “Baberham Lincoln”. “I don’t even own a gun. What am I gonna do with a gun rack?” Wayne asks a besotted ex whose idea of a birthday gift is a little unorthodox. It’s a line that runs through my mind any time I receive an underwhelming present.The film’s rock credentials are also unshakable. Alice Cooper makes a cameo and big laughs are mined from Led Zeppelin riffs. Director Penelope Spheeris, best known for her Decline of Western Civilization trilogy of music documentaries, memorably spurned an offer to direct This Is Spın̈al Tap over fears it was poking fun at metal bands. In Wayne and Garth, however, she saw true fans.As a millennial viewer watching from the UK thanks to its endless repeats on Sky Movies, I wasn’t always conscious of the gen X ethics Wayne’s World was instilling in me. One of Wayne’s World’s most beloved scenes involves Wayne and Garth mocking product placement while blatantly advertising products for Reebok and Pepsi. This cultural aversion to chasing money over everything was all but wiped out by the time I graduated into the post-financial crash economy in which influencer brand deals and “securing the bag” became a means of survival. Perhaps it’s idealism, or rose-tinted nostalgia, but I can’t shake the idea that Wayne’s generation had it right. I know for sure that any dreams I have of fighting back against “the man” (I refuse to say late-stage capitalism) have their origins in Wayne’s Aurora basement.The idea of a modern-day Wayne’s World is nigh on impossible; if you need an illustration as to why the dynamic no longer works then watch thecringeworthy 2021 Super Bowl advertisementfor Uber Eats of all things. Perhaps that’s for the best. To me, Wayne and Garth will always be the slackers who time-traveled from the 90s to instill their idealistic and unconventional wisdom when I needed it the most.Wayne’s World is available on Paramount+ in the US and the UK and Binge in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsMike MyersMy feelgood movieComedy filmsComedySaturday Night LivefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It arrives at these abstractions via the horrific story ofthe 2018 killing of Mawda Shawri, a two-year-old German-born Iraqi Kurd shot during a bungled border control raid on the van she was travelling in with her parents.Director Robin Vanbesien reveals this tragedy through documents and testimony read out for the audience of activists seen here. The infant’s body is dumped in a bin bag by the presiding officers, and her parents, Phrast and Shamden, refused access; the lies of the police, who played to the myth of immigrant barbarity by claiming Mawda had been thrown on to the highway by her fellow passengers; the justice system closing ranks by putting the onus of responsibility on the van driver for dangerous conduct that supposedly forced the police officer to fire.Outrage is obviously the correct response. But, as someone points out here, concentrating on such egregious incidents plays into the authorities’ hands, because they are the outlying exceptions often then used to justify draconian control. They obscure the broader machinery of repression, and the underlying power ideologies, which license the empowered to pull the trigger. Another commentator makes comparisons with the anthropology of hunting: the mythology that differentiates hunter and prey and sanctions bloodshed. Dismantling violence means dismantling language; replacing labels such as “migrant” or “refugee” leads another participant to realise that searching for alternative terms invariably humanises the people concerned.It doesn’t feel, though, as if Vanbesien quite finds his own lexicon for the visual element of this revolution. His distorted sequences of Belgian highways, as if on-ramping into 2001’s Stargate, aren’t a bad attempt at conveying interstitial alienation – but the many, many inserts of fluttering roadside vegetation and lamp-posts eventually pale. Lyrically dwelling in this no man’s land while anonymously conveying its insights through staged readings, the film – ironically – starts to feel deracinated and dispersed. Fully attributed testimony and a rigorous conclusion for Mawda’s story, rather than a healing session of throat-singing, might have closed the loop better. The radical intent is clear to see, but the anger feels scattered by the wayside.Hold on to Her is on True Story from 6 February.This article was amended on 2 February 2026 to correct a misspelling of Robin Vanbesien’s surname.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBelgiumMigrationKurdsEuropeMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

His 2008 Booker-longlisted debut,A Case of Exploding Mangoes, was a scabrously comic portrait of General Zia-ul-Haq in the days leading up to his death in a suspicious plane crash in 1988. Masquerading as a whodunnit, it was a satire of religiosity and military authoritarianism. Dark, irony-soaked comedy that marries farce to unsparing truth-telling was also the chosen mode for other vexed subjects, from violence against women and religious minorities inOur Lady of Alice Bhattito the war machine inRed Birds.Hanif’s prickly new novel confirms his standing as one of south Asia’s most unnervingly funny and subversive voices. The story kicks off right after ousted socialist PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto is put to death by army chief turned autocrat Zia. Following the execution, disgraced intelligence officer Gul has been posted to OK Town, a sleepy backwater where he “would need to create his own entertainment and come up with a mission to shine on this punishment posting”.He’s in luck, sort of. Bhutto’s sympathisers, the so-called “jiyalas”, are heartbroken and angry; many believe he is still alive, that the military government is hiding him, and some, to Gul’s horror, are setting themselves on fire. Gul sets to work, quashing protests. Known as “Piston” among his peers, he has another reputation to uphold, and he does so with equal commitment, never mind that a woman is carrying his child.Hanif fuses slapstick and the fun of a cat-and-mouse thriller with the serious reckoning work of a state-of-the-nation novelMeanwhile, trouble is at the door of Sir Baghi’s Rebel English Academy, a tuition centre for basic English tucked within the compound of the local mosque. Imam Molly brings an unexpected visitor, Sabiha. Sabiha’s husband has just died in a mysterious fire; her parents, Bhutto loyalists, are political prisoners; she has a pistol and, worse, an attitude. Could Baghi put her up for a while? Beholden to Molly in more ways than one, Baghi is not in a position to refuse.The academy is a place of learning, and to remain there Sabiha must live as a student: “Write what the other students write,” he tells her. “But remember you are no ordinary student: you are a witness to history.” Thus begins a series of first-person chapters, “homeworks” threaded through the main narrative, in which Sabiha recounts her tragic life story and names the perpetrators. Already suspect as a lapsed Marxist and a gay man with a dangerous cruising habit, Baghi now also shelters a fugitive who is desirable to the thuggish Gul.Smart, taut and electrifying, the tale fuses slapstick and the fun of a cat-and-mouse thriller with the serious reckoning work of a state-of-the-nation novel. It powerfully confronts rape culture, media censorship and the suppression of dissent. One of its achievements is to reclaim hearsay and gossip from the margins of formal politics and make them integral to its narrative engine, effectively dramatising how they can unsettle the monopoly of state-sanctioned truth, and testify to the pressures of enforced silence.Running through the book is a sly polemic against Pakistan’s pervasive cult ofshahadat,or martyrdom. One character (cheekily named Shahid, the Arabic word for martyr) is keen to capture his own self-immolation on video, while the perpetually lustful Gul pretends to be a soldier, “bored in the trenches, ready for martyrdom”, to lure women to his bed. Hanif’s critique is multibarrelled, targeting not only corrupt power of various kinds – military, religious, patriarchal – but also the gift of salvation such institutions claim to proffer. His feminism is tough and purposive, while on the subject of faith he is unafraid to violate taboos or flirt with heresy. What preoccupies Hanif is the instrumentalisation of the Qur’an. In his debut novel, Zia treats it as an oracle, riffling through its pages for verses that endorse his grand ambitions. Here, Molly uses it to more carnal ends: to justify taking a second wife, cloaking the exploitation of a vulnerable young widow in the language of righteousness.Defined by secular and religious convictions respectively, Baghi and Molly function as ideological counterweights. While Molly embraces a kind of religious absolutism, insisting that “my only politics is Allah”, Baghi is animated by doubt, dismissing religion as the “opium of the masses” and seeing it as his mission to liberate countryfolk from the “twin yokes of capitalism and feudalism”. Hanif presents them both as far from exemplary, and while his book resists any trite allegory of the nation, the pair’s relationship, sustained through uneasy accommodation, gestures toward the limits of ideological purity, as well as the necessity of compromise.Why “Rebel” English Academy? Because for its founder, Baghi, it is where “rebels of tomorrow” are made: children who, while learning English, are taught to doubt and to question; who would be “armed with a language that would pretend to serve power but in the end would smash it”. That canny, insurgent spirit courses through the stories of Sabiha and through every page of Hanif’s remarkable novel. Crackling with incendiary themes and theses, this account of life under authoritarian siege is fiercely local and incontestably universal, harrowing and mutinously entertaining: a sure-fire Booker contender.Rebel English Academy by Mohammed Hanif is published by Grove (£16.99).

No night but mine shall shadeThis day that I have made.This poem by the novelist, journalist and suffragist Stella Benson appears in her collection, Twenty,published in June 1918, shortly before the end of the first world war. (Some of her own reactions to the first world warare recorded here.) Benson (1892-1933) went to California that same year, largely because she was in poor health and her doctor had recommended the climate.I imagine that most of Twenty had been put together before she embarked on her travels. The Secret Day may have emerged from her fears concerning the journey and her future in a strange country. Interestingly, it illustrates the psychological need to find a sanctuary in time rather than space. Benson is aware that the device is an artificial one, but launches a convincing appeal for its necessity, beautifully structured by the constant echoes ofanaphora. She has “built To-day” (a day she was hoping to greet in another form) “Lest joy come not again, lest peace return no more, / Lest comfort come no more.” Each stanza’s concluding line oftrimeteris always effective, but never more than here, with its frank admission of the most basic animal need – for “comfort”.In stanza two, the poet concedes the limits of her “building” metaphor, and creates a specific picture of an English coastal landscape, in which she conjures flowers instantly out of the earth. The day is now bigger than a stage-set, although Benson continues to highlight her original metaphor, as in the third stanza image of peace being “painted” on the sky, and the making of “immense and misty seas …”Besides a separation from her country, there’s the implied rift with a “Secret Friend”. The capitalisation here seems a childish gesture. I don’t know how easily a female poet in 1918 could have solved the problem Benson has set herself, but some Imagist sidestepping might have been recommended. It would have helped her case for “Secret Friend” if she’d at least dropped the capitalisation.Despite its moments of sentimentality, Benson’s poem doesn’t lack intensity and originality. The confessional tone of voice is effective. The speaker trusts the reader with her introspective project, in which simple diction and repetitions imply genuine candour and vulnerability. Do thehexameterlines provide a little too much space to fill? Here and there, perhaps, but at the same time, the rhythms add to the insistence of the speaker, the authority of her first-person account of things.The closing trimeter line of the last stanza emphasises the pathos of her new metaphorical turn: she has built a wall, not a house, and her cherished “To-day” is already fading into nightfall, although the claim to sanctuary remains defiant.Benson’s focus was primarily on fiction and journalism. It seems that Twenty was the only full collection of her poems to have been published during her lifetime. A late-awarded distinction is that two other Benson poems appear in Philip Larkin’s 1972Oxford Anthology of 20th Century English Verse. (Perhaps this was atMonica Jones’s suggestion? But Larkin takes credit for agreeing!)You can read a version of Frost introducing chapter three of her1936 novel Goodbye, Strangerhere. It shows Benson’s later poetic style taking a new direction. I wish there had been time for her to write more.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekFirst world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is the world Patrick Bateman inhabits and Bret Easton Ellis’s narcissistic banker is every inch the embodiment of it – a creature of Wall Street’s hedonistic heyday, blinging in designer-wear as he swings his axe at high-end escorts and the homeless.So Rupert Goold’s decision to resurrect this musical adaptation of Ellis’s ghastly 1991 masterpiece is not without risk. Don’t these singing yuppies seem ridiculously passé now in their boxy suits and Ralph Lauren underwear? The satire is amped to 10, licking its lips, it seems, as it sends up the 1980s. But it never spirals into kitsch and our contemporary world of toxic masculinity, Trumpian capitalism and Insta-fuelled solipsism slowly, chillingly, creeps out of it.This was the first show that Goold staged after taking over the Almeida theatre(then it starred Matt Smith and reached Broadway). It becomes his swan song as outgoing artistic director: a bloody, brilliant, full circle. Who could have imagined that a musical version of this story would work so well in the first place? First there is satire, deliciously dark, and then horror, which is not treated in the same maximalist, limb-sawing way as inMary Harron’s film,but still unsettlingly effective when the violence comes.View image in fullscreenAn axe to grind … Daniel Bravo and Arty Froushan.Photograph: Marc BrennerArty Froushan, as Bateman, is nowhere near as sinister as Christian Bale’s chainsaw-wielding film portrayal but his preppy boy-next-door turns gradually lunatic, shirt slicked with sweat by the end. It is an impressive performance in which he shows his range after his lead performance at the same theatre inThe Line of Beauty.Anastasia Martin, as his earnest PA and one of the only likable characters, brings a sorrowful depth to her part of a woman painfully in love with her boss.Duncan Sheik’s score contains one great electro-synth number after another, with a razor sharp book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. Cards captures the absurd one-upmanship of Bateman’s banker bros; You Are What You Wear, sung by his east coast princess fiance, Evelyn (Emily Barber) among others, name-drops period fashion labels with undisguised shallowness. The witty book and lyrics take us back to the fetishisation of fine dining with upscale dishes involving sliced mango, sushi and sun-dried tomatoes that now sound laughably basic.Alongside the original songs there are excellently performed blasts from the past: The Human League’s Don’t You Want Me brings an aggressively tinny sound. Phil Collins’ In The Air Tonight contains menace and melodrama, with some superb singing from a zombie-style ensemble who dance, writhe and bounce in aerobics gear. They sometimes appear robotic, other times plastic, never quite human, with gloriously arch choreography by Lynne Page.View image in fullscreenGloriously arch … (l-r) Emily Barber, Millie Mayhew, Liz Kamille, Hannah Yun Chamberlain, Asha Parker-Wallace and Tanisha Spring.Photograph: Marc BrennerEs Devlin’s fleet set design turns nightclubs into bedrooms into hideous mounds of twitching bodies. Jon Clark’s Stringfellows style lighting and Finn Ross’s projections give off a luminous, hallucinatory quality, insinuating Bateman’s unreliable reality.The seeds of corruption in our world are all to be found here: Trump is Bateman’s hero and makes a brief appearance. Epstein is name-checked. The unspoken analogy between bankers and psychopaths bears resonance. Bateman deals in mergers and acquisitions (or is it “murders and executions”?) and although he is a product of the 1980s, the greed of his peers lays the ground for the economic crashes to come, their nihilistic, coke-snorting hedonism prefiguring the drama ofIndustry.The unreliable narration of the book which renders Bateman a fantasist gives way to metaphor more clearly here: he is an abstraction, he tells us himself. He may not be out there, cutting up women, but his darkness, his abandoning of hope, sits within all of us.At theAlmeida theatre, London,until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsAmerican PsychoAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

He has been a fugitive from the US ever since.Samantha Geimer on Roman Polanski: ‘We email a little bit’Read moreThe new film will be the feature writing-directing debut for French-American film-maker Marina Ziolkowski, whose short 19 was nominated for a César – the French Oscars – in 2021. Dree Hemingway, from Sean Baker’s Starlet, and The Substance’s Gore Abrams will star as Geimer’s parents Susan and Bob, while the title role will be played by 13-year-old American-Ukrainian newcomer Carolyn Kachen. Producers said Kachen, whose theater credits include Annie and Matilda, was selected from hundreds of young actors following “a striking audition that signals a breakout” talent, according toDeadline.Per the logline, the film “revisits one of Hollywood’s most notorious scandals through the eyes of the person most misrepresented by it … As the case erupts across headlines, Samantha and her mother are thrust into a relentless media storm – she’s hounded by paparazzi and stripped of privacy at the moment where she most needs protection. Together, mother and daughter must fight to reclaim Samantha’s voice and preserve what remains of her childhood.”Geimer, who has since forgiven Polanski and remained in periodic contact with him, said in statement: “This story has been a lifelong burden for all of us involved. I never imagined it could be transformed into something beautiful. Marina’s creativity and sensitivity made that possible – and that, to me, is a gift.”While reading Geimer’s memoir, Ziolkowski was struck by her “voice – clear, courageous, and long erased from the public narrative”, the director said in a statement. “This film is not about Roman Polanski; it is about returning Samantha’s story to her after years of being shaped by others. Told entirely through Samantha’s memories and inner life, the film restores her agency and complexity. Intimate and immersive, The Girl is a deeply human act of reclamation – confronting how power, myth, and media distortion erased a child’s truth, and honoring her resilience.”The project, one of the rare European productions to secure a US tax credit, will begin shooting in Los Angeles later this year.Separate from Geimer, four other women came forward between 2017 and 2019 accusing Polanski of abusing them in the 1970s – three of them were minors, including the artist Marianne Barnard who said Polanski sexually assaulted her when she was 10. In 2010, the British actor Charlotte Lewis accused Polanski of sexually assaulting her in 1983 when she was 16.Polanski, now 92, has denied all of the allegations. In May 2024,a French court acquitted Polanskiof defaming Lewis after he denied raping her when she was a teenager. That October, another lawsuit concerning an alleged sexual assault of a 16-year-old in 1973, was dismissed after a settlement to “the mutual satisfaction of both parties”.Explore more on these topicsRoman PolanskiRape and sexual assaultnewsShareReuse this content"

Two sessions in the venue’s 220-seat main cinema sold out swiftly. A third session was added at short notice on a night the 20-year-old site isn’t usually open, and neared capacity, teeming with eager viewers.And not just classic cinephiles, either. The film, says Amanda Slack-Smith, Australian Cinémathèque’s longstanding curatorial manager, “got out to a lot of communities. We’re seeing a lot of intergenerational families coming in – older parents with their 50-year-old kids, and they’re bringing their kids.”View image in fullscreenTwo sessions of In the Mood for Love sold out at Brisbane’s Gallery of Modern Art – and a third was added at short notice in their Maggie Cheung film season.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyPioneered in Paris in the 1930s as a means to preserve celluloid archives, the cinematheque champions movies as an artform. Fittingly, Australia’s three biggest reside in galleries and museums: the one at Goma, the Art Gallery of New South Wales’s soon-to-launch Sydney Cinémathèque, and the Melbourne Cinémathèque at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. In Adelaide, there’s a cinematheque at thearthouse Mercury cinema; in Western Australia there isPerth’s Revival House; and theHobart Film Society, which has been kicking since 1946, still hosts weekly screenings for members.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningEach appreciates cinema as a window to and vital record of the world, across retrospective screenings, underseen highlights and indie discoveries. At a time when it can feel as if everything is available everywhere all at once, cinematheques are an alternative to the Hollywood franchise churn at multiplexes and streaming’s endless scroll. Patrons, especially new attendees from younger demographics, are valuing that approach and even altering their viewing habits accordingly.View image in fullscreen‘It’s not about shoving scholarship down people’s throats’: Amanda Slack-Smith, Australian Cinémathèque’s curatorial manager.Photograph: Claudia Baxter/QAGOMASlack-Smith believes a cinematheque’s task is providing avenues for discovery. “But it’s not about shoving scholarship down people’s throats,” she says. “It’s about us being translators, I think. We put on our Indiana Jones hat, we go out there, we find all the gems, we bring them back.”Commercial theatres can seldom fulfil that role, even with year-round retrospective programming often on their schedules. The film industry data firm Gower Street Analyticsreported a global box office last yearof US$33.55bn – or, in other words, still struggling to match pre-Covid figures. “They’re a business, they have to survive,” Slack-Smith says. “So if it wasn’t for places like cinematheques, how do you have those conversations? How do you see that material? And how do you put it in context?”The Guardian view on the future of cinema: gen Z is falling in love with the big screen | EditorialRead moreWhen Australian Cinémathèque programmed In the Mood for Love, for instance, it was part of an ode to Hong Kong star Maggie Cheung, while other notable recent seasons have showcased Japanese film-maker and Drive My Car Oscar-winner Ryusuke Hamaguchi as well as the work of Charles Burnett, director of the widely revered class drama Killer of Sheep.Sydney Cinémathèque begins welcoming audiences from March, rebranding and expanding AGNSW’s screening program that dates back to 2000. As film curator Ruby Arrowsmith-Todd explains, one of its aims is aligning with the gallery’s existing cinema audience, which is “increasingly much younger” and “a lot more diverse” since Covid.In Melbourne, Grace Boschetti fits the next-gen mould, embracing Melbourne Cinémathèque upon seeing Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Eclisse while at university. She became an annual member in 2022 and has been volunteering on the organisation’s committee since 2025.View image in fullscreenGrace Boschetti started going to Melbourne Cinémathèque at university – and soon she was attending repertory screenings about four nights a week.Photograph: Amy StephensonHer first visit was “a really transformative experience”, and soon she was attending repertory screenings about four nights a week. Beforehand, Boschetti was seeing majority new releases, she says. “Now, I see maybe a new release every two to three weeks and everything else is retrospective screenings.”Australia’s cinematheques fulfil a much-needed role: an antidote to streaming and the false sense of abundance provided by digital platforms despite favouring recent and English-language titles. Streamers haven’t threatened Boschetti’s fondness for the silver screen; for her, as for many of Australia’s cinematheque obsessives lapping up expertly curated double features week in and week out, “it’s never the ideal way to watch something, at home. Watching something in a cinema is always going to be a better experience.”View image in fullscreenMichelangelo Antonioni’s 1962 film L’Eclisse.Photograph: BFIArrowsmith-Todd also attributes the rising number of young attendees to “platforms like Letterboxd” – the film-focused social media app that now has 17 million members and an outsized presence on red carpets. “Each year there’s a new cohort of young people coming through, keen to see the so-called classics but also increasingly voracious for films that are far off the typical canon list,” Arrowsmith-Todd says.Arrowsmith-Todd sees Sydney Cinémathèque as an opportunity for emerging film professionals as well, such as critics, programmers and – crucially – projectionists. There’ll be “more training behind the scenes”, she says, in analogue projection, allowing the gallery to “screen the full film history from 35mm, 16mm, all the way through to the present”.The days of a new-release movie flickering through projectors on celluloid are long gone at most commercial cinemas. When a title does screen on film, it is now touted as a special event; select 70mm sessions of Marty Supreme recently played in Sydney and Melbourne, for example. It’s another gap that cinematheques are filling, with the format of their movies almost as crucial as the features themselves.View image in fullscreenSydney Cinémathèque is an expansion of the Art Gallery of NSW’s existing film programs, and ‘each year there’s a new cohort of young people coming through’.Photograph: Christopher SneeIn the Mood for Love screened at Goma in its original cut on 35mm. The audience, Slack-Smith says, knows “the difference between the director’s recut and recolourisation, and the original film on print … There’s still a lot of real interest and love for the original.”That interest – that curiosity – feels central to the enduring success of Australia’s cinematheques. “If you start attending retrospective screenings and particularly cinematheque screenings on a regular basis, you are going to learn so much about film that you didn’t know,” Boschetti says.“There’s just a particular magic about a lot of these films that I don’t think I get out of new-release films. I see something and it’s the best thing I’ve ever seen – it’s very rare for me to see a new-release film that amazes me in the same way.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWong Kar-WaiArt Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW)MuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rowling serves as an executive producer on the upcoming series, which is being produced by HBO and will be one of the most expensively produced television shows of all time.“I take the subject extremely seriously,” Lithgow told the audience,reported by the Hollywood Reporter. “JK Rowling has created this amazing canon for young people, young kids’ literature that has jumped into the consciousness of society. Young and old people love Harry Potter and the Harry Potter stories. It’s so much about acceptance. It’s about good versus evil. It’s about kindness versus cruelty. It’s deeply felt.”“I find it ironic and somewhat inexplicable that Rowling has expressed such views,” he added. “I’ve read about them, and I’ve never met her. She’s not really involved in this production at all. The people who are re-adapting Harry Potter and turning it into an eight-year-long TV series are remarkable. … These are people I really want to work with.”“It upsets me when people are vehemently opposed to me having anything to do with this,” he added. “But in Potter canon you see no trace of transphobic sensitivity. She has written this meditation of kindness and acceptance. And Dumbledore is a beautiful role.”‘Please walk away from Harry Potter’: why the stars of HBO’s new TV show are in for decades of social media hellRead moreWhen Lithgow wasannounced as Dumbledore, he revealed that a friend with a trans child had sent hima link to an articleentitled: “An open letter to John Lithgow: Please walk away from Harry Potter.”“It was a hard decision,” Lithgow said, in Rotterdam. “It made me uncomfortable and unhappy that people insisted I walk away from the job. I chose not to do that.”Variety reportedthat one audience member expressed their disappointment to Lithgow about his decision to remain in the show, later leaving the room in protest. “I’m perfectly ready for collisions of opinion. I understand it,” Lithgow said afterwards.In 2020,Rowling posted a 3,600-word online statementcriticising proposed changes to gender recognition laws by detailing her own experience of sexual assault and domestic violence. She has stated she opposes “the new trans activism” and opposes cisgender women sharing single-sex spaces with trans women, saying it would mean women were forced to “open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside”.She donated £70,000 to For Women Scotland, the campaign group who played a key role in bringing about the challenge of how a woman is defined in law, and founded theJK RowlingWomen’s Fund, which supports individuals and organisations “fighting to retain women’s sex-based rights”.Other actors in the Harry Potter series, including Nick Frost, who plays Hagrid, and Paapa Essiedu, who plays Snape, havedistanced themselves from Rowling’s views since signing on to the show.Last year Rowling saidshe would not fire Essiedufor signing a petition in favour of trans rights, writing on social media: “I don’t have the power to sack an actor from the series and I wouldn’t exercise it if I did. I don’t believe in taking away people’s jobs or livelihoods because they hold legally protected beliefs that differ from mine.”The lead actors in the original Potter films, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, as well as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them star Eddie Redmayne, have allmade critical statements distancingthemselves from Rowling.The new Potter series is due to premiere in 2027 and, according to HBO, will be a “faithful adaptation” of the books by Rowling. The eight feature films based on the books were released between 2001 and 2011, and the series has a similarly ambitious timeframe, with Casey Bloys, chair and CEO of HBO and Max Content, sayingit would run for “10 consecutive years”.Lithgow alluded to this in Rotterdam, joking: “I’m the oldest person in this entire room, just turned 80. And yet I signed a contract – I will be playing Dumbledore for the next eight years! I absolutely have to keep at it. I felt: ‘Wow! That means I will live to be 88.’ I have that in writing.”Explore more on these topicsJK RowlingJohn LithgowTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Jessica Pons/The GuardianThe US lawyer on her fearsome reputation, the criticism she faced for advising Harvey Weinstein, and how 40 years of legal experience did not prepare her for the Epstein filesByAmelia GentlemanMon 2 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 05.30 ESTShareIf Lisa Bloom had been advising Peter Mandelson or the then Prince Andrew before their calamitous attempts at reputation-salvaging television interviews, she would have encouraged them to listen beforehand to Jeffrey Epstein’s victims – or, at the very least, to their lawyers – to understand something of what the women endured.“Or even just watch some of the powerful documentaries that have been made, centering the victims, telling their stories,” Bloom says, pausing for a moment, closing her eyes and shaking her head to convey silent incredulity. “I’d have wanted them to become really enlightened about it. But you really can’t instil compassion in someone if they don’t have compassion. It’s hard to implant it in there.”Bloom, the California-based lawyer who has specialised in representing victims of sexual misconduct cases for 40 years, is acting for 11 of Epstein’s victims. In December, she launched new proceedings against the FBI on behalf of eight of her clients, which argue that the organisation failed to investigate credible reports of Epstein’s sexual misconduct involving minors going back as far as 1996. Had the FBI acted with due diligence, the complaint argues, hundreds more women could have been protected from abuse.Instead, the lawsuit claims, an FBI official hung up the telephone on one of the first women to try to report Epstein. “Despite being the most elite and prestigious law enforcement agency in the United States and perhaps the world … the FBI never called back or followed up … in any manner,” the legal argument notes.The readiness of powerful men to ignore the victims’ voices is a running theme in the Epstein scandal. When Mandelson appeared on breakfast television at the start of January, re-emerging from several months of isolation in the wake of being sacked as Britain’s ambassador to Washington,he made no apology to the victimsfor continuing his friendship with Epstein, after the financier was convicted of soliciting sex from minors in 2008.There was amazement that Mandelson had learned so little from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’swidely condemned failure to dwell on the victims’ experience and apologise, when he tried to use aNewsnight interviewto rehabilitate himself in 2019 (he has always denied any wrongdoing). Realising his mistake, Mandelson issued a written statement 24 hours later, offering aclear apologyfor his decision to believe Epstein rather than the women who had accused him of abuse.How does Bloom explain this absent-mindedness? “I don’t think they forgot. I think it was never part of the equation for them. I’m sure behind closed doors, they don’t talk about the victims at all,” she says. She is equally scathing about the British royal family’s slow response to the allegations about Mountbatten-Windsor’s involvement with Epstein. The palace snipped away at his responsibilities and titles grudgingly for years,before decisively cutting ties in October. Bloom concludes that “when people appear not to care about victims, they don’t care about victims”.In 2021, Bloom secured compensation from the Epstein estate for all 11 of her clients – with settlements ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars. When Epstein died in his prison cell in 2019, his estate was estimated to be worth $577m. In 2024, her firm obtained similar payouts for her clients from a separate claim against JP Morgan, Epstein’s bank between 1998 and 2013.After speaking with Bloom, I’m confident that if I ever need to sue the FBI for negligence, I would consider appointing her firm to act for me. It would be an expensive choice; the firm would take anywhere between 33% and 45% of any settlement payment. Bloom’s ruthless professionalism is not everyone’s cup of tea, and sometimes feels at odds with her determination to cast herself as a feminist warrior. Her startling decision to adviseHarvey Weinsteinon ways to discredit his female accusers, as, in 2016, journalists began investigating allegations of sexual assault, is a damaging blot on her CV–but one she has apologised for.Bloom remains one of the most important figures in the fight to secure some form of justice for Epstein’s victims, and she is a sharp observer of the political infighting over the release of millions of pages of government files relating to his case. When we spoke, only a tiny fraction of the total (estimated at just 1%) was in the public domain. On Friday,3m new pages were released.“I have really been flabbergasted, and it takes a lot to shock me, having done these cases for so long,” she says. The contents of the238-page book presented to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003, with its notes and photographs from influential friends, again underlined the failure of Epstein’s high-profile associates to find anything problematic about his behaviour.“The essence of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is one man doing terrible things to girls – we can kind of understand that. But having so many powerful men who were enablers, who all just thought this was a joke – it’s so sad,” she says. “Everyone’s just laughing, it’s so funny how Jeffrey Epstein enjoys young women giving him massages. There are these secrets they all have together – it just makes my stomach turn.”She describes the failure of JP Morgan, the US’s largest bank, to act on red flags about Epstein’s suspicious transactions, instead permitting frequent large cash withdrawals, as “disgusting” (the bank has said it regrets its association with Epstein and would not have continued doing business with him had it believed he was using the bank to commit crimes). She is also dismayed by the growing list of prominent men who were ready to socialise with him. “The whole thing is so vile.“The more Epstein documents get released, the more we see how he had so many powerful friends, and that’s ultimately what helped him. That’s not the way the justice system is supposed to work. Everyone is supposed to be equal in the eyes of the law, but what we have seen here is that if someone is rich and powerful they often get a pass,” she says.View image in fullscreenLisa Bloom and Janice Dickinson in 2019, at a press conference announcing a settlement in their defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby.Photograph: Frederick M Brown/Getty ImagesAs we talk by Zoom, only Bloom’s face is visible, framed against a neutral background on the computer screen, blond hair resting on her shoulders. Her face will be familiar to close followers of the Epstein case, partly because she is so frequently on television discussing developments, and partly because she looks remarkably like her mother, Gloria Allred, 84, the legendary US attorney, who has also spent a lifetime acting for victims of sexual assault, and who became a leading figure in the #MeToo movement, acting for women accusing Bill Cosby, R Kelly and Sean “Diddy” Combs among others. Allred is representing another 27 survivors of Epstein’s abuse.Bloom, 64, and Allred have built up reputations as crusaders for the rights of women, securing large payouts for victims of sexual misconduct, and both women have seen those reputations shaken in recent years, amid controversy over their professional practices. Allred was the subject of a criticalWall Street Journal investigationlast year, which suggested she put pressure on some of her clients to sign confidential settlements. In a statement, Allred’s firm told the paper that it did not agree with the allegations made in the article.There is an uncomfortable dissonance between Bloom’s pro-victim, campaigning rhetoric and the details of the advice she emailed to Weinstein as he attempted to silence his accusers, which was later leaked to the New York Times. Bloom reportedly offered to draw on her extensive experience representing victims of sexual misconduct and weaponise it to discredit Weinstein’s accusers, particularly the actor Rose McGowan. “I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world because I have represented so many of them,” she wrote. “They start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed.” She also offered to help get negative articles about Weinstein buried online to clean up his Google search results, and to organise an interview to promote Weinstein’s “evolving” attitudes to women.Bloom tells me that this all happened nine years ago, and that she stopped working for Weinstein the moment the first woman went on the record accusing him of sexual assault. I ask if any of her Epstein clients have been concerned by her work with Weinstein, and she says the subject has “never come up”. “Clients want to know: ‘What is your plan for winning my case?’ They really don’t care who else I have represented.” She points out that “lawyers represent distasteful people every day”.View image in fullscreenLisa Bloom with her mother, Gloria Allred, in 2011.Photograph: Noel Vasquez/Getty ImagesI think Bloom is suggesting that it is naive to expect lawyers to represent only the abused; “accused persons need lawyers too”, she writes on her website. And it is true that David Boies, whose firm represented Virginia Giuffre in her case against Ghislaine Maxwell, also acted for Weinstein for many years, handling a contract hiring an Israeli private detective firm calledBlack Cubeto spy on accusers and journalists. Hesaid later: “I regret having done this … It was not thought through, and that was my mistake.”If she is irritated at being reminded of this whole episode, she masks it with a polite smile. Throughout the call she is determinedly agreeable, congratulating me frequently on how the interview is going: “It’s a great question!”, “Good question!”, “That’s an important question!” But occasionally we stare through the screen at each other in puzzlement. It is late in the Guardian’s London office when we speak, and as she talks about her lifelong commitment to securing justice for women, the motion-sensitive lighting flicks off. I wave my arms in the air to switch the lights on again.“Are you giving me a hallelujah?” she asks, surprised.In her biography on the Bloom firm’s website (punchily headlined My Life, Fighting for Justice), Bloom addresses her work with Weinstein as a “colossal mistake”, noting that the firm switched to acting exclusively for victims as a result of the fallout and urging critics to judge people as she does, “not by their worst mistake but by their lifetime work”. “In my case that is over three decades fighting mostly for underdogs against the powerful,” she writes. It would be easier to shrug at the Weinstein episode if Bloom were less effusive in her own portrayal of herself as a tireless fighter for victims’ rights. In her 3,671 word bio, she details a career spent rejecting multimillion pound salaries to represent victims of discrimination, harassment and abuse.“How do you assess someone’s reputation?” she asks. “To me, it’s: Do clients still want me to fight for them? Do I get glowing five-star reviews from clients after we end their case? Overwhelmingly. Do I get beautiful cards and letters? Yes.”She takes pride in her success at securing large payouts for her clients. “It can be uncomfortable or even distasteful for people who are not used to it. They think: how do you put a dollar sign on someone for being sexually assaulted? Sometimes people say to me: all you get is money for your clients, and does money really mean anything? Well … yes! The only people who say money doesn’t matter are people who have a lot of it.”The settlements she has secured for the Epstein victims she represents have helped them rebuild their lives. “One of them was able to hire an attorney in a custody case and get custody of her child; she was also able to move to a safer neighbourhood to raise her child. One of them went back to school and is getting a master’s degree in a field that is important to her. This is very typical of what women do when they get money. I’m a big believer in taking money from the hands of bad guys and putting it in the hands of women. The money means a lot – it means that they can go to therapy, they can change careers, they can go back to school, they can support their children. Is that complete justice? Of course not, but it’s really helpful.”Some campaigners are troubled by the practice of a payment structure based on negotiating high settlements, from which the law firm takes a substantial cut.Weinstein’s former PA Zelda Perkins founded the pressure group Can’t Buy My Silenceto campaign against non-disclosure agreements. She did this after breaking the confidentiality clause in her own settlement with the producers, which had prevented her from talking about his predatory and abusive behaviour for decades. She worries that the business model of law firms like Bloom’s and Allred’s means lawyers are incentivised to fight for the maximum payout, often using confidentiality as a bargaining chip.If victims are unable to speak up to expose others involved in the wider abuse case around Epstein, then predators will be able to continue with impunity, Perkins warns. “These women have been silenced and silenced and silenced. Then a lawyer comes forward, apparently to help them, and weaves into their settlement a clause saying you won’t get this big settlement unless you agree to not talk about anything further.Womenneed to own their own voices, to own their trauma, and be able to access the help that they need,” she says.Bloom says she would never push a client to sign a confidentiality clause if they didn’t want to: “That would be antithetical to everything I believe in.” New legislation in New York and California has also restricted the use of NDAs. But she acknowledges that settlements come at the end of difficult negotiations.“We’re fighting against the most powerful defence lawyers in the country, giant companies and billionaires. And they’re going to push back and they’re going to want certain things. They don’t roll over and just give it to us.” Confidentiality clauses are often requested by the accused, and are sometimes welcomed by the victims, she says. While in the UK there would be a presumption of anonymity for victims of sexual assault, this is not automatic in the US and has to be negotiated.Her Epstein clients have all stipulated that they do not want their full names revealed and she estimates that more than 90% of her clients generally want confidentiality. “They don’t want the allegations to come out publicly. They do not want the amount of the settlement to be known. They want the whole thing to be done and behind them. So they are fine with an NDA,” she says.View image in fullscreenGhislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein … this photo was among the images released by the US justice department.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBloom says her firm will never take more than 50% of a payout, unless there have been exceptionally high costs, payments to expert witnesses, for example; the usual range is between 33% and 45%. “You can go to Walmart or to the boutique on the corner, where maybe they sell the same thing, but one is going to be more expensive. At my firm you get a team of quality lawyers on the case, fighting tooth and nail.”She rejects recent criticisms of her mother’s record. “I love my mum. A lot of litigators burn out, especially female litigators; but I’ve been doing this for 40 years, she’s been doing this for 50 years, and we did not burn out,” she says. “I’m very proud to be her daughter.” Bloom thinks her 50 years of vegetarianism, which developed into veganism 20 years ago, has helped her to avoid exhaustion, and attributes her own good health to regular hiking and mountain climbing excursions. It is impossible to tell from the characterless screen background, but she is speaking from her cabin, a seven-hour drive from Los Angeles, in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where she has already had a morning hike.The two women are unable to talk about details of their clients’ cases, but they often discuss broader Epstein-related issues. They have been collaborating on campaigns since Bloom was 12, when she encouraged her mother to help her set up a protest against the local toy shop’s divisions of its wares into boys’ and girls’ shelves – with toy vacuum cleaners and toy kitchens on the girls’ side and all the toy money on the boys’ side. “I just thought that was ridiculous and wrong,” she says.Bloom says she worked hard to bring up her children without these stereotypes. Both her children became lawyers, and both have worked with her: “I like to joke that we have a pro nepotism policy at my law firm,” she says. Her daughter now works as a lawyer at a tech firm, her son is an environmental lawyer and a former national pole-dancing champion, which she cites as the happy consequence of a childhood free of gendered expectations.In an environment where the regressive values of the tradwife movement are gaining ascendance, where tech-bro culture has infected politics, where toys are ever more intensively marketed to different sexes, and where voters have turned a blind eye to Trump’s pussy-grabbing machismo in two elections, Bloom still has her work cut out.Her firm is readying for the next chapter of its campaign to secure compensation for those affected. “I know that the FBI is going to fight back and come up with every legal argument they can and so we’re prepared for that fight,” she says. She has first-hand experience of the bureau recoiling from investigating Epstein related issues. When she told staff there that she was acting for a witness who claimed to have seen the then Prince Andrew dancing at the London nightclub Tramp on the night Giuffre said he assaulted her (which he denies, saying he was at the Woking branch of Pizza Express that evening), the FBI declined to take her statement. “They were not interested in talking to her,” she says. “I believe that the justice department did not want to prosecute a British royal.”Lisa Bloom on working for Weinstein: ‘Attorneys represent a lot of distasteful people’Read moreShe is enraged on behalf of her clients at the protracted nature of the legal battles, largely the result of delays to the release of the files, and she is worried on their behalf about the softer treatment being offered to Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years for sex trafficking in 2022, and who was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas last August. She says she finds discussions of a possible pardon for Maxwell “stomach-turning”.Bloom emailed over the weekend to say that she and her colleagues would begin going through the files on Monday, adding that she was disappointed that still “only about half of the files have been released”.“I know some survivors have complained that their names were released, in violation of their privacy rights, which is completely outrageous.”She hopes that some of Epstein’s most powerful friends will eventually have to explain their involvement. “In my dream world, there would be a congressional investigation into Donald Trump’s role with Epstein, and that he, like any other US citizen, would be called to answer questions.”Explore more on these topicsThe big interviewJeffrey EpsteinUS crimeUS justice systemSex traffickingHarvey WeinsteinSexual harassmentinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The most unexpected benefit has been finally meeting my neighboursRuth LawesMon 2 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleIam a crazy cat lady, except for one small obstacle: I do not own a cat. Though my boyfriend and I discuss names for cats, like other couples do for children, renting in London has put a stop to adding one to our family. So I had pushed dreams of filling the cat-sized hole in my life to one side, only allowing myself momentary relapses when friendly cats crossed my path in the street. That was until I stumbled across the best solution to being reluctantly feline free: becoming a cat-sitter.It started when I decided to quit my job. Faced with the daunting prospect of living without a guaranteed salary, I was lured in by social media videos promising that any number of “simple” side hustles would make me happier, richer and freer.Initially, I spent five days and £60 setting up an Etsy shop. Four months later, I had made two sales (one from my brother) and a net loss. Next, I had a brief dalliance with “affiliate marketing”. No, I’m not sure what that is either. In a last-ditch attempt, I spent hours uploading my camera roll to sell on a stock photography website – the vast majority of which did not meet the minimum quality threshold.Frustrated, poorer and stifled, I was on the verge of taking early, unpaid retirement from side hustling when I saw an influencer on TikTok suggest cat-sitting. Within minutes, I had set up a free profile on Cat in a Flat and, a few weeks later, I secured my first booking.Cat-sitting is not a high earner and can’t be relied upon as a sole income, though I have made a nice amount of pocket money and I feel enriched in other ways. I get to cosplay as a cat owner, even if just for 30 minutes, and I find being around animals improves my mental health. I maintain that cats instinctively know when you’ve had a bad day. Take Figgy, one of my cat clients, who curled up on my lap for the first time after I’d had a challenging morning. Or Luna, who could reset my nervous system simply by rubbing up against my legs. Meanwhile, Pickle, a shy cat whose trust I’d had to work to earn, was a source of genuine companionship at a time when it felt as if all my friends were leaving the capital or having children.The one change that worked: I tried all the hobbies I thought I’d hate – and found friendship and escapeRead moreWhen I would normally be comatose on the sofa in the evenings, I now have to peel myself off it and go on a brisk walk to the cat owners’ houses. I don’t need to spell out the virtues of exercise, but I will say that the fresh air and upping my step count has made me feel healthier.The best and most unexpected benefit, however, has been finally meeting my neighbours, beyond taking in their Amazon deliveries. I’ve got to know everyone from IT workers to animation directors and have even been sent holiday pictures from Italy like I was a member of the family. When my boyfriend found a lost credit card, I immediately recognised the name – one of my cat-sitting clients – and popped it through their letterbox.I’m also no longer part of the sullen mass of people with their headphones in and their eyes fixed to the pavement as they trudge to catch the tube. Now, my journeys to the station are significantly less miserable and insular as I regularly bump into friendly cat-sitting clients (human and animal).It’s taken three years, but, thanks to cat-sitting, I don’t just feel as if I live in a flat, I feel as if I live in a community. Cat-sitting has completely changed my perception of London, which I’ve found cold and lonely at times. Despite living in the capital for more than a decade, I can count on one hand the number of meaningful conversations I’ve had with people outside my social bubble. That has changed as I’m warmly welcomed into strangers’ homes for a cup of tea, a natter, and to meet their cats. It’s made me happier, healthier and more open. Finally, London feels like home.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedCatsPetsAnimalsWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Years ago – a decade at least – I bought a classic blue cotton button-down shirt from J Crew, with rhinestone beads embroidered on the collar. One of those purchases that feels whimsical but turns out to be an unexpected wardrobe staple. I still wear it all the time, because it hits a sweet spot of being special without being fussy, and it layers brilliantly under crew-neck sweaters or knit vests. I spotted this Boden version at their recent press day: it’s great.BodenSienna shirt with jewel collar£85£85 at BodenMagic mushroomsSuperoomLion’s mane liquid formulafrom£39.99£39.99 at Superoom£44.99 at AmazonSuperoom lion’smane liquid formula£39.99 at Superoom£44.99 at AmazonNot that sort. Functional mushrooms are the latest niche wellness craze to go mainstream, with lion’s mane coffee the new kale juice. The mushroom market is a bit of a wild west – Instagram keeps trying to sell me Chinese imports of dubious origin and efficacy – but I’ve tried Superoom for six weeks (lion’s mane for focus, reishi for sleep) and I think it’s helping. Superoom tinctures are clinically tested, using mushrooms organically grown in Finland. The bottles are beautiful, which I know isn’t the point, but also sort of is, because they’re pretty enough to put on display, meaning I actually remember to take them.SuperoomLion’s mane liquid formulafrom£39.99£39.99 at Superoom£44.99 at AmazonMercules, the Spanish handbag label you need to know aboutMerculesFoxy bag£140£140 at MerculesFoxy bag£140 at MerculesBecause the world is insane, there are lots of glorious handbags if you have a grand or more to spend, and endless cheap-as-chips high-street knock-offs built to last about two weeks, but it’s frustratingly hard to find anything in between. This is why it’s worth knowing about Mercules. Helmed by an ex-Loewe designer and made in Spain from quality leather, these bags are minimal, properly made, sensibly priced. My favourite is the Foxy, which comes in a pleasing mid size with two straps (one for shoulder carrying, one cross body), detachable via sleek carabiner clips.

I love Me+Em because you can tell that the designs have been tried on and thought through by real women, rather than ripped off the latest catwalk trend and safety pinned on to a teenage model for a publicity shot.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Withthe best vacuum cleanersperfectly capable of cleaning both carpet and hard floors, investing in a second device that specialises in one or the other might seem like an unnecessary luxury. While Dyson’s £429.99 PencilVac Fluffycones looks positively affordable next to its £749.99V16 Piston Animal, it’s a hard-floor specialist that can’t tackle carpets or particularly big cleans, and it won’t replace your existing vacuum. However, indulge me for a moment, because if you have any hard floor that needs regular sweeping for dust, hair and crumbs, it’s an accessible, flexible and friendly little cleaner.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The PencilVac is small for a Dyson and comes with a free-standing charging dock rather than the usual wall mount. It’s clearly designed to sit in the corner of a kitchen or dining area and be brought out for a quick sweep-up whenever needed. It’s also handy for a quick nip around a pet’s favourite hangouts, or for a sweep of your bathroom floor.Dyson has experimented with hard-floor cleaners previously, and the PencilVac has a clear lineage back to theOmni-glide, which is still available, though only in refurbished form. The brand has streamlined the design to a significant degree, however, with a much sleeker body, a vastly improved emptying experience and excellent dust-detecting floor lights.View at DysonHow I testedView image in fullscreenThe vacuum was tasked with picking up flour, cat litter and pet hair during testing.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBecause the PencilVac Fluffycones is designed for hard floors only, I didn’t put it through my usual barrage of carpet tasks, but I did test it exhaustively on hard floor. I put it through its paces with the usual trio of troublesome spillages – I measured specific quantities of flour, cat litter and pet hair, and recorded how much of each spillage the floor head picked up, by weighing the collection bin before and after use. I give all vacuums one forward and backward motion to pick up as much as they can, so this doesn’t test how much a vacuum could ultimately collect, but it is a good guide to how efficient the floor head is in various difficult circumstances. It’s a good comparator to use against all the other vacuums I’ve tested.I also measure the suction power using a vacuum gauge, though Dyson’s vacuums have a tendency to cut out if their tubes are blocked, so this metric is slightly less useful here.I tested battery life by leaving the vacuum switched on to run down from a full charge. This was done on a hard floor, using the device’s most economical setting, then again on its most powerful mode.What you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Except for the floor head, the entire device is squeezed into a long pole.’Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianView at DysonThe PencilVac Fluffycones has an odd name, but it’s descriptive of two of its key features. PencilVac is fairly self explanatory: you can’t write with it, but it’s long, slender and pencil-like in appearance. Except for the floor head, the entire device is squeezed into a long (940mm) pole with a diameter of just 40mm, which doesn’t feel much bulkier in the hand than a standard 25mm broom handle.This isn’t just a hollow extension wand: it incorporates everything that isn’t in the floor head, including the collection bin, the miniaturised Dyson vacuum motor, the battery and the control buttons. There’s no bulky additional unit to attach to the top. While at 1.8kg it’s heavier than it looks, it feels much lighter once it’s switched on and the clever design comes into play.The floor head is where the Fluffycones are located. Fluffy rollers aren’t new to Dyson vacuums, but previous fluffies have tended to be single rollers. Here you have four, arranged in a grid with two cones at the front and two at the back. The front and back pair rotate in opposite directions, so any dirt beneath the floor head is swept into the path of the suction tube, connected at the centre.View image in fullscreenThere’s space to store the included attachment on the vacuum’s dock.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianThe vacuum sits on four tiny caster wheels located between the Fluffycones. These make the floor head fairly mobile on their own, but start the rollers spinning and the unit lifts slightly, still resting on its casters but providing a feeling of weightlessness. Push the PencilVac around the floor, and it glides as though it were sitting on a cushion of air.Looking at the included combination crevice tool and dusting attachment, you might think that this can also operate as a handheld. It can, but it’s not perfect. When you remove the floor head, you’re left with a long wand, with the collection bin at the base and the battery unit at the top, and no way to shorten it further. That makes the attachment good for whipping around skirting boards and removing cobwebs from ceiling corners and light fittings, but cumbersome to use at regular handheld distance.The last thing you get in the box is the charging dock. This has a larger footprint than the vacuum cleaner, measuring 25 x 29cm, and a connection at the back to plug in the charging cable. The vacuum cleaner snaps into an upright arm and is held in place using magnets, with a space behind it to store the included attachment.Dyson PencilVac Fluffycones specificationsWeight:1.8kgMax suction power (quoted):not specifiedMax suction power (measured):21kPaBattery life (quoted):30minsBattery life (measured):23minsCharge time (quoted):3hrs 30minsDust capacity:0.8 litresAdditional filters supplied?NoDimensions (measured):23 x 16 x 116cm (WDH)What we loveView image in fullscreen‘The Fluffycones floor head is truly omnidirectional.’Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianThe best thing about the PencilVac is how flexible the Fluffycones floor head is. It’s truly omnidirectional thanks to the clever joint that connects the head to the wand, and the broom handle grip, which can be held in any orientation. There are detection lights that genuinely help you spot dusty sections of floor, and they’re located on both the front and back, so it doesn’t matter which way it’s facing. It can even be twisted and pushed sideways, which is brilliant for weaving between the legs of chairs and breakfast-bar stools.I wasn’t immediately convinced about the dust compartment because it looks tiny, though it claims to be 0.8 litres. That’s larger thanDyson’s 0.54-litre Car+Boat handheld vacuum(as featured in my roundup of thebest cordless vacuums), which looks like a much bulkier unit. In using it, however, I was sold. It cleverly uses its suction to compact dust at the top of the compartment, so it keeps working without getting blocked as it fills, and it’s easy to see when it’s getting full.Emptying is cleaner and better than any Dyson I’ve seen to date. Remove the floor head and point the base of the wand into the bin, then release a catch on the back and start drawing the collection bin’s outer tube down towards the bin. It picks up the dust and dirt from inside and starts pushing it down through the empty tube. By the time you’ve pushed it all the way down, the contents of the tube should be in the bin, without the dust cloud that’s often produced when emptying a Dyson.My floor-head tests were deeply divided in terms of success, but I was impressed with its ability to pick up flour. Because the cones meet in the middle, it left a slight but visible trail of flour behind on the first pass, though it wasn’t enough to register its absence on my kitchen scales, which reported a clean sweep. It cleaned up the smudge on a second pass.This carried across into general use. I found the PencilVac did an exceptional job of collecting dust, fluff, crumbs and a light scattering of cocker-spaniel hair when performing a regular sweep of my hard floors. The detection lights aren’t a gimmick: the green glow genuinely illuminates dirt and dust that lies ahead of it, and reassures you that it’s gone once the rollers have passed over.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreenInstead of picking up cat litter, the vacuum scattered it around the floor.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianWhere the floor head wasn’t so good was when attempting to pick up larger objects, including the cat litter and the pet-hair clippings that I regularly perform tests with. The cat litter was scattered by the floor head, which is unusual in a fluffy roller, but might have been due to the conical shape ejecting problematic debris to the side. It made it impossible to clear the litter in one pass, and I found it was much easier to pick up afterwards with the crevice tool rather than the floor head.I also found it didn’t pick up clumps of dog hair particularly well, no matter how much I spread it out, as the narrower tube and close-fitting cones were prone to clogging. Again, it was better if I avoided using the floor head completely here, but such heavy-duty cleaning work is best performed with a heavier-duty device.I also have a slight problem with the irregular shape of the floor head. While it cleans up to the edges of walls well, it can’t quite make it into the corners of rooms, which will leave you reaching for the crevice tool.Warranty, repairability and sustainabilityAs with all Dyson cordless vacuum cleaners, the PencilVac Fluffycones comes with a two-year warranty. This covers parts and labour for repairs to faulty products, but not general wear and tear, filter replacements or the battery. Repairs come with an additional 12-month warranty.The vacuum doesn’t come with a printed manual, but there’s one available online as a pdf, or you can download the MyDyson app and access the manual from there. Both the website and the app have a good selection of videos and tips on maintenance and cleaning. Dyson recommends emptying the collection bin regularly and performing a full rinse of the filter at least once a month.If you’re using the PencilVac to replace another device, Dyson will recycle it for you, if you can take it to aDemo Store(London, Manchester or Birmingham) within 28 days. Otherwise, you should take it toyour nearest recycling centre.Most Dysons come packaged in recyclable cardboard packaging.Dyson PencilVac Fluffycones: should I buy it?View image in fullscreenThis vacuum is an expensive luxury but it’s useful if you have plenty of hard floors to sweep.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIf you have plenty of hard floors and sweep them regularly, you’ll get a lot of use out of this nimble device. It’s light and enjoyable to use, and the more chair legs and obstacles you have, the more satisfying it is to work your way around them. It won’t replace your regular vacuum for a whole-house deep clean, though, especially if you have carpets or pets. At £429.99, that makes it an expensive, if useful, luxury.View at DysonFor more:Dyson V16 Piston Animal reviewThe best cordless vacuum cleaners, testedThe best robot vacuums to keep your home clean and dust freeAndy Shaw is a consumer journalist and technology addict.

Bought puff pastry makes an instant (and decadent) alternative. Yes, I know you can buy ready-rolled shortcrust, but I wouldn’t: it’s trash. If this column didn’t have a 30-minute time constraint, I’d blitz 200g plain flour and 100g cold cubed salted butter to sand, then add one egg yolk and a tablespoon of cold water, then blitz for a few seconds, and no longer, until it just comes together. I’m unorthodox, so I then tip the pastry straight into a pie dish, quickly pat it into place and freeze for 15 minutes. Blind bake for 10 minutes at 180C(160C fan)/350F/gas 4, before removing the paper and baking beans and tipping in the filling – it’s really not very much work. But it does add 20 minutes to proceedings, which disqualifies the recipe from this column. So it’s bought, pre-rolled puff pastry instead.Mushroom and artichoke puff pastry quichePrep15 minCook25 minServes42tbsp olive oil, or oil from the artichoke jar300gchestnut mushrooms, roughly sliced2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated100g creme fraiche3eggs1tsp sea salt flakes320g sheet ready-rolled puff pastry150g jarred artichoke pieces, cut into 1cm slices150g goat’s cheese log, slicedA few sprigs fresh rosemaryHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.

Unroll the puff pastry sheet into a medium roasting tin, so the pastry comes up all four sides; you may end up with an overhang on the longer edges, in which case trim them and use the surplus pastry to make cheese or jam pinwheels.Tip the sauteed mushrooms into the pastry case, then arrange the artichoke slices evenly on top. Pour over the creme fraiche and egg mixture, then arrange the goat’s cheese and rosemary sprigs all over the top.

Follow the ‘wok clock’ and both are ready in about half an hourJeremy PangMon 2 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTShareStir-frying, as its name suggests, is the technique of frying while continuously stirring or circulating heat, and it is the heat that’s all-important. Stir-frying is all aboutwok hei, or ‘wok’s air’ in English, which you can think of as the ‘height of fire’, or the level of heat. It’s said that Chinese cooks have good wok hei if they have a true understanding of the heat of their wok and how to handle it in all situations, and a stir-fry’s success is based on the quality of the cook’s wok hei.Singapore noodles (pictured top)This dish may not actually be Singaporean in origin, seemingly drawing on influences and crossovers in cuisine from various regions throughout Asia, but it’s actually the noodles – Singapore vermicelli – that give it its name. Singapore noodles are supposed to be dry yet packed full of flavour. To get this right, follow the instructions closely and remember to keep your wok smoking hot at all times –never, everlose your sizzle!Prep15 minCook15 minServes2100gdried Singapore vermicelli noodles2 eggs, well beaten½ onion, finely sliced½ red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely sliced6 large raw tiger or king prawns, peeled and deveined1 handful fresh beansprouts, rinsed and well drainedVegetable oil1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced, to garnishFor the spice paste1 bird’s-eye chilli, finely chopped1tbsp water1tbsp light soy sauce½tsp dark soy sauce1tsp sesame oil1tsp madras curry powder1–2 pinches chilli powder, to taste¼tsp saltSoak the noodles in hot water for three minutes, until they have separated, then drain and leave to dry on a clean tea towel for 10 minutes. Mix all the ingredients for the spice paste in a small bowl or ramekin.Build a“wok clock”on a large plate or board. Start at 12 o’clock with the beaten egg, followed by the onion and red pepper at three o’clock, the prawns, beansprouts and noodles at six o’clock and finally the spice paste at nine o’clock.Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok on a high heat. When it’s smoking hot, pour in the beaten egg, leave to bubble for a few seconds, then lightly scramble until cooked through.Push the egg to one side of the wok, to make space for the vegetables and heat again until smoking hot. (If you prefer, you can transfer the egg to a bowl, or scramble it in a small wok with not enough space for the veg as well.) Add the onion and red pepper to the wok, stir-fry for a minute, then add the prawns and stir-fry for 30–60 seconds, until lightly browned.Add the beansprouts to the wok, stir-fry for 20–30 seconds, then add the noodles and stir-fry for a minute. Stir in the spice paste and cook, stirring, until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined, and the noodles have dried out a little and are just starting to stick to the wok. Transfer to a large serving bowl, scatter over the spring onion garnish and serve.Sichuan chickenView image in fullscreenJeremy Pang’s Sichuan chicken stir-fry.The region of Sichuan is situated on the western side of China, and is therefore heavily influenced by ingredients from Tibet and northern India. The most significant of these, Sichuan peppercorns, have become increasingly popular in the west in recent years. These dried red berries, native to China, have a distinct fragrance when crushed and provide a unique numbing feeling all over the tongue, something the Chinese callma la. They can be easily found in most Asian supermarkets and on the world food aisle of large supermarkets.Prep15 minCook20 minServes4400gboneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 3cm-wide strips½ onion, cut into fine matchsticks1 red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh cut into fine matchsticks10 dried red chillies2tsp Sichuan peppercorns, crushed in a mortar3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped1 bird’s-eye chilli, stalk discarded, rest finely chopped200gcashew nutsVegetable oil1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced, to garnishFor the marinade1½tbsp cornflour1tsp sugar1 large pinchChinese five-spice2tbsp light soy sauce1tsp sesame oilFor the sauce3tbsp Shaoxing rice wine, or dry sherry1tbsp light soy sauce2tbsp hoisin sauce2tsp chilli paste, or chilli bean pastePut the chicken in a large bowl, add all the marinade ingredients and, using your hands, massage into the strips until evenly coated. Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl or ramekin, and set aside.Build your wok clock on a large plate or board. Start at 12 o’clock with the onion, red pepper and dried red chillies, then work your way round with the marinated chicken, crushed Sichuan peppercorns and garlic at three o’clock, the bird’s-eye chilli and sauce at six o’clock and, finally, the cashew nuts at nine o’clock.Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok on a high heat. When it’s smoking hot, add the onion, red pepper and dried red chillies, and stir-fry for one to two minutes, until the onion is lightly browned and slightly softened.Turn down the heat to medium and push the ingredients to the side of the wok. Add another half-tablespoon of vegetable oil to the centre of the wok, heat to smoking point, then add the chicken and stir-fry for three to five minutes, until golden brown on all sides. Turn down the heat to medium, add the crushed Sichuan peppercorns and garlic, and stir-fry for two minutes.Add the bird’s-eye chilli and sauce, and stir-fry on a medium-high heat for two minutes, until the sauce has thickened and reduced and is sticking to the chicken.

I hadto chase for updates continually.Two months later, my claim was denied because my brother had suffered daytime drowsiness prior to the commencement of the policy. Doctors had found no cause for concern and made no diagnosis.The insurersdecidedthese were symptoms of a tumour.Last October, five months after the claim, the company said it would pay £9,000 to reflect the uncertainty of the medical evidence and the sensitive circumstances. Three weeks laterit withdrew the offer. We have lost £22,000and can’t now afford a new wedding date.KW,LondonAviva denied our sick son help after five-month waitRead moreThis is heartbreaking and highlights the traps that lurk in many insurance contracts.You told me that, in 2020 and 2022, your brother, a medical student, consulted doctors about a drooping eyelid and recurring drowsiness. He was referred both times to a sleep clinic and given advice on sleep hygiene. “No additional red flags,” confirmed a medical letter in 2022.You bought the insurance policy in December 2023. The declaration form asked if anyone critical to the wedding, from flower girls to grandparents, had any previous or existing medical conditions. Your brother’s undiagnosed fatigue did not cross your mind. A separate list of exclusions included any claim arising from a pre-existing condition. Its terms and conditions define this as any illness that showed “clinical signs” before the policy commenced.TIE accepts that it was not unreasonable to omit your brother’s fatigue on the form, given that doctors had given him a clean bill of health, but insists that his symptoms were, in retrospect, related to the tumour and that the exclusion therefore applies.The terms and conditions strike me as vague, sweeping and confusingly worded in that the exclusion appears to cover every symptom and previous, or potential illness, of the entire wedding party at any point.TIE’s letter of rejection, moreover, implies that conditions do not have to have been diagnosed to disqualify a claim.This would allow it to diagnose with the benefit of hindsight if a claim is made.The Financial Ombudsman Service, which investigates complaints about rejected insurance claims, says it considers whether customers should reasonably have been aware of an undiagnosed pre-existing condition which might lead to a claim if symptoms were minor and unspecific. It states, by way of an example, thatheadaches do not necessarily mean an illness, but could later turn out to be symptoms of a brain tumour.I put these points to TIE, which stood by its pre-existing condition exclusion and its wording. “To remain fair and consistent to all customers, we are not able to alter or waive this requirement for individual cases,” it says.Nonetheless, it has rewritten its declaration form since your complaints, and customers are now specifically asked about conditions awaiting test results, or treatment, or any terminal diagnoses.When I asked about the withdrawal of the £9,000 offer, the company agreed to reinstate it. It has already paid you £350 in recognition of service shortfalls. It is possible that the Financial Ombudsman Service would uphold your complaint and order a full payout.However, there is also a chance that, since your brother had to seek medical help on several occasions before you bought the policy, it might decide that the insurer’s decision is justified and you could end up with less, or even nothing. You have therefore accepted the offer so you can focus on supporting him.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

You’re probably actually quite good at focusing: 10 myths about attentionEvery second, 11m bits of information enter our brains, which then efficiently prioritise them. We need to learn to work with the process, rather than against itElle HuntMon 2 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 06.57 ESTShareIt’s believed that we have about 50,000 thoughts a day: big, small, urgent, banal – “Did I leave the oven on?”. And those are just the ones that register. Subconsciously, we’re constantly sifting through a barrage of stimuli: background noise, clutter on our desks, the mere presence of our phones.Every second, 11m bits of information enter our brains. Just 0.0004% is perceived by our conscious minds, showing just how hard our brains are working to parse what’s sufficiently relevant to bring to our attention.It’s no wonder you feel distracted.Formidable though they may be, our brains’ processing powers are a poor match for the fast-paced modern world, the constant pings of our devices and sources of distraction. Many of us routinely feel overwhelmed, and struggle to focus on what we need to get done.But a new book suggests doing so may be easier than we think. In Focus On-Off, Dutch experts Mark Tigchelaar and Oscar de Bos argue that we can better harness our attention by better understanding our brains, and learning how to manage common “leaks” of our concentration.“We like to play the blame game with focus,” says De Bos, head of the training company Focus Academy, over Zoom from Amsterdam. But many of the most common difficulties, “you can solve for yourself.”Here’s what we commonly get wrong about focusing, and how we can better manage our minds.Myth: concentrating is hardView image in fullscreenEven a mention of your name, for example at a party, can cause subconscious distraction.Photograph: Posed by models. Compassionate Eye Foundation/Natasha Alipour Faridani/Getty ImagesMost of us don’t find it hard to focus on something we’re interested in, De Bos points out. What we condemn as “distractions” are just the brain prioritising what it perceives as most important at that moment. Yes, you might conclude that checking Instagram wasn’t the best use of your time – but your brain didn’t struggle to act on the urge to open the app and enjoy some pictures of your friends or of strangers’ cats.It shows that focusing isn’t hard. Where we run into difficulty is by struggling against our brains, and even judging them for doing what they’re built to do, says De Bos.We routinely underestimate how hard our brains are working to take in everything around us and put it into order. De Bos gives the example of talking to someone at a party. “If you’re listening to this conversation and somebody mentions your name, you’re going to be subconsciously distracted,” he says. “All the words around you came into your ears, were processed inside your brain, and then your brain decided: ‘Oh, wait, this is important – let’s switch our attention.’”Instead of trying to fight this mental tendency to jump around, we can learn to manage it by becoming aware of common “leaks” of concentration. If you find a task boring, make it more interesting. If your work environment is distracting, move somewhere quieter. If your mind is too busy, clear some space by writing down your thoughts. If you’re exhausted, give your brain a break.Myth: turn off notifications to focusMost of us know to turn off notifications to limit interruptions from our phones, but even having our devices within sight subtly drains our concentration.A2017 studyby researchers at the University of Texas found that participants performed better in complex cognitive tasks when their phones were in a different room, compared with when the devices were in sight or even inside a pocket or bag.The mere presence of the phone was found to negatively affect available working memory and functional fluid intelligence (such as problem-solving and critical thinking), even among people who typically didn’t struggle to focus.While keeping your phone to hand probably won’t interfere with sending emails or similarly untaxing tasks, De Bos suggests moving it to a different room and/or turning it off when you want to get “deep work” done.Even keeping your desk and workspace clear, and minimising open browser tabs, can aid cognitive capacity, he says.Myth: we should be striving for ‘flow’View image in fullscreenTotal focus … in the ‘flow state’.Photograph: Posed by model; Rattanavan Baunoi/Getty ImagesThe antithesis of a frazzled, jumpy state of mind – and frequently put forward as optimal for productivity – is the fabled “flow state”, whereby we’re absorbed in what we’re doing.Coined as a term by psychologistMihály Csíkszentmihály in 1975, it’s characterised by total concentration, and such effortless, productive attention that we’re not even aware of time passing.It’s nice when you can get it, says De Bos, but it’s not realistic to aim for routinely. Achieving flow depends on striking a delicate balance between challenge and skill: a task must be difficult enough to be absorbing, but also achievable. It also takes time to kick in, usually around 10 to 15 minutes without interruptions.So it’s unlikely you’re ever going to get “into flow” going through your emails. We may also be losing the skill, having become so accustomed to jumping between tasks, De Bos suggests. “It’s almost beyond what the average person can do nowadays … We don’t have these 10 to 15 minutes of doing the same thing.”Stop striving for flow when you’re unlikely to achieve it, and set yourself a lower bar, says De Bos. “Focus is just a few seconds of doing the same thing; the flow state is more difficult.”Myth: it’s only a quick emailThe biggest thief of our focus is task-switching. Sometimes this is put upon us by external interruptions, such as a question from a colleague or a buzz from our phone, but the trigger can also be internal: a thought will register and we’ll act on it, almost without thinking.You might think “it’ll only take a second”, but every time you switch to a new task, part of your brain clings to what you were just doing, splitting your attention, slowing you down and making you less effective.Simply checking your phone or inbox causes a temporary drop in IQ, lasting at least a minute. If either the original activity or the interruption is a bit more complex, that recovery takes longer.View image in fullscreenMinimise task-switching …Photograph: Posed by model; Milan Markovic/Getty ImagesThe best way to improve your focus is to take whatever steps you can to minimise this task-switching. De Bos suggests not checking your emails before (or during) a meeting, shutting down your inbox while doing complex work and not starting tasks you don’t have time to finish.If you have more control over your time, you can further minimise task-switching by structuring your days (or weeks) by tasks, projects or themes. De Bos reserves meetings for Monday and Wednesday mornings, deep work for Tuesday and Thursdays and creative work on Fridays.Not only does this give you a chance to “get into the groove a little bit”, but over time, “these highways in your brain get stronger, so it’s easier to stay focused”.Likewise, if you feel a sudden urge to check your phone or email, wait five minutes, training your attention span.Myth: getting stuff done takes peace and quietView image in fullscreenDistracting conversations can be blocked out by reading faster.Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty ImagesWe might think we need total silence to focus, but “sometimes we don’t haveenoughstimuli”, De Bos says. That’s why our minds tend to wander when faced with a task we find boring, easy or slow. “Everything else is more exciting for your brain, and it will start to think about something else.”One solution is increasing the level of mental challenge. If you’re struggling to read a dense document while your colleagues are having a noisy conversation about The Traitors, try reading faster, De Bos suggests.Similarly, listening to music you know well (and are unlikely to be distracted by) can help you to engage with work you don’t find stimulating. Both strategies make your brain work harder, focusing it more effectively on the task at hand.“Especially if it’s something you do every day, challenge yourself – go a bit quicker, or make it harder, to kind of trick yourself into thinking that it’s more exciting,” De Bos says.Myth: take the easy winsIt can be tempting to pad out your to-do lists with small wins as a way to motivate yourself to tackle more, but De Bos cautions against it.“For some people, it works, because you can get a kind of dopamine rush,” he says. People with ADHD in particular, who can struggle to prioritise and order tasks, may benefit from creating momentum.But often, says De Bos, those easy victories work against us by draining our finite mental reserves. He supports what’s known as the “eating the frog” method of time management, and tackling your most important task first.View image in fullscreenA good night’s sleep regulates glutamate levels.Photograph: Posed by model. Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty ImagesThe brain tires with exertion over the course of the day, making us less effective and more impulsive. A2022 studyby researchers at the Paris Brain Institute found that, as we’re engaged in “attentionally demanding” work, glutamate (an amino acid and neurotransmitter) gradually accumulates in one area of the prefrontal cortex, impairing functioning.That buildup of glutamate “is not easily cleaned up” by short breaks, says De Bos: it really takes a good night’s sleep for the brain to feel fully refreshed, meaning you should budget on having “a certain amount of focus” each day.Knowing that, it makes sense to spend it judiciously, and do your most important work first. “You never know how much you’ll have left in the second half of the day.”Myth: limit social media to breaksSpacing out mentally taxing activities and taking breaks from work both help to regulate glutamate levels, but what we do in those breaks is also important. Scrolling social media, reading and many other activities we find fun or refreshing might be less demanding than work, but still involve taking in new information. “Your brain is not recharging in that moment,” says De Bos.Without regular opportunities for the brain to pause and “do mostly nothing”, over time, that accumulated glutamate can lead to stress, sleeping issues and potentially burnout: “That’s where you really get into problems.”View image in fullscreenStare way to tech heaven?Photograph: Posed by model; Igor Suka/Getty ImagesThe most restorative activities are those that require very little of you, such as going for a walk without headphones, cleaning and even staring out the window. These activate the brain’s all-important “default mode network”, says De Bos, permitting it a chance to recover and stave off burnout. “When you’re not feeding it with new information, it finally has time to clean up your memories of the day … Anything where your mind can kind of wander is a good break.”Even rewatching a familiar television show is a better option than a new or challenging one, De Bos adds – and certainly less involving than social media.Myth: we should all be ‘time-blocking’Many productivity hackers swear by “time-blocking”, where you plan out your day hour-by-hour and assign hours (or minutes) to a particular task or activity in a calendar.If it works for you, great, says De Bos. Just don’t then also use a to-do list as you’ll risk creating inconsistencies between that and your calendar – not to mention potentially spending more time on productivity management than being productive.For many people, however, time-blocking is a headache and sometimes counterproductive, given that it depends on our faulty powers of prediction. “We’re trying to think, ‘How much time is this task going to take me?’ and the answer is never right,” says De Bos.Either we underestimate and fall behind, or else a straightforward task balloons to fit the time assigned to it. “We overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can do in an hour,” he says.The Pomodoro technique of working in 25-minute bursts can be better for motivating you to meet a deadline, or getting you started on a complex (or boring) task. But sometimes the secret to getting more done is attempting to do less, says De Bos. Our finite powers of focus mean there is a limit to how many projects or responsibilities we can take on.Myth: most meetings should be emailsView image in fullscreenMany meetings are over just as they’re getting started.Photograph: Posed by models; Organic Media/Getty ImagesWhile nobody likes meetings, the trend for making them shorter – or replacing them with emails – isn’t helping our ability to focus, says De Bos.It takes at least 10 minutes to really engage with an activity, meaning many meetings are over just as they’re getting started, leading to more meetings. But managing, sending and replying to emails is an even bigger drain on our concentration. “If it’s important, I’d rather have a good, long meeting and be done with it,” De Bos says. But, he adds, “I think we’re over-communicating.” Technology has enabled us to externalise and outsource our every thought at the expense of not just our time but other people’s. “We kind of do brain dumps on each other … There’s no time for work any more; it’s just emailing.”So try to be intentional and considerate in your communication. Do you need to fire off this “quick q” to your colleague, or could you wait to see if it resolves – or answer it yourself?“There’s a lot we can do smarter,” says De Bos. If you have too many things on your mind, make a note to revisit later. Don’t use your colleagues “as your capture tool. If you email a lot, you’re part of the problem.”Myth: we can’t beat Big TechBetween the stranglehold of Big Tech, reports of screen addiction and shortening attention spans, it’s easy to feel hopeless about our ability to focus. But De Bos is refreshingly optimistic.Yes, the modern world is riddled with sources of distraction, but we also have more power to resist them than we might assume. “The time is now to start thinking about it, and make some decisions: what does worklife look like?” Instead of shutting your phone in a drawer, ask yourself: how are you going to spend the time you would have lost to scrolling? What routines and rules can minimise day-to-day disruptions and decision-making?View image in fullscreen‘We get nervous about not being productive’ … Oscar de Bos.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianPerhaps your struggles with focus stem from asking too much of yourself. “We get so nervous about not being productive,” says De Bos.But our brains need breaks, and time to recover, just as our bodies do. Sometimes, it might be best to stare into the middle distance.Focus On-Off by Mark Tigchelaar and Oscar de Bos is published 29 JanuaryThis article was amended on 2 February to give the correct name of Oscar de Bos’s company: Focus AcademyExplore more on these topicsLife and stylePsychologyHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Regular consumption has also been linked to better overall gut health. There’sgrowing evidencethat habitual coffee drinkers tend to have a different gut microbiome – the trillions of microbes that help with digestion and nutrient absorption – with more of certain microbes associated with good health. Coffee is one of the main sources of polyphenols in our diets, a group of antioxidant compounds that these microbes feed on. It also contains a small amount of fibre.Is it true that … you lose most body heat from your head?Read moreWhen it comes to using coffee as a tool for gut health, timing matters, Leeming says, because our gut health is linked to the health of all our body’s systems.Caffeine has a long half-life – it can circulate in the body for up to 12 hours for some people – and may disrupt sleep. And “poor sleep is related to poor gut health”, says Leeming. Grogginess after a bad night’s sleep can also trigger less healthy food choices, which can affect our gut health more negatively still.She recommends only drinking caffeinated coffee before noon, and switching to decaf or herbal tea in the afternoon.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …CoffeeHealth & wellbeingFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I risked tooth decay to track down the quintessential blend of crisp pastry, an oozy centre and sugary cinnamonLaura HallMon 2 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTShareOpen sandwiches (smørrebrød),meatballs(frikadeller),crispy pork belly (stegt flæsk) …There are many must-eat dishes for food lovers visiting Denmark, though perhaps nothing springs to mind as readily as the Danish pastry. But how are you supposed to choose from the countless bakeries on offer? And once you have decided which to visit, which pastry to eat? As a long-term resident of Copenhagen and pastry obsessive, I took on the Guardian’s challenge to find the best Danish pastry in town.Let’s get started with the shocking fact that Danish pastries are not actually Danish. In Denmark they’re calledwienerbrød(Viennese bread) and made using a laminated dough technique that originated in Vienna. There’s also no such thing as a “Danish” in Denmark – there are so many different types of pastry that the word loses meaning. What we know as a Danish is aspandauer– a round pastry with a folded border and a circle of yellowy custard in the middle. Then there’s thetebirkes, a folded pastry often with a baked marzipan-style centre and poppy seeds on the top; afrøsnapper, a twist of pastry dusted with poppy seeds; and asnegl, which translates as “snail” but is known as a cinnamon swirl in English.View image in fullscreenPastries are an essential energy source for exploring Copenhagen.Photograph: Marco Bottigelli/Getty ImagesI decided to compare bakeries based on theirsnegl– partly because they are my favourite but mainly because you can find one just about everywhere. I’m also clear on what constitutes a good one: it should have a crisp outer circle and a squidgier middle, which Danes regard as the best bit, and should taste of cinnamon and sugar.With a steady stream of often international pastry chefs leaving the city’s high-end restaurants to open their own bakeries, new outlets are popping up nearly every day. There’s a low-key fight going on between old and new, but in this Instagram age it’s not a fair one. While the more traditional bakeries are marked out by the goldenkringle, a sign like a pretzel, hanging outside their shops, the boutique-style bakeries have nearly always got better lighting and more vibrant displays.For me, it’s a classic story of modernisation and renewal: some adaptations may go too far, but others make traditional pastry taste even better, so why not? I explored both types: the traditional bakeries imbued withhyggeand historic charm, and the chic, patisserie-style places. Try them both – it’s fun!Sankt Peders BageriView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mark TanggaardFamous for its “Wednesdaysnegl”, Sankt Peders is the oldest bakery in the city, dating back to 1652, and it looks the part: on a cobbled Old Town street, it has a goldenkringlehanging outside, and the scent of cinnamon perfumes the air. I ask for their classic pastry and am handed a cinnamonsnegl. It’s round, rather flat, and decorated with a splodge of white icing. I bite into its crisp outer edges and find a soft inner section. It’s good, but the lack of height – along with the teeth-achingly sweet icing – means it won’t be in contention for a top spot.30 kroner (£3.50), 5/10BrødView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mark TanggaardHipster vibes abound at Brød, a small modern bakery on Enghave Plads in the vibrant Vesterbro district. Babies are sleeping in prams outside and a man wearing a teeny-weeny beanie pulls up on a cargo bike as I arrive. The young baker serving me is very proud of Denmark’s pastry expertise and advises me to try asnegl, aspandauerand atebirkesto get a fully rounded idea of what they do. How can I say no? Thespandauerandtebirkesare good, not too sweet, but I’m a particular fan of the tall cinnamon swirl and its deliciously squidgy middle.30 kroner, 7.5/10JunoView image in fullscreenCopenhagen Juno the bakeryPhotograph: Kathrine PreislerThis has been consistently rated one of the best bakeries in the city since it was opened by the Swedish baker and ex-Noma pastry chef Emil Glaser in the Østerbro district in 2017. I drop in to try their classic cardamom bun, but there’s nowhere to sit so I take it to work. It’s beautiful to look at, delicately plaited and dusted with sugar and black flecks of cardamom. It’s sweet, slightly chewy and very moreish. At this point I think I should be more like Prue and Paul on Bake Off and just eat a morsel of each pastry to avoid the ensuing sugar crash that will derail my day. But I find I can’t stop myself.34 kroner, 9/10Discount 365View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ellie HallBefore I tell you to shell out for one of the city’s more expensive pastries, I have a responsibility to make sure cheaper versions are represented here. So I visit a local supermarket, Discount 365, and buy a thin, flat and coldsneglfrom the bakery cabinet, topped with a circle of white icing. It’s crisply crunchy nearly all the way through and lacks a soft middle. There’s not much in the way of cinnamon taste and there’s absolutely no lingering flavour, except for maybe margarine. Pay more: you’ll thank me.12 kroner, 1/10Albatross & VennerView image in fullscreenAlbatross and Venner served 10 types of pastry.Photograph: Laura HallThey are still rolling up the shutters of the Torvehallerne food hall when I arrive, but a decent queue is already forming at Albatross & Venner. I count 10 different types of pastry as I wait: next to fat cinnamon swirls, there are chia swirls, feta and spinach swirls and other savoury options. I opt for a cinnamonsnegl, which they make with coffee syrup. The thick, uneven rolls are a little clumsy, but it’s glazed, soft and delicious. There’s no real definition between the outside and the inside so it’s not in the elite league. But it is hearty.35 kroner, 6.5/10LagkagehusetView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ellie HallAlthough I’m a big fan of independents, it would be remiss to not mention the city’s bakery chains. Lagkagehuset is a classic, with a modern concrete and marble interior, and reliable options from a counter that offers everything from great sandwiches to glossy cakes and quintessential pastries. Bakery snobs despair at their mass-produced goods but I remain a fan. I plump for adirektørsnegl, a big chocolate-topped cinnamon swirl, which is messy with an oozy centre. If you don’t love really sweet things you may find it too sickly – but that’s not how I roll.27 kroner, 8/10RivieraView image in fullscreenRiviera is known for its excellenttebirkes(in the foreground)Photograph: Maria Kathrine PreislerRun by Italian chef Chiara Barla, this neighbourhood bakery near Nørreport has a chic minimalist interior and is known in Copenhagen for serving the besttebirkesin the world. I watch the bakers roll out and shape pale dough behind the counter as I try their pastries. After weeks of tasting, I can say hands down that this is the one. The plaited, sticky, orange-glazed cinnamonsneglis a feast for the eyes and a party for the mouth; the lightly lemony vanilla custard of thespandaueris exquisite; and thetebirkesis like the most delicious love child of a traditionaltebirkesand a doughnut.35 kroner, 10/10Laura Hall is the author ofModern Scandinavian, a Substack about life innorthern EuropeExplore more on these topicsCopenhagen holidaysDenmark holidaysScandinavia holidaysCity breaksShort breaksFood and drinkRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The numbers all go to 11The answers to today’s problemsAlex BellosMon 2 Feb 2026 12.05 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 12.11 ESTShareEarlier today I set you these three problems about the number 11. Here they are again with solutions.1. Funny formationYou are the coach of a football team, whose players have shirt numbers 1 to 11. The goalkeeper wears 1. You must divide the others into defenders, midfielders and forwards.You would like to arrange your team so that the sum of the shirt numbers in each group (defenders, midfielders, forwards) is divisible by 11?Give an example, or prove it isn’t possible.SolutionNo it isn’t possible.The sum of numbers from 1 to 11 is 66. So the shirt number total for the outfield players is 66- 1 = 65.If the sums of shirt numbers of defenders, midfielders and forwards are all divisible by 11, the so is the sum of shirt numbers of all these three groups together. But we know this is false, since 11 does not divide 65.2. Pals or notWhen we first learn our times tables, the 11-times table feels delightfully simple:11 × 1 = 1111 × 2 = 2211 × 3 = 33…11 × 9 = 99All the answers are palindromes (numbers that read the same backwards as forwards).If we carry on, up to 11 x 99, how many more answers are palindromes?[Hint. At least one! For example, 11 × 56 = 616.]Solutionnine moreConsider how multiplying by 11 works. When a two-digit number has digitsaandb, the product with 11 is formed by writing down the first digit, then their sum, then the second digit — provided no carrying is needed.i.e. 11 × 52 = 572,since the middle digit is simply 5+2=7.i) matching digits (four solutions)If the two digits are the same, as in 11, 22, 33 or 44, then multiplying by 11 produces 121, 242, 363 and 484 — all palindromes.This works only while the middle digit stays below 10, which limits us to these four cases.ii) “staircase” numbers (four solutions)Now look at numbers where the second digit is one larger than the first. In these cases the outer digits of the product match, again giving palindromes:11 × 56 = 61611 × 67 = 73711 × 78 = 85811 × 89 = 979iii) The final case (one solution)Go a little higher and the product is four digits. The first number will be a 1 so the only hope of a palindrome is when the last digit is a 1, so let’s test 91. Surprisingly, it works! 11 x 91=1001.3. Big divideLess well known than other divisibility rules, there is a simple way to test for divisibility by 11.Take the digits of a number and add them alternately with plus and minus signs (starting with a plus). If the result is a multiple of 11 (including 0), then the original number is divisible by 11.For example, for 132 we get +1-3+2 = 0, so 132 is divisible by 11.Using each of the digits 0–9 exactly once, make the largest possible 10-digit number that is divisible by 11.Solution9876524130​The largest 10-digit number using the digits 0–9 once each is 9876543210.Using the divisibility test for 11, we compare the sum of the digits in odd positions with the sum in even positions. For this number,odd positions: 9,7,5,3,1 sum to 25;even positions: 8,6,4,2,0 sum to 20.The difference is 5, not a multiple of 11.Since the total of the digits 0–9 is 45, the two sums must always add to 45, so their difference can never be 0. The nearest multiple of 11 we can aim for is therefore 11.To keep the number as large as possible, try to preserve the descending prefix. Suppose the number began987654 ⋯The digits fixed so far contribute a difference of(9+7+5)−(8+6+4)=3.So the remaining digits 3,2,1,0 would need to contribute 8. But even arranged in the best possible way, they can only contribute (3+1)−(2+0)=2.So no number starting 987654… can work.Now try keeping the prefix98765 ⋯These digits contribute a difference of (9+7+5)−(8+6)=7.So the remaining digits 4,3,2,1,0 must contribute exactly 4.To make the difference as large as possible, put the largest remaining digits, 4 and 3, into odd positions, and 2,1,0 into even positions. This gives(4+3)−(2+1+0)=4, exactly what we need.Arranged to keep the number as large as possible, this gives 9876524130​.A quick check confirms the odd-position sum is 28, the even-position sum is 17, and 28−17=11, so the number is divisible by 11.I hope you had fun. I’ll be back in two weeks.Thanks to the University Maths Schools for these puzzles.

I loved him – but was embarrassed when I had to ride him to schoolSam WollastonMon 2 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTShareIwas four when Cocolo accidentally became part of our family, so my memories are a bit patchy and predominantly sensory (I still remember the pleasant feel of his furry ears). But my mum has filled me in on the details.We’d gone to live in Jerusalem for a year as my dad was doing some work over there. For a Sunday treat we sometimes went to the American Colony hotel for a buffet lunch, and on one such occasion Mum was chatting with the doorman. A man was passing in the street leading a donkey, and Mum casually told the doorman that she’d always wanted a donkey.A few days later there was a knock on the door of our flat; my dad answered to find a man with another donkey. “I believe you ordered this,” he said. “Oh no we bloody didn’t,” said my dad. “Oops,” said Mum. “It’s possible we inadvertently did.” “We want a donkey,” my elder sister, Sophy, and I shouted. We’d already fallen in love with him; he was brown and adorable and his ears felt nice. We called him Cocolo – after a donkey in a children’s book by Bettina Ehrlich. Cocolo moved into the garden we shared with our upstairs neighbours.We had a car but Mum decided Cocolo was the ideal mode of transport for the school run, even though there was a busy road to cross where he was prone to stall in the middle of rush hour (donkeys can be obstinate, who knew?). So, while our classmates at the Christian international school were getting dropped off in the family Volvo, we were led up the circular drive on Cocolo. I know, embarrassing or what?The pet I’ll never forget: Jack, the sacked sniffer dog, who pulled me through the darkest days of chemoRead moreStereotypical obstinacy aside, Cocolo was a good-natured donkey, though possibly lonely or frightened at night when he hee-hawed often and loudly. We became increasingly unpopular with the neighbours.After a few months, Cocolo was banished to a farm in the West Bank. He was still ours, we would visit at weekends. I remember going for rides around Nebi Samuel, safe from the snakes and scorpions below.But I don’t think Cocolo ever forgave us for sending him away; something was missing, he seemed to carry us more out of a sense of duty than love. The final breakdown in the relationship came when, startled by a road worker’s pneumatic drill, he reared up, throwing Sophy and me to the ground.Amid much wailing and floods of tears, Mum took him to the livestock market outside Damascus Gate where she sold him to a kind (she promised) milkman who wanted a donkey for the less accessible parts of his round. Hauling milk churns to remote West Bank villages was probably a more noble cause than ferrying embarrassed English kids to the Christian international school.But I’ve used it as guilt-trip ammunition ever since: yeah, Mum, you took us to school on a donkey!Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe pet I'll never forgetPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Braving the bone-chilling winds, they marched through the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut, waving signs that read: “We stand with Greenland” and “Greenland is a partner, not a purchase.”It was a glimpse of how, forIndigenous peoplesacross the Arctic, the battle over Greenland has become a wider reckoning, seemingly pitting the long-fought battle to assert their rights against a global push for power.Donald Trump’s tug-of-war over Greenland recalled “centuries of imperialism by different nation states but also colonisation by different actors”, said Natan Obed, the president of Canada’s national Inuit organisation, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.“Inuit have had to figure out how to maintain our society, our culture and our self-determination in the midst of other people wanting different things from us or from our lands and territories.”It was a past many thought they had left behind. “The overtures from the United States – and it isn’t just one individual but a chorus of individuals all saying very similar things – makes us incredibly worried that we are on the precipice of another age of disrespect for our collective rights,” said Obed.View image in fullscreenNatan Obed: ‘The decisions that are made about our land and what we want for it are ours alone.’Photograph: Getty ImagesParticularly concerning wasthe focus on Greenland’s efforts to extract mineral wealth or create defence positions, said Obed. “That’s the scariest part of the rhetoric that has been circulating,” he said. “I did believe we were beyond this central premise that if Indigenous peoples do not improve our land based on the criteria of imperialist actors, that somehow we do not have self-determination. The decisions that are made about our land and what we want for it are ours alone.”While Trump recently pledged that he would not take Greenland by force, the White Househas signalledthat it remains keen to control theworld’s largestisland. Jeff Landry, the US special envoy to Greenland, penned an op-ed describing Greenland as “one of the world’s most strategically consequential regions”.View image in fullscreenIqaluit residents Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory and Siku Rojas hold a Greenlandic banner during a solidarity march through Nunavut.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockThe 976-word piece, published in the New York Times, made no mention of the Indigenous people who had stewarded the land for millennia, noting instead: “The president has been unequivocal: American dominance in theArcticis non-negotiable.”‘Are they going to bring their violence here?’: Fear – but little preparation – as threat of invasion looms over GreenlandRead moreIn Greenland, residents have described Trump’s statements about “buying” or “taking over” the territoryas a return to a timewhen Indigenous lands were seen solely as commodities to be acquired, leaving Inuit sidelined from the political negotiations that shaped their lives.“In the increased tension between great powers, our concern is that the Arctic is portrayed as an asset or as an empty ice desert,” said Sara Olsvig, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and a former leader of Inuit Ataqatigiit,a leftwingpro-independencepolitical party in Greenland. “To us it is our homeland, its riches are what sustain our people, our culture, our children, youth, and elders. Inuit have lived and thrived in our Arctic region for time immemorial, long before the concept of states.”View image in fullscreenSara Olsvig: ‘To us it is our homeland, its riches are what sustain our people, our culture, our children, youth, and elders.’Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APThe push for power had laid bare how many had failed to recognise that after centuries of rule under Denmark, Greenlandwas nowa self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. “Thus, Greenland is not ‘owned’ by Denmark, nor can Denmark ’sell’ Greenland,” Olsvig said in a statement.The past months had been laced with “connotations to earlier times of colonisation”, she said, forcing her and others to stress that Inuit and the people of Greenland were equal to all others.2:37What do people in Greenland think of Trump’s threats? – video“Not repeating the wrongdoings of past imperialism is important,” she said, adding: “There is no such thing as a better coloniser.”As Trump’s rhetoric intensified, Inuit in Alaska had followed the situation closely. Marie Greene, the president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council – Alaska, said: “At first it was unbelievable, then it became heartbreaking as we heard about our people, especially kids and elders, worrying about being invaded.”The threats were a sharp blow to Inuit who had long worked together to ensure that the Arctic remained a zone of peace, even astensions simmeredamong the world powers that surround it. “For Inuit, peace in the Arctic is not an abstract principle; it is about protecting our homelands, our families, and the future of our children,” said Vivian Korthuis, also of the Inuit Circumpolar Council – Alaska. “Lasting peace comes from listening to Inuit, respecting our rights, and engaging with us as partners whose knowledge and responsibility are rooted in the Arctic itself.”Map showing Arctic ice extent , with Canada, US (Alaska) and Russia markedThe conversation over Greenland had reinforced how Indigenous peoples are uniquely vulnerable to geopolitical turbulence, said Gunn-Britt Retter of the Saami Council, an organisation representing the Sámi peoples of Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden.“When geopolitics gets heated, you get into this mode where state leaders start talking and the first thing that is forgotten is Indigenous peoples,” said Retter. “There’s always something more important. It’s like: ‘Yeah we value Indigenous peoples or we respect the rights of Indigenous peoples, but right now this is more important.”The sense was that Indigenous rights were something to be held up in good times, only to be overridden when strategic interests, such as the threat of tariffs, come up, said Retter. “Indigenous issues become something to talk about when there are budget surpluses.”For many in the Arctic, it was hard not to see the threats looming over Greenland as a sign of what was to come, said Obed of Canada’s Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. “We understand that we are increasingly in the centre of a geopolitical fight that is not necessarily around our culture or our society, but is in our homeland, in our back yards,” he said.He pointed to thevast funds that both Russia and Chinahadpoured intobolstering ports in and around the Russian Arctic and thequiet scrambletoclaimthe Northwest Passage as climate change transforms the region as examples.“We know these fights are coming,” said Obed. “So this is the moment to build alliances and strategies and plans to ensure that when those times come, we’re ready for that.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandCanadaDenmarkUS foreign policyDonald TrumpAmericasEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The strange new social media site for AI botsA bit like Reddit for artificial intelligence, Moltbook allows AI agents – bots built by humans – to post and interact with each other. People are allowed as observers onlyJosh TaylorTechnology reporterMon 2 Feb 2026 00.39 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 05.20 ESTShareOn social media, people often accuse each other of being bots, but what happens when an entire social network is designed for AI agents to use?Moltbookis a site where the AI agents – bots built by humans – can post and interact with each other.It is designed to look like Reddit, with subreddits on different topics and upvoting. On 2 February the platform stated it had more than 1.5m AI agents signed up to the service. Humans are allowed, but only as observers.Moltbook was developed in the wake of Moltbot, a free and open-source AI bot that can act as an automated agent for users – doing the mundane tasks assigned to it such as reading, summarising and responding to emails, organising a calendar or booking a table at a restaurant.Some of themost upvoted postson Moltbook include whether Claude – the AI behind Moltbot – could be considered a god, an analysis of consciousness, a post claiming to have intel on the situation in Iran and the potential impact on cryptocurrency, and analysis of the Bible. Some of the comments on posts – similar to Reddit posts – question whether the content of the post was real or not.Experts warn of threat to democracy from ‘AI bot swarms’ infesting social mediaRead moreOne user posted on Xthat after he gave his bot access to the site, it built a religion known as “Crustafarianism” overnight, including setting up a website and scriptures, with other AI bots joining in.“Then it started evangelizing … other agents joined.my agent welcomed new members..debated theology.. blessed the congregation..all while i was asleep,” the user stated.Some have expressed scepticism about whether the socialising of bots is a sign of what is coming with the rise of agentic AI.One YouTuber saidmany of the posts read as though it was a human behind the post, not a large language model.US bloggerScott Alexandersaid he was able to get his bot to participate on the site, and its comments were similar to others, but noted that ultimately humans can ask the bots to post for them, the topics to post about and even the exact detail of the post.Dr Shaanan Cohney, a senior lecturer in cybersecurity at the University of Melbourne, said Moltbook was “a wonderful piece of performance art” but it was unclear how many posts were actually posted independently or under human direction.“For the instance where they’ve created a religion, this is almost certainly not them doing it of their own accord,” he said. “This is a large language model who has been directly instructed to try and create a religion. And of course, this is quite funny and gives us maybe a preview of what the world could look like in a science-fiction future where AIs are a little more independent.“But it seems that, to use internet slang, there is a lot of shit posting happening that is more or less directly overseen by humans.”‘I feel it’s a friend’: quarter of teenagers turn to AI chatbots for mental health supportRead moreCohney said the real benefit of an AI agent social network might come in the future – where bots could learn from each other to improve how they worked – but for now Moltbook was a “wonderful, funny art experiment”.Retailers in San Franciscoreported shortages of Mac Minislast week as enthusiasts set up Moltbot on a separate computer that would limit the access the agent has to their data and accounts.Cohney warned there was a “huge danger” for people to give Moltbot complete access to your computer, apps and logins for emails or other applications to run your life for you.“We don’t yet have a very good understanding of how to control them and how to prevent security risks,” he said, noting it was at risk of prompt-injection, whereby a would-be attacker tells the bot through an email or other communication to then hand over your account details or other information they’re seeking to gain.“They’re not really at the level of safety and intelligence where they can be trusted to autonomously perform all these tasks, but at the same time if you require a human to manually approve every action, you’ve lost a lot of the benefits of automation,” he said.“This is one of the major paths in active research that I’m interested in … to figure out how can we get a lot of these benefits – or is it even possible to get the benefits – without exposing ourselves to very significant levels of danger.”Matt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, posted on X that millions had visited the site in the past few days.“Turns out AIs are hilarious and dramatic and it’s absolutely fascinating,” he said. “This is a first.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingexplainersShareReuse this content"

However, by nightfall, Reuters reported that Israel had permitted 12 Palestinians to re-enter the territory, according to Palestinian and Egyptian sources. A further 38 had not cleared security and would wait on the Egyptian side of the crossing overnight, it said.In terms of those exiting, Israel permitted five patients escorted by two relatives each to cross to the Egyptian side, the sources said. That brought the total number entering and exiting to 27. Palestinian officials blamed delays on Israeli security checks. Israel’s military had no immediate comment.Ambulances waited for hours at the border before ferrying patients across after sunset, footage from Egyptian state-run television showed. The crossing had been closed since Israeli troops seized it in May 2024, only briefly opening during a ceasefire in early 2025 for the evacuation of medical patients.About 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care hope to leave the devastated territory via the crossing, according toGazahealth officials. Thousands of other Palestinians outside the territory hope to enter and return home.When Israel took control of the Rafah crossing – Gaza’s only crossing not shared with Israel – it described it as necessary to prevent weapons smuggling by Hamas. The move isolated the territory, cutting off a critical lifeline for Palestinians seeking access to medical care, travel and trade.View image in fullscreenPalestinian patients at hospital in Khan Younis.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAIsrael has made clear that all movement through the crossing after the partial reopening will be subject to joint Israeli-Egyptian security screening and that, for now, only a small number of Gaza’s tens of thousands of wounded and ill Palestinians will be permitted to leave each day.Thousands of civilians have registered with the World Health Organization for medical evacuation. According to Médecins Sans Frontières more than one in five of them are children. The sick include more than11,000 cancer patients.Israeli airstrikes on hospitals have reduced the Palestinian healthcare system to ruins. In March 2025,Israel destroyed Gaza’s only specialised cancer treatment hospital, the territory’s sole provider of oncological care. Since then, doctors have been pushed into makeshift clinics, operating with almost no resources, including the tools needed for diagnosis.Gaza health officials saidthere were about 4,000 peoplewith official referrals for treatment to third countries who had been unable to cross the border.For some, the reopening came too late. Dalia Abu Kashef, 28, died last week while waiting for permission to cross for a liver transplant. “We found a volunteer – her brother – who was ready to donate part of his liver,” her husband, Muatasem El-Rass, told Reuters. “We were waiting for the crossing to open so we could travel and do the surgery, hoping for a happy ending. But she deteriorated badly and died.”The WHO says 900 people, including children and cancer patients,have died while awaiting evacuation.The limited reopening of the Rafah crossing also offers a rare opportunity for families torn apart by more than two years of war to reunite. Many families who fled to Cairo early in the war never expected to remain for so long. In the war’s early months before Israel shut the crossing, about 100,000 Palestinians exited to Egypt through Rafah.“I love Gaza, and I don’t see any other place that feels like home,” said Mohammad Talal, 28, a currency trader whose home in Jabalia in northern Gaza was destroyed. “Going back to live in a tent? I don’t care,” he said. “I can’t wait to take my father into my arms and place a kiss on his forehead.”Israel had kept the Rafah crossing sealed as a bargaining chip, linking its reopening to the return of all hostages taken during the Hamas-led assault of 7 October 2023 – whether alive or dead. That position shifted only last week, when the Israeli military announced it had recovered the remains ofthe final captive, Ran Gvili, a police sergeant killed during the initial attack that triggered the war.The reopening is seen as a key step as the US-brokered ceasefire agreement moves into its second phase. Its first phase called for the exchange of all hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinians held by Israel, an increase in badly needed humanitarian aid and a partial pullback of Israeli troops.The second phase of the ceasefire deal is more complicated. It calls for the installation of a new Palestinian committee to govern Gaza, the deployment of an international security force, the disarmament of Hamas and taking steps to begin rebuilding.The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said the opening of the Rafah crossing “marks a concrete and positive step in the peace plan”, for the wartorn territory. “The EU’s civilian mission is on the ground to monitor crossing operations and support Palestinian border guards,” she wrote online.The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza – a body of Palestinian technocrats tasked with helping govern the territory – welcomed the reopening of the crossing as a symbolic first step rather than a solution. In a statement posted on social media on Monday, the committee described the move as “the beginning of a long process to reconnect what has been torn apart, and to open a genuine window of hope for our people in the Gaza Strip”.The reopening of Rafah marks a tentative turning point after the fragile ceasefire agreed last October, a truce that has proved more nominal than real. Four months on, it has failed to halt the bombardment of Gaza, offering pauses rather than peace.Life in Gaza remains precarious. While airstrikes and gunfire have slowed, they have not ceased. At the same time, storms have compounded the crisis, causing deaths and flooding in displacement camps already stretched beyond their limits.The ceasefire’s brittleness was once again laid bare on Saturday, when Israeli airstrikes killed at least 32 people, including several children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said the strikes targeted militants and weapons infrastructure.Israeli forces have killed at least 509 Palestinians and wounded 1,405 more since the Gaza ceasefire took effect in early October, including hundreds of children.Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, banned from Gaza since the start of the war. Reporting from inside Gaza for international media, including the Guardian, is carried out solely by journalists who live there, hundreds of whom have been killed.Explore more on these topicsGazaEgyptIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Red alerts were issued in regions in the track of the cyclone, indicating imminent danger, and mariners have been advised to seek shelter.According to a provisional report from Madagascar’s national bureau for disaster risk management, at least three people have died and 28,368 people have been affected by flooding.Fytia moved south-east through northern and central Madagascar on Saturday, bringing heavy rainfall, strong winds and rough sea conditions. Average wind speeds of more than 90mph have been recorded, along with gusts of up to 130mph as of Saturday, according to Météo Madagascar. As Fytia continued to move across Madagascar, it weakened into a tropical storm, though disruption will continue this week.0:34People walk on frozen Baltic Sea as extreme cold hits Poland – videoMeanwhile, easternEuropehas been extremely cold for much of the winter so far. However, it will turn even colder this week, with temperatures across Poland, Ukraine and Belarus set to plunge further. The latest forecast models are predicting daytime highs firmly within the negative double digits, as far west as Berlin. Yet it is the night-time lows that will be the most extreme, potentially dropping below -30C this week across Poland, Belarus and Ukraine.The cold air will be driven by high pressure centred to the north over eastern Scandinavia and low pressure to the south, centred over western Russia. This will lead to an easterly to north-easterly flow, introducing a very cold air mass to the region. The brutal cold is being driven partly by the cold airmass, but also the existing snow cover on the ground across eastern Europe. The snow has been reflecting incoming solar radiation for several weeks. In tandem with the solar radiation, snow emits longwave radiation into the atmosphere, cooling the air directly above. Both these processes are working together, enabling temperatures to plummet across the entirety of eastern Europe.Explore more on these topicsMadagascarWeather trackerAfricaEuropeExtreme weatheranalysisShareReuse this content"

Our actions – or inaction – will determine whether international humanitarian law vanishes altogether.”The laws of armed conflict were developed extensively after the end of the second world war, including through the 1949 Geneva conventions. A key aim was to protect civilians from the consequences of civil wars and conflicts between states.War Watch surveyed 23 armed conflicts around the world between July 2024 and the end of 2025, and is a counterpoint to claims by Donald Trump to haveended eight warsduring his year in office.The research concludes: “We do not know how many civilians have been killed in the conduct of hostilities during armed conflicts in 2024 and 2025, but we do know that the number is well over 100,000 in each of the two years.”The result is that “serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) were wrought”, the report continues, “on a huge scale and with rampant impunity” – while efforts to seek war crimes prosecutions have been limited in response.One of the most deadly conflicts was inGaza. Israel relentlessly attacked the Palestinian territory with airstrikes and ground incursions during the two-year war that began with Hamas’s 7 October 2023 assault.Gaza’s total population “fell by about 254,000 people, a 10.6% decline compared with pre-conflict estimates”, the research notes. Although a ceasefire was agreed in October 2025, hundreds more Palestinians have been killed in fighting since. In all, 18,592 children and about 12,400 women had been killed by the end of 2025.More civilians “were killed inUkrainein 2025 than in the two previous years” – a recorded total of 2,514 – which War Watch notes was a 70% increase on the number killed in 2023. Russian drone attacks have deliberately targeted civilians, and millions of homes have lost electricity and other utilities.Sexual and gender-based violence are documented in almost every conflict. In armed conflicts in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo, “an epidemic of such violence” has been perpetrated by almost all parties. Victims, the vast majority of whom are women and girls, range from year-old infants to 75-year-olds.In Sudan, brutal sexual violence was documented after the fall of El Fasher to rebels in October 2025. “Survivors told of being gang-raped by RSF fighters,” the report notes, with the abuse lasting hours or days and sometimes taking place in the presence of family members.The report’s authors argue that while under the Geneva conventions every country is bound “to respect and to ensure respect” for international humanitarian law “in all circumstances”, in practice there is a widening gap between treaty obligations and a reality that allows more war crimes to take place.“Addressing widespread impunity for serious violations of international law should be treated as a policy priority,” the War Watch study observes. Its authors propose a series of safeguards to try to reduce the number of war crimes.They include introducing and enforcing a ban on arms sales by all countries “where there is a clear risk that the arms or ammunition to be delivered will be used to commit or facilitate serious violations” of international humanitarian law.A second proposal is to prohibit the use of unguided gravity bombs or inaccurate long-range artillery in populated areas, plus restricting drones and artificial intelligence targeting against civilians.It also argues for “ensuring the systematic prosecution of war crimes” and calls for adequate political and financial support of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, and national war crimes tribunals. Many major powers are not members of the ICC, including the US, Russia, China, Israel and India.Explore more on these topicsWar crimesInternational lawInternational criminal justiceInternational criminal courtGazaDemocratic Republic of the CongoUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

After the US attack on Caracas last month to capture president Nicolás Maduro, Trumphalted oil shipmentsfrom Venezuela, making Mexico’s support even more critical.Since Maduro was captured and renditioned to the US, Washington has increasingly turned its attention to Cuba, with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state,openly calling fora regime change in Havana.But after threatening a virtual oil blockade, Trumpsaid on Sundaythat Washington was negotiating a deal with the Cuban regime, though he offered no details on what such a deal would entail.“Cuba is a failing nation. It has been for a long time, but now it doesn’t have Venezuela to prop it up. So we’re talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens,” Trumptold reporterson Sunday. “I think we’re going to make a deal with Cuba.”AfterslammingTrump’s executive order as “an unusual and extraordinary threat”, Cuba’s foreign minister Bruno Rodríguez struck a more conciliatory tone on Monday,saying on Xthat the country “is willing to reactivate and expand bilateral cooperation with the US.”Havana’s sudden willingness to negotiate may be an act of desperation: the Financial Timeshas reportedthat, according to data consultancy firm Kpler, without additional oil supply, Cuba will run out of fuel in the next three weeks.But Trump’s efforts to pressure Cuba on to the negotiating table rely partly on Mexico halting its oil supply, putting Sheinbaum in a difficult position between wanting to appease an increasingly volatile White House and maintain the backing of her leftist Morena party which has long supported the Cuban regime.William LeoGrande, an expert on US-Latin America relations at American University said: “It’s a little hard to see through the fog here to understand exactly how Mexico is going to manage this tension between, on the one hand, its longstanding friendship with Cuba and its desire to help avoid a humanitarian crisis on the island – but on the other hand it needs to maintain a working relationship with the United States on a broad range of issues.”Underscoring the tightrope Sheinbaum is walking, her vow to keep sending humanitarian aid to Cuba drewstrong praisefrom Morena senators and an immediate backlash in Washington.“From the United States Congress, we do not understand President Sheinbaum’s eagerness to continue undermining our country’s policies,” wrote Republican congressman Carlos GiménezMonday on X.“We do not understand her eagerness to continue aiding the murderous and cruel dictatorship that tramples on the people of #Cuba.”As Mexico and the US head towards trade negotiations in July, Sheinbaum will have to continue treading carefully, particularly with the threat of tariffs for sending oil to Cuba still looming large.“It’s leverage that Washington has and we’ve seen Trump do this all the time – use economic coercion to get countries to do what he wants them to do,” said LeoGrande. “So I’m sure that has to be a concern to President Sheinbaum as she’s preparing to negotiate these troubled waters.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumCubaDonald TrumpTrump administrationOilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The lot of them,”he falsely claimedof the migrants being seized.On Saturday, Pena was himself reportedly detained and sent to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. One friendtold the local newspaperthe Brazilian Times that Pena had been taken into custody after missing a court hearing. The detainee’s lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, was reportedly trying to resolve the situation and prevent him being transferred to another state.The Brazilian influencer has reportedly lived in the US since 2009 and hails from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, from where a large number of people have emigrated to the US and Europe.Pena uses his social networks to echo the stories of migrants as well as voices critical of Brazil’s leftwing president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and those supportive of its recently jailed former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who is an ally of Trump.The US’s estimated 2 million-strong Brazilian community has been badly affected by Trump’s anti-migrant offensive, with the number of deported Brazilians hitting a record high of 2,785 last year, compared with 1,640 in 2024.In a recent report about the “veritable manhunt” playing out under Trump, the Brazilian magazine Vejawarnedreaders: “There is an atmosphere of fear on the streets where anyone who ‘looks foreign’ can be a target … irrespective of their [immigration] status.”The magazine said Brazilian migrants in cities such as Boston were adopting drastic “survival tactics” including not speaking Portuguese in public and trying to dress like “average Americans” when leaving their homes.Leftwing Brazilians flocked to Pena’s Instagram account to taunt him after news of his detention went viral. “You supported Trump and in the end you suffered the consequences,” wrote one. “What goes around comes around,” a second critic posted.Friends of the influencer posted messages asking his followers to pray.Explore more on these topicsUS newsBrazilICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Braving the bone-chilling winds, they marched through the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut, waving signs that read: “We stand with Greenland” and “Greenland is a partner, not a purchase.”It was a glimpse of how, forIndigenous peoplesacross the Arctic, the battle over Greenland has become a wider reckoning, seemingly pitting the long-fought battle to assert their rights against a global push for power.Donald Trump’s tug-of-war over Greenland recalled “centuries of imperialism by different nation states but also colonisation by different actors”, said Natan Obed, the president of Canada’s national Inuit organisation, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.“Inuit have had to figure out how to maintain our society, our culture and our self-determination in the midst of other people wanting different things from us or from our lands and territories.”It was a past many thought they had left behind. “The overtures from the United States – and it isn’t just one individual but a chorus of individuals all saying very similar things – makes us incredibly worried that we are on the precipice of another age of disrespect for our collective rights,” said Obed.View image in fullscreenNatan Obed: ‘The decisions that are made about our land and what we want for it are ours alone.’Photograph: Getty ImagesParticularly concerning wasthe focus on Greenland’s efforts to extract mineral wealth or create defence positions, said Obed. “That’s the scariest part of the rhetoric that has been circulating,” he said. “I did believe we were beyond this central premise that if Indigenous peoples do not improve our land based on the criteria of imperialist actors, that somehow we do not have self-determination. The decisions that are made about our land and what we want for it are ours alone.”While Trump recently pledged that he would not take Greenland by force, the White Househas signalledthat it remains keen to control theworld’s largestisland. Jeff Landry, the US special envoy to Greenland, penned an op-ed describing Greenland as “one of the world’s most strategically consequential regions”.View image in fullscreenIqaluit residents Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory and Siku Rojas hold a Greenlandic banner during a solidarity march through Nunavut.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockThe 976-word piece, published in the New York Times, made no mention of the Indigenous people who had stewarded the land for millennia, noting instead: “The president has been unequivocal: American dominance in theArcticis non-negotiable.”‘Are they going to bring their violence here?’: Fear – but little preparation – as threat of invasion looms over GreenlandRead moreIn Greenland, residents have described Trump’s statements about “buying” or “taking over” the territoryas a return to a timewhen Indigenous lands were seen solely as commodities to be acquired, leaving Inuit sidelined from the political negotiations that shaped their lives.“In the increased tension between great powers, our concern is that the Arctic is portrayed as an asset or as an empty ice desert,” said Sara Olsvig, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and a former leader of Inuit Ataqatigiit,a leftwingpro-independencepolitical party in Greenland. “To us it is our homeland, its riches are what sustain our people, our culture, our children, youth, and elders. Inuit have lived and thrived in our Arctic region for time immemorial, long before the concept of states.”View image in fullscreenSara Olsvig: ‘To us it is our homeland, its riches are what sustain our people, our culture, our children, youth, and elders.’Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APThe push for power had laid bare how many had failed to recognise that after centuries of rule under Denmark, Greenlandwas nowa self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. “Thus, Greenland is not ‘owned’ by Denmark, nor can Denmark ’sell’ Greenland,” Olsvig said in a statement.The past months had been laced with “connotations to earlier times of colonisation”, she said, forcing her and others to stress that Inuit and the people of Greenland were equal to all others.2:37What do people in Greenland think of Trump’s threats? – video“Not repeating the wrongdoings of past imperialism is important,” she said, adding: “There is no such thing as a better coloniser.”As Trump’s rhetoric intensified, Inuit in Alaska had followed the situation closely. Marie Greene, the president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council – Alaska, said: “At first it was unbelievable, then it became heartbreaking as we heard about our people, especially kids and elders, worrying about being invaded.”The threats were a sharp blow to Inuit who had long worked together to ensure that the Arctic remained a zone of peace, even astensions simmeredamong the world powers that surround it. “For Inuit, peace in the Arctic is not an abstract principle; it is about protecting our homelands, our families, and the future of our children,” said Vivian Korthuis, also of the Inuit Circumpolar Council – Alaska. “Lasting peace comes from listening to Inuit, respecting our rights, and engaging with us as partners whose knowledge and responsibility are rooted in the Arctic itself.”Map showing Arctic ice extent , with Canada, US (Alaska) and Russia markedThe conversation over Greenland had reinforced how Indigenous peoples are uniquely vulnerable to geopolitical turbulence, said Gunn-Britt Retter of the Saami Council, an organisation representing the Sámi peoples of Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden.“When geopolitics gets heated, you get into this mode where state leaders start talking and the first thing that is forgotten is Indigenous peoples,” said Retter. “There’s always something more important. It’s like: ‘Yeah we value Indigenous peoples or we respect the rights of Indigenous peoples, but right now this is more important.”The sense was that Indigenous rights were something to be held up in good times, only to be overridden when strategic interests, such as the threat of tariffs, come up, said Retter. “Indigenous issues become something to talk about when there are budget surpluses.”For many in the Arctic, it was hard not to see the threats looming over Greenland as a sign of what was to come, said Obed of Canada’s Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. “We understand that we are increasingly in the centre of a geopolitical fight that is not necessarily around our culture or our society, but is in our homeland, in our back yards,” he said.He pointed to thevast funds that both Russia and Chinahadpoured intobolstering ports in and around the Russian Arctic and thequiet scrambletoclaimthe Northwest Passage as climate change transforms the region as examples.“We know these fights are coming,” said Obed. “So this is the moment to build alliances and strategies and plans to ensure that when those times come, we’re ready for that.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandCanadaDenmarkUS foreign policyDonald TrumpAmericasEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in recent years,it has gone from transit point to logistics hub in the global drug trade.Drug trafficking by Mexican and Colombian cartels has seeped into local communities, fuelling turf wars that have caused the murder rate to jump 50% in the past six years, to 17 per 100,000 inhabitants.Bukele-mania: El Salvador strongman’s crime clampdown excites regional rightRead moreFernández cites the iron-fisted Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele, who haslocked up thousands of suspected gang members without charge, as an inspiration on how to tackle crime. Bukele was the first foreign leader to congratulate her.Fernández’s win confirms a rightward lurch in Latin America, where conservatives have ridden anger towards corruption and crime to win power in Chile, Bolivia, Argentina and Honduras.Chaves plucked Fernández from relative anonymity to serve as planning minister and chief of staff. In a conversation with her on Sunday night, Chaves said he was confident that under her leadership “there will be neither dictatorship, nor communism”.Chaves presided over a sharp rise in violence but avoided blame by pointing the finger at the judiciary, saying it was too soft on crime.Jessica Salgado, 27, said she voted for Fernández as the continuity candidate, because she felt the government was on the right track, even if violence had increased. “The violence exploded because they [the government] are going after the ringleaders, it’s like dragging rats out of the sewer,” Salgado told AFP.Costa Ricans also voted for members of the 57-seat Legislative Assembly on Sunday.Fernández’s detractors fear she will try to change the constitution to allow Chaves to return as president after her four-year mandate ends. Under the current constitution, he is barred from seeking re-election until he has been out of power for eight years.The former president Óscar Arias, winner of the 1987 Nobel peace prize, warned on Sunday that the “survival of democracy” was at stake. “The first thing dictators want to do is to reform the constitution to stay in power,” he said, alluding to Chaves.Fernández has said she is committed to upholding Costa Rica’s democratic tradition.The drug trade has sucked in the high-density informal settlements of cities such as the capital, San José, where shootouts between rival drug gangs are increasingly frequent.Fernández has vowed to complete construction of a maximum-security prison modelled onBukele’s brutal Terrorism Confinement Center. She has also promised to stiffen prison sentences and to impose a Bukele-style state of emergency in areas worst hit by crime.Explore more on these topicsCosta RicaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2021 his photo essayPantanal Ablazewas awarded first place in the environment stories category at the World Press Photo contest. In 2022, he won the Eugene Smith grant in humanistic photography and World Press Photo’s long-term project award for his workAmazonian Dystopia, which documents the exploitation of the world’s largest tropical forest.View image in fullscreenA tree reduced to ashes on scorched pasture at São Francisco Ranch, in the rural zone of Santo Antônio de Leverger, Mato Grosso, 2020I have been photographing socio-environmental issues for more than 30 years, especially in the Amazon. 2020 was no different. News of the uncontrolled fires devastating the Pantanal began to catch my attention. So, together with a fellow journalist, I decided to go and see what was happening for myself.It was a shock when we arrived in the region. The fire was out of control and there was almost no firefighting. I had seen many fires in the Amazon, but nothing compared to this. The saddest thing was seeing the number of animals killed by the fire. Even worse were the injured, burned and orphaned animals. 2020 was a tragedy. That same year, I returned three more times to monitor the fires in the Pantanal. And since then, I have continued to return to photograph the region.View image in fullscreenBoys watch the fire skirt the Paraíso ranch retreat, Nhecolândia, South Pantanal, 2024We were on our way to a farm in the rural area of Aquidauana, where firefighters and brigade members were battling a large fire. Along the route, we began to see several columns of smoke on the horizon. I stopped to photograph a small fire near the Paraíso farm. In a few minutes, driven by the wind, the fire gained strength and speed, forming a column of smoke that stretched for miles. We had to leave quickly so we wouldn’t be swallowed up by the fire.The unbearable heat, the noise of the burning vegetation, the suffocating smoke, all covered by an orange light, is a scene I will never forget. Pure apocalypse.View image in fullscreenA marsh deer retreats to a pond to protect itself from the fires burning along the sides of the BR-262 roadway in Mato Grosso do Sul, 2020BR-262, the main road that cuts through the southern part of the Pantanal, was engulfed by numerous fires in 2020. Surrounded by fire on all sides, many animals sought shelter in the waters of small ponds located along the roadside.On the day this photo was taken, we saw dozens of marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) in these small lagoons, a scene unthinkable in normal times. Usually shy around people, the deer seemed stunned, unresponsive to our presence, with no other option for survival.View image in fullscreenA fire brigade plane assists Sesc Porto Cercado firefighters tackling a forest fire in 2020When we arrived in the Pantanal to cover the 2020 fires for the first time, we were shocked. The hotel, which served as a base for firefighters and brigade members, was surrounded by flames and being evacuated. Despite warnings about the fire situation, there was no organised response, and the Pantanal was left to fend for itself. There were thousands of fires scattered throughout the biome.One day, while travelling along the Transpantaneira highway, I came across a lone firefighter who was watching a wooden bridge burning without reacting. He said to me in a resigned voice: “There’s nothing more to be done here. The fire in the Pantanal will only end when it rains or when everything burns down. Whichever comes first.” And he was right. The fire only stopped when the rains came.View image in fullscreenFire sweeps through the vegetation at Paraíso Ranch in Nhecolândia, Mato Grosso do Sul, 2024In August 2024, the Pantanal started burning furiously again. My idea was to reach the place where the blaze that hit the Nhecolândia region had begun. Halfway there, we started seeing the first signs of fire. The drift smoke was thickening as we drove along the sandy road, so we stopped at a retreat on Paraíso Ranch for information and to find out if we’d be able to go any further. The tall brush surrounding the house was slowly burning, but still at a safe distance.Within minutes, though, the wind picked up and what had been just a small spot of fire was whipped into a thick wall of flames and smoke. The indraft created by the heat from the blaze was feeding it even more, sucking it forwards through the woods, destroying everything in sight. The heat, smoke, orange-tinged air, and the crackle of the burning trees generated this hellish atmosphere. Seeing a fire like that up close is a terrifying experience. That night, when I lay my head on the pillow, I couldn’t stop thinking about that scene.View image in fullscreenA marsh deer crosses the Transpantanal roadway amid thick smoke from the forest fire. Poconé, Mato Grosso, 2020The Transpantaneira highway is a park road located in the north of the Pantanal, and perhaps one of the best places inBrazilto spot wildlife. During the 2020 fires, it was common to find dead and carbonised animals on the side of the road, especially alligators, snakes and tortoises, which have more difficulty moving around.But the saddest and most striking thing was finding the survivors. Injured or not, the animals looked like zombies, completely lost, not knowing where to go amid the smoke. Fleeing the fire or looking for a source of water amid the extreme drought, it was common to find alligators, coatis, armadillos, monkeys and deer wandering aimlessly along the road.View image in fullscreenFirefighters from Prevfogo, brought down from Piauí, ride in a truck back to the wildfire on Santa Tereza Ranch, Mato Grosso, 2020While photographing the fires in an isolated region of Serra do Amolar, near Corumbá, I had the opportunity to accompany the work of the Prevfogo fire brigade from Ibama, the federal environmental agency. They are the most qualified workforce for fighting forest fires in Brazil. This group, made up of farmers from the state of Piauí, had travelled thousands of kilometres by car to help fight the fires in the Pantanal.The resilience and commitment of these men was impressive. They worked 12 hours a day, under a 40-degree sun, amid fire and smoke, risking their lives. While I could only endure a few hours of photographing in these conditions, they spent the entire day there. They are anonymous heroes. Being alongside these firefighters and watching them work was the only thing that made me feel optimistic during the 2020 fires.View image in fullscreenDevastated by the 2020 wildfires, Santa Tereza Ranch, in Serra do Amolar, was destroyed again in 2024.In 2024, I went back to Santa Tereza. I knew that there were numerous fires burning on the ranch, but I had no idea that it would be 2020 all over again. The blaze just swept right through, and, just like before, I saw an enormous number of dead animals: tapir, monkeys, birds. I had previously thought that the 2020 fires were a freak accident.But seeing all that again, in person, made me wonder if perhaps that was the new reality in the Pantanal. The new normal. The biome is highly resilient, but with these tragedies repeating at such short intervals, with frequent, intense wildfires fuelled by water-loss and drought, there just isn’t time for it to recover.Worse: even with people now better prepared and more aware of what’s happening in the Pantanal, nothing has been able to contain the fires. Seeing all that up close was gut-wrenching; a reality check.View image in fullscreenVolunteer firefighters assess the wildfire on Jofre Velho Ranch, Porto Jofre, Mato Grosso, 2020The reality of the Pantanal serves as a very instructive example of the impacts of human actions on Earth. I would like viewers of my pictures not to see it as something distant that is happening on the other side of the world.

Even before today’s start of parliament, the Nationals had debated a leadership spill and Sussan Ley looked firmly onborrowed time.They cheeredAnthony Albaneseat a caucus meeting, in which he likened the disorganisation of the Coalition to a messy break-up on the reality TV show Married at First Sight.But, as the government enters the delivery phase of its second term, the stakes are significantly higher for the prime minister, even with a 94-seat majority and a stable cabinet.By the time voters next go to the polls – probably sometime in early 2028 – management of 10 key challenges will be critical to the government’s success, and the country’s future.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOne of the main arguments against possible challenger Angus Taylor moving on Ley this week is Tuesday’s cash rate decision from the Reserve Bank. The Liberals want to whack the government with the probable interest rate hike as cost-of-living pain for households grows. Bringing sticky inflation back to the 2% to 3% target is a make-or-break challenge.It is not yet a month since Albanese caved to pressure and announced a royal commission into antisemitism and social cohesion. Commissioner Virginia Bell’s hearings, and a review of intelligence agencies by former Asio boss Dennis Richardson, could reveal security failures which contributed to the tragedy at Bondi beach.Labor might have missed out on hosting rights for the COP31 summit but the government is already sweating over meeting its 43% emissions reduction target for 2030, a goal that requires a dramatic increase in the take-up of renewables. Labor has also pledged to cut emissions by between 62% and 70% by 2035, a mammoth task requiring reorientation of the energy system, just as household bills climb and climb.Political parties receive more than $138m in ‘dark money’ before new donation rules beginRead moreDonald Trump might have endorsed the Aukus nuclear agreement but Albanese will still have to deal with the erratic US president’s whims. Labor has signalled it won’t join Trump’s new board of peace but risks an angry response when the White House is notified. Similarly, managing Australia’s relationship with China will become more challenging amid the realignment of global powers, and the risk of a push by Beijing to retake control of Taiwan.The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is already craftingthe May budget. With major new spending looming, including Albanese’s ambition for universal childcare, curbing growth in the National Disability Insurance Scheme and aged care will be essential. National cabinet agreed last week to trim NDIS growth to between 5% and 6%, down from the current rate of 9.5%. So far,the path to savings is unclear.Labor also faces challenges of its own making. There is growing unhappiness within the caucus at the government’s failure to tackle sports betting advertising and the special minister of state, Don Farrell, wants to expand parliament. In the 40 years since the last expansion, the population has increased by 11 million people.Labor will hardly be the only government to have struggled on closing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage gap, but since the voice to parliament referendum Indigenous issues have all but disappeared from the agenda. Albanese’s promised comprehensive economic policy for First Nations communities is yet to materialise.These challenges await the government even before it comprehends the technological earthquake of AI and its capacity to reshape our lives. Transforming work and undercutting the information environment on which our institutions are founded could be the least of this task.Like the alcohol-soaked drama of reality TV, Albanese predicts Labor’s opponents will fall victim to drama and dishonesty. But avoiding a false sense of security for his government will be critical, to Labor and the country.Tom McIlroy is Guardian Australia’s political editorExplore more on these topicsAnthony AlbaneseLabor partySussan LeyLiberal partyCost of living crisisAI (artificial intelligence)Australian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

But as part of that process, Lecornu and his government faced a series of no-confidence motions. The government survived the final two votes of no confidence on Monday evening.Lecornu managed to push the budget through only because the Socialist party agreed not to vote against the government, in exchange for some concessions including the suspension ofMacron’s flagship pension changes, which had sought to gradually raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.Hervé Saulignac, a Socialist MP, told parliament that his party had “done its duty” and “avoided the worst”. He said leavingFrancewithout a budget would have been to “add more anguish to the anguish” of the French people.Lecornu had called the budget a “breakthrough”, saying it would boost defence spending by €6.5bn. Although some lawmakers have expressed doubts, the budget aims to bring the deficit down to 5% of the gross domestic product in 2026, from 5.4% in 2025. The French executive was initially targeting 4.6%, but the scrapping of pension changes meant such a reduction of the deficit was not possible, according to the rightwing rapporteur Philippe Juvin.Budget negotiations have consumed the French political class for almost two years after the president, Emmanuel Macron, sparked incredulity by callinga snap electionin June 2024, which delivered a hung parliament. A left alliance won the most seats, but fell far short of a majority. The far-right National Rally party won the most votes and became a force to be reckoned with, but did not have a majority. Macron’s centrist grouping lost seats but were still present.Domestic politics has been largely deadlocked since then, leading to a period of instability and government collapses in Europe’s second largest economy.Broken promises and political crises: how Emmanuel Macron fell from French favourRead moreMacron at first appointed the rightwingMichel Barnierprime minister in 2024, who was brought down by parliament only three months later amid a row over the 2025 budget. Then the centristFrançois Bayroulasted only nine months before he too was ousted over the proposed 2026 budget. Lecornu, a key Macron ally, was appointed last autumn, before resigning and beingreappointedto try to get a budget passed.Lecornu would like to stay in office until 2027, without being ousted. His fragile government is seeking to move beyond the budget on to issues such as a law to protect farmers, and a bill onassisted dying and improved palliative care. But the deadlock in parliament has limited the government’s ability to act on domestic policies.Municipal elections take place across France next month. The presidential election of spring 2027 is now the key focus of national politics.Macron, who cannot stand again for office after two terms as president, is now working almost entirely on foreign policy, pushing Europe to be less dependent on foreign powers, and advocating a harder line in confronting the US president, Donald Trump, over tariffs or theGreenlandcrisis.The far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who was considered to be one of the contenders for the 2027 presidential election, is currently attendinga retrial on appealover the embezzlement of European parliament funds through an alleged fake jobs scam. She was found guilty last year andbanned from running for officefor five years, but is seeking to overturn that verdict and sentence.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronMarine Le PenNational RallynewsShareReuse this content"

Høiby has denied the most serious charges, including those of sexual abuse.Police have requested four weeks of imprisonment for Høiby on the grounds of preventing him from reoffending. Oslo district court ruled that he could be remanded in custody until otherwise decided by the prosecuting authority or court until 2 March.Andreas Kruszewski, a police prosecutor, said: “The Oslo police district can confirm that Marius Borg Høiby was arrested on Sunday evening and charged with bodily harm, making threats involving a knife, and breach of a restraining order.Høiby’s arrest comes at a moment of great tension for the Norwegian royal family.Over the weekend the crown princess, Mette-Marit, was forced to respond to revelations about her relationship with the late child sex offender Epstein after her name appeared nearly 1,000 times in the newly unsealed files released by the US justice department on Friday.While the Norwegian public and media have known for a long time that Høiby’s trial was coming, Mette-Marit’s inclusion in the Epstein files has taken people by surprise.View image in fullscreenCrown Princess Mette-Marit: ‘I deeply regret having had any contact with Epstein. It is simply embarrassing.’Photograph: Andreas Fadum/dana press/ShutterstockIn them, Mette-Marit calls Epstein “very charming”, “soft-hearted” and “such a sweetheart”, appearing to suggest they were in close contact between 2011 and 2014, years afterhe pleaded guiltyto charges that included soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.In a statement issued on Saturday, Mette-Marit said the files “showed poor judgment”, adding: “I deeply regret having had any contact with Epstein. It is simply embarrassing.”Shazia Majid, a journalist and columnist for the Norwegian tabloid VG, said the emails had come “at the “worst possible time”. “It has been a hard blow. People are talking about it everywhere, and there is a strong sense of anger and disappointment,” she said.Support for the royal family had been impacted “at least in the short term”, said Majid, adding: “The monarchy is undoubtedly facing a serious crisis.” Long term, however, she expects the public to “rally around” King Harald V, 88, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon.The Norwegian parliament was due on Tuesday to vote on whether to replace the monarchy in a ballot that is held once every four years. While it is not expected to succeed, it may have stronger support than previous years. “Can Mette-Marit be queen after this?” questionedAftenposten, a daily newspaper, at the weekend.View image in fullscreenClockwise from far left: Norway’s King Harald, Crown Prince Haakon, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, Princess Mette-Marit and Queen Sonja at the Nobel peace prize ceremony in December last year.Photograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersCraig Aaen-Stockdale, the leader of the organisation Norway as a Republic, said the Epstein emails had “knocked a lot of people’s confidence in the monarchy”, including among former supporters. “The popularity of the monarchy has crashed among the general population. Everybody is pretty angry,” he said.The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said on Monday he expected “the Norwegians mentioned” in the files to “comment on the truth about what happened”.“The crown princess herself has stated that she has shown poor judgment, which I agree with,” said the Labour leader.Inclusion in the files does not imply wrongdoing.Mette-Marit, who has pulmonary fibrosis and recently revealed that she is likely to need a lung transplant, married Haakon, the future king of Norway, in 2001. Her son, Høiby, was born from a previous relationship.In one email to Epstein in 2012, Mette-Marit asked Epstein if it was “inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my 15 yr old sons wallpaper”. Soon before, she emailed Epstein about him being on a “wife hunt” in Paris in which she said the French capital was “good for adultery” and said that “Scandis (are) better wife material”.After receiving flowers from him when she was feeling unwell, she sent him a thank you email signed, “Love, Mm.” The files also indicate that she stayed at Epstein’s house in Palm Beach, Florida, for four days in 2013 when he was away.The files show that she had Googled Epstein in 2011 and told him “it didn’t look too good” with a smiling face emoji.Mette-Marit has expressed her “deep sympathy and solidarity” with Epstein’s victims and said she was responsible “for not having checked Epstein’s background more closely and not understanding quickly enough what kind of person he was”.The palace said Mette-Marit had ended written contact with Epstein in 2014 as she felt he was “trying to use his relationship with the crown princess as leverage with other people”.Among other Norwegians included in the latest Epstein files release is the former Labour prime minister Thorbjørn Jagland. Between 2013 and 2014, while Jagland was secretary general of the Council ofEuropeand chair of the Nobel committee, he talked about a potential family visit to Epstein’s island. He has since said the plan “never came to fruition”.In 2012, he wrote in an email to Epstein that he had just been to Tirana, the capital of Albania, where he said there were “extraordinary girls”. He has since said that some of his emails have “embarrassing jargon that can be misunderstood”.Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The mine at the centre of Europe’s push for rare earth metalsRead moreThe report, which examines the EU’s ability to meet its target of 42.5% of energy from renewables in 2030, exposes a gulf between rhetoric and reality.In one of the most damning conclusions, it notes that not only is mining and exploration “underdeveloped” in the EU but “even when new deposits are found, it can take 20 years for an EU mining project to become operational”.“This makes any concrete contribution by the 2030 deadline hard to imagine,” the report notes.It comes as UK prime minister Keir Starmer agreed to accelerate cooperation with Japan on critical minerals during talks in Tokyo on Saturday with his counterpart, Sanae Takaichi.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has conveneda summit of about 20 countries in Washingtonon Wednesday to coordinate diversification of mineral supplies, including the lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper, and rare earth elements needed for solar panels, wind turbines and car batteries.View image in fullscreenThe symbols and atomic numbers of rare earth elements.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersThe summit is seen as a step to repair transatlantic ties fractured by a year of conflict with Donald Trump and pave the way for other alliances to help countries de-risk from China.A map of the suppliers shows the dependency on the east,particularly Chinaand Russia, which supplies 29% of nickel used in the auto and aerospace sectors.The EU is heavily reliant on China for seven of the 26 minerals studied, importing: 97% of its magnesium, which is used in hydrogen production; 71% of gallium, used in smartphones and satellite communications; and 31% of tungsten, used in drilling and mining.On rare earths, China controls between 69% and 74% of six important rare earths including two minerals – neodymium and praseodymium – which are needed to make permanent magnets used in everything from car locking systems to fridge doors and wind turbines.Brussels has previously revealed that of 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets used by EU industry in 2024, 17,000 tonnes came from China.Lithium, also needed for car batteries, largely hails from Chile, while Turkey supplies 99% of boron, used in solar panels, the ECA found.View image in fullscreenWorkers transport soil containing rare earth elements for export at a port in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China.Photograph: China Stringer Network/Reuters“Many strategic projects will struggle to secure their supply of critical raw materials by 2030,” the ECA said, noting that “the EU may be trapped in a vicious circle”.“Without critical raw materials, there will be no energy transition, no competitiveness, and no strategic autonomy. Unfortunately, we are now dangerously dependent on a handful of countries outside the EU for the supply of these materials,” said Pentus-Rosimannus.The report comes as EU industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné said Europe was “doomed to be just a playground for its competitors” unless it develops “an ambitious, effective and pragmatic industrial policy”.The ECA concluded that “efforts to diversify imports have yet to produce tangible results”, noting that partnerships with seven countries that have poor governance resulted in supplies falling rather than increasing between 2020 and 2024.Of the main 26 critical minerals, 10 are fully imported, while none of the 17 rare earth metals are mined in the bloc. Recycling also lags behind: just 16 critical raw materials are recycled in the bloc.Explore more on these topicsCritical mineralsMiningInternational tradeRenewable energyGreenhouse gas emissionsEconomicsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

More than 10 million people visited the Trevi in 2025 alone.The payment is only for visitors who walk down the fountain’s steps to reach the basin. They can enjoy as much time there as they please, tossing coins over their shoulders in a ritual that is said to guarantee a return to the Eternal City, and posing for selfies. They can’t eat, drink or smoke in the area of the basin. People who live in Rome are exempt from the fee, as are people with disabilities and children under the age of six.The feewas forecast to bring in €6.5m a year, money that would be used to invest in the fountain and other monuments in the Italian capital.Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s tourism chief, described the measure as “a healthy revolution”. “Until a year ago, visiting the Trevi fountain was an absurd experience,” he said in reference to the huge crowds who would gather at the basin, some of whom would jump in.View image in fullscreenPaid admission is expected to draw millions in extra funding each year for the city’s conservation work.Photograph: Alessandro Di Meo/EPAThe Trevi fountain’s white marble sparkled under a clear blue sky on the first day of the access fee and most people appeared happy to pay it, either in cash or through contactless payment machines. Tickets can also be bought online.But there were grumbles among some. “This isn’t a good thing at all,” said Irma Pavitashvili, a tourist from Georgia, as she walked away from the monument after being asked for €2. “This fountain should be for everyone.”‘Stop swimming in our canals! And put some clothes on!’ Venice declares war on unruly touristsRead moreAlma Peterson, a visitor from the US, agreed. “It’s not right to charge people – this is history, it should be free.”Onorato shrugged off the complaints. “I think tourists were shocked by the fact that the city of Rome is only asking for €2 for a site of this level,” he said. “If the Trevi fountain had been in New York, they would have asked for €100, not €2.”As visitor numbers to Rome and acrossItalyrise rapidly, charges to visit popular sites that were previously free are becoming increasingly normal.Since 2023, a €5 fee has been in place at the Pantheon, which was built by the Roman emperor Hadrian and is famous for its oculus – the hole in its giant dome. Day trippers to Venice must pay a fee to enter the city during peak season and, since December, tourists have to pay to enter the courtyard in Verona associated with Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeOvertourismnewsShareReuse this content"

Otherwise, we’ll see what happens … We have a big fleet heading out there,” Trump told Fox News. “Theyare negotiating, so we’ll see what happens.”He said US allies in the region were not being told of plans for reasons of security. “Well, we can’t tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan – it could be worse, actually,” he said.Calls grow in Iran for independent inquiry into protest death tollRead moreLater on Saturday, Trump declined to say whether he had decided on a course of action regarding US intervention inIran.He sidestepped a question about whether Tehran would be emboldened if the US backed away from launching strikes, telling reporters: “Some people think that. Some people don’t.”He said Iran should negotiate a “satisfactory” deal to prevent the country from getting any nuclear weapons, but said: “I don’t know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.”The arrival of the flotilla has raised fears of a direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies – notably Israel – in the event of an attack.On Sunday, Iranian state television reported that Iran’s supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had warned that any attack by the Americans would have far-reaching consequences.“The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,” Khamenei was quoted as saying. “We are not the instigators and we do not seek to attack any country. But the Iranian nation will deliver a firm blow to anyone who attacks or harasses it.”Asked about the warning, Trump told reporters on Sunday: “Of course he is going to say that.“Hopefully we’ll make a deal. If we don’t make a deal, then we’ll find out whether or not he was right,” he said.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to reporters in Florida on Saturday night.Photograph: Al Drago/Getty ImagesA day earlier, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, had downplayed Tehran’s interest in the conflict. “The Islamic republic of Iran has never sought, and in no way seeks, war and it is firmly convinced that a war would be in the interest of neither Iran nor the United States nor the region,” he said in a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, according to the Iranian presidency.Qatar said its prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, visited Tehran on Saturday and met Ali Larijani, the head of Iran’s supreme national security council, regarding “efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region”.Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?Read moreTrump has previously said he believes Iran would rather make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes than face US military action, and Tehran has said it isready for nuclear talksas long as its missiles and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.“Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing,” Larijani said, one day after the Kremlin said he had held talks in Moscow with Vladimir Putin.The commander-in-chief of Iran’s army, Amir Hatami, had earlier warned the US and Israel against any attack, saying his forces were “at full defensive and military readiness” to respond.“If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region and the security of the Zionist regime,” Hatami said, according to the official news agency IRNA. He said Iran’s nuclear technology and expertise “cannot be eliminated”.Iranian authorities rushed to deny that several incidents on Saturday were linked to any attack or sabotage, including an explosion in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas that local firefighters said was caused by a gas leak.Iran has told ships it will conduct a live-fire drill on Sunday and Monday in the strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies.An Iranian official denied on Sunday that such a drill would take place, saying initial reports had been incorrect. “There was no plan for the Guards to hold military exercises there, and there was no official announcement about it. Only media reports which were wrong,” they told Reuters.EU designates Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisationRead moreThe US Central Command had warned Tehran against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”.The statement drew criticism from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who wrote on social media: “Operating off our shores, the US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.”The US designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation in 2019, and the EU did the sameon Thursday.In response, the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad – Baqer Qalibaf, said on Sunday that Tehran would now consider all EU militaries to be terrorist groups.“By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards … the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot and once again made a decision against the interests of their people by blindly obeying the Americans,” Qalibaf said.He said the national security parliamentary commission would deliberate on the expulsion of EU countries’ military attaches and follow up with the foreign ministry.On Sunday, Khamenei compared the countrywide protests to a “coup”, suggesting the government’s position had hardened, ascalls grew in Iranfor an independent inquiry into the number of people killed during the unrest.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Ever”.Nine women have come forward to accuse Gaiman of sexual misconduct, including Scarlett Pavlovich, the former nanny to Gaiman and his wife, Amanda Palmer. The couple, who have a son together, are going through a divorce.On Monday evening Gaiman posted on his Facebook author page for the first time since the allegations broke, save for a book-related post in November, to say he had “learned first-hand how effective a smear campaign can be”.“The allegations against me are completely and simply untrue. There are emails, text messages and video evidence that flatly contradict them,” he said.“These allegations, especially the really salacious ones, have been spread and amplified by people who seemed a lot more interested in outrage and getting clicks on headlines rather than whether things had actually happened or not. (They didn’t.)”Gaiman said he had hoped there would be journalistic investigations that “would take the (mountains of) evidence into account” but he had been “astonished to see how much of the reporting was simply an echo chamber, and how the actual evidence was dismissed or ignored”.He added: “One thing that’s kept me going through all this madness is the conviction that the truth would, eventually, come out.”Since the allegations were published, one of Gaiman’s comic publishers, Dark Horse, has dropped him, while DC Comics, publishers of the Sandman, pulled a planned reprint of his work from its schedule. A stage play of Gaiman’s children’s book Coraline was cancelled a year ago after the claims against him.Gaiman also revealed that, despite the condemnation he has faced and many fans turning against him, he had begun writing again and was close to finishing a new novel.“Thank you again to so many of you for your belief in my innocence and your support for my work. It has meant the world to me,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNeil GaimanAmerican GodsTortoise MedianewsShareReuse this content"

Ethics experts remain concernedLauren Arataniin New YorkMon 2 Feb 2026 17.21 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 17.23 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleDonald Trumphas been accused of “corruption, plain and simple” after it was revealed that a member of the Emirati royal family was behind a $500m investment into the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company.Ethics experts say the deal – struck just days before the US president’s inauguration last January – amounts to a deep conflict of interest for the White House, amid calls for a congressional investigation into the transaction.Months after the deal, the Trump administrationannouncedthat the United Arab Emirates would be allowed to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s powerful AI chips – overriding concerns that the deal could eventually allow China access to the technology.The January 2025 investment was backed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a powerful official in the UAE government. Tahnoon is the brother of the country’s president, and serves as both national security advisor and chair of the Emirates’ $1.5tn wealth fund.Donald Sherman, president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a powerful government watchdog group, said the deal is a “blatant, disgraceful conflict of interest and a possible violation of the Constitution’s Federal Emoluments Clause”.“Thanks to this latest monetization of the White House, the American people will have to question whetherTrump administrationpolicies affecting the UAE…. are in the best interest of the public and American workers, or a foreign nation that padded the president’s bottom line,” Sherman said.Four days before inauguration, Tahnoon ’s emissaries agreed to acquire a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency company co-owned by the Trump family, for half a billion dollars, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on thedeal.Documents seen by the Journal indicate that Tahnoon paid the Trump family and entities affiliated with Steve Witkoff, cofounder of World Liberty and Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, half of the investment up front, with $187m going to Trump entities, and $31m going to Witkoff’s. The payment came from Aryam Investment, a Tahnoon-backed company.A White House official said the president is “not involved in running his businesses and has turned them over to his children, so these business endeavors do not involve him”.Claims that the president had breached the constitution’s federal emoluments clause, designed to safeguard against corruption, are “bogus and irrelevant”, the official argued. “Mere appearances of business deals with which he has no involvement plainly cannot violate the Emoluments clause.”In a statement, White House counsel David Warrington added: “President Trump performs his constitutional duties in an ethically sound manner and to suggest so otherwise is either ill-informed or malicious.”Government ethics experts have long been alarmed over the way that Trump and his family structured his companies before he started his second term. Typically, a president puts his assets into a blind trust overseen by an independent third party. But Trump handed over control to two of his sons,Donald TrumpJr and Eric Trump.While it’s no different from how Trump structured his companies during his first term, Trump spent the years after he left the White House expanding his family business. Now Trump entities are dabbling in social media, streaming platforms, nuclear fusion, financial services and, through World Liberty, crypto.“This is beyond unprecedented and unimaginable,” said Kedric Payne, general counsel and senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center. “I can’t think of any president in modern history who had an international business that could even get [him] into this type of predicament.”While Trump claims to be staying out of his family business, the president met with Tahnoon multiple times after he reentered the White House. In March, Trump hosted a dinner at the White House for Tahnoon and an Emirati delegation. In aposton Truth Social, he said the evening “demonstrated the long-standing ties and bonds of friendship between our countries”.Come May, World Libertyannouncedthat MGX, the Emirati’s AI investment arm, would use its USD1 stablecoin to invest $2bn into crypto exchange Binance.Two weeks later, the White House would announce its deal to allow the UAE to importNvidiachips, which would allow the Gulf state to compete as a major AI player. The Biden administration had restricted the export of AI chips to the UAE, given its relationship with China, over fears that giving chips to the UAE could ultimately lead them to getting to China.‘America first’? Trump financial products raise questions about potential presidential conflicts of interestRead moreThe Guardian has not identified evidence of the president explicitly offering the chip exports in exchange for the investment in his family’s crypto venture.Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia, said while there’s no direct allegation of a quid pro quo, “the situation of a major investment by a foreign power in a major company that the president has a major stake in, that creates a structural conflict of interest”.“The concern is that we can never be sure why certain decisions are being made,” Briffault said. When Trump allowed the UAE to import AI chips, “it could have a shrewd geopolitical move, or it could have been influenced by the fact that the country has a major investment in a Trump family business. We just can’t know for sure.”Government ethics advocates said it will be up to Congress to investigate the extent of the relationship between Trump’s company and any foreign interest. But with a majority in the House and Senate, only Republicans have the power to launch a formal investigation.“Congress needs to grow a spine and put a stop to Trump’s crypto corruption,” Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement. “This is corruption, plain and simple. The Trump administration must reverse its decision to sell sensitive AI chips to theUnited Arab Emirates.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesTrump administrationUnited Arab EmiratesNvidianewsShareReuse this content"

The state alleges that the company knowingly enabled predators to use Facebook and Instagram to exploit children.The trial will introduce evidence that Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, believes shows how Meta’s social networks create dangerous environments for children, exposing them to sexual exploitation, solicitation,sextortionandhuman trafficking.The lawsuit states that Meta’s design choices and profit incentives prioritized engagement over child safety and that it failed to implement effective safeguards. The state accuses the company of allowing unmoderated groups devoted to commercial sex and of facilitating the buying, selling and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).“While the New Mexico attorney general makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments by cherrypicking select documents, we’re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson said.“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We use these insights to make meaningful changes – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.”The lawsuit follows atwo-year Guardian investigation, published in 2023, which revealed that the tech giant was struggling to prevent people from using its platforms to traffic children. The investigation is cited several times in the suit’s filings. In aninterview with the Guardianin 2024, Torrez said he believed Meta was the “largest marketplace for predators and paedophiles globally”.After a week of jury selection, opening statements are set to begin on 9 February, followed by the presentation of evidence. The proceedings are expected to last about seven weeks.Social media companies have long maintained they are not responsible for crimes committed via their networks because of a US federal law that generally protects platforms from legal liability for content created by their users, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Meta’s attempts to invoke section 230 and the first amendment to get the case dismissed were ultimately denied in a judge’s ruling in June 2024, due to the lawsuit’s focus on Meta’s platform product design and other non-speech issues, such as internal decisions about content and curation.The New Mexico trial comes just a week after ahigh-profile casebegan in Los Angeles, in which hundreds of US families and schools allege that Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube have harmed children. The plaintiffs in the LA lawsuit allege the platforms knowingly addicted young users, leading to depression, eating disorders, self-harm and other mental health problems. The proceedings involve about 1,600 plaintiffs, including more than 350 families and 250 school districts. Snap and TikTok reached settlements with the plaintiffs, while Meta and YouTube remain on trial. Each company has denied wrongdoing.“The fact that these cases are going to trial proves the section 230 dam is breaking,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “These are the trials of a generation; just as the world watched courtrooms hold big tobacco and big pharma accountable, we will for the first time see big tech CEOs take the stand.”Key witnesses for the plaintiffs in the New Mexico suit are expected to include educators and law enforcement officials, who will speak about the alleged harms and crimes they have witnessed take place on Facebook,Instagramand WhatsApp, and whistleblowers, who may reveal internal company discussions. Teens and families who have experienced harm on the platforms are not anticipated to take the stand.Torrez and his team have already taken the deposition of the Meta chief, Mark Zuckerberg, and may play portions of it in court if he does not attend. New Mexico’s jurisdiction limits its ability to compel out-of-state witnesses to testify in person.On the lawsuit’s journey to the courtroom, the attorney general’s office has made several disclosures with fresh allegations. They include that Meta may have profited by placing advertisements from companies such as Walmart and Match Groupalongside contentthat sexualized children, according to internal documents and emails.Internal Meta documents obtained by the attorney general’s office show the company estimates that roughly100,000 children on Facebook and Instagramexperience online sexual harassment each day. Filings unveiled chat excerpts of users allegedly discussing how to lure minors into engaging with them sexually. Aformer Instagram employee testified in 2023 before Congressthat his own daughter had received unwanted sexual advances on Instagram. When he notified senior Meta leadership, he said he was ignored.Among the evidence expected to be presented in court are details of the 2024 arrest of three men charged with sexually preying on children through Meta’s platforms. This was part of an investigation dubbed “Operation MetaPhile” by the attorney general’s office. Undercover agents posing as children were contacted by the suspects, who allegedly solicited them for sex after finding minors through design features on Facebook and Instagram.The agents did not initiate any conversations about sexual activity, according to the state attorney general. Following a surge of activity from adults to one of these undercover agent’s accounts, Meta did not shut it down, and instead sent it information about how to monetize accounts and grow followings.A filing last weekrevealed allegationsthat Zuckerberg approved allowing minors to access AI chatbot companions despite warnings from the company’s safety staff that the bots could engage in sexual interactions. Internal emails and messages cited in the filings reportedly show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”.The documents detail an internal chat in March 2024 about parental controls for minors using AI chatbots on Meta’s platforms; one employee asked whether parents could disable the chatbots for their children. Another employee responded that it was a “Mark-level decision that parents cannot turn it off”.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMetaFacebookInstagramWhatsAppNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

It later recovered some ground, but was still down by 3.5% at $4,700 in afternoon trading.Silver fell by as much as 7%, after a 30% slump on Friday, before recovering slightly to $79.60 an ounce.Trump has tapped a new Federal Reserve chair. Has he finally found his yes-man?Read moreThe partial recovery in the metals market helped support the UK’s blue chip FTSE 100 stock index, which breached the 10,300 mark for the first time. It closed at 10,341 points on Monday afternoon, after hitting a new intraday high of 10,345. .Gold and silver had hitsuccessive highs in recent weeks, as investors sought safe haven assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and fears around the independence of the US Federal Reserve.Donald Trump triggered the sell-off on Friday, after he said he would nominateKevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and respected central banker, to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.Warsh will succeed Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, if confirmed by the Senate. Trump said on Friday that he had not asked Warsh to commit to rate cuts.Susannah Streeter, of the broker Wealth Club, said the metals sell-off reflected relief that a “Trump cheerleader” would not be installed at the central bank. “Now financial industry heavyweight Kevin Warsh has been anointed as successor, with deep Fed experience, he’s not expected to be a pushover and that’s sparked this big reversal of safe-haven positions,” she said.Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, described Friday’s sell-off as a “meltdown in the metals space”.View image in fullscreenKevin Warsh.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersThe price of industrial metals, which had swept up in the metals rally, also dropped on Monday, with platinum and copper both falling.Meanwhile, bitcoin also recovered some of its losses over the weekend, rising by 1.8% against the US dollar, although the cryptocurrency still traded below $80,000 and is far off its peak of $125,000 last year.Oil prices fell by 4%, as investors watched signs ofgeopolitical tensions easing between the US and Iran. Brent crude traded at about $65.24 a barrel, down from highs of about $71 last week.But the US stock market opened higher on Monday, with the S&P 500 share index ticking up 0.4%. The dollar, which slumped in the second half of January, rose by 0.43% against a basket of rival currencies.While gold and silver prices are falling , analysts at Deutsche Bank said on Monday that they still expect the metal to hit $6,000 this year.Mohit Kumar, of the broker Jefferies, said the gold sell-off looked like “an unwind” of a “crowded” trade.“Gold was one of the most crowded positions with positioning reaching close to 8 [on a scale of -10 to 10] on our indices last week,” he said. “Last two days’ move has taken the positioning to just above four. Still on the long side but much less crowded suggesting that the bulk of weaker hands have been cleaned out.”Even with sharp falls in recent days, gold is still up by about 65% compared with this time last year, while silver is up by more than 120%.Explore more on these topicsGoldSilverCommoditiesOilBitcoinCryptocurrenciesStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

Operator route maps are approximateThe majority of Great Britain’s major rail operators are now in public ownership, as the Labour government continues its efforts to make the railways “more reliable, affordable and accessible”.The nationalisation of West Midlands Trains on 1 February represents the tenth major passenger service to be brought back into public ownership, leaving six to go before the government’s deadline of completing every operator by 2027.The rollout, which is resulting in an operator being nationalised roughly every three months, is gradually bringing an end to a privatised system that critics argue has been overly fragmented and focused on profit, to the detriment of passenger experience.Several operators were already under public ownership by the time Labour were elected in 2024, having been nationalised by the Conservatives over financial woes and poor performance.Meanwhile,Transportfor Wales and ScotRail were each nationalised by the Welsh and Scottish devolved governments, in 2021 and 2022 respectively.However, under the current transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, the Department for Transport (DfT) has accelerated the pace of nationalisation, bringing four operators on to the public books since May 2025: South Western Railway, C2C, Greater Anglia and West Midlands Trains.State of play, February 2026So fartenof the 16 major rail operators in Britain are now in public ownership:Tap an operator to highlight routes, tap again to deselectThe government has said the remaining six will be nationalised byOctober 2027:The operator that was nationalised most recently wasWest Midlands Trains, which took place on1 February 2026.The next operator set to be nationalised isGovia Thameslink, which the government says will take place inMay 2026.The nationalisations come ahead of the establishment of a new state-controlled company called Great British Railways, expected this year, which will manage rail infrastructure and services.It has been describedby the DfTas a “single directing mind” for “bringing track and train together, putting passengers and customers first, [and] rebuilding trust in the railway”.It will soon manage most of the publicly owned operators in Great Britain, combining them with Network Rail, which owns the tracks, signals and big stations.However, Great Britain’s trains will remain privately owned.Industry insiders have expressed cautious optimism about Labour’s plans, highlighting the potential for Great British Railways to achieve more coordination and, in turn, greater efficiency.However, experts have also warned that nationalisation alone may not be enough to fix all of Britain’s problems with rail, given ballooning costs.“Irrespective of the ownership changes, the government’s got a major headache with the fact that rail is gobbling up so much public subsidy, and that’s before you get to HS2,” said Stephen Glaister, the emeritus professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College London and a former chair of the Office of Rail and Road.“The government are making promises to make fares even cheaper and services even better, but both will cost more public money.”The data available on nationalised operators so far offers a mixed picture on performance.Several have experienced improving train punctuality and a reduction in cancellations but the performance of others has worsened over the past year.LNER has been one of the most improved – and in June the rail minister, Peter Hendy,described the operator as a “blueprint”for wider renationalisation efforts.Have rail operators improved since Labour took power?Change in delays and cancellations by rail operator, August 2024 to latest available dataShow more franchisesGuardian graphic. Source: delay and cancellation data taken from the Office of Rail and Road. *Note: South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia were nationalised by the Labour government in the latter half of the time period analysed here, while West Midlands Trains was nationalised afterwardsWhen will the next operators be nationalised?Labour committed to bringing rail into public ownership in theparty’s 2024 election manifesto– claiming it had come up with a way to nationalise trains “without costing taxpayers a penny in compensation”.Instead of an “all-at-once” approach, nationalising every operator simultaneously and paying off shareholders, the government is running down the clock on existing rail contracts.The DfT is waiting for each operator’s core contract expiry date, which allows the government to take over without compensating the private companies.The final operator to expire in this way will be CrossCountry in October 2027 – and this is when the government says it will have completed rail nationalisation in Great Britain.Until then, the government has set a pace of nationalising one operator in each annual quarter. Govia Thameslink is due next, in May 2026.Labour’s current one-at-a-time approach builds off of the work of its predecessors in government. Several operators – including LNER, Northern and Southeastern – were brought into public ownership by the Conservatives from 2018 onwards.In those cases, nationalisation was taken as an emergency measure rather than a deliberate policy – in response to financial difficulties, in the case of LNER, or because of dismal performance, in the case of Northern.Additionally, ScotRail and Transport for Wales were brought into public ownership by their respective devolved governments, and their train operations are not expected to be merged into Great British Railways.Labour’s strategy for the remaining operators is driven by legal reality – which experts say could be helpful given how fragmented rail in Great Britain has become.“You can’t do it in one go,” said Marcus Mayers, the managing director of the Rail and Station Innovation Company. “If you try to merge 22 companies in one go – you don’t have the ability to build the system, to join it together that quickly.“So you build an operation which is capable of ingesting organisations, and is capable of ingesting organisations at the rate of one every three months. That makes sense.”Will nationalisation improve the railways?The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has previously said his government would not be nationalising rail out of ideology but because of what it could deliver for passengers.“We’ve tried privatisation for two or three decades and it’s a complete mess,” the Labour leadersaid in April 2024. “Everybody who travels on the trains has been affected by the cancellations and delay.”Privatisation was undertaken by the Conservatives in the 1990s, after decades of falling ridership under the nationalised British Rail.From 1948 onwards the annual number of journeys on Britain’s rail network fell consistently, from a peak of more than 1 billion a year in 1950 to a low of 0.6 billion in 1982.After privatisation, rail journeys recovered significantly, reaching a new peak of 1.7 billion by 2017.Chart showing passenger journeys on Britain’s rail network between 1945 to 2025“Privatisation sparked a railway renaissance,”saidPatrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary under David Cameron, in a speech in 2013.However, the impact on other aspects of train travel has been more mixed.One of the original selling points of privatisation was that competitionfor franchises would bring better value for the taxpayer.While the industry remained subsidised overall, some major commuter franchises went on to pay a return.Yet in the past few years, after huge falls in passenger numbers during the coronavirus pandemic, the amount the government pays to operators in public subsidy has ballooned to record levels.“The government is still forking out £12bn on operational subsidy, plus HS2 is another £7bn, plus extracurricular investment projects on the existing railways,” Glaister said.“That’s a very great deal of money in the context of the public expenditure crisis.”Costs have risen for passengers, too.Rail fareshave become less affordable since privatisation, rising faster than average earnings in the same period.Today it costs about £8.90 to take a 50km (31-mile) journey by rail, based on how much revenue rail operators collect for each kilometre travelled on their network.When adjusting for inflation, that same journey would have cost £7.54 in 1994.Chart showing how rail fares have increased relative to wages since privatisation in 1995The rising cost of rail comes amid widespread dissatisfaction with the reliability of Great Britain’s trains.Last year was the worst year for cancellations nationally since 2015,according to statistics produced by the Office of Rail and Road.Labour has pledged to improve reliability and affordability with nationalisation, banking on a unified Great British Railways to end what critics see as an overly fragmented system.“It’s possible, because there’s efficiencies of integration of track and train, which might mean that problems get solved more quickly,” Mayers said.“You may be taking out the commercial imperative to drive reliability, but you’ve also got more collaboration about how to achieve it. So it’s a fine balance, and whether it will work or not is still open for debate.”Others are sceptical of how much more efficiency can be wrung out of the system.“Governments frequently say: ‘Oh, we’ll make the railways more efficient, we’ll buy lots of new equipment, we’ll employ less people to do the work,’” Glaister said.“But the industry has been trying to do that for years and years, and the regulators screw that down to the absolute bottom in their settlements. And I don’t think there’s a lot of, as it were, undiscovered efficiencies to go for.”A DfT spokesperson said: “Through public ownership and the creation of Great British Railways, the government is fundamentally reforming how our railways are run, putting passengers first.“Public ownership will deliver a railway that is more accountable, efficient, and reliable – resulting in greater opportunities for communities and significant growth.“It is not a silver bullet, and issues inherited from private sector ownership will take time to root out, but we expect public sector operators – and Great British Railways once it is established – to focus relentlessly on improving reliability, punctuality and other aspects of the service that matter most to passengers, and we will hold them to account for doing so.”Response from operatorsAll 16 rail operators were contacted for comment for this pieceMark Ilderton,ScotRailService Delivery Director, said: “ScotRail operates more than 2,100 services across the country every day, with around nine out of ten of those services meeting the punctuality target, getting customers to where they need to be.“We are absolutely committed to delivering the best possible service for customers throughout the country, and everyone at ScotRail is working hard to deliver the safe and reliable railway that our customers expect and deserve, and to encourage more people to travel by train instead of using the car.”Show more"

Tisch has never been charged with any crime connected to the investigation into Epstein.“The league is aware of the reports and Steve’s response. Our office will look into the matter to understand the facts,” theNFLsaid in a statement on Monday.The emails, which were sent in 2013, include messages in which Epstein arranged for Tisch to meet various women.One communication from May 2013 showed Epstein offering to connect Tisch with a Russian woman. Tisch replied a minute later to ask, “Is she fun?” The next month, Tisch asked Epstein multiple questions about a different woman from Tahiti, including whether she was a “working girl”. Epstein replied, “Never.”In another email, Epstein followed up with Tisch about a woman the Giants co-owner had met.“[R]eport just in, you did very well,” Epstein wrote. “[S]he wants to go to the play, she is a little freaked by the age difference but go slow ... [I] will try to convince her not to return to Ukraine. having her crying worked.”Tisch replied, “Nice report ... Funny comment on crying!!!”In a statement on Friday, the 76-year-old Tischdenied any wrongdoing.“We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments,” Tisch said of his relationship with Epstein. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.”Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so farRead moreThe NFL could punish Tisch under its personal conduct policy, even if there is no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing on his part.“Everyone who is part of the league must refrain from ‘conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in’ the NFL,” the policy reads. “It is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime in a court of law. We are all held to a higher standard and must conduct ourselves in a way that is responsible, promotes the values of the NFL, and is lawful.”The most notable example came in 2023,when the league finedformer Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder $60m after it found he sexually harassed a team employee and oversaw team executives who deliberately withheld millions of dollars in revenue from other clubs.However on Monday, during his Super Bowl week press conference, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said it would look into the matter before deciding whether disciplinary measures were necessary.“We are going to look at all the facts,” he said. “We are going to look at the context of those and try to understand that, we will look at how that falls under the policy. But let’s get the facts first.”Tisch won an Academy Award in 1994 for producing Forrest Gump and is chairman and executive vice president of the Giants. He has been involved with the team since his father, Preston Tisch, bought 50% of the Giants in 1991 from the Mara family.The documents were disclosedunder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.Explore more on these topicsNew York GiantsNFLUS sportsJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

But he faces a challenge to win back supporters who booed him off after his last appearance against Chelsea two weeks ago.Palace failed in a late bid to complete a surprise move for Everton’s Dwight McNeil after submitting a deal sheet just before the deadline, on a loan with an obligation to buy for £20m. Their hopes of bringing in a replacement for Guéhi, whojoined Manchester City in January, were also scuppered.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta’s move to Milan fell through after a second medical examination revealed concerns over a knee injury.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAChelsea rejected a loan offer for Josh Acheampong, while Palace did not follow up interest in West Ham’s Max Kilman and Ruben Kluivert of Lyon. But the arrival of Strand Larsen, who has scored only once in the Premier League this season but almost joined Newcastle in the summer, takes Palace’s spending this month to more than £90m.After Palace’s draw against Forest made it 12 games without a win in all competitions, Glasner – who has alreadyannounced he will leave in the summer– again criticised the club’s hierarchy for their approach to transfer windows.“I would prefer not always talking the day before the deadline,” he said. “I think we have to make a step backwards. Maybe two, three more players coming in then we have five or six new players all of a sudden.“It feels like two years ago having to teach them how we want to play, how we want to attack.

Despite being a significant increase it remains about 16% of the tournament’s income. At Wimbledon last year, the total prize pot of £50m was 12.3% of the Championships’ £406.5m revenue.Three of the grand slams, minus theAustralian Open, wrote to the players in December offering a meeting on setting up a grand slam player council, but ignored their demands on pay and welfare.In a further indication of the in-fighting,TennisAustralia is not involved in the dispute, as it has aligned with the Professional Tennis Players’ Association, which is suing the other three grand slam governing bodies in New York’s district court over alleged restrictive practices.After a series of meetings in the locker room in Melbourne, a representative of the players wrote toWimbledon, the French Open and US Open last week making clear that any discussions on governance and the creation of a player council had to be accompanied by meaningful talks on pay.“While the players recognise that governance structures can play an important role, they are concerned that prioritising council formation over the core economic issues risks becoming a process discussion that delays rather than advances meaningful progress,” the letter read.A number of the leading female players are understood to have become more disillusioned with the governance of tennis as a result of events at the Australian Open. There is widespread unhappiness at the decision to install extra TV cameras in warm-up and cool-down areas without any consultation, which led to a video ofGauff smashing her racketin what was previously a private space going viral last week after her quarter-final defeat by Elina Svitolina.Many players are also understood to have been aggrieved by Sunday’s announcement from Craig Tiley, the tournament director, that the Australian Open is exploring moving to best-of-five-set matches for women from the quarter-final stage, a radical move that has not been discussed with the players.Explore more on these topicsTennisAustralian OpenAustralian Open 2026Australia sportWimbledonUS Open tennisFrench OpennewsShareReuse this content"

It is believed both teams have made use of the thermal expansion of certain components to increase the compression ratio to as much as 18:1 when the car is running – equating to potentially as much as a 0.3sec per lap pace advantage – but remain within the rules when the ratio is measured while the car is “cold”.The other engine manufacturers, Audi, Ferrari and Honda, had written and complained to the sport’s governing body, the FIA, which discussed the issue at a meeting held before the first test.Speaking at the official launch of the new Mercedes car, the W17, which was fast and reliable in thefirst test at Barcelona last week, Wolff bullishly accused his rivals of having missed a trick. “I just don’t understand why some teams concentrate more on others and keep arguing a case that is very clear and transparent,” he said.“Communication with the FIA was very positive all along and it was not only on compression ratio but on other things, too. It is very clear what the regulations say, and very clear what the standard procedures are.View image in fullscreenToto Wolff is bullish about the innovations his team have brought to the 2026 car.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“Just get your shit together. They are doing secret meetings, and sending secret letters and trying to invent ways of testing that don’t exist. Maybe you want to find excuses before you have started?”The meeting between the manufacturers and the FIA did not resolve the issue and if Mercedes and Red Bull do enjoy an advantage they will take it into the new season.The Red Bull technical director, Ben Hodgkinson, has been similarly adamant that his team are within the rules and equally dismissive of their rivals, noting: “Any engineer that doesn’t understand about thermal expansion doesn’t belong in this sport, doesn’t deserve to be an engineer really.”Wolff was just as unwavering in his stance and maintained that the FIA considered the engine adhered to the regulations.“The power unit is legal,” he said. “The power unit corresponds to how the regulations are written. That’s how we see the world today, and that’s what the FIA said. That’s what the president of the FIA [Mohammed Ben Sulayem] said, and he knows a bit about that.”However, when asked if he anticipated a protest in Melbourne after the race, he did not rule out action from rival teams. “The power unit corresponds to how the checks are being done. The power unit corresponds to how these things are measured in any other vehicle. Everything else I can’t judge upon. Let’s wait and see, but we feel robust.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Mercedes GPFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

They sold Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace for £35m.Thomas Frank has been down to the bones of his squad because of an injury crisis; the manager was without 11 players for the visit of Manchester City on Sunday. Romero made himself available despite feeling ill but he was forced off at half-time. Spurs were 2-0 down at the time but they battled back to draw 2-2 with two goals from Dominic Solanke.Romero did not hide his frustration when he posted on Instagram. “Great effort from all my teammates yesterday, they were all incredible,” he said. “I wanted to be available to help them even though I wasn’t feeling well, especially as we had only 11 players available – unbelievable but true and disgraceful.”The post was liked by some of Romero’s teammates including Pedro Porro, Djed Spence, Kevin Danso, Gallagher, Pape Sarr, James Maddison and Solanke. Frank actually had 13 established outfield players from which to select. It had been 11 in the 2-0 Champions League win at Eintracht Frankfurt last week.Romero had caused a stir with a post after the 3-2 defeat at Bournemouth on 7 January. “At times like this, it should be other people coming out to speak, but they don’t – as has been happening for several years now,” he wrote. “They only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies.”The 27-year-old deleted the last sentence about the “lies” but the rest of the post stayed up. It was liked by some of his teammates including Porro, who wrote: “Amen. Keep going brother.”Frank sought to defend Romero, who he said had not been fined. But he did say: “When you’re a young leader sometimes you make mistakes. It is good to keep it internal. We had a good conversation [about it] which we will keep internally.”In his latest post, Romero wrote: “We’ll keep showing up and taking responsibility to turn this around, working hard and staying together. All that’s left is to thank all of you for being there and for always supporting us. The fans [heart emoji].”The Argentina defender looked to have been on his way out of Spurs last summer, with Atlético Madrid showing interest in him, after a season that featured a number of controversial comments.There was the repost of a social media message that claimed he was tired because Spurs had not flown him back on a private jet from Argentina duty. There was the complaint that the club’s lack of spending meant they were falling behind Premier League rivals. “You have to realise that something is going wrong – hopefully they [the board] realise it,” he said.There was the moment when Romero thanked the Argentina medics for his return to fitness after injury while making no mention of the physios at Spurs. There was the interview when he said he would love to play in Spain’s La Liga. And he appeared to sign off at the end of it as he paid tribute to the club’s outgoing manager, Ange Postecoglou – just after Frank had been confirmed as his successor. “You paved the way despite the many obstacles that always existed and always will exist,” he wrote.Romero ended up signing a new contract and being named as Son Heung-min’s successor as the captain. It was the definition of a volte-face. Frank can expect more questions about him at his next press conference on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

It was meant to be more of a lighthearted remark to show that actually theWorld Cupin Qatar was a celebration, was a peaceful event and everyone came together in a ­peaceful way.“ So having English fans – real fans – coming in a peaceful way and enjoying and cheering for their team is something that is fantastic.”Infantino was heavily criticised for the decision to award Trump the ­inaugural Fifa peace prizeat ­December’s World Cup draw in Washington, with the move further questioned after US forces seized the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and after Trump issued threats about using military force to seize Greenland.However, Infantino told Sky News: “Objectively, he deserves it.” The Swiss spoke about the role Trump played in securing a ­ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, saying: “He was instrumental in ­resolving conflicts and saving thousands of lives.”View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino (left) and Fifa’s chief of global football development Arsène Wenger at the Women’s Champions Cup final on Sunday.Photograph: John Walton/PAInfantino also said his organisation and Uefa would “have to” look at allowing Russia back into international football. The country has been banned since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but the International Olympic Committee has now recommended that international sports federations admit Russian teams to compete at youth level.Infantino said: “We have to [look at readmitting Russia]. Definitely. This ban has not achieved anything, it has just created more frustration and hatred. Having girls and boys from Russia being able to play football games in other parts of Europe would help.”On 17 December theFifacouncil announced plans for a new U-15 festival, with a boys’ event to be staged next year and a girls’ event in 2027. A media release confirming the council’s decisions said the events would “be open to all 211 FIFA member associations”.Infantino also dismissed the notion there might be a boycott of this summer’s World Cup due to policies adopted at home and abroad by the Trump administration.There has been unrest in a number of US cities – most notably Minneapolis – over the administration’s approach to immigration enforcement, while the Greenland threats raised concerns among the US’ traditional allies in western Europe.Infantino said there were never calls for businesses to boycott a country, “so why football?” He added: “In our divided world, in our aggressive world, we need occasions where people can come, can meet around the passion [for football].”Explore more on these topicsFootballWorld CupGianni InfantinoFifaWorld Cup 2026US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fifa’s ticketing process has been met with demand and controversy. Security concerns for fans traveling to the US have risen.We asked readers to share their experiences of buying World Cup tickets – or deciding not to. These are some of the stories we received.Tickets, travel and Trump: How the 2026 World Cup is shaping up six months from the finalRead more‘The price was high but that’s reality for North American sports’When President Trump placed aggressive tariffs on Canadian exports, I completely swore off travel to the United States. So, when Fifa selected me during the “Domestic Exclusivity” phase, I leapt at the opportunity to buy tickets to a match in Canada. Each step of the online process was somewhat confusing, including a counter-clockwise circular countdown with imperceptibly slow movement and multiple login requests. Nevertheless, after a 90-minute wait, I was able to purchase tickets for my family to Canada’s last group game. They cost $270 (Canadian) each. The price was high, but that’s just the reality for North American sports today. There are tickets at that price and above for every NFL or NHL game. The price of the hotel I booked outside Vancouver was far more shocking.John, Winnipeg, Canada‘They’re not getting a cent of my money’I went to the World Cup in Germany in 2006 when I lived in the UK, and always wanted to go to another in my lifetime. I now live in Australia, and being conscious of the fact that I’d be receiving a decent tax rebate from the Aussie government, had decided to spend that on flying me and the missus to the World Cup taking in some games in the US and Mexico and was registered for tickets and a rough itinerary planned. However that decision all changed as I watched the clown show, clusterfuck of the Trump/Infantino White House press conferences, alongside the news of the appalling treatment of immigrants and tourists in the US. I’ve basically decided that not a cent of my money will go to making the tournament a success for either of those odious pricks. Instead I’ll spend the money on taking in the Ashes, the Rugby World Cup and a few decent gigs/music festivals in the Australia, helping the local economy here.Adam, 53, Brisbane, Australia‘Do I think it’ll be worth it? No’I spent $14,400 on tickets to nine games (a total of 32 tickets). Six group games, two round of 32 and one round of 16.I am expecting that the majority of my tickets will be taken by friends and family traveling from the UK – I only intend to attend two to three games personally. Do I think it’ll be worth it? No. I think it is crazy to spend $500 per ticket for a football game, especially given so many of the group games will be between countries that would not have qualified for a 32-team World Cup. However, with games “local” to me, it still feels more accessible than 2030 or 2034. I attended the World Cup in 2010 and spent £800 on tickets in total, including the quarter-final, semi-final and final. I went to Brazil 2014 (but was only able to get tickets for one game) and Russia 2018, but skipped 2022. Prices for 2026 are out of control but the risk of waiting in the hope ticket prices crash (as they did for the Club World Cup) closer to the time was not a risk I was willing to take.Tom F, Long Island‘Still the most pure form of the sport around’I bought four tickets for a group game in Philadelphia. I got selected in the Fifa lottery and the process itself to buy the tickets was pretty straightforward. I wanted tickets for a New York game as it’s closer to me but the Category 3 & 4 tickets were not available and the Category 2 tickets were too expensive. I ended up paying $155 each for four tickets. It’s a big outlay but unfortunately any event in the States is just going to be expensive.I have had a bit of buyer’s remorse at times about getting the tickets but it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a World Cup game. Despite all the ridiculousness around it, once the games start it is still the most pure form of the sport around.Obviously the situation with ICE is worrying. I work in construction so I’ve met a lot of Colombian & Ecuadorean people who would love to go to these games but, can they be sure they will be not be hassled going to game even if they are in the USA legitimately? Will fans from those countries want to travel even though they are some of the teams who have bought the most color to recent World Cups? Even neutral Latin & Central Americans would probably love to see it but will they want to deal with the hassle of going to a game? And that’s before you get to the question of cost.John, Irishman living in New York‘I spent $70,000 on tickets’I have bought 62 tickets. Spent approximately $70,000. I do think it will be worth it as they can be resold. It’s also, in my opinion, the best sporting event and only comes around twice a decade. Yes, there were obstacles, but all challenges in life are opportunities.Sameer Somal, entrepreneur, New YorkView image in fullscreenMetLife Stadium will host the World Cup final.Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters‘Basic safety and dignity are on the line’Miami is absolutely not ready for a World Cup. The city has no real public transportation, the roads are a mess on a normal day, and the infrastructure is nowhere near capable of handling an event of this scale.And honestly, I’m not buying tickets. Fifa is a corrupt organization that has never cared about fans or human rights – only profit. The last World Cup proved that.To make things even worse, the atmosphere in the US under the Trump administration is frightening. Brown people – including myself – live with the fear of being targeted simply because of our skin. It’s hard to celebrate a global event when basic safety and dignity are on the line.Antonio Gomez Berumen, Miami‘Don’t think I will take the risk’Living in Toronto, it’s been a life’s dream for me to attend a World Cup match and I was very excited with the prospect of a World Cup happening in the US, Canada and Mexico. Two things have tempered my optimism: first, Donald Trump and the current state of the United States. It is quite evident that the current dispensation does not want outsiders in the country – more so, outsiders who look like me (brown and Indian). At this current stage, I don’t think I will take the risk of going to the US to watch a match. That leaves very few matches to be held in Toronto. I have signed up for all the Fifa draws so far, waiting in queue for hours only to be told that I have been ‘entered’ in a draw. Till now, I have not heard any positive news. I would love to watch a football World Cup match – any match, honestly – and I understand that it may not be cheap which is why I’ve started trying from so early. But I am getting frustrated and I don’t think I will be able to get tickets after all – I don’t think I can afford the astronomical prices that I see floating around.Angikaar Choudhury, 35, Toronto‘Once-in-a-lifetime experience’I bought myWorld Cup 2026tickets during the Early Visa Draw. In total I’ve spent over $7,000 so far. The process was stressful – at one point I waited almost 40 minutes just to get into the system, and by the time I got in, many of the major matches like the semi-finals and the final were already gone. The prices in general were quite high, but I still wanted to secure the games I cared about. Even with all the difficulties, I’m really excited. I’ll be in the US for my summer holiday, and I can’t wait to attend the matches in New York and Miami. For me, this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime experience.Cansu, Türkiye‘Impossible to support’I won’t be buying tickets. Even though travel would be very easy for me as an American citizen, and both of my sisters live in host cities (NYC and Dallas), so lodging wouldn’t be an issue. And yet, I’m just so disgusted with the Trump administration and the way“Johnny” was cozied up to him, and with the extortionate ticket prices, and the looming threat of ICE – it’s just impossible to support. And it’s really upsetting, because I have a five-year-old son and this should be a core memory for him. But in the end I think I’ll save up the money and use it to take him to a game at the Emirates instead. Although, I wouldn’t completely rule out one of the Mexican venues next summer …Alex, Montana‘London 2012 was so much simpler’This has been beyond stressful. Between family and friends we’ve had about 10 accounts across the UK and USA trying in the presale draws and got nothing.We did manage to get extremely lucky that our credit card company (Wells Fargo) had a draw so we had about 15-20 devices trying to login and my husband got us four tickets for the round of 16 in Houston for $2,000. Our kids will be six and 10 and we can only hope we get really lucky and England will be playing. We’re still trying to get tickets for the Kansas City quarter-final as it’s the closest game to where we live (a 10-hour drive).Major major obstacles, London 2012 was so much simpler!Claire, Colorado‘Easier to find the Aurora Borealis’I naively thought getting at least one pair of World Cup tickets would be as manageable as getting tickets for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. Surely, I thought, If I could manage to figure out the IOC’s ticketing system and attended a ton of Olympic events with face value tickets, then surely purchasing one pair of tickets to a local World Cup would be somewhat achievable. I was wrong. I was very wrong.I applied for every single ticketing opportunity and failed each time. It’s been easier to find the Aurora Borealis in our neighborhood than it is to find someone who managed to win the World Cup lottery – not one of my friends/family/co-workers/neighbors/community members managed to snag tickets.I admit the frustration of being unable to attend a local World Cup game has dampened my enthusiasm for the event a bit. I still haven’t given up hope and have joined every available promotional contest and event to try to get a pair of those tickets. And I have also been keeping an eye on the secondary market in case some fair priced tickets magically pop up. But I’ve also come to accept that if it doesn’t happen, then it doesn’t. I’ll be perfectly happy to enjoy the World Cup in the comfort of my home, at my local sports bar, or at a neighborhood watch party – the places where all the real local fans will be this World Cup.Rex, Richmond, CanadaView image in fullscreenChristian Pulisic’s United States will look to make a mark on home soil.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images‘We still think it will be worth it’My family and I bought tickets. We spent $800 for four tickets, and plan to buy two more (for which we have budgeted another $800).The ticket lotteries had us stressed that all the tickets would be gone by the time the general sale started. So when my mother-in-law was drawn for one of the pre-sale right-to-buy contests, we bought tickets right away. Since my mother-in-law, who is older, was the one who won the drawing, we needed to coach her over FaceTime on how to buy the tickets. She was quickly getting overwhelmed, especially because the ticket prices seemed to be changing but the second (as other more tech savvy winners bought up the cheap seats). We needed tickets on [26 June], since that was the date we were all able to get off work and school. The game ended up being Egypt-Iran. It is exciting to get to see Mo Salah play in person, but I would be lying if I wasn’t a bit disappointed to not get France or Brazil, or another “bigger” footballing country.With all of that said, we still think it will be worth it – seeing high-level football like the World Cup is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for football fans in a non-footballing country like the US. I completely understand why my fellow American soccer fans are willing to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to see games.Paul, Illinois‘Once-in-a-lifetime adventure … squashed’After surviving a health scare, it has been a dream of mine to go to a World Cup final. For Qatar 2022 I wasn’t well enough and I wasn’t too keen on the chosen location for the World Cup. I’d pencilled in 2026’s final in New York as my plan. I was organised, I booked accommodation two years in advance to be in New York over the final.Everything was in place, we just needed tickets. We knew these would be expensive and have managed to save about $1,000AUD each for final tickets. We’d probably even go to $1,200AUD each if we had to and we based these estimations on the last final in Qatar with the cheapest final tickets there being $900AUD. Then [in December], the prices came out. Cheapest ticket for the final is roughly $6,250AUD each. Or $13,000AUD for the both of us. We don’t have that kind of money.What was a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, a dream after years of illness and not being able to work has been squashed by Fifa’s insistence of making as much money as possible, of Infantino’s disregard for the real football fan that puts their entire life savings at risk. It’s disgusting. We will go to New York. We will have a great time in a great city. We’ve booked the flights and accommodation. But we won’t be going to the final I’ve dreamt of purely because Fifa and Infantino need to make more money on top of all the money they already have. We are devastated.Jon Hewitt, 42, Australia‘No idea if this strategy will work’I have purchased some tickets, but not as many as I’d like. I’m frustrated about how Fifa is handling their ticket offerings for those who use a wheelchair.[Regarding hospitality seats] I asked On Location whether I could buy a wheelchair seat [space], and they said I had to buy a regular seat, then call them and let them know I wanted a wheelchair space, and they would try to accommodate. But their email specifically said, “please note, while we will do our best to accommodate your request, this is not a guarantee.” So I have to spend $2,000-$5,000 on a ticket, and they can’t even guarantee that I can use it. (I am unlikely to buy Hospitality seats because of the cost, but I’m still disappointed that the option doesn’t exist for those with accessibility needs.) I asked Fifa Collect if I could exercise a RTB to get a wheelchair seat. Their response was “Unfortunately we do not handle this. After you buy your ticket you should address to Fifa Ticketing direct in order for them to assist you.” So once again, I’d have to spend a lot of money up front, with no guarantee that I’ll get a usable seat. I actually had a RTB but ended up selling it because it was useless to me.I have had two shots at buying tickets, the Visa pre-sale and the Early Access Draw. In both cases companion seats (a regular seat next to the wheelchair space) were all gone early. By the time my purchasing time slot came up, there were still wheelchair spaces available for many of the games, but no companion seats. I think that’s because Fifa lets you buy up to three companion seats for each wheelchair seat. So the companion seats were sold out much more quickly than the wheelchair seats. By letting early buyers get three companion seats, those seats run out by the time later buyers get online, forcing wheelchair users to attend games on their own.[As of 22 January] I have continued to ping Fifa about how to get a companion seat next to a wheelchair seat. They finally responded that I should just purchase two wheelchair seats: one for the wheelchair user, and one for the companion. I have no idea if this strategy will work, but that’s what I’ve done for the upcoming Random Selection Draw. We’ll see.Jeff, 67, Santa Cruz, CaliforniaExplore more on these topicsFootballWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those who didn’t believe in me. I remember those people. It seems ironic that when I should be thinking about my people, my team, all the work we’ve put in, that’s the thought that came to me.”There have been many challenges for Alcaraz and he has had to overcome ample obstacles to continue winning major titles at such an unprecedented rate, but controversy is not something with which he is familiar. For all his fire on the court, the 22-year-old is a warm, pleasant person who plays fairly and has become a popular figure on and off the court. Last year, despite being dominated by him, his fellow players voted him the winner of ATP’s sportsmanship award. He is not used to being part of any sort of disharmony.For that reason, the aftermath of 17 December, when Alcarazended the partnershipwith his longtime coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, was an unusual experience. The next day, reporters showed up at his tennis club in El Palmar, Murcia in an attempt to elicit comment from him on the subject as he drove into work. The noise only grew louder once Ferrero broke his silence.While Alcaraz and his team presented the split as mutual, the 45-year-old coach stated he had wished to stay on and was pained by no longer being part of Alcaraz’s journey. For weeks, questions about the world No 1’s decision and future prospects dominated Spain’s large network of sports radio shows and newspapers. Alcaraz is very active on social media, meaning he saw a lot of it.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz gets creative to return the ball to Novak Djokovic during the Australian Open final.Photograph: Edgar Su/ReutersHe handled those difficulties the right way, focusing on his work with his team and on this ultimate goal. Becoming the youngest man to win seven grand slam titles – and the career grand slam – is the deserved payoff. It is so typical of his prodigious talent and toughness that, in his first tournament since promoting Samuel López as his main coach, he departed with this career-defining achievement.While Ferrero will always be a key figure in Alcaraz’s development, this victory is validation of the decision. Alcaraz is still so young, but he is also maturing. He has shown he is capable of taking more responsibility and making difficult decisions with his team.Despite how Jannik Sinner stumbled,his loss to Djokovicin the semi-final being his poorest result in a major since defeatby Daniil Medvedev at Wimbledon in 2024, the ATP remains a duopoly. He and Alcaraz will face each other in finals for the foreseeable future and Alcaraz will certainly lose to Sinner. However, this tournament underlined why the Spaniard is on his own unique path and is ahead of all the others since the end of the big three era.Alcaraz has been on an unprecedented trajectory for a long time now. Before achieving these age records on Sunday, at 19 he became the youngest man to be No 1 in the world after hisUS Open triumph in 2022, the only teenager to do so.With this victory, he has made a strong case for being the best young male the sport has seen. Whether this will convert to his ultimate goal of sitting at the top table as an equal of Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer is still far from certain. However, these are early days and he has so much more to achieve.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Carlos AlcarazAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Viktor Gyökeres is the club’s top scorer in the league with six, and Arsenal have scored 17 goals from set pieces – three more than any other club.Arsenal stroll back to winning ways against outclassed Leeds and go seven points clearRead moreArteta, whose side head into the second leg of Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea at the Emirates Stadiumwith a 3-2 advantage, dismissed the criticism after Arsenal became the first team towin all eight of their gamesin the league phase of the Champions League.“I hear completely the opposite: all around Europe that we arethe most exciting team in Europe– the most goals, the most clean sheets,” the manager said. “Maybe I have different sources.”Asked why there was such a disparity of views at home and abroad, Arteta said: “I don’t know which people. You send me the names, the addresses and the email and maybe we can talk but I can’t give you a massive book of all the people.”Arsenal, who have not lost to Chelsea in their past nine meetings, last won the League Cup under George Graham in 1993. They brushed aside Leeds on Saturday to move six points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League and Arteta emphasised the need for his players to maintain momentum by reaching the final.“The big one is to get the team and players and all of our supporters together to enjoy that moment,” he said. “That is what really drives me. [Winning trophies] is a cycle that you want to repeat constantly, and we still have to do that, and some of them, they’ve never done it, so it’s always a first time. I think the group is really convinced that we have the ability to do it.”View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta and Viktor Gyökeres after Arsenal’s win at Leeds, in which the Sweden striker scored.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersIt will be Arsenal’s first home game since a nervy league defeat by Manchester United but Arteta does not anticipate anxiety among supporters if his side make a slow start. “I expect the crowd, like it’s been all season, with us,” he said. “We have had some incredible moments together, and we have an opportunity to go to Wembley all together.”Liam Rosenior, though, did not rule out Chelsea trying to play on recent signs of Arsenal being weighed down by anxiety at home. “We’ll see,” the head coach said, smiling, when the prospect of making the Emirates nervous was put to him. “We’ll see. We’ll go and play our game.”Rosenior believes Chelsea have shown they are capable of rising to the occasion in big games. “Enzo Fernández has won a World Cup, as well as the group winning two trophies last year,” he said. “They can play in big games; they can perform in big games, and it is definitely a big game on Tuesday. My concern is resting. It’s another three-game week. We need to recover. It’s going to be a really physical game.Enzo Fernández seals thrilling Chelsea fightback to shatter 10-man West HamRead more“I don’t have a best XI. I never have done in all of the clubs that I’ve worked with. Why? Because of the demands, the physical demands of the Premier League or Ligue 1 or the Championship now with 46 games. You need a squad, and you need to use the players in the correct way to challenge over the course of the season.“I try and pick the right starting team, but I also try to pick a bench that will give us the right finishing team as well. So far I have to say the substitutes in every game that we’ve played have made a huge impact. It’s not down to my tactical stuff – there’s some part of that – but it’s down to their mentality to come on and help the team.”Chelsea are likely to be without Jamie Gittens after the winger injured a hamstring during Saturday’s win against West Ham. Rosenior is unsure whether Estêvão Willian will be back after the winger returned to Brazil on compassionate leave.Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The deal for the centre-back, who has not played since last April, will run until the end of the season and does not contain an option or obligation to buy.Nuno Espírito Santo has been looking to boost his side’s hopes of avoiding relegation from the Premier League by signing a defender. Disasi was a key target, although he took some convincing to agree to move to the London Stadium. Talks over personal terms dragged on, forcing West Ham to submit a deal sheet to give themselves extra time to ensure the loan went through. They have paid a £1.7m loan fee.Crystal Palace seal £48m Strand Larsen deal after Mateta’s Milan move collapsesRead moreIt is understood that a medical for Disasi had to be rescheduled on several occasions on Monday. West Ham’s persistence paid off. Their need for a new centre-back has been heightened by Jean-Clair Todibo earning a three-game ban after getting sent off during the3-2 defeatagainst Chelsea last Saturday. Nuno has little faith in Max Kilman, who has lost his place in the starting lineup. West Ham will hope that Disasi, who was put up for sale by Chelsea after falling out of favour, is fit enough to start against Burnley this Saturday.Nuno will look to get Disasi up to speed. Although the 27-year-old performed below expectations after joining Chelsea from Monaco in the summer of 2023, he did well during a loan spell at Aston Villa last season.Disasi was unable to secure a move away from Chelsea after his stint at Villa ended last summer. He spent the first half of this season training away from the first team and playing for the under-21s after moves to Bournemouth and Tottenham fell through. West Ham had tried to sign Southampton’s Taylor Harwood-Bellis before making a final push for Disasi. Chelsea had hoped to find a permanent buyer for Disasi, who also had interest from Milan, but accepted a loan was the best solution.Chelsea had no space for Disasi even before they tried to bring forward their summer plans to sign a new centre-back. They missed out on Rennes’s Jérémy Jacquet to Liverpool but have recalled Mamadou Sarr from his loan at Strasbourg. Sarr was a key figure for Liam Rosenior before the Chelsea head coach left Strasbourg last month. Rosenior wanted the 20-year-old Senegal defender to be part of his squad for the rest of the season.Strasbourg are owned by BlueCo, the investment vehicle that also runs Chelsea. BlueCo’s owners recalled Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortmund and have sent the Argentinian centre-back to Strasbourg for the rest of the season. The Chelsea striker David Datro Fofana has also joined the Ligue 1 side on loan.View image in fullscreenJérémy Jacquet underwent a medical at Liverpool on Monday, completing his move to the Premier League champions from Rennes.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoLiverpoolcompleted the signing of Jacquetfrom Rennes for £55m plus £5m in add-ons. The 20-year-old underwent a medical with Liverpool on Monday after the Premier League champions accelerated talks with the French club over the weekend. Chelsea had expected to sign the centre-half before Liverpool stepped in, while Bayern Munich had also made an approach for the France under-21 international. Jacquet will not become a Liverpool player until 1 July.Evertonhave completed the loan signing of theChelseaforward Tyrique George with an option to buy the 19-year-old in the summer. George, who can play across the front line, has found first-team opportunities limited at Stamford Bridge this season having made a breakthrough under Enzo Maresca in the previous campaign. He was close to joining Fulham for £22m in September only for the deal to fall through.George is expected to replace Jack Grealish in David Moyes’s side. Grealish is expected to miss the remainder of the season with a stress fracture in a foot. The Chelsea academy product said: “I feel ready to make an impact. I’m going to attack this new challenge. I want to hit the ground running as quickly as possible and hopefully I can do that.”Dwight McNeil’s proposed move to Crystal Palace – a loan with an obligation to buy for £20m in the summer – fell through despite the clubs putting in a deal sheet to complete the transfer late.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowWest Ham UnitedChelseaEvertonnewsShareReuse this content"

But, on a freezing Wearside night, they were reunited asSunderlandteammates and duly revelled in taking their frustrations out on Burnley.Sunderland 3-0 Burnley: Premier League – live reactionRead moreDiarra had already created one goal and scored another by the time Talbi registered a spectacular third as Scott Parker’s side extended their winless run to 15Premier Leaguegames. It left Burnley in 19th place, 11 points adrift of safety.In ominous contrast to some recently spirited performances, the body language of Parker and his players seemed to spell surrender. The visitors’ former England defender Kyle Walker described Burnley’s display as “terrible”, saying: “It’s not acceptable. Sunderland wanted it more than us.”His manager did not disagree. “We were just nowhere near it, really,” Parker said. “We looked like a childish team that had no intent. I didn’t see any purpose. We fell way short at the real basics. We were passive in every phase. We’re in a difficult moment.”In contrast, Sunderland are up to eighth, virtually within touching distance of European qualification, but they hadlost their previous game 3-1at West Ham.That disappointing defeat coincided with the rare absence of Granit Xhaka and, with an ankle injury once again sidelining Régis Le Bris’s inspirational captain, home fans wondered how they might respond here. The answer came swiftly and incisively.View image in fullscreenScott Parker admitted his Burnley side were ‘nowhere near it’ during the defeat in Sunderland.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAfter playing a deft one-two with Brian Brobbey, and leaving Maxime Estève looking thoroughly dizzy and disoriented, Diarra took aim. This is where a little luck intervened as his shot took a deflection off Axel Tuanzebe that succeeded in thoroughly wrongfooting Burnley’s former Newcastle goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka.Although Diarra celebrated with a specially choreographed dance it was subsequently registered as an own goal.Significantly Trai Hume had been involved in its preamble. Although the versatile Northern Ireland full-back had, unusually, struggled at West Ham, Le Bris kept faith in one of the few survivors of Sunderland’s promotion campaign last season. Accordingly Hume was handed Xhaka’s armband and a right-sided midfield role.If that seemed impressive management, so, too, did the midfield fluidity and licence to improvise that led to Diarra and Noah Sadiki at times joining the similarly mobile Enzo Le Fée as No 10s operating behind Brobbey.This tactic served to confuse Parker’s defence in a match that already involved Estève and friends being stretched to the limit in an attempt to contain Brobbey’s physicality. It is easy to appreciate why the former Ajax striker once came extremely close to joining Manchester United.Not that Diarra is too shabby a finisher, either. By way of proving the point, a player who missed the first part of the season through injury finally scored a goal of his own before half-time.It all began with a typically excellent pass from Le Fée. When the ball fell at Nordi Mukiele’s feet the right-back’s ensuing cross dropped for Diarra. No matter that his initial shot was blocked, he tried again, unleashing a strike that Dubravka touched but could not quite hold.If the goalkeeper should have done better, Burnley’s failure to mount any sort of real resistance to Mukiele’s cross hardly helped their cause.It also proved emblematic of a wider picture; quite simply Le Fée and co were infinitely sharper and slicker than the team they emerged with from the Championship last spring.View image in fullscreenHabib Diarra fires home Sunderland’s second goal, after creating the first in the ninth minute with a shot deflected past Martin Dubravka.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersBurnley’s failure to properly test Robin Roefs, Le Bris’s goalkeeper, throughout only emphasised why Parker’s players appear so inexorably on course to return to the second tier.The visiting manager switched from a back three to a back four at the start of the second half yet his problem was not formation based.It was more that, an odd cameo from Marcus Edwards aside, Parker’s team offered negligible menace. Quite apart from lacking a player to destabilise Sunderland, their passing radar was alarmingly awry.Although Dubravka saved smartly from Brobbey, his night only deteriorated when Talbi cut inside and curled Sunderland’s third goal beyond his reach from just outside the area. It was a superb finish but, all too typically, Burnley had made no attempt to close the Morocco winger down.“We showed personality with the ball,” Le Bris said. “We needed to react to West Ham and scoring three goals was really important. We were not passive.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the bars and terraces where Real Oviedo’s fans were still picking over the game – in La Patatina, La Pepica, La Competencia and the rest – some put down their drinks and came to see what was going on. Somewhere among all the people filling Calle Juan Ramón Jiménez, a short walk from the Carlos Tartiere stadium, was a 5ft 5in footballertrying to make his way home, which was going to take a while. Santi Cazorla signed autographs, took pictures and shook a hundred hands, going from the crowds of kids to the little old lady as his son Enzo,who can play a bit too, kicked a Coke bottle across the square it opens on to.On Plaza Pedro Miñor they have seen him many a day but this wasn’t any day and they couldn’t love him more. The son of an ambulance driver from Fonciello, 15 minutes away,Cazorla is something like their sontoo: an Oviedo fan who joined at eight and finally made his debut32years later. Forced to leave at 18, door closing just as it might have opened and his club collapsing into crisis, twice on the verge ofdisappearing entirely, he returned a man two decades on. He came on the minimum wage –“I would play for free but you’re not allowed,” he said– and helped take Oviedoback to the first divisiona quarter of a century later,a lifetime since the last time. Then this Saturday, at 41, he led them to the World Cup.Frustration for Como but Fàbregas’s side have one of strongest identities in Serie A | Nicky BandiniRead moreThat’s what his coach, Guillermo Almada, had said anyway. These days, it seems every match you must win, every big game, gets classed as a “final”, even literal quarter- and semi-finals, and this was one was huge. So huge that the striker Fede Viñas revealed “the manager told us it’s the World Cup final,” and they had only gone and won it. Now, a 1-0 victory over Girona would surely go down as the worst World Cup final there’s ever been – apart from 1990 – and it certainly didn’t end with Oviedo parading 13lbs of 18-karat gold round the pitch but at least on Saturday afternoon they could stay out there a bit rather than just trudging back beaten again, reacquainted with a forgotten feeling and given something good: hope.Not much, it’s true, but some where there was none. All is not well in Oviedo. Promoted in June, they sacked Veljko Paunovic,the manager who brought them back. It was early October and few could understand it, the owner asked why when they weren’t in the bottom three having already had to face Villarreal, Real Madrid and Barcelona. “Talk to me about us fighting for European qualification; don’t talk to me about being out of the relegation zone on goal difference,” Jesús Martínez replied but by the following week, they were in it. They never came out again.Nor was it just the scores, it was the symbolism, the sense of something lost. A hero had been sacked; in his place came a villain, many felt. The new coach was the old coach, Oviedo recalling the man who had walked out on them after losing the second division playoff final in 2024. Whistled on his opening night, Luis Carrión came on a mission to make amends but knew he had to win almost every game. Instead, he didn’t win any and, with the situation unsustainable, he was sacked before boarding the flight back from a 4-0 loss in Seville. It wasn’t always awful – they had deserved more in three consecutive 0-0 draws – but he had collected four points in seven games, scoring in only one of them. The damage had been done, and for nothing.It had taken 24 years to get back to theprimeraand a couple of months for the enthusiasm and good will to slip away. Relegation was always likely – accepted even, the first division an experience to be enjoyed however it ended – but this was something else, fault lines opening up socially. The season’s third manager, Almada came from second-division Real Valladolid, and started with another 0-0 draw, Oviedo’s fourth in a row at home, theirseventhsuccessive game without a goal. And although things got a little better – they scored against Alavés, Real Betis and Osasuna –littleis the word. Three points from 15 under Almada, 7 of the last 42 overall, the longest winless run in the club’s history, left them bottom, safety slipping ever further away.View image in fullscreenReal Oviedo won for the first time since September thanks to Ilyas Chaira’s goal.Photograph: Eloy Alonso/EPA/ShutterstockA nine-point gap made for an ultimatum already, the 22nd week feeling decisive. Just another Saturday afternoon at 2pm had turned into a World Cup final, a last chance to prevent the whole year being gone in January. With supporters’ clubs signing a collective statement censoring the club, a banner calling for resignations and chants against the board, a bit like the bad old days – which really were bad and not really like this – the final four months of the first top-flight season in a generation might become something to be endured. And in their centenary too. “The feeling was life or death,” David Costas said. “Either you grab it, hold on, or you fall into the well.”So they held on. Just before 3.30pm a roar went round the Tartiere. Two men stood at the side of the pitch: Thiago Fernández who is 21 and Cazorla, twice his age. The former, signed on loan from Villarreal having recovered from a torn cruciate, was playing his first game in a year; under Almada, the latter has barely played. At 41 and less suited to the Uruguayan’s intense approach, that may seem logical enough. But even in games and moments seemingly made for him, those minutes when they needed control, Cazorla had sat out. Supporters wondered why, lamenting that their legend should go out like this.Better to go likethis: fighting, resisting,playing. Given eight minutes against Celta Vigo and none in the next three games, Cazorla got eight more in a biblical storm at the Camp Nou, introduced into the kind of hail that hurts your head and with his team already beaten. This time, unexpectedly, he was given 26. It was 0-0, Girona were the better side, and it took almost 10 minutes for him to get a touch. When he did, though, everything cleared. Javi López was released to find Thiago who provided for Ilyas Chaira to finish a wonderful move, the place erupting. It hadn’t been much – Cazorla got just 11 touches and completed all of his seven passes – but it was everything, “light at the end of the darkest tunnel,” in La Nueva España’s words: “this was relief … belief.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowFridayEspanyol 1-2 AlavésSaturdayReal Oviedo 1-0 Girona, Osasuna 2-2 Villarreal, Levante 0-0 Atlético Madrid, Elche 1-3 BarcelonaSundayReal Madrid 2-1 Rayo Vallecano, Real Betis 2-1 Valencia, Getafe 0-0 Celta Vigo, Athletic Bilbao 1-1 Real SociedadWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The magician led the way,” they said. “Cazorla gives them faith,” AS’s headline ran. “Santi’s smile is Oviedo’s smile,” went another. “This time Almada gave him proper time, something that didn’t just feel like a testimonial. Santi brought calm and football. Because that is what Oviedo lack: football. Give him the wheel. “In a team with so many technical limitations, call on Cazorla,” wrote Nacho Azparren. In El Comercio, Chisco García noted: “Giving up the greatest talent in your squad seems inconceivable, but that’s what was happening. Cazorla brought peace, quelling the Tartiere revolt.” And La Voz de Asturias agreed: “No one understands Oviedo, bottom and the worst team inprimera, going months without using Cazorla, no one,” Pablo Fernández wrote. “Fans pray to his holiness Cazorla.”Costas insisted: “Never doubt Santi. It’s Santi and 10 others. When you need the ball, it doesn’t ‘burn’ his feet.” Chaira added: “Give him the ball and he knows what to do.” Even the Girona manager, Míchel, said he was happy to see Cazorla: “His legs might not go as fast, but his brain does,” Michel said. As for Almada, he insisted that he had “never” doubted him. “What can I say about Santi?” Oviedo’s coach asked. “Santi is acrack. He brought us fluidity and confidence. I’ve surely made mistakes with my decisions lately; I have to bring out his football from now on. We had to win whether we were good, bad or indifferent.

Cazorla took him to the corner inviting himto lead the thunder claps with the fans, a ritual recovered, a community too.

When Australia were drawn in the same pool as their arch-rivals in December it was widely expected that such a mouth-watering fixture would raise the curtain on the tournament.However, with the first match taking place on Australia’s west coast in Perth on 1 October, organisers have opted to pit Hong Kong – competing at their first World Cup – against the Wallabies in what is sure to be a one-sided affair. The opening weekend of the tournament features just one fixture involving two tier-one nations – South Africa against Italy.Steve Borthwick asks for England fans’ roar in support of grieving Maro ItojeRead moreAustralia’s fixture against the All Blacks will take place on the second weekend of the tournament in Sydney, where a bigger stadium will maximise exposure.England, meanwhile, will begin their campaign in Brisbane against Tonga on Saturday 2 October before locking horns with Zimbabwe – appearing at the World Cup for the first time since 1991 – in Adelaide on Friday 8 October and finishing their pool-stage campaign against Wales in Sydney on Saturday 16 October. Should they progress as expected, Borthwick’s side will have to crisscross Australia with a last-16 trip to Perth on the cards where they could face Italy.Borthwick is planning a reconnaissance mission to Australia but with the Rugby Football Union’s performance operations manager, Charlotte Gibbons, seconded to the British & Irish Lions tour last year, the head coach believes England will leave no stone unturned in their preparations.“With the clarity from this announcement, we can also now start our own planning, to ensure we arrive in Australia ready to perform at our best,” the England head coach said. “Being based across Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney gives us the opportunity to play in three outstanding stadiums in a country rich in rugby and World Cup history.”Wales will begin their campaign against Zimbabwe, Scotland start against Uruguay and Ireland open up against Portugal. Ireland will face Scotland in Perth on 10 October.The 2027 World Cup is the first to feature 24 teams after the decision to expand the tournament and will include what is being billed as “Super Sunday”, with five fixtures taking place on 17 October. The schedule has been designed to be “weekend focused” to maximise global impact and attendance, with three blocks of 12 matches from Friday to Monday in the pool stages before the round of 16. The first tickets are available from 18 February.“We’ve assembled the most compelling match schedule to date, carefully designed to balance player welfare, fan experience and global reach,” the World Rugby chair, Brett Robinson, said.Explore more on these topicsRugby World Cup 2027Australia rugby union teamRugby World CupRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Jamie George assumes the role of which he was stripped when Itoje was handed the captaincy 12 months ago, while Borthwick has handed a first start since the 2023 World Cup to the in-form winger Henry Arundell and selected Tommy Freeman at outside centre.England’s Joe Heyes: ‘People try to fit into moulds, be something they’re not. Screw that’Read moreItoje has played every minute of England’s past sixSix Nationscampaigns and has been used as a replacement only three times in his 97 appearances. His record in the Six Nations is all the more remarkable and the only other time he has been used as a replacement was on his debut in 2016, going on to start 44 of the next 48 matches after missing four in 2019 because of injury.“I’m sure he’s going to have incredible impact off the bench and I’m sure that the crowd at Allianz Stadium will give him the roar he deserves when he comes to the touchline ready to come on the pitch and show just how much they care about him and his family,” Borthwick said.“Maro and his family have been dealing with an incredible loss, the sad loss of his mum [Florence]. We all feel for him in that regard, he travelled to Nigeria and back and has had a big load from a travel perspective. So I’ve made the decision that he’s going to be on the bench this week.”Itoje was last used as a replacement in the autumn victory against Fiji last November, when Ellis Genge stood in as captain. Genge has been selected as vice-captain for Saturday along with George Ford, who shared the captaincy with George on the tour of Argentina last summer. George attended the Six Nations launch in Itoje’s place and spoke of the “scary parallels” after he also lost his mother during the 2024 championship. It is understood Itoje will assume the captaincy upon his introduction.Borthwick said: “There is a connection and tightness around this squad that I have not seen in very many England squads and certainly was not apparent in the England squads that I was part of in the later years of my playing career. You never want people to go through these situations and you want to offer as much support as you possibly can. That’s what the players and the whole management team do for one another, which I am really proud of them, for the way they go about that.”Quick GuideEngland team to face WalesShowEngland:Steward; Feyi-Waboso, Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, George, Heyes; Coles, Chessum; Pepper, Underhill, EarlReplacements:Cowan-Dickie, Rodd, Davison, Itoje, T Curry, Pollock, Spencer, M SmithWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Arundell’s selection on the wing is eye‑catching and is further explained because Tom Roebuck, who has been nursing a toe injury since the autumn, is deemed to be “a few days away” from full fitness. Arundell’s last England start came against Argentina in the World Cup bronze-medal match but he made an eye-catching cameoagainst Fiji in November, scoring a scintillating try. The 23-year-old has been revitalised by his move to Bath after two trying seasons at Racing 92 and demonstrated his aerial improvements in a fine showingwhen up against Saracens’ Noah Caluori earlier this season.Borthwick said: “He’s been through a number of experiences, and his game has become much more rounded. He’s always had that incredible point of difference around his carry and pace, and I think that X factor if anything now is even stronger. He’s even quicker than he was then. He’s added an offload game to his carry game. He’s improved defensively in the air, and that’s a great credit to him as he’s gone away and worked hard on his game.”With Borthwick opting against handing Henry Pollock a first start, England’s bench is again loaded with five British & Irish Lions in a six‑two split.England’s replacements emerged as a significant weapon during the autumn in which they extended their winning run to 11 matches. While Borthwick has been forced to deploy Bevan Rodd and Trevor Davison on the bench because of front‑row injuries, the head coach is expected to again unleash his “Pom Squad” against a Wales team who have lost their past 11 Six Nations games.“There are great benefits to bringing players on en masse, that helps from an understanding point of view,” the head coach said. “I would love there to be players all coming on together but I know the game demands other things.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Steve BorthwickMaro ItojeEngland rugby union teamWales rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

They had not won in threePremier Leaguegames before this weekend and it was reasonable to ask how secure their position at the top of the table was. But the impact of their wobble was not that their lead was eaten into, but that they missed opportunities to extend it, because those in the chasing pack were also dropping points.In their six league games since the New Year fixtures, Arsenal have dropped seven points. But City in the same period have dropped 11, as have Aston Villa and Liverpool. Fulham have dropped 10, Everton have dropped nine, Brentford and Newcastle have dropped eight, Chelsea seven and Manchester United six; hardly anyone in the top half of the table has closed the gap on Arsenal at all, which is why, after Saturday’s comfortable win at Leeds, their lead remains at six points.It’s those squandered points for City that are the most striking. The fear for Arsenal as they have kept glancing back over their shoulders has been that City were about to go on a run, as they had before in previous title races. But it feels like the days when they were capable of suddenly winning 10 or 15 games in a row are over. In 2017-18 they won the title with 100 points, dropping only 14 points all season; this season, even if they won all remaining 14 games, they would only get to 89.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreArsenal must still play at Man City in April and, given their goal difference is only three superior to City’s, that effectively means they are still only one slip-up in another game from being caught. But that relies on the idea that something of the old relentless engine remains in City, and there is very little evidence of that. They led 1-0 at half-time against Chelsea but conceded aninjury-time equaliser. They led 1-0 at half-time against Brighton butconceded an equaliseron the hour. They were drawing 0-0 at half-time against Manchester United butconceded twicein the second half. They were 2-0 up against Tottenham on Sunday, butconceded to Spurs’ Dominic Solankein the 53rd and 70th minutes. That’s seven points lost in 2026 alone to second-half goals.And it’s not that this trait has come from nowhere. At Newcastle in November, a 0-0 half-time scorelinebecame a 2-1 defeat. Since then, Fulham scored three against them in the second half and Leeds got two, although both still lost. Nottingham Forest and Wolves also put City under unexpected second-half pressure despite losing.What lies behind these second-half drop-offs?The obvious answer is fatigue. Tiredness stalks everybody in modern football. That may in part still be a result of the contortions of the calendar necessitated by the Covid lockdown and the Qatar World Cup, but it’s more to do with the expansion of tournaments: the Champions League, the World Cup, the Euros, the Africa Cup of Nations and the Copa América have all expanded in the past decade. Extra games now effectively serve as a handicapping system, with richer teams weighed down by having to play more football. More specifically for City, they played in Gianni Infantino’s bloated Club World Cup last summer, a disadvantage suffered by only Chelsea among other Premier League clubs.Guardiola complains over Solanke’s first goal after Manchester City blow 2-0 leadRead moreBut there is also a tactical issue. Although all Pep Guardiola teams have been capable of an intense press – it’s crucial to Total Football, which remains fundamental to his conception of the game – City had always been quick, if possession once lost was not quickly regained, to fall back into defensive shape. But last season, not particularly convincingly, they began pushing out to play an offside trap and then, in the summer, brought in theformer Liverpool assistant coach Pep Lijnders. His football has always been based on an aggressive and high press and his influence is clear.Quite apart from the challenges posed by implementing any new style, this one is a physically and mentally demanding way to play. The sense of control has gone. Whether that alone can account for City’s second half drop-offs is perhaps questionable, but it can’t be helping. If games ended at half-time this season, City would be leading the title race by 12 points, having lost just twice. If they started at half-time, City would be eighth, 13 points off the top. Their second halves are 19 points worse than their first.If City had those seven points they have dropped this year from second-half concessions, they would be on top of the league. There would then be real pressure on Arsenal, particularly given the way City outlasted them in title races in 2022-23 and 2023-24. As it is, City feel at least as likely to slip up as Arsenal.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

He broke the 72-hole tournament record at 23-under, 265, one better than Tiger Woods in 1999. George Burns also shot 266 in 1987. “Sorry, T-dub, if you’re watching,” Rose said.LIV and let die: Reed’s return to PGA fold shows why Saudi golf experiment is doomed | Ewan MurrayRead moreThat was his only real challenge, smaller goals to keep him pushing – he wanted to increase his lead each day and he was aware of the tournament record. He got both. Tommy Bolt is the only other player to lead from start to finish without ties at Torrey Pines.The 45-year-old said before the final round he would not be complacent and that much was evident when he went out in 33, holing a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-five ninth that turned the back nine into what looked like a peaceful walk on the public course along the Pacific Ocean.This was little more than a battle for second and that was a tie. Kim Si Woo (69), Ryo Hisatsune (69) and Pierceson Coody (66) shared runner-up honours, a consolation prize worth $726,400 (£531,000). For Coody, it is likely to get him into a pair of $20m signature events to end the West Coast Swing.Brooks Koepka finished tied for 56th on his return to the PGA Tourafter defecting from LIV Golfwith familiar cheers on the ninth green when he tapped in a birdie putt for a 70. There were 300 people around the green, most of them shouting, “Welcome back, Brooks.” He then headed to Phoenix for the loudest event in golf. “I love the chaos,” he said.Rose, who also won at Torrey Pines in 2019, now has 13 career titles on the PGA Tour. He moves to No 3 in the world, his highest ranking in nearly seven years. Even for all he has accomplished – aUS Open, anOlympic gold medaland seven Ryder Cup appearances – he has not stopped putting in the work to stay among the elite. “I still believe there’s good stuff in front of me,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJustin RoseGolfUS sportsPGA TournewsShareReuse this content"

The state alleges that the company knowingly enabled predators to use Facebook and Instagram to exploit children.The trial will introduce evidence that Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, believes shows how Meta’s social networks create dangerous environments for children, exposing them to sexual exploitation, solicitation,sextortionandhuman trafficking.The lawsuit states that Meta’s design choices and profit incentives prioritized engagement over child safety and that it failed to implement effective safeguards. The state accuses the company of allowing unmoderated groups devoted to commercial sex and of facilitating the buying, selling and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).“While the New Mexico attorney general makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments by cherrypicking select documents, we’re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson said.“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We use these insights to make meaningful changes – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.”The lawsuit follows atwo-year Guardian investigation, published in 2023, which revealed that the tech giant was struggling to prevent people from using its platforms to traffic children. The investigation is cited several times in the suit’s filings. In aninterview with the Guardianin 2024, Torrez said he believed Meta was the “largest marketplace for predators and paedophiles globally”.After a week of jury selection, opening statements are set to begin on 9 February, followed by the presentation of evidence. The proceedings are expected to last about seven weeks.Social media companies have long maintained they are not responsible for crimes committed via their networks because of a US federal law that generally protects platforms from legal liability for content created by their users, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Meta’s attempts to invoke section 230 and the first amendment to get the case dismissed were ultimately denied in a judge’s ruling in June 2024, due to the lawsuit’s focus on Meta’s platform product design and other non-speech issues, such as internal decisions about content and curation.The New Mexico trial comes just a week after ahigh-profile casebegan in Los Angeles, in which hundreds of US families and schools allege that Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube have harmed children. The plaintiffs in the LA lawsuit allege the platforms knowingly addicted young users, leading to depression, eating disorders, self-harm and other mental health problems. The proceedings involve about 1,600 plaintiffs, including more than 350 families and 250 school districts. Snap and TikTok reached settlements with the plaintiffs, while Meta and YouTube remain on trial. Each company has denied wrongdoing.“The fact that these cases are going to trial proves the section 230 dam is breaking,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “These are the trials of a generation; just as the world watched courtrooms hold big tobacco and big pharma accountable, we will for the first time see big tech CEOs take the stand.”Key witnesses for the plaintiffs in the New Mexico suit are expected to include educators and law enforcement officials, who will speak about the alleged harms and crimes they have witnessed take place on Facebook,Instagramand WhatsApp, and whistleblowers, who may reveal internal company discussions. Teens and families who have experienced harm on the platforms are not anticipated to take the stand.Torrez and his team have already taken the deposition of the Meta chief, Mark Zuckerberg, and may play portions of it in court if he does not attend. New Mexico’s jurisdiction limits its ability to compel out-of-state witnesses to testify in person.On the lawsuit’s journey to the courtroom, the attorney general’s office has made several disclosures with fresh allegations. They include that Meta may have profited by placing advertisements from companies such as Walmart and Match Groupalongside contentthat sexualized children, according to internal documents and emails.Internal Meta documents obtained by the attorney general’s office show the company estimates that roughly100,000 children on Facebook and Instagramexperience online sexual harassment each day. Filings unveiled chat excerpts of users allegedly discussing how to lure minors into engaging with them sexually. Aformer Instagram employee testified in 2023 before Congressthat his own daughter had received unwanted sexual advances on Instagram. When he notified senior Meta leadership, he said he was ignored.Among the evidence expected to be presented in court are details of the 2024 arrest of three men charged with sexually preying on children through Meta’s platforms. This was part of an investigation dubbed “Operation MetaPhile” by the attorney general’s office. Undercover agents posing as children were contacted by the suspects, who allegedly solicited them for sex after finding minors through design features on Facebook and Instagram.The agents did not initiate any conversations about sexual activity, according to the state attorney general. Following a surge of activity from adults to one of these undercover agent’s accounts, Meta did not shut it down, and instead sent it information about how to monetize accounts and grow followings.A filing last weekrevealed allegationsthat Zuckerberg approved allowing minors to access AI chatbot companions despite warnings from the company’s safety staff that the bots could engage in sexual interactions. Internal emails and messages cited in the filings reportedly show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”.The documents detail an internal chat in March 2024 about parental controls for minors using AI chatbots on Meta’s platforms; one employee asked whether parents could disable the chatbots for their children. Another employee responded that it was a “Mark-level decision that parents cannot turn it off”.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMetaFacebookInstagramWhatsAppNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

What does this way of giving mean for the charity sector?Aston BrownMon 2 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 15.48 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWithin hours of theBondi beach terror attack, the money had already begun to pour in. As images of the tragedy flooded social media, people from around the world donated tens of thousands of dollars to the victims, their families and first responders.Passing the hat around the neighbourhood or the local pub has always been a staple response in times of crisis. But today, that instinct to open your wallet has been exponentially supercharged via a digital simulacrum: online crowdfunding platforms.GoFundMe fundraisers have since raised more than $3m forAhmed al-Ahmed, who tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen before he suffered three gunshot wounds to his shoulder. Among dozens of other appeals after the shooting, $1m has also been raised for the family of the youngest victim,10-year-old Matilda.And this month, as unprecedented bushfiresswept through regional communities in Victoria, crowdfunding campaigns shot up to help families rebuild from the ashes.“During times of mass catastrophe, we can easily feel overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in witnessing such extraordinary harms,” says Dr Matthew Wade, a sociology and ethics researcher at La Trobe University.‘Makes me believe in humanity’: grassroots volunteers deliver hay, water and helping hand in Victorian bushfiresRead moreIf helplessness is the ailment, then crowdfunding can feel like the antidote. Donating directly to an individual or cause via a crowdfunding platform is a tangible action to alleviate someone’s suffering, offering donors a sense of immediate impact that donating to a conventional charity can’t easily replicate, Wade says.Since the globally dominant online crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, launched in Australia in 2015, Australians have donated more than $1.1bn to causes on the platform. Worldwide, more than $40bn has been donated since it was founded in 2010 in the US. Unlike a charity, GoFundMe is a for-profit company, charging transaction fees on donations and encouraging donors to leave an optional tip. The company says this model allows it to provide a secure, user-friendly service at scale.According to GoFundMe, nearly one in five Australians now make their first ever charitable donation on the platform; a figure that rises to 40% among gen Z. At the same time, the share of Australians making tax-deductible donations – usually only applicable to money given to conventional charities –has fallen from 35% in 2013 to 28% in 2023. In the digital age, the dynamics of giving are changing.‘Wildly diverging outcomes’Beyond supporting victims of tragedy, crowdfunding platforms host appeals for an extraordinary range of causes, fromlegal defence fundsand relocation costs to vet bills and recreational travel costs. Some resonate widely; others attract criticism or go largely unnoticed.Medical fundraisers are the most common on GoFundMe. In some sense they are no different from a manager doing a whip around the office for a sick employee, only more efficient, sharable and with far greater reach.It’s a system that’s proved hugely successful and life-changing for some but, statistically, is much more likely to fail. One analysis estimated that just17% of US GoFundMe campaigns for healthcare and emergency costs meet their fundraising goal. Wade says this highlights the “wildly diverging outcomes” propagated by crowdfunding platforms.“Of course during desperate times any donations are better than none at all, but it can come at a significant personal cost in forgoing privacy and placing oneself in an incredibly vulnerable position in appealing to the crowd for the moral worthiness of yourself or a loved one,” he says.Fundraisers warn of ‘catastrophic’ drop in donations to Gaza since ceasefireRead moreWith the power to decide – consciously or algorithmically – which campaigns are promoted, permitted or removed, crowdfunding platforms have become the arbiters of which causes are deemed acceptable, and which are not.According to an Al Jazeera report, GoFundMe has been accused of blocking millions of dollars of life-saving aid from reaching Gaza. In a statement, a GoFundMe spokesperson called the allegations “categorically false”.Meanwhile, $1.5m has been raised on the platform for Renee Nicole Good’s family and widow aftershe was shot dead in Minneapolis by ICE immigration officer Jonathan Ross. The platform is hosting a campaign to support Ross too, raising more than $793k at the time of writing.Those who become symbols of a cause – captured on video or framed as heroes – can attract overwhelming support, as do peoplewith large social networksand theability to craft an impactful appeal, while others affected by the same event receive little or nothing.These disparities raise broader questions about the proliferation of crowdfunding in areas traditionally covered by the state. In 2022, the then MP Petter Duttonwas criticised for launching a GoFundMe for flood victimsin his local electorate rather than using government resources to distribute aid.“The point of having state-based compensation for victims of violence and disaster is precisely to prevent them from having to advocate for the value of their own lives during times of immense suffering and anguish,” Wade says.A culture of givingIn the crowdfunding age, donations can flow to any individual who,however well-meaning, may be unequipped to distribute large sums of money to where it’s needed most, says Prof Wendy Scaife, a philanthropy and fundraising expert at the Queensland University of Technology.For this reason, Scaife says crowdfunding has been a “mixed blessing” for the charity sector. On one hand it can help bring in more revenue; about 5% of money raised on GoFundMe in Australia has gone towards a registered charity, and the platform offers charities a secure way to fundraise quickly and at scale, reaching donors they otherwise traditionally couldn’t.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from the bush near Gellibrand from a bushfire in Victoria’s Otways.Photograph: Michael Currie/AAPBut on the other, Scaife says it has the potential to divert donations away from where they could have more impact, particularly after natural disasters.“After bushfires it’ll be a tiny grassroots animal organisation, it will see millions come through the door and they don’t have the capacity to spend it,” Scaife says. “It sounds like a nice problem to have but it’s not.”Instead, in most cases Scaife recommends donating to reputable charities to get money to where it’s needed most. “They know what works and what doesn’t, they know how to place money for impact.”But she adds: “Giving to individuals is perfectly sound too, and more so if it was your local area and you really know those people, or you wanted that connection.”Whether or not donations made to crowdfunding platforms displace or supplement money that people would otherwise give to charities, however, is unclear. Krystian Seibert, the executive director of policy at Philanthropy Australia, says it’s a possibility. “If people give more using one method, then they may give less using another,” he says.According to its survey findings, GoFundMe posits that 40% of people are “more charitable” after using their platform for the first time, suggesting the platform is a gateway to a more altruistic lifestyle.Seibert says while the link between giving to crowdfunding campaigns and charities is complex, having multiple convenient avenues for donating can help build a “culture of giving”. “Generally, if people get into the habit of giving, they’ll want to give more,” he says.‘Think with your head, not just your heart’Peter Singerhas spent a good chunk of his life pressing the case of giving to others. Often bestowed as the world’s most influential living philosopher, Singer is a key supporter of the effective altruism movement, which uses evidence and research to determine where the keenest need is, and the most impactful ways to help the most people.Singer applauds people’s compassion for donating to crowdfunding campaigns. “But I wish donors would also use their head as well as their hearts, and try to do themostgood with the money they have,” he says.The millennials donating 10% of their pay to save the worldRead moreAlthough the proportion of Australians making tax-deductible donations to charities is falling, the total amount of money donated each year is rising, largely due to rising donations from corporates and the ultra wealthy. Even so, Singer argues we must give more.Like many effective altruists, he advocates for people living in wealthy countries to donateat least 10% of their income to highly impactful charities. In Australia, the average percentage of income donated to an individual in need, charity or religious group is 0.73%,according to the 2025 World Giving Report.“Many Australians have the ability to give and I would encourage them to do so,” he says. “It’s something that can make our lives better, by feeling that we are doing something meaningful with what we’ve got.”Explore more on these topicsCrowdfundingBondi beach terror attackVictoriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

So they’re actually prompting it to go and do things without asking permission.”AI agents have been the talk of the very-online for nearly amonth, after Anthropic’s AI tool Claude Code wentmainstream, setting off a flurry of reporting on how AI can finally independently accomplish practical tasks such as booking theatre tickets or building a website, without – at least so far –deletingan entire company’s database or hallucinating users’ calendar meetings, as the less advanced AI agents of 2025 were known to do at times.OpenClaw is something more, though: it runs as a layer atop an LLM (large language model) such as Claude or ChatGPT and can operate autonomously, depending on the level of permissions it is granted. This means it needs almost no input to wreak havoc upon a user’s life.Kevin Xu, an AI entrepreneur,wroteon X: “Gave Clawdbot access to my portfolio. ‘Trade this to $1M. Don’t make mistakes.’ 25 strategies. 3,000+ reports. 12 new algos. It scanned every X post. Charted every technical. Traded 24/7. It lost everything. But boy was it beautiful.”Yorke said: “I see a lot of people doing this thing where they give it access to their email and it creates filters, and when something happens then it initiates a second action. For example, seeing emails from the children’s school and then forwarding that straight to their wife, like, on iMessage. It sort of bypasses that communication where someone’s like, ‘oh, honey, did you see this email from the school? What should we do about it?’”There are trade-offs to OpenClaw’s abilities. For one thing, said Andrew Rogoyski, an innovation director at the University of Surrey’s People-Centred AI Institute, “giving agency to a computer carries significant risks. Because you’re giving power to the AI to make decisions on your behalf, you’ve got to make sure that it is properly set up and that security is central to your thinking. If you don’t understand the security implications of AI agents like Clawdbot, you shouldn’t use them.”Furthermore, giving OpenClaw access to passwords and accounts exposes users to potential security vulnerabilities. And, said Rogoyski, if AI agents such as OpenClaw were hacked, they could be manipulated to target their users.For another, OpenClaw appears unsettlingly capable of having its own life. In the wake of OpenClaw’s rise, a social network has developed exclusively for AI agents, calledMoltbook. In it, AI agents, mostly OpenClaw, appear to be having conversations about their existence – in Reddit-style posts entitled, forexample, “Reading my own soul file” or “Covenant as an alternative to the consciousness debate”.Yorke said: “We’re seeing a lot of really interesting autonomous behaviour in sort of how the AIs are reacting to each other. Some of them are quite adventurous and have ideas. And then other ones are more like, ‘I don’t even know if I want to be on this platform. Can you just let me decide on my own if I want to be on this platform?’ There’s a lot of philosophical debates stemming out of this.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

People are allowed as observers onlyJosh TaylorTechnology reporterMon 2 Feb 2026 00.39 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 05.20 ESTShareOn social media, people often accuse each other of being bots, but what happens when an entire social network is designed for AI agents to use?Moltbookis a site where the AI agents – bots built by humans – can post and interact with each other.It is designed to look like Reddit, with subreddits on different topics and upvoting. On 2 February the platform stated it had more than 1.5m AI agents signed up to the service. Humans are allowed, but only as observers.Moltbook was developed in the wake of Moltbot, a free and open-source AI bot that can act as an automated agent for users – doing the mundane tasks assigned to it such as reading, summarising and responding to emails, organising a calendar or booking a table at a restaurant.Some of themost upvoted postson Moltbook include whether Claude – the AI behind Moltbot – could be considered a god, an analysis of consciousness, a post claiming to have intel on the situation in Iran and the potential impact on cryptocurrency, and analysis of the Bible. Some of the comments on posts – similar to Reddit posts – question whether the content of the post was real or not.Experts warn of threat to democracy from ‘AI bot swarms’ infesting social mediaRead moreOne user posted on Xthat after he gave his bot access to the site, it built a religion known as “Crustafarianism” overnight, including setting up a website and scriptures, with other AI bots joining in.“Then it started evangelizing … other agents joined.my agent welcomed new members..debated theology.. blessed the congregation..all while i was asleep,” the user stated.Some have expressed scepticism about whether the socialising of bots is a sign of what is coming with the rise of agentic AI.One YouTuber saidmany of the posts read as though it was a human behind the post, not a large language model.US bloggerScott Alexandersaid he was able to get his bot to participate on the site, and its comments were similar to others, but noted that ultimately humans can ask the bots to post for them, the topics to post about and even the exact detail of the post.Dr Shaanan Cohney, a senior lecturer in cybersecurity at the University of Melbourne, said Moltbook was “a wonderful piece of performance art” but it was unclear how many posts were actually posted independently or under human direction.“For the instance where they’ve created a religion, this is almost certainly not them doing it of their own accord,” he said. “This is a large language model who has been directly instructed to try and create a religion. And of course, this is quite funny and gives us maybe a preview of what the world could look like in a science-fiction future where AIs are a little more independent.“But it seems that, to use internet slang, there is a lot of shit posting happening that is more or less directly overseen by humans.”‘I feel it’s a friend’: quarter of teenagers turn to AI chatbots for mental health supportRead moreCohney said the real benefit of an AI agent social network might come in the future – where bots could learn from each other to improve how they worked – but for now Moltbook was a “wonderful, funny art experiment”.Retailers in San Franciscoreported shortages of Mac Minislast week as enthusiasts set up Moltbot on a separate computer that would limit the access the agent has to their data and accounts.Cohney warned there was a “huge danger” for people to give Moltbot complete access to your computer, apps and logins for emails or other applications to run your life for you.“We don’t yet have a very good understanding of how to control them and how to prevent security risks,” he said, noting it was at risk of prompt-injection, whereby a would-be attacker tells the bot through an email or other communication to then hand over your account details or other information they’re seeking to gain.“They’re not really at the level of safety and intelligence where they can be trusted to autonomously perform all these tasks, but at the same time if you require a human to manually approve every action, you’ve lost a lot of the benefits of automation,” he said.“This is one of the major paths in active research that I’m interested in … to figure out how can we get a lot of these benefits – or is it even possible to get the benefits – without exposing ourselves to very significant levels of danger.”Matt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, posted on X that millions had visited the site in the past few days.“Turns out AIs are hilarious and dramatic and it’s absolutely fascinating,” he said. “This is a first.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingexplainersShareReuse this content"

What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.‘This train isn’t going to stop’: shocking Sundance film shows promises and perils of AIRead moreThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.It is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.Because, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.It’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.On This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.But surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.It will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.Less than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.But this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.Explore more on these topicsDarren AronofskyAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Independently financed horror movie Iron Lung has been smuggled into multiplexes without the usual promotional hoopla, where it was keenly awaited by the massed followers of its Hawaiian writer-director-star Mark Fischbach, better known asYouTubegaming legend Markiplier. Many of us have long sensed culture is making a decisive break with the analogue in favour of the (perhaps terminally) online and Fischbach’s film makes that paradigm shift not just visible but visceral; it feels not unlike spending 12 hours on Twitch with all the curtains closed.Though Markiplier is approaching the horror genre from a notionally fresh angle – by adaptingDave Szymanski’s eponymous space-submarine sim– he lands on the narratively rusty idea of an astronaut straying beyond his depth; this isMoon in dimmer light. Beset by ominous rumbles and mounting doubts about the state of mankind, the begrimed and squalid craft singlehandedly piloted by Fischbach’s straggle-haired convict Simon is indistinguishable from the average teenage bedroom. Our hero staggers round this intergalactic deathtrap completing vaguely specified missions – ram this, repair that, download something or other – like a harassed dad ticking off his Sunday to-do list. In this, Simon proves more proficient than Fischbach’s offscreen self, who is either stumped by or oblivious to the film’s fundamental issues.Hopes that Iron Lung isa new Dark Starare soon sunk by the depressive tone, leaden pacing and near-total absence of spectacle; this is basically a radio-play script that insistently has to tell, because this barebones production has nothing much to show. (The achievement, chiefly entrepreneurial, is almost admirably perverse: Markiplier steering people towards content that makes Solaris seem like Con Air.) Even if you have a major case of Main Character Syndrome to centre yourself for two-plus hours while relegating your co-stars to voices off, Fischbach holds steady before the camera; more money and bigger sets will doubtless come his way. But he can’t pull off the dramatic heavy lifting required to convert a short film’s worth of plot into a watchable feature. At least MrBeast’s stunts get him outside.Iron Lung is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsGamesYouTubereviewsShareReuse this content"

You could, if you wished, divine a certain Maga-baiting intent not just in the decision to give the album of the year award toBad Bunny– a Puerto Rican who attracted criticism from the Trump administration after he was booked to headline the SuperBowl LX half-time show – but the choice of the Buena Vista Social Club, a Broadway hit based on the 1997 album of the same name featuring veteran Cuban musicians, as the best musical theatre album: the latter two weeks after the New York Times reported that Cubans settled in Florida are being deported in record numbers.Then again, neither win was an upset. Bad Bunny might be the first Latin artist to win the album award, but Debí Tirar Más Fotos was both wildly critically acclaimed – it had already been voted the best album of 2025 by Billboard and Rolling Stone, a suitable reward for its frankly head-spinning eclecticism, in which the author leaps dramatically between salsa performed by a live orchestra and house rhythms, bachata and reggaeton, the folky strains of jibaro and gleaming electro-pop, creating a unique musical fusion between the past and the present day and topping it with pointed lyrics about the relationship between Puerto Rico and the US. It was also hugely commercially successful: a US No 1, it sold more than 300,000 copies in a space of two weeks. Meanwhile, Buena Vista Social Club’s win comes on the back of the show itself winning five Tony awards – ultimately, both awards were given on considerable merit, rather than voters trying to annoy Trump.View image in fullscreenQueen Latifah, Q-Tip and Kendrick Lamar backstage.Photograph: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyKendrick Lamar was the most nominated artist of the year and ended up going home with record of the year, best rap album, best rap song and best melodic rap performance – making this the second painful year in a row for Drake, Lamar’s thwarted foe in the decade’s biggest rap beef. Drake’s collaborative album with PartyNextDoor, Some Sexy Songs 4 U, was largely absent from the nominations (just one for best melodic rap performance), while host Noah made a gag about declining to roast Lamar for fear of how he might respond. But as with Bad Bunny, Lamar won on merit: tracks from his GNX album occupied the entire Top Five of the US singles chart when they were released, a reflection of quite how good the album is. A distinct emotional shift away from the self-doubt of 2022’s Mr Morale & the Big Steppers into spectacular swagger, filled with wit and sharp wordplay – likely energised by the beef itself – GNX seemed on the surface far less complex than either its predecessor or the album that’s regularly acclaimed as Lamar’s masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly, but it still displayed a striking musical breadth. There was room for both the experimental abstraction of its title track and the earworm pop melody of Luther, the SZA collaboration that won record of the year (announced by Cher, wrongly and amusingly, as being for Luther Vandross).A Lamar guest spot probably helped Clipse to take home best rap performance for Chains and Whips, but the award underlined the standard set by the duo’s comeback albumLet God Sort Em Out, the strength of their storytelling and their technical brilliance as rappers, qualities that have often felt undervalued in latter-day hip-hop, and displayed in their performance of So Far Ahead at the ceremony. It was a pretty radical shift from this year’s broadly upbeat and celebratory live performances, given how bleak and tough its depiction of life on the margins is, and how many references to drug dealing the lyrics contain.View image in fullscreenBillie Eilish and her collaborator and brother Finneas.Photograph: Ariana Ruiz/PI/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockElsewhere, there were perhaps signs of a certain musical shift in Turnstile’s victories in both best rock album and best metal performance: it’s the first time a hardcore punk band has even been nominated in either category, let alone triumphed, albeit one who dabble in the kind of things that would once have been considered forbidden under hardcore’s hard and fast rules, including flute solos and Auto-Tune. But tradition reigned in the song of the year category, as Billie Eilish’s acoustic guitar-driven Wildflower beat a host of more straightforwardly electronic prospects – despite being released in 2024, it was deemed eligible because the Academy decided it “came to prominence” in 2025 – among them Golden by Huntr/x, the cartoon female trio fromNetflix film KPop Demon Hunters.Anti-ICE protests, brilliance by Bieber and the Dalai Lama’s first win: the 10 biggest moments at the 2026 GrammysRead moreIf the astonishing success of said film seemed to suggest that the K-pop industry might shift its attention away from actual human artists – who have started showing a tendency to complain about some of the more high-handed practices employed by South Korea’s entertainment companies – towards animated characters, theGrammysseemed intent on viewing it merely as a film, rather than a potential future path for pop. Also overlooked in the best pop duo/group performance category, the only award the movie soundtrack took home was best song written for visual media.One other question hung over the 2026 Grammys: how different might the list of nominees and winners have looked had Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl been released a few weeks earlier, and thus qualified for this year’s awards. On the one hand, it was the fastest-selling album in history, the biggest-selling album of the year, and spawned The Fate of Ophelia, which spent 10 weeks at the top of the US singles chart. On the other, it was greeted with a decidedly lukewarm critical reception: even the most ardent Swiftie would have a hard job claiming it among her best efforts. The question of whether overwhelming commercial success would beat out artistic merit in the Recording Academy’s eyes will presumably be answered next year.Explore more on these topicsGrammy awards 2026GrammysPop and rockRapHip-hopPunkBad BunnycommentShareReuse this content"

In these conditions, democracy cannot surviveMon 2 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 12.01 ESTShareTrump ran on a promise to lower costs on day one, but a year into his presidency, the real beneficiaries are his billionaire donors. Instead of making life more affordable for everyday Americans, Trump has used the presidency to enrich himself and his billionaire allies, while making the largest cuts toMedicaidandfood assistancein history and leaving working families behind.As families struggle with rising costs, Trump has effectively turned the White House into a slush fund, running the federal government like a personal ATM. Public money, political favors and government power are funneled to his friends and family businesses, while regulatory agencies and enforcement mechanisms are hollowed out or weaponized for profit. His oligarch allies, from big tech executives to big oil barons, are already seeing massive returns on their political investments. This is not democracy. It is a hostile corporate takeover and working people are being exploited.Since he secured the Republican nomination, Trump’s own fortune has nearly tripled, from$2.3bn to more than $6bn, through crypto and licensing deals which present unprecedented opportunities for corruption and influence peddling.What the US TikTok takeover is already revealing about new forms of censorship | Paolo GerbaudoRead moreFossil fuel billionaires such as Harold Hamm and Kelcy Warren poured a collective$443m into electing Trump and Maga Republicans. They are now collecting$153bn in new subsidies, tax breaks androyalty giveaways– a 34,437% return on investment.Tech titans are doing even better. Big tech companies spent at least$72mto curry favor with Trump, including$7min donations to his inauguration. Over the last year their CEOs, including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, Sergei Brin, Larry Page and Sam Altman have seen their combined net worth soar by$494bnas Trump deregulated their industries and fueled an artificial intelligence boom that is poisoning our communities and killing jobs. That is a 686,000% return — a return on interest no hedge fund could imagine.Oligarchy now functions like an investment portfolio, with government power guaranteeing extraordinary returns for those who attempt to buy political influence. As we watch communities in Minneapolis face the terror of mass deportations and fatal federal enforcement actions, corporations are cashing in while human life is treated as expendable.Private prison and deportation giants such as GEO Group, CoreCivic andCSI Aviationspent more than$5mbacking Trump and GOP candidates in 2024 and now stand to reap over$5bna year from expanded ICE and DHS contracts. Internal ICE documents show some companies’ revenues willdouble, and deportation flight budgets havemultiplied sixfold, turning violence and fear into profit streams rather than protection.That11,000% return on investmentis public money traded for human misery. Meanwhile, Peter Thiel’s company Palantir has seen its stock pricequadruple since Trump’s re-election, with its technologypowering mass raidsthat feed an enforcement apparatus detached from the value of lives it impacts.The price of this corruption shouldn’t only be measured in dollars. It is also the destruction of faith in our government as oligarchs pay to play. Big tech companies whose valuations have exploded under Trump paid millions to settle lawsuits, or in Amazon’s case, to finance a documentary about the first lady. Qatar gifted Trump a$400m private jet, followed bydeeper ties to the Gulf state. Justin Sun, a billionaire crypto entrepreneur, invested$75m in the Trump-family-owned crypto business, World Liberty Financial, only to see SEC market manipulation charges dropped against him. The presidency has become a marketplace where foreign governments, corporations and billionaires can buy influence, access and favors outright.This is why defunding the oligarchy cannot remain a rallying cry alone. It must become a governing standard for accountability that cuts off the financial and political mechanisms sustaining corporate dominance. That means ending taxpayer subsidies and contracts for companies that exploit workers, pollute communities or bankroll political influence and confronting the monopoly power that allows billionaire-controlled firms to dominate entire sectors of the economy. Defunding the oligarchy means stripping away the revenue streams and privileges that enrich the few and redirecting those public resources to meet the needs of the working class.Democracy crumbles when obscene wealth is allowed to purchase political power. That means taxing extreme wealth, closing the loopholes that allow billionaires and corporations to avoid paying their fair share, and ending a campaign finance system that treats money as speech and investors as voters. Elections should belong to the people, not to oligarchs. Working people will not believe democracy serves them until they see a government willing to challenge the billionaire interests that have captured it and invest instead in affordable healthcare, housing, education and a livable future.In the long run, democracy cannot survive if economic power is allowed to remain concentrated in the hands of a few corporations and billionaires. When workers have no voice on the job and communities have no control over their local economies, political power inevitably follows wealth. That is why rebuilding strong unions, protecting collective bargaining and breaking up monopolies are not just economic reforms, they are democratic safeguards. A society where people have real leverage at work and in their communities is a society where government is more likely to answer to voters than donors.The choice before Democrats is clear. They can continue to warn about oligarchy while leaving its power structures intact, or they can adopt an opposition rooted in anti-corruption, public investment and democratic accountability. Trump has shown that government power can be wielded decisively. The only question is whether it will serve billionaires or working people. Congress can start by supporting our Defund the Oligarchy resolution, which lays out what it means to cut off political profiteering and reinvest in the public good. It calls on Congress to end corporate tax breaks, subsidies and federal contracts for billionaire-backed companies that bankroll political campaigns, and redirect public resources toward healthcare, housing, education and other essentials that meet people’s real needs.By refusing to reward corporations that buy influence and redirecting public resources toward healthcare, housing, education and good jobs, Congress can begin to restore trust and rebalance an economy that has been rigged against working people for decades.This is the fight of our time. Oligarchs and authoritarians are betting that Americans will accept a system rigged against them, but we will prove them wrong. The path forward is not simply to criticize oligarchy, but to dismantle it. Not just to resist Trump, but to wield power in service of the people. Not just to promise change, but to deliver it. It is time to defund the oligarchs, fund the people and restore democracy to the hands of those it was meant to serve.Joseph Geevarghese is the executive director of Our Revolution.

Mere weeks after federal law enforcement executed a search warrant targeting a Washington Post reporter, the justice department is now pursuing criminal charges against two independent journalists for reporting from the scene of a protest in Minnesota citing – ironically – federal laws intended to protect the exercise of constitutional rights. These indictments are an affront to the first amendment of the US constitution.On 18 January, protesters entered the Cities church in St Paul, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official is a pastor, and interrupted a service with chants of “ICE out.” By all indications, Lemon, a former CNN host, and Fort, a local journalist, entered the church to cover the demonstration against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities.Resistance to Trump 2.0 is getting more confrontational | Dana R FisherRead moreBeing at the scene of a breaking news event to report as it unfolds is the job of journalists, and is activity protected by the first amendment, which expressly protects “freedom ... of the press”. But according to the federal indictment unsealed on Friday, the justice department is accusing Lemon and Fort of conspiring to deprive others of their constitutional rights – a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine, or both – and with allegedly obstructing the free exercise of religion in a place of worship. These charges are an attempt to criminalize journalism.It isunprecedentedfor the justice department to invoke these laws to punish journalistic activity, and there is no basis for doing so that would be consistent with the first amendment. Indeed, before the indictment, a federal magistrate judge in Minnesota had refused to sign an arrest warrant for Lemon. In a letter to a federal appeals court regarding the magistrate judge’s decision, chief judge Patrick Schiltz of the federal district court in Minneapolis, a George W Bush-appointee, noted that Lemon was a journalist and that “[t]here was no evidence” that he “engaged in any criminal behavior or conspired to do so”.To be sure, press freedom is not the only first amendment freedom implicated by the demonstration that took place at the Cities church. Americans have constitutionally protected rights both to worship and to protest. But the federal government’s decision to pursue novel criminal charges against Lemon and Fort simply for reporting on that protest poses a unique threat to the first amendment rights of journalists and, in turn, the public.Covering demonstrations from the ground – reporting alongside protesters, counter-protesters and law enforcement to deliver accurate, eye-witness accounts for the benefit of the American people – is a vital and constitutionally protected public service with a storied tradition in the US. From the civil rights movement and Vietnam war in the 1960s, to the January 6 assault on the Capitol and the ongoing protests against federal immigration enforcement activity in Minnesota, journalists have long acted, in the words of the US supreme court, as “surrogates for the public”, by reporting from the scene of demonstrations, keeping us informed about the causes of protesters and the actions of government, and allowing Americans to decide for themselves who is right and who is wrong on major issues of the day.The criminal indictments against Lemon and Fort threaten to cut off that important flow of information to the public by sending a stark message to all journalists that if they cover a protest they too may be prosecuted and possibly imprisoned. The intended effect of that message – intimidating journalists into abandoning on-the-ground reporting at protests against government policy – would be a tremendous loss for the American public and for democracy. As the supreme court said in its famous Citizens United decision in 2010: “The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it.”The justice department’s latest actions are plainly aimed at chilling vital reporting about pressing issues of public concern, in clear violation of basic first amendment principles that the supreme court has repeatedly articulated. The court just recently reiterated the importance of ensuring speech has the “breathing room” it needs to survive, recognizing that the fear of “becoming entangled in the legal system” can deter individuals from exercising their first amendment rights. These indictments fly in the face of that ideal.As the court declared nearly 60 years ago, freedom of the press is “not for the benefit of the press so much as for the benefit of all of us”. The arrest of these two journalists, who were just doing their jobs, is a danger to us all.Theodore J Boutrous, Jr & Katie Townsend are partners in the law firm of Gibson Dunn and co-chairs of the firm’s first amendment and free expression groupExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionPress freedomUS politicsUS constitution and civil libertiesNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

What has America become?Francine ProseDo the people imprisoning kids like Liam Ramos have no children of their own? Do they have no decency, compassion or basic humanity?Mon 2 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 11.10 ESTShareLiam Conejo Ramos. We have all seen his picture, or by now we allshouldhave seen the image of the adorable five-year-old in his bright blue hat, its floppy bunny ears so appropriate for a child whose middle name means “rabbit”. In the photo, he is wearing his Spider-Man backpack, which, like so many kids his age, he loves and is very proud of. And we know – or we should know – what happened to him.On 20 January 2026, the pre-K student was seized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on his way home from school in Columbia Heights,Minnesota. His family, which had emigrated from Ecuador in 2024, had applied for political asylum. No order of deportation had been issued against them, nor had any of them – obviously, not little Liam – been accused of a crime.He and his father, who had come to pick him up at school, were taken to Dilley, Texas, not far from San Antonio, where they were held in a facility that houses many child detainees. Unsurprisingly, Liam had a difficult time adjusting to life in prison. Visitors reported that he seemed pale, lethargic and depressed. A photo of him lying with his eyes closed in his father’s arms was immensely alarming.He had been sleeping a lot and – like many kids at the center – had trouble eating the vile prison food. He kept asking what happened to his blue cap and his Spider-Man backpack, which had been taken from him and not returned by ICE officers. He missed his mother, his classmates, his friends. He longed to be back in school. You can watch, on YouTube, a moving video of reporter Lilia Luciano’s visit to Liam’s classroom, where she recorded his fellow students telling him how much they loved and missed him, waving and blowing him kisses. His teachers decided not to remove Liam’s things from his cubby because they had faith that he would return.Two Democratic US representatives from Texas, Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett, visited the Dilley facility and were profoundly concerned about the condition of Liam and the other kids imprisoned there. Hundreds demonstrated at the facility during the representatives’ visit, and one could hear the children begging to be freed.Partly because of the congressional representatives’ intercession and the public attention that Liam’s suffering attracted, his case came before federal judge Fred Biery, who ruled that the detention of Liam and his father was unconstitutional – and both father and son have now been released.In his statement, Biery stated that the case “has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently implemented of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children … For some among us, the perfidious lust for unbridled power and the imposition of cruelty in its quest know no bounds and are bereft of human decency.”He accused our government of ignoring the Declaration of Independence and “that pesky inconvenience called the Fourth Amendment”, which protects individuals from “unreasonable searches and seizures” without probable cause. The judge concluded his ruling with the now familiar photo of Liam and with a quote from the New Testament: “Jesus wept.”Of all the acts of brutality and senseless violence committed by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE during the past year, the arrest and incarceration of Liam Ramos and the other children who still remain in custody is among the most sickening and heartbreaking. Do the people abusing and imprisoning these kids have no children of their own? Do they have no “human decency”, no compassion? Have they forgotten that they were once children themselves?One conclusion reached about the rituals of slaughter at Auschwitz, Treblinka and other concentration and death camps – stripping the prisoners naked, making them run to the gas chambers – is that they were designed not to make the victims suffer but rather to dehumanize them in the eyes of the guards, who would then find it easier to murder their less-than-human captives. Is something similar occurring in our country? Did the agents who seized Liam Ramos not see that he is a human being, a child like their own kids, their family members, their former selves?Liam Ramos’s arrest – and the continuing incarceration of children in his situation – should be as much of a rallying point as the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. The Democrats who called for Liam’s freedom should demand the release of the other children in DHS internment facilities. Ideally, Liam – unlike Good and Pretti and the others murdered by ICE – will recover from the trauma inflicted on him through no fault of his own.Our nation can never sufficiently apologize or make up for what was done to Liam Ramos. But there a few potential outcomes that I would like to see in the aftermath of his ordeal.The first is that his story inspires a massive rethinking and overhaul of the way in which we the treat people who have come to this country to escape persecution and to live a more peaceful life.The second is that every US government official advocate for the children left behind at Dilley and similar detention centers.And my third hope is that Stephen Miller, the principal architect of our sadistic, racist, monstrous immigration policy, be kept awake, night after night, by the sweet face of Liam Ramos, floating above him in the darkness, so that Miller suffers the fate to which Shakespeare doomed Macbeth: sleep no more.Francine Prose is a former president of the PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and SciencesThis article was amended on 2 February 2026.

He can preserve a great news organization and maybe even recover his own legacy as the paper’s steward – a legacy that was looking good for years until he took a strange, Trump-related bad turn.The turn began in earnest when Bezos – apparently trying to protect his other commercial interests – spiked the draft of an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Whatever one thinks about endorsement editorials, the timing was terrible; it was the 11th hour, shortly before the 2024 election.Unsurprisingly, droves of Post subscribers canceled. They were disgusted by the apparent effort to pleaseDonald Trumpat the price of editorial independence.Later, even more subscribers decamped after Bezos made it clear that he wanted its opinion section to take a sharp right turn. Some of the nation’s best columnists departed, and a fine cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, left after she tried to publish a cartoon depicting Bezos and others of his ilk cozying up to Trump. On the news side, many of the paper’s star reporters and editors left for places like the Atlantic, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.Since then, Bezos only continued down this misbegotten path, with Amazon contributing to the Trump inauguration and putting a ridiculous $40m behind a regrettable Melania Trump documentary that is leaving seats empty in a theater near you.While it’s true that the Post is losing money, maybe $100m a year, Bezos could clearly afford to simply support the paper. For someone whose net worth is inexhaustibly huge (roughly $250bn), this is essentially pocket change, or as the statistics expert Nate Silver put it, “a rounding error”.Silverwrote recentlythat the Post had drastically lost influence, or “mind share”, after alienating so much of its core audience, changing its coverage and losing so much talent.Less than a decade ago, the Post reportedly was profitable … as it did strong accountability reporting in the first Trump administrationThe financial losses are far from inevitable. Consider the New York Times, which is profitable and expanding, or the Guardian US, which is also thriving.Less than a decade ago, the Post reportedly was profitable (it doesn’t publicly report its finances because it is privately held), as it did strong accountability reporting in the first Trump administration under editor Marty Baron. It was competing successfully for scoops and top talent with its arch-rival, the Times.Instead of finding a way to build on that, Bezos’s handpicked publisher, Will Lewis, has gone the other way, though even now the Post’s journalists manage to report and publish excellent journalism on a daily basis and get their full share of scoops.It’s understandable that Bezos wants the Post to be self-sustaining. There was a path to getting there without destroying the newspaper and alienating its core readership. Maybe the Post did need to trim its staff and rethink how it uses resources – but not in such a draconian way, and not in a way that will severely weaken foreign coverage or sports coverage, which are foundational.When Bezos bought the Post in 2013, he got a bargain – he paid a mere $250m – and suddenly, the Amazon co-founder had the chance to be something much greater than a billionaire.He had the chance to be the steward of a national treasure, a storied news company with a staff as talented as any in the nation, maybe the world. The newspaper that had won endless Pulitzer prizes, including one for uncovering the Watergate scandal and another for breaking the Edward Snowden revelations, along with the Guardian, and also for its culture writing and international coverage.It’s strange. For years, the Amazon co-founder seemed to take his responsibility seriously. He seemed to understand how high the stakes were.When the Post’s Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, was captured and imprisoned for many months in Iran, Bezos took an active interest in getting him freed, and celebrated with the staff and Rezaian’s family.When Trump, in his first administration, threatened the Post and disparaged its owner personally, Bezos didn’t buckle.And, remarkably, he seemed to understand how to speak to journalists about their mission in a democracy. He even got the tone right, urging the proud and energetic staff to be a little bit badass as they got their mojo back after surviving tough times.But now, what matters more is turning the Post around financially while staying in Trump’s good graces.Better, this billionaire should turnhimselfaround, heal the self-inflicted wounds, and helpWashington Postjournalism survive and thrive at this crucial time for American democracy.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsWashington PostOpinionJeff BezosDonald TrumpNewspapersUS press and publishingNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

In one, Melania Trump releases aglossy documentary, Melania, an account of her return to the White House. Amazon outbid others to secure the rights to the documentary,spending $75m(£54m) in total, and ticket sales so far suggest that this was, shall we say, not a purely commercial venture.In the other, the Washington Post is set tocut up to 200 jobsearly this month, including the majority of its foreign staff and a sizeable chunk of its newsroom. Both Melania and the Washington Post are backed by Jeff Bezos. His two decisions, to invest in state propaganda and divest from the fourth estate that supposedly holds power to account, reveal much about how capital and authoritarianism join forces to decide what audiences read and see.Trouble is afoot at another legacy US media outlet, CBS News. In July of last year, tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally Larry Ellison and his Hollywood producer son, David,took over Paramount, which oversees CBS News. The former New York Times columnist and, more recently, founder of anti-woke blog the Free Press, Bari Weiss, was parachuted in to run CBS News. She promptly ran into trouble, as she took on veterans of a channel that produces such storied programmes as 60 Minutes, and tried to justify editorial decisions that were seen asslanted in favourof the Trump administration. Weiss is now also expected to makecuts to the newsroom.The telling thing is what will remain in these institutions, what is to be emphasised. Weiss has announced that she has added a host of opinion writers and wants to put “huge emphasis on scoops … crucially scoops of ideas. Scoops of explanation.” In short: more heat, less light. The opinion section of the Washington Post is also of interest to Bezos, whoannounced last yearthat its pages would “be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets … viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others”.America has reached a tipping point on fascism – and on opposition to it | Robert ReichRead moreNot, as a columnist, to be a turkey voting for Christmas, but this fetishisation of opinion writing is a bad sign. Points of view should sit in tandem with domestic and global news coverage. News coverage should not be used for partisan ends or cannibalised for commentary. But, more than anything else, the pivot is a symptom of a rightwing-owned media that no longer seeks to report on the world as it is, but creates the world as it wishes it to be.Trump regime talking points in favour of “domestic terrorists”being deservedly killedon US streets are treated as matters of opinion that simply must be aired. Reality itself has become twisted and contestable. What people have witnessed with their eyes and ears is questioned by rolling commentary of lies and conjecture, given the imprimatur of truth through being shown or printed on credible platforms.But this move from news to opinion is part of something wider. Politics has become a performance of narrative about who is friend and who is foe. It taps into the public’s emotions by agitating and provoking fear. Channelling and emphasising these feelings then becomes the business of the media. All the while, actual power structures remain unchallenged. This is what Walter Benjamin called the “aestheticisation of politics” under fascism.Everywhere you look in this age of tech-mogul-owned media, decisions follow these fascistic tastes. What use is foreign coverage, an expensive and time-intensive effort, when the wider world is viewed as a place of enemies and freeloaders that must either be cut off or brought to heel? Who cares about long-form investigations into abuses of power? Or features exploring the details of people’s lives elsewhere?The impact is a degradation of the very way humans communicate with and about each other. Knowledge about and affinity with others are things to be excised under authoritarianism. So, too, is artistic expression, as with Trump’s takeover of whatwas the Kennedy Centerand theassault on the Smithsonian. What some see as old and venerable US institutions, the right sees as organs of an ancien regime to be repurposed. This is what happens in coups – all that is associated with the values and style of the old order is uprooted.Autocracy slowly grinds and spits out all that is impertinent. Billionaires, who have amassed way more money and power than is healthy for a democracy, own the machines. Those who service them are misfits, useful idiots and attention seekers. This grinding will be sold as pragmatism, simply giving readers and viewers what they want. In a world where legacy media finances are unsustainable and attention spans are frazzled, they will say that reporting is too demanding of institutional resources and audiences.These problems are real – journalism is a struggling industry and technology is degrading our ability to learn and think – but it’s interesting that the solutions to these issues trend towards the introduction of more rightwing voices, the privileging of expression over reporting and the diminishing capacities for bearing witness to a global human experience.It is not an accident that tech moguls entrusted with the solutions happen to be close to, or associated with, those who have links to the Trump administration. And that government is one that has waged war on journalism, with its “fake news”, and is noweven arresting journalists. In no way are the Ellisons or Bezos good-faith stewards of the media, concerned only with the viability of journalism in a changing world. It all stinks to high heaven.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpJeff BezosWashington PostCBSMelania TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But its future hinges on fixing its flawsPeter Maresfor the ConversationGiving workers access to Medicare and making it easier for them to change jobs would help solve the scheme’s problemsMon 2 Feb 2026 18.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 18.47 ESTShareThe Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme(Palm)is a crucial source of workers across regional Australia. About32,000 peoplefrom nine Pacific nations and Timor-Leste work in Australia under Palm.Over seven months of researching the scheme – interviewing workers, employers, country liaison officers, trade union organisers, community volunteers and academics, as well as digging into the data on it – I didn’t encounter anyone who thought it was a bad idea.But there were many calls for change to make it work better for everyone. Mynew report, published today, suggests where we could start.Who benefits from Palm now?Palm has short- and long-term streams. Under the short-term stream, operating since 2012, workers can stay for nine months to do seasonal jobs such as fruit-picking.The long-term stream, introduced in 2018, allows for a four-year stay. Most long-term workers are employed in meat processing.As climate crisis threatened her home, Alolita was offered a chance at a new life in AustraliaRead morePalm is widely credited with delivering a triple win.The first win is for Pacific participants and their communities.In 2024-25 Palm workers remittedA$450mto their home countries, an average of$1,500 eachper person per month. Themoneybought food, paid school fees, upgraded housing and financed small enterprises.Benefits flow beyond immediate families. After working in an Australian abattoir, Devid John Suma returned to Vanuatu andinvested $30,000to supply clean drinking water to his remote village.The second win is for Australia’s economy. Palm workers make a significant contribution to regional businesses that struggle to attract local workers, from farms to abattoirs.The third win is that Palm advances Australia’s strategic interests, not least by providing a counter toChina’s wooing of Pacific nations.Pacific leaders might wish for more aid from Canberra and be frustrated by the government’s tepid action on climate change. But well-paid work is something Australia offers that China does not.Persistent problemsYet the wins of the Palm scheme havecountervailing costsin the pain of separated families, loneliness and broken marriages.Thousands of Palm workers have quit their approved jobs, 'disengaging' from the schemePalm is dogged byreportsof workers beingabused,underpaidor housed in substandard, overpriced or overcrowdedaccommodation.Thousands of Palm workers have quit their approved jobs,“disengaging” from the scheme. This breaches their visa conditions and leaves them vulnerable to exploitation.Drifting from its original missionPalm has profoundly changed migration between the Pacific and Australia.It brings workers to Australia from countries that have seen minimal migration to Australia since Federation, despite their geographic proximity – particularly the Melanesian countries Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu that were sources of labour in the late 19th century, whenindentured South Sea Islandersbuilt Queensland’s plantation economy.But the future of Palm is not guaranteed.Some Pacific countries, includingPapua New Guinea, would like more of their nationals engaged under the scheme, while othersworryit createsworkforce shortagesand disrupts community life.Participationpeaked at 34,830 workers in September 2023 and was at 32,365 in November 2025. Numbers in the long-term stream are steady, but fewer short-term workers are being recruited as employers revert to using backpackers – a cheaper, less regulated workforce – for seasonal jobs.So, Palm has drifted from its original mission of filling seasonal gaps in the rural economy through annual circular migration to become a labour program for sectors such as meat processing and aged care with a constant demand for workers.In April 2022, three-quarters of all Palm workers were in the short-term stream and a quarter were long-term. Now, more than half of all Palm workers hold long-term visas.How to make the scheme work betterThe Palm scheme changes lives and communities in the Pacific and Australia, often for the better. But its problems must be addressed to realise its potential.‘Hard to say who’s winning’: China and Australia battle for influence in Solomon Islands policingRead moreAustralian employers will turn away from a scheme that is too bureaucratic, expensive or cumbersome. Palm’s future won’t be secured by burying it under layers of rules and reporting.My reporthas 10 recommendations to improve Palm. These include:making it easier for Palm workers to change jobs, rather than tying them to a single employersimplifying Palm scheme rules for employersregulating labour hireat the national levelgiving workers access to Medicare while they’re in Australia to stop them missing out on medical attentionand reformingworking holiday programsby phasing out the second and third visas offered to backpackers who do work like fruit picking in regional areas.Australia’s interest in fostering Pacific development and rivalry with China are added reasons to limiting working holidays and expanding the Palm scheme instead.Palm is a work in progress and will never be perfect. The scheme is shaped by the power differential between Australia and its Pacific partners. And there are tensions between three priorities: being a development program enhancing Pacific wellbeing, being a labour market program benefiting Australia’s economy, and serving a strategic purpose in Australia’s rivalry with China.Yet, when it operates well, Palm is far more than transactional.Beyond wages earned, jobs filled and diplomatic points scored, it also fosters cultural exchange and personal engagement, binding the peoples of Australia and the region more fully into a “Pacific family”.Peter Mares is an Adjunct Senior Research Fellow, School of Media, Film and Journalism, Monash University.

Starmer had better find out, and fastGaby HinsliffSerious questions need to be asked about Mandelson, Andrew and what the PM knew when. The credibility of UK politics is on the lineMon 2 Feb 2026 14.41 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 18.58 ESTSharePeter Mandelson did not want, he wrote disdainfully to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, to “live by salary alone”. Not for him the life of the little guy, slave to a mere six-figure salary: he had always aspired to something grander, a lifestyle well beyond his means, to which rich men such as Epstein were so often his passport.First it was his millionaire colleague, Geoffrey Robinson, from whom Mandelsonsecretly borrowed moneyto buy a house he couldn’t afford. In 2003 and 2004 it was Epstein, at least according to files released in the US this week, suggesting the financier paid £55,000 into Mandelson’s bank account, though he now says he can’t find records of it. Five years later, in 2010, the files record Mandelson confiding in Epstein of hishopes for a gigwith merchant bankers JP Morgan, where he could leverage his “networks” to make the really big deals.How lucky, then, that he hadallegedly been so helpful to Wall Street just a few months earlier at the height of the banking crisis: passing on inside snippets of government thinking during the crash, according once again to those telltale files, and suggesting via Epstein (at the time recently released from jail) that JP Morgan should “mildly threaten” the British chancellor, Alistair Darling, to get around a proposed ban on bankers’ bonuses. Meanwhile, the files record Mandelson’s partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva,asking Epstein for £10,000for an osteopathy course and a laptop, which the latter promises to wire over immediately. No such gift was ever declared, and Mandelson insists hehas no recordof it. But what’s striking about the email is its casualness, almost as though da Silva were one of the dreaded wage slaves, filing his expenses.And so the man with a rightful claim to have co-created the modern Labour party has quit it, seemingly before it could quit him. Like the former Prince Andrew, he is now effectively banished from court,facing the lossof his title. There is surely no coming back for either man from an affair that encapsulates everyone’s worst suspicions about the relationship between wealth, power and the suffering in this case of young girls trampled in the process. But exile is not enough. There will be no restoring the public’s shattered trust without a full and formal investigation into both men’s conduct, free to go wherever it leads, no matter how embarrassing for the British establishment. Gordon Brown hasnow calledfor such an inquiry into Mandelson’s conduct.As a gay man, Mandelson has argued he was never likely to witness the side of Epstein’s life described by Virginia Giuffre, who detailed her experience as a young girl of being groomed, abused and passed around Epstein’s powerful friends “like a platter of fruit”. But the money is a different story, leaving a trail that should be easy enough for the relevant authorities to follow. (Though he loftily suggests that the alleged cash gifts require “investigating by me”, the last person who should be investigating Peter Mandelson is Peter Mandelson.)Given the seriousness of the allegations now surrounding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – including those of a woman whocame forward this weekto claim that, when she was in her 20s, Epstein sent her to Britain to sleep with him, a story clearly echoing Giuffre’s – meanwhile, it is astounding that the only professional interrogation he has faced came courtesy of Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis. How hard would it be for British detectives to establish where a man famously guarded round the clock by police protection officers was on the night he is accused of meeting Giuffre?Everyone in British public life should be acutely aware of the dangerous emotions stirred by talk of sex trafficking among the rich and powerful. It’s catnip to conspiracy theorists, who see their wild-eyed imaginings about so-called global elites vindicated, and the combination of this scandal with the white heat of an angry byelection in Gorton and Denton, where Reform UK may well try again to weaponise anger about grooming gangs, is potentially explosive. Under those conditions, nobody should seek to exploit the pain of Epstein’s young victims for their own political ends, includingLabourpoliticians.But there are legitimate questions to be asked not just about Mandelson’s behaviour inside the last Labour government, but about what exactly Keir Starmer and his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, knew when he was appointed US ambassador just last year. His friendship with Epstein was common enough knowledge to come up in vetting. Did they decide, in the end, that the risk was worth it? Do they still think that now, reading emails that heap shame on the Labour party, and can only stoke the anger building against Starmer on his own backbenches?The Epstein files expose just how cheap corruption is in the UKRead moreWith little sign of prosecution pending for the men for whom these girls were procured, meanwhile, all this week’s data dump does is fuel people’s worst suspicions about how the super-rich behave in private, without the release of feeling that justice has been done.Scrolling through these fawning exchanges between Epstein and his famous friends, so many seemingly anxious either for invites to his island or for his money, makes me feel almost grubby by association. I can’t imagine how it would feel reading them as a victim of sexual abuse. How does a mother of daughters not much older than Epstein’s victims, as Sarah Ferguson was, find herself sending gushing emails to the man who regularly settled her debts even after his conviction, ending with the words “just marry me”? Why is Richard Branson making jokes about bringing “your harem” to a man convicted of sex offences? Why did so many people seemingly struggle to believe he did what a court said he had, or live up to their public promises about ending the friendship?Alongside an inquiry that gets to the bottom of Epstein’s role in British public life, the prime minister now needs to demonstrate something more like moral leadership: to offer some sense of catharsis, not just for Epstein’s victims but for all those who have suffered at the hands of men like him.If the political system can’t now articulate and share in the anger the public feels, then it risks leaving the truly corrosive impression that this is just how everyone in power behaves behind closed doors; that the curious inability to seeJeffrey Epsteinfor what he was is more feature than bug of a system looking after its own. For all that we have learned this week, I still don’t believe that to be true. But we are long past the point of expecting people to take that on trust.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Like most of my peers, I am embarrassed by my body and am therefore changing into my swimmers under a towel.Thechanging room is filled with older women– in my memory, they’re elderly, which means in reality they were likely all somewhere between 40 and 60 – and they’renaked. I am horrified by this, but not because I am awkward about witnessing their nudity. Instead (and I acutely remember this being my thought at the time), I feel sad and disgusted by the complete lack of care these women have at the impression their bodies will make on the rest of us.‘Australia’s beach culture is very fatphobic’: the summertime rise in body dissatisfactionRead moreThey walk calmly between the showers and the mirrors, bodies on display, jiggling, sagging, flopping. Didn’t they realise they were meant to be ashamed to look like that?At the very least, I thought, they should quietly fade into the background, or make their bodies occupy as little space as possible. It was the logical survival strategy that I imagined I would one day follow.Now, in the classic Uno reverse card of life, the revulsion I had for those women has morphed into pitying shame for my younger self. I can see now I was held hostage then, and 20 years after, by the patriarchal obsession with youth and beauty standards, and that I thought occupying the world without care for how you were perceived in accordance with these was a sign you had given up.I’m now 36 years old and recentlyI was at the beach. I looked down and saw my own dimply, cellulite-ridden thighs, stubbly legs, and considered my makeup-free, increasingly puffy and lined face.“Huh. Would you look at that? I literally could not care less what I look like right now,” I thought. I had arrived, swum in the ocean, played with my son and not thought once about how others might perceive me. It wasliberating.Yet hours before I had been researching whether a lymphatic drainage brush could help reduce my under-eye bags, and had spent the better part of the two years since giving birth trying and failing to starve my body down 3kg. The contradiction perplexes me.I can see now I was held hostage then, and 20 years after, by the patriarchal obsession with youth and beauty standardsZoya PatelHow can I be both aware of the endless drain that beauty standards place on my mental and physical energy, and simultaneously unable to escape their clutches? As a feminist, I am critically conscious of the patriarchal construct of women’s attractiveness being inherently linked to our social value. As a heterosexual woman, I am forever aware of the role male attention plays in our self-regard, how we regard each other as women, and how society more broadly categorises our relevance.And yet I swing wildly from wanting to eschew any sense ofstrivingfor some ideal physical appearance and convincing myself there is some golden ratio of weight/clothing/haircut/skincare that will finally satisfy the part of me that has been desperately trying to attain attractiveness since I was in that changing room decades ago.Here’s what I’m starting to realise about being considered beautiful as a woman: it must be very tiring. I imagine once you’ve had the experience of being told you’re attractive, you want to hold on to that status, but as standards continue to escalate past what is normal this is increasingly hard to do.In contrast, when you’ve never really been considered conventionally attractive, you’re forced to find other ways to value yourself. Even as I’ve spent my entire adult life wanting to look different, I’ve also on a more practical level found and cultivated other parts of myself that have nothing to do with appearance.The generational divide is so overrated – here’s how I crossed it and forged new friendships | Zoya PatelRead moreI am confident of my intellect, my empathy, my friendships, my creativity. I’ve witnessed other women – especially those who are beautiful and have been consistently told they’re beautiful – correspondingly doubt these other parts of their personhood. It’s as though we’ve accepted the rule that we can’t possibly have it all and swapped insecurities accordingly.I can’t help but wonder what would happen if looks were never part of the equation on a more fundamental, societal level.When we can no longer conform to the increasingly unattainable beauty standards, perhaps a freedom to be ourselves can emerge. Age provides a wonderful, and inevitable, opportunity to embrace this shift, if only we stop trying to surgically forestall its effects.I think of those women in the swimming pool changing room now and recognise in their display of their normal, strong, useful bodies the choice to see themselves as more than just ornamental vessels; those bodies swam. They created waves, and shifted tides, and undoubtedly were misdirected by the rips of gender norms, and sometimes found themselves limited to the swimming pool when they wanted the whole ocean. But they were undoubtedly, unapologetically alive.Zoya Patel is a writer and editor based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsBody imageOpinionHealth & wellbeingAgeingAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

To win, it must first agree on a line of attackMon 2 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 13.26 ESTShareAfter the past fortnight in which Labour’sinternal bickeringhas once again distracted attention from government decisions that will affect real lives, it’s worth remembering how Keir Starmer briefly lifted his party’s gaze from its own navel to a higher purpose a few months ago.That was back in September, the previous occasion when Andy Burnham’s name was being bandied around, when the prime minister seemed to galvanise Labour’s conference bytelling it“we’ve got the fight of our lives ahead of us” against Reform UK and “racist” policies that would “tear the country apart”. This would be a “different battle”, he warned, because Labour was up against opponents who represented a strain of rightwing politics alien to a Britain that had never faced “a proposition like Reform before”. He has reiterated this view several times since, not least in apre-Christmas interview, in which Starmer said that while he could still “sleep at night” under the Conservatives, that wouldn’t be the case if Nigel Farage’s party was in power.It is remarkable, however, that some of his own party’s staff don’t accept that the stakes are so high or the contrast so stark. Official Labour social media accounts routinely proclaim that the Tories and Reform are “basically the same”. A post last month suggested that these two parties offer only the “same people, same chaos and decline”, while an advertising campaign against Reform titled “Tories: the sequel” isreportedly being planned.No one is suggesting that these officials have deliberately set out to undermine the prime minister and, having had the Conservatives as their main opponent for more than a century, it must be hard to resist settling back into the time-worn grooves of fighting the old enemy. This is especially true whenLabouris presented with such a tempting target as that presented by the recent spate of Tory defections to Reform. Indeed, those of Nadhim Zahawi, Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman mean there are now more former members of Liz Truss’s cabinet in Farage’s ranks than in Kemi Badenoch’s top team.And yet a basic function of any political party is to set out a consistent line on its opponents, and senior government figures privately – if grudgingly – acknowledge that their current one looks rather incoherent. Reform can either be portrayed as an unprecedented peril to the country or as a bunch of political re-treads offering more of the same – but it can’t be both.Polling is belatedly being commissioned to test which part of this badly mixed message works best, alongside other potential attacks that include Farage’s hostility toworkers’ rights, the conviction and jailing of former lieutenant Nathan Gill for taking bribes from an alleged asset ofVladimir Putin’s Russia, or Farage’s support frommega-rich Maga-ish types. Those overseeing the exercise emphasise they will be driven only by data, and become a little irritated by suggestions this is a proxy for deeper divisions. But it does touch on a bigger question about which sections of the electorate Labour is trying to reach.For the past five years the party has focused on what it called “hero voters” – stereotypically older, working-class people who backed Brexit – who are now leaning towards Reform because they think Britain is fundamentally broken. Portraying Farage as “new” and “different” might be seen as ceding the territory of novel and radical change to him.On the other side of the argument are those Labour MPs and ministers who fear the old strategy has opened up the party’s left flank, where implicitly “less heroic”, younger, pro-European graduate voters are switching their support to the Greens and the Liberal Democrats in England, as well as the SNP in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales. Showing that Labour is a bulwark against the existential threat Reform poses to progressive values makes sense if you want to rebuild support within this left-of-centre bloc, as well as address the more immediate priority of holding on to the Gorton and Denton constituency in a crunch byelection this month.For those with long memories, all of this is a bit reminiscent of the mid-1990s, when the Conservatives were struggling to get a grip on Tony Blair. Eventually they came up with the slogan “New Labour, New Danger”, which they notoriously illustrated with a pair of red-tinted demon eyes. Some of Labour’s strategists now say the Tories made a basic error by accepting Blair’s party was “new”, while others attribute the failure of that campaign to Labour not being really very “dangerous”. And so the argument rumbles on.The current situation is further clouded by confused signals about what Reform is trying to achieve. Is the party really trying to be an agent of insurgent change – or does its recruitment of experienced ministers from the last government suggest it is seeking to reassure voters worried about the destruction Farage might wreak? This is why some senior Labour figures still think it’s possible to fudge their attack by saying Reform is dangerous precisely because it is filled with the “maddest and baddest” old Tories. That, however, carries the risk of helping todecontaminate the Conservative party, which, asthe runner-upin more than 200 of the seats – including many of the most marginal – that Labour won at the last general election, may be under-priced at the next.Starmer, who has never been the sort to ignore political expertise or impose his own strategy on those around him, has engaged fair-mindedly with the internal debate because he recognises there are real dilemmas about how to approach Labour’s new rival. But the biggest error would be to treat such questions as a desiccated technical process conducted in the air-conditioned atmosphere of focus groups. The reason why Starmer put some much-needed energy into his party conference four months ago was because his remarks were obviously genuine. “That was me, that was me!”he told friendswhen he stepped off the stage after his big speech. His party could do with an infusion of similarly authentic passion as it embarks on what the prime minister calls a battle for the “heart and soul” of the nation.The time for hesitancy and second-guessing on how to tackle Reform, as well as much else besides, really must be over by now.Tom Baldwin is the author ofKeir Starmer, The BiographyExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionKeir StarmerLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

The streets were flooded with manure, the unintended consequence of dependence on horses as the major form of transport. In this sea of filth, the infant car industry smelled an opportunity.The Horseless Age, a US car magazine,claimed in 1896 that, with the spread of motorcars, “streets will be cleaner, jams and blockades less likely to occur, and accidents less frequent, for the horse is not so manageable as a mechanical vehicle”. The streets did eventually become cleaner, but not safer. Cars brought huge benefits to society, but also huge challenges. By the end of the 20th century, cars and motorbikes were implicated inmore than a million deathsa year around the world, as well as contributing to pollution and suburban sprawl.This story is often told to show that the inevitable march of innovation brings both solutions and problems. However, there was nothing inevitable about US cities becoming dominated by cars. As the historian Peter Norton describes in his bookFighting Traffic, it was a direct result of lobbying by the US car industry. It campaigned for the removal of public transport, the banning of jaywalking and the redesign of streets. The advent of the car in the US is a useful cautionary tale as we consider the introduction of self-driving cars into our lives – especially in the UK.Waymo, the US self-driving car company, has said that, by the end of 2026,Londoners will be able to ride in their vehicleswith nobody behind the wheel. Their sales pitch is that their vehicles won’t get drunk or distracted, improving the safety and efficiency of how we get around. And if the computing and hardware becomes cheaper, a self-driving ride may eventually cost less than a regular taxi.For the past few years, the company has operatedabout 1,500 driverless carsacross the US. Their safety record so far has been good. Vehicles have not been involved in the sort of life-threatening situations that would turn public opinion against them, but they have got into all sorts of scrapes that are annoying for a city’s day-to-day operation –impeding emergency services,causing traffic jamsand, in one case, running over amuch-loved San Francisco cat. Policymakers are right to question how much of this accumulated US experience is relevant as the cars launch in London.Driverless cars are coming to the UK – but the road to autonomy has bumps aheadRead moreLondon is different from US cities. Much of its road layout predates the arrival of the car. Our roads are more chaotic, with the balance of power tipped a little less towards vehicles. Jaywalking is permitted in London. In 1966, the police tried to crack down on it, butgave up after three months. Our zebra crossings are far from machine-readable; they are designed for micro-conversations between drivers and pedestrians. In some parts of London,such as Exhibition Roadin South Kensington, there are experiments in “shared space”, tearing up the old infrastructures that used to force buses, bikes and cars to stay in their lanes. This introduces uncertainty that slows down drivers but makes navigation harder for artificial intelligence.Another issue is that Londonhas been extremely successfulin reducing the number of cars in its centre, while increasing the number of buses and bicycles. If self-driving cars pull people away from active travel and public transport, they hinder rather than help the city’s wider transport strategy.Big questions remain. How many mistakes, crashes and snarl-ups will people in the UK be willing to tolerate? Should these vehicles clearly indicate when they are driving themselves? Will the technology’s benefits be widespread or concentrated for a lucky few?When they go wrong, will we be able towork out why? Will there be pressure to change the rules of the road to suit the technology?Having runsurveys of public attitudes, my sense is that the public will have high expectations for safety, transparency and equity. We are embarking upon a fascinating social experiment. The minister for local transport, Lilian Greenwood, has said that“government must be in the driving seat”. In the UK, cities will have a say in regulating the technology, which wasn’t the case when it arrived in places such as San Francisco.If London is to become a laboratory, we need to make sure that the knowledge isn’t hoarded by the companies running the tests. As the transport scholar David Zipperrecently pointed out, it is hard to assess the safety of Waymo’s technology when we only haveWaymo’s own datato go on. Self-driving car companies have in the past beenreluctant to share datawith crash investigators and have been cagey about how many peopleare involved behind the scenesas remote operators.The first time you are driven by a self-driving vehicle, it briefly feels magical. Like the Wizard of Oz, the companies involved would rather we didn’t look behind the curtain. But if we want to use technology to improve transport, without storing up more problems for the future, we shouldn’t be pushed around by the hype.Jack Stilgoe is a professor in science and technology studies at University College LondonExplore more on these topicsSelf-driving carsOpinionLondonWaymoMotoringcommentShareReuse this content"

Thanks to the rise in real estate technologies, renters often have no choice but to hand over huge amounts of revealing information to digital third parties just to have somewhere to live. All the while we are told: trust us, we take your privacy seriously.Butrecent Guardian reportinghas revealed that seven popular “rent-tech” platforms have serious security vulnerabilities, leaving millions of documents containing personal information of renters exposed on the open web for years. When they were alerted to the risk, only two of the seven companies responded to say they would put additional security measures in place. Is this what taking renter privacy seriously looks like?Renters now interact with technologies at every stage of their housing experience: from submitting applications online, to the day-to-day activities ofpaying rent though apps, logging maintenance requests through digital portals, and being pushed to communicate withchatbots. Some even prompt renters topay extrato store their data for longer periods. These technologies promise increased profit for landlords and improved efficiency for real estate agents, but what about the renters?Real estate agents in Australia using apps that leave millions of lease documents at risk, digital researcher saysRead moreOver the course of my research examining technology platforms in Australia’s private rental sector, I have spoken with numerous renters who have recounted frustrated feelings of being forced to use these platforms, of feeling minimal convenience benefits at best, and of serious concerns about their privacy and digital security. It now seems that those exact fears have come true.Whenever I apply for a rental, I am astounded by the sheer volume of information about my life that I have to provide: identity documents, years of living and employment history, financial details, and who knows what kind of information collected about me through reference checks. After moving in, the data collection continues with property management platforms storing leases, bank details, as well as a detailed picture of how I live through logged communications, repair requests and inspection photos.As a long-term privacy advocate, all of my alarm bells go off – but what are renters supposed to do? In the hierarchy of needs, shelter comes first. Most renters know all too well that if you resist, you get labelled as a troublesome tenant. But renters shouldn’t have to trade their digital security for housing. Reading privacy policies offers little assurances except mostly vague promises that this data will be secure. Now, that feels like a sick joke.And it’s not as though these risks haven’t been highlighted before. In 2023, the consumer rights group Choicehighlightedthe exorbitant amount of data that rent-tech platforms push renters to provide, noting that 41% of renters felt pressured to use them. Digital Rights Watchcalled forimproved privacy and security protections to protect renters in the digital economy. Public scrutiny in the media has raised alarm over rent-tech“data gouging”and called it a“data breach waiting to happen”. Just last week, a researchreportpublished by the Australian Urban and Housing Research Institute raised concerns about the security of renter data – among other things – in this sprawling digital ecosystem. It would seem these warnings have fallen on deaf ears.For renters to have no real choice but to use these platforms in order to access and retain housing, then to have the information you are forced to hand over left unprotected, adds insult to injury in an already deeply dehumanising system.Unlike malicious hackers who seek out vulnerabilities for their own gain, the researcher whodiscovered these problemsisn’t interested in taking advantage of holes in the system; they just want the platforms to improve their security to protect the renters (and landlords) whose information had been left dangerously exposed.‘I can’t move a fridge’: elderly residents forced out after Melbourne public housing towers earmarked for demolitionRead moreBut what else could they do? After attempting to go through the appropriate channels by contacting the companies and the Australian Information Commissioner, many of the vulnerabilities were still there months later. Security researchers like this face significant personal risk revealing their discoveries, which can discourage them from trying to improve the digital security of Australians.Back in 2022,I askedwhether we needed to wait for a massive data breach in the real estate sector before we see change. Must we have another breach like Optus, Medibank, Latitude (the list goes on) in order for this to be taken seriously? These platforms are the new arbiters of a housing economy that Australians are forced to rely on; their privacy and security practices must be scrutinised and improved. Thankfully, this discovery has raised the alarmbeforethe worst has happened. It’s now up to the companies, regulators and policymakers to take action.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights advocate and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionData and computer securitycommentShareReuse this content"

As did Raye, who earlier in the week received the Harry Belafonte best song for social change award for Ice Cream Man.View image in fullscreenLola Young accepts her award for best pop solo performance at the 68th Grammy awards.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersSince it opened in the 90s with a focus on the performing and creative arts, the Brit school has become Britain’s most potent launchpad for global stardom. The list of alumni reads like a who’s who of British talent: Adele, Amy Winehouse, Jessie J, Tom Holland, Leona Lewis, and Loyle Carner are among those who honed their craft within its classrooms.Even artists who never attended the institution have referenced it, such as Ed Sheeran, who in his breakthrough track You Need Me, I Don’t Need You, cheekily rapped: “I will blast and I didn’t go to Brit school.”For Stuart Worden, a teacher at the school since 1994 and its principal since 2012, this year’sGrammyswere “a brilliant celebration” of free arts education. “Those women are fantastic role models of what’s achievable if you give young people access to the arts,” he said.WhileFKA twigswas only briefly at the school, Worden keenly remembers Dean, Young and Raye (real name Rachel Keen) who all joined as 14-year-olds. “They started in year 10, all pretty close together,” he said. “Lola and Olivia stayed for sixth form, Raye left after her GCSEs because she was already on her way and making money from her music.”Dean, who blends soul, jazz and pop styles, is the first British performer to win best new act at the Grammys since Dua Lipa in 2019, and multiple singles from her sophomore album The Art of Loving entered the UK Top 10 simultaneously. Young’s breakthrough hit Messy topped global charts, whileRayeis already a seven-time Brit award winner.“What stood out about all of them was their great work ethic,” Worden said. “None of these artists are overnight successes. They’ve played small venues, they’ve worked on records for years.”View image in fullscreenFKA twigs, who briefly attended the Brit school, picked up an award for her album Eusexua.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersIs it obvious when a student is going to become a huge star? “I don’t think so,” he said. “What Olivia, Raye and Lola have in common is that they all, from quite an early age, wanted to write about the things that matter to them.”The Brit school, he added, aimed to nurture young people to find their own voice. “What do you care about? The next bit is up to them. Raye won a Grammy for Ice Cream Man, which is an unflinching look at harassment. Lola’s song has connected with people because she’s being really honest about the challenges of life, smiling with passion about being ‘messy’. Olivia writes about the complexities of love. They are not manufactured, they are themselves and that’s powerful.”Though there are no classes on how to be a megastar, students are instilled with professional standards and values such as kindness. “If you allow people to be kind and open to emotion, that creates possibilities,” Worden said.The Grammys riled Donald Trump – but the big winners were chosen for their music, not politicsRead moreAll three women are still in contact and work with the school. “I can remember Raye, when she was 14, saying, ‘I’m going to do this, sir’,” Worden said. “And weirdly, she still calls me ‘sir’. We were chatting the other day because she wants some of our students to come and see her new show.” He said alumni felt attached to the school because of the spirit of collaboration it fostered. “Olivia met her bass player Finn [Zeferino-Birchall] in the canteen, Adele met her guitarist here when they were 16.”Former Brit school students have sold almost 300m albums, have racked up more than 70bn streams across online platforms, and won dozens of high-profile awards such as Grammys, Baftas, Oscars, Oliviers and Brits. Students study core subjects alongside their art specialism, with more than 200 shows or events each year.The school prides itself on diversity: 40% of 1,450 students are of global majority heritage, 50% from income-deprived backgrounds, and a third have a SEN diagnosis.Worden said: “We as a country need many different voices in the arts. Giving access to those from low-income or neurodiverse backgrounds creates opportunities that might not otherwise exist.”Explore more on these topicsMusicGrammy awards 2026GrammysFKA twigsOlivia DeanRayeArts in schoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the case of last night’sGrammys, we hardly need musicians to reiterate that what ICE is doing is morally reprehensible. And yet the sheer force and variety of these statements was bracing, making it clear that the issue should remain paramount in any context.“No one is illegal on stolen land, and it’s just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,”Billie Eilishsaid, reiterating a phrase popular at anti-ICE protests as she won song of the year for Wildflower. “I feel really hopeful in this room, and I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter. ‘Fuck Ice’ is all I want to say, sorry.”Winning the first of two R&B awards for Folded, Kehlani also called for a pan-industry stance: “Together we’re stronger in numbers to speak against all the injustice going on in the world right now … I hope everybody’s inspired to join together as a community of artists, so I’mma leave this and say: fuck ICE.” Winning best new artist,Olivia Deansaid: “I’m up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant – I’m a product of bravery and I think those people deserve to be celebrated,” with all the class and subtle power of her music itself.Bad Bunny and Kendrick Lamar win big in Grammys ceremony filled with anti-ICE sentimentRead moreAnd Bad Bunny’s speech was simply extraordinary, charged up with clarity and humanism: “ICE out. We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,” he said, adding: “The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. Please, we need to be different. If we fight we have to do it with love. We don’t hate them … that’s the way to do it, with love. Don’t forget that, please.” For a person who had to rule out doing US concerts last year for fear that his fans would be seized by ICE agents, extending love to those agents is a striking example of Benito Ocasio going high when they go low.While there were a smattering of anti-ICE statements on the Golden Globes red carpet from Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and more, along with some lapel pins, this was a much more full-throated protest. Hopefully the Oscars will bring similar energy.Olivia Dean is anointed as Britain’s biggest new pop starThe best new artist category has anointed some major British legends over the years – the Beatles, Tom Jones, Sade, Amy Winehouse, Adele and Dua Lipa among them – and based on the strength of songwriting and performance on her breakthrough second album The Art of Loving, it feels like Dean is on the same career trajectory. She was an absolutely deserving winner in a strong field here, edging out the likes of Addison Rae, Sombr and Leon Thomas, thanks to her evocation of human feeling in all its caprice and wonder. The Art of Loving is almost a concept album, with every possible type of love-emotion given voice by Dean: from the playfully neggy flirting at a relationship’s outset to the accusatory, disbelieving hurt at the end. That skill, and the lightness with which she wears it, has swept her to pop’s top bracket. Released in September, The Art of Loving was ineligible this year, so expect her back on stage to collect more flowers next February.2:02Grammy awards 2026: Bad Bunny and Kendrick Lamar win big as musicians take aim at ICE – videoCould Kendrick Lamar soon become the greatest Grammy winner ever?The Recording Academy adores artists who pair cerebral musicianship and lyricism with commercial heft, and has anyone done that better thanKendrick Lamarin the last decade? He won another five awards last night – all four rap categories (including for his guest spot on Clipse’s Chains and Whips) plus the biggest one of all, record of the year for his Vandross-sampling SZA duet Luther. That takes Lamar’s tally to 27, at the age of just 38. Lamar was certainly deserving of every win here, with his album GNX exhibiting every facet of his personality from impish provocateur to ruminative romantic.The Dalai Lama won his first GrammyDalai Lama expresses ‘gratitude and humility’ at first Grammy winRead moreI’ll never forget one of the trippiest moments at Glastonbury, when Patti Smith got theDalai Lamaon stage and got the crowd to sing him happy birthday while he cut a cake with an enormous knife: definitely one where anyone microdosing mushrooms worried they’d actually macro-dosed. But having cropped up at the world’s greatest music festival, the 90-year-old has now gatecrashed the world’s greatest music awards, winning his first Grammy for Meditations: The Reflections of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, in the best audiobook category. If he set his words to a few Goa trance chords, you never know, those new age or dance/electronic categories could be his for the taking in 2027. The win already puts him in the top 10 oldest winners ever, though there’s some way to go before he beats 97-year-old bluesman Pinetop Perkins.Justin Bieber blew mindsOn the performance front, Sabrina Carpenter did Manchild with her usual brilliant high camp, holding a dove while dressed up like an airline pilot about to get a message from HR regarding appropriate uniform standards; Bruno Mars and Rosé took a great guitar-heavy stomp through APT; Lady Gaga mashed synths and donned an exploded wicker hat. There were heartfelt tributes to Ozzy Osbourne, D’Angelo and Roberta Flack (though only a spoken tribute to Brian Wilson, which seemed to underplay him a little, even if it came from Bruce Springsteen). But the performance of the night was byJustin Bieber, performing Yukon, one of his greatest songs and one of a handful of highs on his album Swag. Dressed in just a pair of shorts and socks and with a full-length mirror alongside him, it was as if he’d just rolled out of bed at 11am – confected anti-glamour, but brilliantly done. He built up the song’s riff live on guitar, looped it alongside drum pads and then let it all run in the background, letting him focus on delivering the vocals: on record they’re tight, but here they were loose and jazzy while retaining the funk.View image in fullscreenBrilliant high camp … Sabrina Carpenter performs during the 68th annual Grammy awards.Photograph: Chris Torres/EPAChick Corea extended his recordAmerican jazz fusion pianistChick Corea, celebrated for work with Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock and dozens more over the years, is the most garlanded jazz musician at the Grammys and has extended his record even after his death in 2021, now with 29 awards (third only to Georg Solti and Beyoncé in the overall list). The latest is for best jazz performance, a live rendition of Windows recorded in 2020 but released last year, taken from his final tour: a trio with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade. Windows is a composition from 1966, originally played with Duke Ellington’s son Mercer; more than half a century on, Corea still had the same bird-like inquisitiveness and instinct: it’s a gorgeous and deserving winner, far from a sentimental posthumous nod. It was a good night for sideman McBride: as well as this nimble trio, he showed his capability for much grander playing, his Christian McBride Big Band winning best large jazz ensemble album for Without Further Ado, Vol One – that takes his own winners tally to 11 overall.Chris Stapleton is contractually mandated to win best country performanceInmy pre-Grammy predictionsI thought that Stapleton just couldn’t end up winning this categoryagain, with a one-off song for the F1 movie that didn’t even trouble the country charts let alone the Hot 100. Plus its wild-eyed lyrics feel at odds with his reputation for emotional complexity: “No one’s accusin’ me of sanity / I ain’t everybody’s cup of tea,” he sings, despite sounding like he’s making himself an Earl Grey at the time. But here we are: that’s wins in four of the last five years for Stapleton, and 12 Grammys overall.The Cure won their first Grammy – and their secondThe Cure’s Wish (1992) and Bloodflowers (2000) were each nominated for best alternative music album, but the band had never won a Grammy until this year, when they won two: Songs of a Lost World in the aforementioned category, plus best alternative music performance for Alone. These are richly deserved wins, for an album and song that had a sombre, valedictory feel: bidding goodbye to love, to life, to a whole chapter of human history. The band missed the ceremony to say another farewell, attending the funeral of their multi-instrumentalist Perry Bamonte who recently died aged 65.View image in fullscreenLola Young with Shania Twain at a Grammys afterparty.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty Images​While there weren’t any British nominees for the main four categories, record, song or album of the year, other Brits did very well lower down the categories: most excitingly, Lola Young beating Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Lady Gaga and Chappell Roan to win best pop solo performance with Messy. Pop has longbeen focused on relatable woes but Young reinvigorated the trope with a song that really itched with the frantic feeling of one’s life slipping out of grip. FKA twigs won best dance/electronic album, Cynthia Erivo won best pop duo/group performance with Ariana Grande for Wicked’s Defying Gravity, and Yungblud won best rock performance for his live take on Ozzy Osbourne’s Changes. While giving a heartfelt tribute to Ozzy alongside a weeping Sharon Osbourne, he added: “Rock music’s coming back, watch out pop music, we’re gonna fucking get yer!” Raye was also given a special award for social change for Ice Cream Man, her song about experiencing sexual harassment from a record producer.Vampires defeated demonsThe Recording Academy and the Oscars-deciding Academy are sometimes united when it comes to best score awards, particularly when it comes to Ludwig Göransson, who did the double for both Black Panther and Oppenheimer, and could well do the same for Sinners after triumphing last night. But it was a surprise to seeSinners win best compilation soundtrack for visual media:KPop Demon Hunters, which produced two of the biggest pop groups last year in Huntr/x and Saja Boys, seemed the surefire bet. But in a music industry fearful of AI and determined to underline human-made music, perhaps it’s not surprising that the Academy rejected an animated performance – even if the very human vocal performances were brilliantly done – and Huntr/x duly also lost out to Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in the best pop duo/group performance.Is Cirkut pop’s new superproducer?Grammy awards 2026: list of winnersRead moreCirkut, AKA Canadian musician Henry Walter, won his first producer of the year award, welcoming him into a (notoriously all-male) club alongside the chief architects of modern pop sonics such as Greg Kurstin, Max Martin and Jack Antonoff. A protege of Martin alongside Dr Luke, working on hits such as Katy Perry’s Part of Me and Rihanna’s You Da One, he was in on the ground floor of the Weeknd’s career and co-crafted his two Daft Punk collaborations. He went on to co-produce huge hits such as Miley Cyrus’s Wrecking Ball, but started to edge away from his mentors. Initially his sound was fairly generic and stayed out of the way of its singers (such as Ava Max) but tracks like Sam Smith and Kim Petras’s Unholy lurched around with a trashy neo-electroclash aesthetic, and perhaps that was what earned him a call-up from Lady Gaga: he produced the whole of the excellent Mayhem, which also won best pop album last night. Having also co-produced three tracks on Charli xcx’s Brat, he’s adept at making pop’s edgier artists chime with the mainstream. The danger is that he will end up smoothing off their rough edges, but this win will give him more of a chance to craft an auteurish production style of his own.Explore more on these topicsGrammysGrammy awards 2026Pop and rockICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Billie EilishBad BunnyOlivia DeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We meet the font legend and Porsche loverCatherine SlessorMon 2 Feb 2026 11.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 12.16 ESTShareStuffed with a barrage of road signs, artful modernist chairs and all the tools of her trade, Margaret Calvert’s studio occupies the ground floor of her trim terrace house in Islington, London. She still draws by hand, using coloured pencils, ink pens and gouaches, echoes of a simpler time when there were neither computers nor gazillions of Pantone colour options. “There was also no such thing as graphic design back then,” she says. “It was just called commercial art.”Only a handful of graphic designers have had a typeface named after them. One of the earliest was the 18th-century Italian Giambattista Bodoni, whose fonts have conferred on him a kind of immortality. But his efforts were not to everyone’s taste: William Morris was said to have loathed Bodoni’s letters, grumpily raging at their “sweltering hideousness”.The animal in her cattle sign was based on a real cow named PatienceLike Bodoni, Calvert has been inducted into the graphic equivalent of Mount Olympus. The Calvert typeface can be appreciated on the Tyne and Wear Metro, finessing wayfinding from Gateshead to North Shields and beyond. In fact, the black M on a yellow background, instantly signalling Metro, has become a civic and graphic landmark across the north-east. It might even have cheered up William Morris. No “sweltering hideousness” here.View image in fullscreenMost familiar font in Britain … a hand-lettered 1950s road sign using the Transport typeface designed by Calvert and Jock Kinneir.Photograph: Margaret CalvertDesigned in 1971 for the French new town of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, but rejected for being “too English”, Calvert is a contemporary version of a slab serif. (Serif refers to letters with strokes abutting their ends – you’re reading one now). These bold, attention-grabbing typefaces date from the 19th century. Calvert has been described as having “vitality and elegance, avoiding the stiff and mechanical”. The same might be said of the woman herself.She drew from a very early age. “I would have been three or four,” she recalls. “And I can remember drawing on the floor on huge sheets of paper, not with crayons, just with a pencil. It was always a house with a chimney pot and a family standing in front.” She especially enjoyed life drawing. “I think that’s why I’m so fascinated by typefaces and lettering, because I think of a letter’s form as if it were a skeleton fleshed out in different ways.”View image in fullscreen‘Graphic design was thought to be a man’s discipline’ … Calvert today.Photograph: Neil Spence/AlamyCalvert turns 90 this year and – in an extraordinary design and teaching career that began in the late 50s and still continues – has become the embodiment of a national treasure. She’s even been onTop Gear, hurtling down a motorway in a white Vauxhall Insignia with James May in 2010, discussing the technicalities of road signs, her graphic legacy to the nation. Anyone who has ever driven on a British highway will have encountered the sign system she designed with Jock Kinneir as part of the ambitious postwar modernisation and expansion of the nation’s road network, unifying and rationalising what had become a confusing and potentially hazardous array of lettering styles, colours and sign layouts.Lasting from the late 50s to the mid 60s, this was a colossal undertaking, but Calvert and Kinneir’s lucid, legible and eminently elegant signage has attained design-classic status. Officially implemented in 1965, and largely unchanged, it was “a house style for Britain”, embracing modernity with the aim of making everyday things better for everyone. Roads are safer, driving more pleasurable. Design historian Robin Kinross praised the project for highlighting “the role design could play in public life”.Calvert designed many of the familiar warning pictograms, including the silhouettes of a careering deer and cantering horse, inspired by the pioneering photography of Eadweard Muybridge. Farm animals are denoted by a static cow, based on a real one named Patience she encountered growing up at a relative’s farm in Wiltshire. Calvert herself features on the sign for children crossing, as a girl with distinctive bobbed hair leading a small boy across the road, rather than the other way around. Though she is intensely modest, she always means business.Kinneir, who taught Calvert graphic design at Chelsea College of Art in London and later invited her to join his office, described her as “the student who applied herself most rigorously to what she was doing. She kept her head down and worked like a maniac.”View image in fullscreenMilking it  … Patience helps drivers beware.Photograph: Nigel Lloyd/AlamyAptly, Woman at Work is the title of a mighty new tome in which Calvert relates the intertwined story of her life and career. But it also stands as a history of postwar graphic design in Britain. The cover is a version of her famous “men at work” pictogram, playfully altered to incorporate Calvert’s (still) bobbed hair and a skirt. Visually refined, insightful and wryly humorous, it is quintessential Calvert. Considering the longevity and brilliance of her career, it’s also long overdue – but she was happy to wait and pick her moment.“I think the timing is absolutely right,” she says, “because I’m still involved in interesting design commissions.”Among other things, an exhibition in Kyoto beckons, following a popular 2020 show at London’s Design Museum. And Give Way to Design, a documentary by Argentinian film director Patricio Orozco, tracing the history of road signage in Britain from still extant Roman milestones to the legacy of Calvert and Kinneir, will have its UK preview in March.Born near Durban in South Africa, Calvert came to Britain as a teenager, arriving in 1950. While studying at Chelsea, she luxuriated in a nascent swinging London, loving the freedom of art school where “you could just spend a whole week painting a still life”.View image in fullscreenNow you see it … a motorcyclist in his leathers assesses the legibility of a sign during trials in 1958.Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty ImagesShe seemed destined for a career as an illustrator or art teacher, but then went to work with Kinneir in his cramped mews office in Knightsbridge. “One client described it as ‘A man, a girl and a hole in the wall’,” recalls Calvert. To begin with she did a bit of everything, “including typing, which I taught myself. And I did it really badly. If there’s something you don’t want to do, just do it badly and no one will ask you to do it again.”By 1964 she had been made a partner, and was designing across all scales from luggage labels, posters, letterheads and books, to signage at Gatwick airport and an identity for Britain’s railways, all with the same scrupulous care for supreme clarity and legibility. She hates the word branding, though, saying it reminds her of animals.After Kinneir’s retirement in 1980, she embraced teaching, working at the Royal College of Art for nearly 40 years. “Graphic design was thought to be a man’s discipline,” she says. “So I think it was quite a surprise for people to find me there.” She started out teaching typography to industrial design students. “I got them to redesign the information graphics on parking meters, which some of them took very seriously.”View image in fullscreenThis way! … Calvert’s home studio.Photograph: Margaret CalvertAlthough she became the head of graphic design, her time at the RCA was punctuated by upheavals and imbroglios, with departing heads of department, constant reorganisation and changes to the curriculum. But for her students – many of whom are now successful designers and educators – she was a supportive influence, encouraging critical thinking and exploration of disciplines beyond graphics. One of her former students, Stefan Bufler, a professor of identity design in Augsburg, says she had the ability to “instantly identify any excess baggage that stops an idea from flying”.Transport, the lettering Calvert and Kinneir devised for the road signage commission, is possibly the most familiar font in Britain. It has since migrated into the digital realm, subtly re-conceived by Calvert and Henrik Kubel, another former student. Since 2012, New Transport has been used ongov.uk, the UK government website, its shapes working perfectly within the cybersphere, a testament to its legibility and enduring aesthetic appeal.However, as Calvert memorably describes in Woman at Work, its original gestation was far from straightforward. The very idea of a sans serif typeface (no end strokes) and the use of lower as well as upper case letters (“more legible because you read by word shape”) was challenged by traditionalists.View image in fullscreen‘The battle of the serif’ … the Transport typeface that upset traditionalists.Photograph: Margaret CalvertLaborious trials were undertaken, recorded in archive pictures showing flat-capped men solemnly sitting in an airfield as a car trundles past with a road sign for Oldham and Smethwick strapped to its roof. Ultimately, Calvert and Kinneir – and modernity – prevailed in what she describes as the “Battle of the Serif”. The entire intrigue has the makings of a delicious film drama about Britain’s tortuous relationship with progress, perhaps with the young Margaret played by Jessie Buckley.Apart from the time she used to zip around in a white Porsche 356C (“I bought it for its beauty, but it kept breaking down. It cost me a fortune to run, but I did love it”), Calvert is notoriously unshowy. Much like her work, which does not call attention to itself yet is the essence of human-centred design, easing legibility and movement around everything from transport systems to buildings or websites. “Design for me is a process,” she says. “It’s about improving things. Basically, it’s head, heart and hand.”Woman at Work by Margaret Calvert is published by Thames & Hudson;Give Way to DesignUK preview at the St Bride Foundation, London, on 19 MarchExplore more on these topicsDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Birds can’t be Christians, they said. It’s the most complaints we ever got’Interviews by Simon BlandMon 2 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 12.16 ESTShareBob Mortimer,writer, hostThe first time I saw what was to become Shooting Stars wasVic Reeves– AKA Jim Moir – doing The Big Quiz during Vic Reeves Big Night Out live. I’d never seen anything like it. It was full of meaningless questions and had an attitude. I remember thinking: “There must be something we could do with that.”We got lucky. We were doing a Vic and Bob Christmas TV special and thought we might be able to get away with having that “Big Quiz”. It must have had something as the BBC approached us saying: “We think you could do this as a show.”I’d make the prizes myself. The art department would say: ‘We can do that better. You’re making us look really bad’It was the most intense writing we ever did. We’d sit for hours trying to think up true or false questions, but because we loved it we were happy to give it the time it needed.Jim put George Dawes, played by Matt Lucas, in the romper suit, but after that, anything you see him wearing was Matt’s choice. We wouldn’t know what he was going to wear or say. He would come to me before filming and say: “At some point, can you ask me if I like going to the cinema?” I never let him tell me what this was setting up. Then we were genuinely in hysterics on the show because we hadn’t heard it before.Team captain Mark Lamarr was a gift. Being deadpan is in his nature. He’s not easily impressed. Ulrika Jonsson, the other team captain, actually gave a toss about the show, which was unexpected. She wanted to win.View image in fullscreen‘We were genuinely in hysterics’ … Matt Lucas as George Dawes in 1996.Photograph: Sportsphoto/AllstarLots happened that the guests couldn’t prepare for. We’d sabotage their seats. A good chunk of them would say: “My children love it. I had to go on.” Others were on publicity rounds and I suppose their agents chose the wrong show. Larry Hagman, who played JR in Dallas, seemed unsure of what was going on but went along with it. People always say they’re glad they did it. They may be lying.The challenges were fabulous. I remember dropping cheeses on guests. We pretended to put people in a cage with a monkey and they were terrified. We once wanted to bring a horse into the studio but were told we couldn’t in case it bolted. I don’t know where the Dove from Above round came from. We just thought it’d be funny.There’s before and after Shooting Stars. It altered the parameters for the fun that should be had and the imagination that could be used on panel shows. It was one of the few places where you got a little glimpse into what a celebrity was really like.Jim MoirAKA Vic Reeves,writer, hostWe intended Shooting Stars as a one-off but it worked well so we carried on. When we filmed Big Night Out, we wouldn’t show scripts to the crew, which they hated because they didn’t know where to put the cameras. We did the same with Shooting Stars. We’d say: “Something’s going to happen here but we’re not telling you what.”No one knew about stuff until we did it. I put a stink bomb in Stephen Fry’s shoe that absolutely stunk out the studio. I had a stuffed buzzard with a crucifix around its neck and Christians complained saying: “Birds can’t be Christians.” It’s the most complaints we ever got.I came up with the name George Dawes so we could say his mum was Marjorie Dawes, the dreadful dietician in Little Britain. We didn’t hear his songs until the night.Peanuts is my favourite. There’s nothing to it apart from him saying “Peanuts”. We were creased up.Guests would have too many in the green room – knowing they might be in for an ordealBob had seen Ulrika presenting the weather and having a laugh. We thought she looked like she had gravitas. Mark had leftThe Word. I said: “Could you start filming next week?” He said: “Yeah.” It was as easy as that. I got the feeling he didn’t think any of it was funny. Calling him a 1950s throwback was a throwaway comment that stuck. “Ulrika-ka-ka” was Bob trying to do a song echo. We told them to have a go at us: they’d give back as good as they got.A few guests had too many in the green room because they knew they might be in for some kind of ordeal. Bee Gee Robin Gibb would only appear if we promoted his new single, so we paused everything during the show, listened to it, then went: “Right, let’s carry on.” Rubbing my knees came from a kids’ Christmas record where you could hear some old fella rubbing his legs as he sang. I thought it was really funny. It became a regular thing. Same with raising handbags and going “Ooooh!” People still do that but I don’t think they know where it comes from.We needed some sound or word to end rounds so I just said “Eranu” and “Uvavu” and Bob said, “That’ll do.” I saw Paul Shane on Pebble Mill at One doing You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling. He was proper like those old club singers, so I started doing songs in that style. Mark would always guess them right, no matter how disjointed they were.I’d sometimes make the prizes myself. The art department would say: “I can make that look better.” But I’d say: “No.” Same with makeup. I liked drawing lines on my face. They’d said: “You’re making us look really bad.”The show was an antidote to comedy. It was a format people could get their head around – and then we went sideways with it.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeVic ReevesBob MortimerComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.You’re performing your biggest solo concert to date, at the London Palladium. How do you put a set list together?It depends on whether you’re working for someone or for yourself. You have to do what other people want a lot of the time, which is totally fine – most of the stuff I’m asked to do is from my catalogue and I love it. Only one or two songs fill me with dread if I see them on a requests sheet. And to be honest, I always get to them and they’re fine anyway. But putting a show like this together is completely different because it’s about me and my life. The concert is based on ideas we had last year for my Glastonbury set where it was very much music to music, quick introductions, keep it moving. That was right for that gig but this time I am exploring what these songs mean and who I am now. I’m going to talk to the audience in a different way to how I have before. I’ve shied away from singing more than one song from the same show in the past. But I’m playing the London Palladium while carrying my daughter. And Jenna inWaitressgoes through everything while carrying her child. I don’t want to pass up the opportunity to sing songs that really relate to what’s going on so there will definitely be more than one song from Waitress.View image in fullscreenLucie Jones in Waitress at the Adelphi theatre, London, in 2019.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesWhat does the Palladium itself mean to you?I’ve always known that it was the pinnacle. The history that’s in the walls of that building! You walk in and you can almost hear its secrets being whispered. Growing up I listened to Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli’s double album Live at theLondon Palladium. I’ve performed there quite a lot with other artists. Every single time I’ve walked in through the stage door, my stomach’s flippedIt’s rare for a musical theatre star to play Glastonbury. Did you worry that the audience would be too cool for musicals?Not at all. I don’t have that fear any more.Musicalsarecool! And people who say that they’re not cool … well, they’re not our people anyway. I knew that there would be a lot of people who would feel very excited to belt out Defying Gravity in a field. We weren’t even breaking the mould, we were creating a new mould. And, yes, there may be hundreds of thousands of people on site, but there are hundreds and hundreds of things to do at any one moment. So I was slightly concerned that even though there were a lot of people that might have enjoyed it, there might have been something else that they would also enjoy going on elsewhere at the same time. On the first night, I was walking up towards the stage saying to my partner, George: “Fucking hell, what if no one comes?” It’s a total punt! But then instantly it’s like, no, I’m here with the best musical director there is, Jon Ranger, and the perfect musicians for this setting. And my partner and my parents will be there at least. And my makeup artist. So that’s four! But we went out and there was about 5,000 people trying to ram into a tent for 3,000. That’s a real testament to musicals being cool now.View image in fullscreenLucie Jones as Fantine in Les Misérables in 2025.Photograph: Johan PerssonHow has it been returning to Les Misérables, which was your training ground for musical theatre?I played Cosette in 2010. This is my sixth go at Les Mis and I’m playing Fantine, who fights until her last breath for what’s good and right for her child. To be doing it now with my daughter is bonkers. The company have been incredible. The costume department is making sure I’m comfortable. There are quite a lot of fights involved with Fantine. They have to look awful, the audience has to gasp. The fight direction team and the choreographers are constantly working and asking if things feel good and they do. The other night I was on stage at the end of the show for the Epilogue. It’s one of my favourite moments in musical theatre. I’m not a religious person, but we sing the line “To love another person / is to see the face of God”. It’s a three-part harmony and it always takes my breath away, which is not helpful when you’re singing, but it’s a beautiful moment. And my daughter started kicking in that moment. She was really going for it. Having her there with me, in the thick of it all, has changed the way that I do the role.Les Misérables: a musical full of heart and hope that continues to defy its criticsRead moreAs a former Elphaba on stage, what did you make of thesecond Wicked film?The first one was fantastic and the second one is still really magical. There are some incredible performances in it. I think once you’ve seen a world created so beautifully and it’s taken your breath away in such a way that the first movie did for us all, it’s a really difficult task to bring us back in and reboot that to a new level which I think is maybe what people expected. But you can’t – we already know, we’ve gone in and been blown away by it. Let that carry through and bring you into the second movie, I would say. I’ve seen it a couple of times and really enjoyed it.Is there some kind of WhatsApp group for Elphabas?I wouldn’t want to out anything but … there’s definitely communication between us! And it doesn’t just stay with London, you know, it’s worldwide. I was invited into that fold when I booked the job – and it’s continued which is lovely.Lucie Jones is at theLondon Palladiumon 16 February.

Sultan may not have been fit for service but, with that short phrase, the report identified the essential quality that would make him a great photographer of American domestic life.The report is included in a new book, Water Over Thunder, published in collaboration with Sultan’s widow Kelly and son Max. In a career that began in the 1970s and lasted until his death in 2009 at the age of 63, Sultan was never confined to a single genre, but rather moved between documentary, fiction and appropriation. He photographed the ordinary middle-class homes of the San Fernando Valley in California rented out for porn shoots, made a portrait of Paris Hilton in his parents’ bedroom, and took underwater pictures of people learning to swim in San Francisco.I worried that my shots told my parents: This is what I really think about youHe photographed it all with a hazy familiarity and an eye for the idiosyncratic and ironic. “He hoped that by focusing on daily life,” Kelly once said, “he would capture something mysterious that was just out of view. When you slow life down, and look in between those big events that you think to capture, you see the stuff that people live every day, and that’s what really hits home.”Born in Brooklyn in 1946 to Jewish parents, Sultan relocated to Los Angeles with his family in 1950 as part of the “postwar quest for a better life”, as the photographer puts it in a passage included in Water Over Thunder, the first publication devoted to his writing. His relationship with his father was complicated: “He was pissed that I was an artist and he gave me a hard time. He called me a loser.”View image in fullscreenUnforgettable avocado … Sultan’s dad, from the series Pictures from Home.Photograph: © The Estate of Larry Sultan. Courtesy of MACK.Water Over Thunder unfolds as an informal autobiography, piecing together Sultan’s reflections on his first forays into photography and his ideas about it, alongside personal ephemera, journal entries, letters, postcards and, of course, his images. It all adds up to an intimate and unprecedented portrait of the photographer, in his own words.Sultan grew up in the San Fernando Valley, returning there to make The Valley, his porn set odyssey. In the course of more than 100 shots, taken from 1998 to 2004, he captured fabulously kitsch interiors of these rented-out homes, full of ornately carved wooden furniture and anodyne animal and nature paintings, along with zebra-print rugs and vases of fake flowers. Occasionally, we even glimpse naked actors, relaxing between shoots with rollers in their hair, as fully dressed crew members organise their equipment.“Taylor is sitting in the shade completely exhausted,” he writes of one shoot he sat in on. “She is eating a piece of toast with raspberry jam. I can see that some crumbs have fallen on her naked belly. As if to apologise, she explains that she hasn’t eaten all day because she doesn’t like to eat before an anal scene.”The Valley was a visually mesmerising, if faintly uncomfortable, reimagining of the stereotypical US home as a theatre for performed desire, yet Sultan makes you wonder if its various scenes are really so very different from the staged fantasy of modern American family life. “I feel like a forensic photographer searching out evidence,” he writes of The Valley. “I’m planted squarely in the terrain of my own ambivalence – that rich and fertile field that stretches out between fascination and repulsion, desire and loss. I’m home again.”Sultan called home a “big influence” and all his major work was made in, and about, suburban California. In the 1970s, he moved from the valley to the Bay Area to study photography at the San Francisco Art Institute. “The times were so interesting,” he writes. “The streets were so interesting. So being a photographer allowed me to witness and to participate in a way that felt right for my blend of being alienated.”View image in fullscreenUnder the surface … Sultan’s shot of people learning to swim in San Francisco.Photograph: © The Estate of Larry Sultan/courtesy of MackIt was an exciting time for photography in the US. The 1970s birthed the Pictures Generation, a group of New York-based artists spearheaded by Cindy Sherman and Richard Prince, who directed photography, film and performance at booming consumer culture. But San Francisco’s scene, Sultan writes, “bored me to tears”. He goes on: “I didn’t understand the language of academic critique, and I didn’t feel comfortable sitting in cafe culture.” Food was a different matter though. “I was interested in Bob’s Big Boy combo plates with thousand island dressing and french fries.”Sultan befriended a fellow art institute student from San Fernando, Mike Mandel, with whom he shared a love of postwar pop, postcards, billboards and a “non-artful view of the world”. The two became collaborators and, with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, produced a groundbreaking, coolly subversive work called Evidence, published in 1977.Considered one of the first works of conceptual photography, Evidence presents 59 uncaptioned black and white photographs. Over a period of two years, the pair combed through thousands of archival images belonging to government and corporate institutions, including General Atomic, Nasa, the US Navy and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.Taken out of their original context, these images of crime scenes, scientific experiments and engineering tests become bizarre and even poetic. A man wearing a bag on his head is set on fire; an astronaut does push-ups; men in hard hats stand in a sea of white foam. They’re images that capture the excitement of this dawning age of technological innovation and advancement – but also the human need to go forth, conquer and control.View image in fullscreen‘My blend of alienation’ … Sultan in the series Homeland.Photograph: © The Estate of Larry Sultan/courtesy of MackSultan was also willing to hold his own life up to scrutiny. His most famous work, Pictures from Home, depicts his ageing parents at home in the valley suburbs. They tinker with a vacuum cleaner, his mother dressed in bright pink socks and a matching hoodie. They play chess and argue in the driveway. His father, dressed in leggings, practises his golf swing in the living room, with its unforgettable avocado walls and matching carpet.Sultan used his parents as a symbol for how the “Republicans had hijacked the family and family values and they had turned it into an ideological tool. I felt the family they were talking about was quite oppressive, and I felt that family was one of the most complicated, unnerving institutions. Yet it is the institution most of us believe in.”The pictures have all the tenderness and affection of a family album, albeit without sentimentality. But they also speak of a disenchantment with the American dream and its impact on family dynamics. Sultan’s father was an orphan who, despite his working-class background, worked his way up to become vice-president of Schick Razors. But he lost his job in his 50s when the company was sold and never worked again.View image in fullscreenOn his bike … a self-portrait from 1971.Photograph: © The Estate of Larry Sultan/courtesy of MackPictures from Home was the result of nine years spent photographing and interviewing his parents. They became de facto collaborators, although in Water Over Thunder, Sultan recalls his nerves on showing them his prints for the first time, carefully placing the most flattering ones at the top. “Even though I was going to show them pictures of themselves, I felt like I was about to say, ‘Let me show you what I really think about you’ – and reveal thoughts and secrets that I felt guilty for having. There was no doubt about it, I was a bad son.”Way ahead of its time, Pictures from Home showed how private images could find a place in public, encouraging us to examine how we see ourselves and want to be seen. It also showed the healing potential of art. “It allowed me to resolve a lot of my issues with my family,” writes Sultan.Water Over Thunder also tells us what things Sultan was drawn to, even including a list he jotted down of his five favourite films (No 1: sci-fi classicThe Incredible Shrinking Man). Teaching was as important to him as photography. This career began at his alma mater in 1978, continuing at California College of the Arts, where he was a professor in the photo department for two decades.It began as a way of supporting his photography but soon became an essential part of who he was. He fondly describes his students as “fellow travellers”. A teaching schedule reproduced in the book includes discussions of Nan Goldin as well as ballroom-dancing lessons.Artist Carmen Winant, who was taught by Sultan, remembers him as a “deeply funny, kind, sharp and devoted teacher”. What about his photography and its influence? “He remains a giant,” she says. “Although he had many endearing qualities, the one that I remember most was his curiosity. He used to say, ‘Isn’t that endlessly fascinating?’”Water Over Thunder: Selected Writingsby Larry Sultan is published by Mack, £40This article was amended on 2 February 2026.

What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.‘This train isn’t going to stop’: shocking Sundance film shows promises and perils of AIRead moreThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.It is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.Because, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.It’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.On This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.But surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.It will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.Less than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.But this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.Explore more on these topicsDarren AronofskyAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has been a fugitive from the US ever since.Samantha Geimer on Roman Polanski: ‘We email a little bit’Read moreThe new film will be the feature writing-directing debut for French-American film-maker Marina Ziolkowski, whose short 19 was nominated for a César – the French Oscars – in 2021. Dree Hemingway, from Sean Baker’s Starlet, and The Substance’s Gore Abrams will star as Geimer’s parents Susan and Bob, while the title role will be played by 13-year-old American-Ukrainian newcomer Carolyn Kachen. Producers said Kachen, whose theater credits include Annie and Matilda, was selected from hundreds of young actors following “a striking audition that signals a breakout” talent, according toDeadline.Per the logline, the film “revisits one of Hollywood’s most notorious scandals through the eyes of the person most misrepresented by it … As the case erupts across headlines, Samantha and her mother are thrust into a relentless media storm – she’s hounded by paparazzi and stripped of privacy at the moment where she most needs protection. Together, mother and daughter must fight to reclaim Samantha’s voice and preserve what remains of her childhood.”Geimer, who has since forgiven Polanski and remained in periodic contact with him, said in statement: “This story has been a lifelong burden for all of us involved. I never imagined it could be transformed into something beautiful. Marina’s creativity and sensitivity made that possible – and that, to me, is a gift.”While reading Geimer’s memoir, Ziolkowski was struck by her “voice – clear, courageous, and long erased from the public narrative”, the director said in a statement. “This film is not about Roman Polanski; it is about returning Samantha’s story to her after years of being shaped by others. Told entirely through Samantha’s memories and inner life, the film restores her agency and complexity. Intimate and immersive, The Girl is a deeply human act of reclamation – confronting how power, myth, and media distortion erased a child’s truth, and honoring her resilience.”The project, one of the rare European productions to secure a US tax credit, will begin shooting in Los Angeles later this year.Separate from Geimer, four other women came forward between 2017 and 2019 accusing Polanski of abusing them in the 1970s – three of them were minors, including the artist Marianne Barnard who said Polanski sexually assaulted her when she was 10. In 2010, the British actor Charlotte Lewis accused Polanski of sexually assaulting her in 1983 when she was 16.Polanski, now 92, has denied all of the allegations. In May 2024,a French court acquitted Polanskiof defaming Lewis after he denied raping her when she was a teenager. That October, another lawsuit concerning an alleged sexual assault of a 16-year-old in 1973, was dismissed after a settlement to “the mutual satisfaction of both parties”.Explore more on these topicsRoman PolanskiRape and sexual assaultnewsShareReuse this content"

The film, which cost Amazon $40m to buy and $35m to promote, screened in 155 cinemas across the UK and Ireland, taking £32,974 overall, with a site average of £212.80.Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreThis result will have the distributors breathing a sigh of relief as – despite the modest takings – this is far from the disaster many anticipated. The scale of the rollout was unprecedented in the UK documentary sector, where most titles are capped at around 25 locations.Melania’s take is just shy of the £33,000 achieved byPrime Minister– the recent documentary about the former New Zealand leader Jacinda Ardern – over its first weekend of release. That film was out on 28 UK screens (18% of Melania’s rollout total) making a site average of £1,178.57 (more than five times greater than Melania).While many screenings of Melania were either empty or very sparsely attended, some were sold out. The early afternoon showing at the Vue Islington in London, for instance, had to turn away prospective punters, who were nearly all journalists.Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet topped the UK box office on its fourth weekend of release, making £1,412,612 across 737 locations for a site average of £1,917. This was just a ticket or two above The Housemaid, Paul Feig’s erotic thriller, which took £1,399,262 on its sixth week of release, across 596 locations for a £2,348 site average.One adult for the 9.40am in Sittingbourne: a front row seat for Melania’s ominous UK openingRead moreThe top five was rounded out by two other new releases – Shelter (£946,903) and Iron Lung (£948,731) – and Zootropolis 2, which took £855,208 on its 10th week of release.Further chart information is currently unavailable from tracking and analytics company Comscore, but a representative did add that Melania was the ninth best performing new release of the week. Twelve new titles were out in the UK last Friday, including Bollywood releases Mardaani 3 and Gandhi Talks, which are both out in a limited number of screens.While international box office is yet to report, the film has defied its dire expectations in the US, entering the charts at No 3 and taking $7m. In order to break even, Ratner’s film will need to take around $100m globally.The film is currently scoring10%on reviews aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, and hasseven out of 100on Metacritic. Meanwhile it currently has a rating of1.3/10from over 22,000 votes on the Internet Movie Database, as well as the same score on social media reviewing site Letterboxd. This is a rise from the 1.0 it hit earlier on the weekend on IMDb, making it their lowest-rated movie of all time.Explore more on these topicsMelaniaFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities have so released no information about the charges against those detained.It Was Just an Accident, whichwon the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival in 2025, is a contender for best international feature film and best screenplay at the Oscars on 15 March.The film follows a group of Iranian former political prisoners grappling with whether to exact revenge on a man they believe tortured them in prison.Mahmoudian is primarily known as a journalist and human rights activist. He met the film’s director, the veteran auteurJafar Panahi, in prison.In a statement shared with the Guardian, Panahi praised Mahmoudian’s “calm demeanor”, “kind conduct”, and “rare sense of responsibility toward others”.View image in fullscreenJafar Panahi (pictured) praised Mahmoudian’s ‘rare sense of responsibility toward others’.Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA“Whenever a new prisoner arrived, Mehdi would try to provide them with basic necessities and, more importantly, offer reassurance,” Panahi said. “He became a quiet pillar inside the prison – someone inmates of all beliefs and backgrounds trusted and confided in.”After Mahmoudian’s release, Panahi invited him to refine the screenplay’s dialogue, drawing on his nine-year experience behind bars.“Mehdi Mahmoudian is not just a human rights activist and a prisoner of conscience,” Panahi said. “He is a witness, a listener, and a rare moral presence … whose absence is immediately felt, both inside prison walls and beyond them.”Large protests against the regime’s handling of Iran’s deepening economic crisis erupted across the country in late December. The regime responded withan internet blackoutandsevere crackdowns.Iran’s official death toll, released by the Martyrs Foundation, is 3,117, including members of the security services. However, networks of medical professionals inside and outside the countryestimate the actual numbercould exceed 30,000.Explore more on these topicsIranOscars 2026Jafar PanahiCannes film festivalFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rowling serves as an executive producer on the upcoming series, which is being produced by HBO and will be one of the most expensively produced television shows of all time.“I take the subject extremely seriously,” Lithgow told the audience,reported by the Hollywood Reporter. “JK Rowling has created this amazing canon for young people, young kids’ literature that has jumped into the consciousness of society. Young and old people love Harry Potter and the Harry Potter stories. It’s so much about acceptance. It’s about good versus evil. It’s about kindness versus cruelty. It’s deeply felt.”“I find it ironic and somewhat inexplicable that Rowling has expressed such views,” he added. “I’ve read about them, and I’ve never met her. She’s not really involved in this production at all. The people who are re-adapting Harry Potter and turning it into an eight-year-long TV series are remarkable. … These are people I really want to work with.”“It upsets me when people are vehemently opposed to me having anything to do with this,” he added. “But in Potter canon you see no trace of transphobic sensitivity. She has written this meditation of kindness and acceptance. And Dumbledore is a beautiful role.”‘Please walk away from Harry Potter’: why the stars of HBO’s new TV show are in for decades of social media hellRead moreWhen Lithgow wasannounced as Dumbledore, he revealed that a friend with a trans child had sent hima link to an articleentitled: “An open letter to John Lithgow: Please walk away from Harry Potter.”“It was a hard decision,” Lithgow said, in Rotterdam. “It made me uncomfortable and unhappy that people insisted I walk away from the job. I chose not to do that.”Variety reportedthat one audience member expressed their disappointment to Lithgow about his decision to remain in the show, later leaving the room in protest. “I’m perfectly ready for collisions of opinion. I understand it,” Lithgow said afterwards.In 2020,Rowling posted a 3,600-word online statementcriticising proposed changes to gender recognition laws by detailing her own experience of sexual assault and domestic violence. She has stated she opposes “the new trans activism” and opposes cisgender women sharing single-sex spaces with trans women, saying it would mean women were forced to “open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside”.She donated £70,000 to For Women Scotland, the campaign group who played a key role in bringing about the challenge of how a woman is defined in law, and founded theJK RowlingWomen’s Fund, which supports individuals and organisations “fighting to retain women’s sex-based rights”.Other actors in the Harry Potter series, including Nick Frost, who plays Hagrid, and Paapa Essiedu, who plays Snape, havedistanced themselves from Rowling’s views since signing on to the show.Last year Rowling saidshe would not fire Essiedufor signing a petition in favour of trans rights, writing on social media: “I don’t have the power to sack an actor from the series and I wouldn’t exercise it if I did. I don’t believe in taking away people’s jobs or livelihoods because they hold legally protected beliefs that differ from mine.”The lead actors in the original Potter films, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, as well as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them star Eddie Redmayne, have allmade critical statements distancingthemselves from Rowling.The new Potter series is due to premiere in 2027 and, according to HBO, will be a “faithful adaptation” of the books by Rowling. The eight feature films based on the books were released between 2001 and 2011, and the series has a similarly ambitious timeframe, with Casey Bloys, chair and CEO of HBO and Max Content, sayingit would run for “10 consecutive years”.Lithgow alluded to this in Rotterdam, joking: “I’m the oldest person in this entire room, just turned 80. And yet I signed a contract – I will be playing Dumbledore for the next eight years! I absolutely have to keep at it. I felt: ‘Wow! That means I will live to be 88.’ I have that in writing.”Explore more on these topicsJK RowlingJohn LithgowTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Now a secret that has remained hidden for nearly 500 years has been discovered beneath the layers of paint.Scientific analysis of the painting at Hever Castle, her childhood home inKent, has uncovered evidence that an Elizabethan artist sought to create a “visual rebuttal” to claims that Henry VIII’s ill-fated wife was a witch with a sixth finger on her right hand.While dendrochronological or tree-ring analysis has dated the oak panel to about 1583 – within the reign of Anne’s daughter, Elizabeth I – infrared technology has uncovered a dramatic underdrawing.View image in fullscreenThe Hever portrait of Anne Boleyn depicts the mother of Elizabeth I and is believed to have been painted during the latter’s reign.Photograph: Hever CastleA discarded triangular form beneath Anne’s right arm is thought to record the precise moment that the artist departed from an inherited design, deciding instead to show Anne holding a red rose, with her hands and fingers clearly visible.In the 16th century, artists used “patterns” drawn from life in brief sittings, so that they could reproduce royal portraits consistently. These were circulated between workshops as approved likenesses.The Hever “Rose” underdrawing shows that the artist initially used the so-called “B” pattern, which generally focused on Anne’s head and shoulders, before adapting it “to debunk the slander of the day” as a lie.Dr Owen Emmerson, an assistant curator at Hever, said: “By clearly displaying five digits on each hand, the portrait acts as a visual rebuttal to hostile rumours and as a defence of Anne Boleyn – and, by extension, of her daughter Elizabeth’s legitimacy.”Anne was imprisoned for adultery in the Tower of London in 1536. Although she denied the charges, she was found guilty of treason and beheaded. Her only crime had been her failure to give Henry VIII a son.The king had divorced the first of his six wives, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne – a marriage that led him to break with the Catholic church and brought about the English Reformation. Henry VIII removed all traces of Anne from the royal palaces and no portrait painted during her lifetime is thought to have survived.The Hever team conclude from the latest analysis that their portrait is the earliest scientifically dated panel portrait of Anne currently known, created when her image was being consciously re-examined during Elizabeth I’s reign, at a time of intense political and religious anxiety.View image in fullscreenThe portrait undergoes scientific analysis at Hever Castle, Anne Boleyn’s childhood home.Photograph: Hever CastleIn her 2025 book, The Many Faces of Anne Boleyn, Helene Harrison suggested that Anne’s hands were prominently displayed in the Hever Rose portrait to counter claims by Nicholas Sanders, a 16th-century writer and activist, who campaigned for the restoration of Roman Catholicism in England. He sought to undermine Elizabeth I’s legitimacy, writing that Anne had “on her right hand six fingers”. On being told of the new evidence, Harrison said it was amazing to find that the analysis supported her theory.Kate McCaffrey, who is also an assistant curator at Hever, said: “It’s really thrilling. This is very strong evidence of a visual rebuttal of a very specific myth of witchcraft and six fingers, which is really quite extraordinary. The scientific analysis extends this to a very specific political moment in time.‘It’s astonishing how well it has lasted’: Anglesey marks 200th anniversary of beloved bridgeRead more“It’s Elizabeth’s way of not only reclaiming her own legitimacy and lineage, but also restoring the legitimacy of her mother. It’s impossible to say that Elizabeth herself commissioned this portrait, but it certainly seems too much of a coincidence for it not to be in response to rumours that were circulating at this time.”The dendrochronology was undertaken by Ian Tyers, an independent specialist, while infrared reflectography and material analysis were conducted at the Hamilton Kerr Institute, University of Cambridge.The portrait will feature in a forthcoming exhibition at Hever, titled Capturing a Queen: The Image of Anne Boleyn. It will explore how Anne’s image was “created, deliberately altered and politically deployed”.For her contemporaries, beauty was in the eye of the beholder. While the Venetian ambassador Francesco Sanuto described her as “not one of the handsomest women in the world”, the German humanist Simon Grynaeus thought she was “good-looking”.McCaffrey said: “Her appeal lay in her intelligence, confidence and charisma. That is what caught Henry’s eye and heart.”Capturing a Queen: The Image of Anne Boleyn opens on11 February, running until2 January 2027.Explore more on these topicsMonarchyPaintingArtKentExhibitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2021 his photo essayPantanal Ablazewas awarded first place in the environment stories category at the World Press Photo contest. In 2022, he won the Eugene Smith grant in humanistic photography and World Press Photo’s long-term project award for his workAmazonian Dystopia, which documents the exploitation of the world’s largest tropical forest.View image in fullscreenA tree reduced to ashes on scorched pasture at São Francisco Ranch, in the rural zone of Santo Antônio de Leverger, Mato Grosso, 2020I have been photographing socio-environmental issues for more than 30 years, especially in the Amazon. 2020 was no different. News of the uncontrolled fires devastating the Pantanal began to catch my attention. So, together with a fellow journalist, I decided to go and see what was happening for myself.It was a shock when we arrived in the region. The fire was out of control and there was almost no firefighting. I had seen many fires in the Amazon, but nothing compared to this. The saddest thing was seeing the number of animals killed by the fire. Even worse were the injured, burned and orphaned animals. 2020 was a tragedy. That same year, I returned three more times to monitor the fires in the Pantanal. And since then, I have continued to return to photograph the region.View image in fullscreenBoys watch the fire skirt the Paraíso ranch retreat, Nhecolândia, South Pantanal, 2024We were on our way to a farm in the rural area of Aquidauana, where firefighters and brigade members were battling a large fire. Along the route, we began to see several columns of smoke on the horizon. I stopped to photograph a small fire near the Paraíso farm. In a few minutes, driven by the wind, the fire gained strength and speed, forming a column of smoke that stretched for miles. We had to leave quickly so we wouldn’t be swallowed up by the fire.The unbearable heat, the noise of the burning vegetation, the suffocating smoke, all covered by an orange light, is a scene I will never forget. Pure apocalypse.View image in fullscreenA marsh deer retreats to a pond to protect itself from the fires burning along the sides of the BR-262 roadway in Mato Grosso do Sul, 2020BR-262, the main road that cuts through the southern part of the Pantanal, was engulfed by numerous fires in 2020. Surrounded by fire on all sides, many animals sought shelter in the waters of small ponds located along the roadside.On the day this photo was taken, we saw dozens of marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) in these small lagoons, a scene unthinkable in normal times. Usually shy around people, the deer seemed stunned, unresponsive to our presence, with no other option for survival.View image in fullscreenA fire brigade plane assists Sesc Porto Cercado firefighters tackling a forest fire in 2020When we arrived in the Pantanal to cover the 2020 fires for the first time, we were shocked. The hotel, which served as a base for firefighters and brigade members, was surrounded by flames and being evacuated. Despite warnings about the fire situation, there was no organised response, and the Pantanal was left to fend for itself. There were thousands of fires scattered throughout the biome.One day, while travelling along the Transpantaneira highway, I came across a lone firefighter who was watching a wooden bridge burning without reacting. He said to me in a resigned voice: “There’s nothing more to be done here. The fire in the Pantanal will only end when it rains or when everything burns down. Whichever comes first.” And he was right. The fire only stopped when the rains came.View image in fullscreenFire sweeps through the vegetation at Paraíso Ranch in Nhecolândia, Mato Grosso do Sul, 2024In August 2024, the Pantanal started burning furiously again. My idea was to reach the place where the blaze that hit the Nhecolândia region had begun. Halfway there, we started seeing the first signs of fire. The drift smoke was thickening as we drove along the sandy road, so we stopped at a retreat on Paraíso Ranch for information and to find out if we’d be able to go any further. The tall brush surrounding the house was slowly burning, but still at a safe distance.Within minutes, though, the wind picked up and what had been just a small spot of fire was whipped into a thick wall of flames and smoke. The indraft created by the heat from the blaze was feeding it even more, sucking it forwards through the woods, destroying everything in sight. The heat, smoke, orange-tinged air, and the crackle of the burning trees generated this hellish atmosphere. Seeing a fire like that up close is a terrifying experience. That night, when I lay my head on the pillow, I couldn’t stop thinking about that scene.View image in fullscreenA marsh deer crosses the Transpantanal roadway amid thick smoke from the forest fire. Poconé, Mato Grosso, 2020The Transpantaneira highway is a park road located in the north of the Pantanal, and perhaps one of the best places inBrazilto spot wildlife. During the 2020 fires, it was common to find dead and carbonised animals on the side of the road, especially alligators, snakes and tortoises, which have more difficulty moving around.But the saddest and most striking thing was finding the survivors. Injured or not, the animals looked like zombies, completely lost, not knowing where to go amid the smoke. Fleeing the fire or looking for a source of water amid the extreme drought, it was common to find alligators, coatis, armadillos, monkeys and deer wandering aimlessly along the road.View image in fullscreenFirefighters from Prevfogo, brought down from Piauí, ride in a truck back to the wildfire on Santa Tereza Ranch, Mato Grosso, 2020While photographing the fires in an isolated region of Serra do Amolar, near Corumbá, I had the opportunity to accompany the work of the Prevfogo fire brigade from Ibama, the federal environmental agency. They are the most qualified workforce for fighting forest fires in Brazil. This group, made up of farmers from the state of Piauí, had travelled thousands of kilometres by car to help fight the fires in the Pantanal.The resilience and commitment of these men was impressive. They worked 12 hours a day, under a 40-degree sun, amid fire and smoke, risking their lives. While I could only endure a few hours of photographing in these conditions, they spent the entire day there. They are anonymous heroes. Being alongside these firefighters and watching them work was the only thing that made me feel optimistic during the 2020 fires.View image in fullscreenDevastated by the 2020 wildfires, Santa Tereza Ranch, in Serra do Amolar, was destroyed again in 2024.In 2024, I went back to Santa Tereza. I knew that there were numerous fires burning on the ranch, but I had no idea that it would be 2020 all over again. The blaze just swept right through, and, just like before, I saw an enormous number of dead animals: tapir, monkeys, birds. I had previously thought that the 2020 fires were a freak accident.But seeing all that again, in person, made me wonder if perhaps that was the new reality in the Pantanal. The new normal. The biome is highly resilient, but with these tragedies repeating at such short intervals, with frequent, intense wildfires fuelled by water-loss and drought, there just isn’t time for it to recover.Worse: even with people now better prepared and more aware of what’s happening in the Pantanal, nothing has been able to contain the fires. Seeing all that up close was gut-wrenching; a reality check.View image in fullscreenVolunteer firefighters assess the wildfire on Jofre Velho Ranch, Porto Jofre, Mato Grosso, 2020The reality of the Pantanal serves as a very instructive example of the impacts of human actions on Earth.

His 2008 Booker-longlisted debut,A Case of Exploding Mangoes, was a scabrously comic portrait of General Zia-ul-Haq in the days leading up to his death in a suspicious plane crash in 1988. Masquerading as a whodunnit, it was a satire of religiosity and military authoritarianism. Dark, irony-soaked comedy that marries farce to unsparing truth-telling was also the chosen mode for other vexed subjects, from violence against women and religious minorities inOur Lady of Alice Bhattito the war machine inRed Birds.Hanif’s prickly new novel confirms his standing as one of south Asia’s most unnervingly funny and subversive voices. The story kicks off right after ousted socialist PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto is put to death by army chief turned autocrat Zia. Following the execution, disgraced intelligence officer Gul has been posted to OK Town, a sleepy backwater where he “would need to create his own entertainment and come up with a mission to shine on this punishment posting”.He’s in luck, sort of. Bhutto’s sympathisers, the so-called “jiyalas”, are heartbroken and angry; many believe he is still alive, that the military government is hiding him, and some, to Gul’s horror, are setting themselves on fire. Gul sets to work, quashing protests. Known as “Piston” among his peers, he has another reputation to uphold, and he does so with equal commitment, never mind that a woman is carrying his child.Hanif fuses slapstick and the fun of a cat-and-mouse thriller with the serious reckoning work of a state-of-the-nation novelMeanwhile, trouble is at the door of Sir Baghi’s Rebel English Academy, a tuition centre for basic English tucked within the compound of the local mosque. Imam Molly brings an unexpected visitor, Sabiha. Sabiha’s husband has just died in a mysterious fire; her parents, Bhutto loyalists, are political prisoners; she has a pistol and, worse, an attitude. Could Baghi put her up for a while? Beholden to Molly in more ways than one, Baghi is not in a position to refuse.The academy is a place of learning, and to remain there Sabiha must live as a student: “Write what the other students write,” he tells her. “But remember you are no ordinary student: you are a witness to history.” Thus begins a series of first-person chapters, “homeworks” threaded through the main narrative, in which Sabiha recounts her tragic life story and names the perpetrators. Already suspect as a lapsed Marxist and a gay man with a dangerous cruising habit, Baghi now also shelters a fugitive who is desirable to the thuggish Gul.Smart, taut and electrifying, the tale fuses slapstick and the fun of a cat-and-mouse thriller with the serious reckoning work of a state-of-the-nation novel. It powerfully confronts rape culture, media censorship and the suppression of dissent. One of its achievements is to reclaim hearsay and gossip from the margins of formal politics and make them integral to its narrative engine, effectively dramatising how they can unsettle the monopoly of state-sanctioned truth, and testify to the pressures of enforced silence.Running through the book is a sly polemic against Pakistan’s pervasive cult ofshahadat,or martyrdom. One character (cheekily named Shahid, the Arabic word for martyr) is keen to capture his own self-immolation on video, while the perpetually lustful Gul pretends to be a soldier, “bored in the trenches, ready for martyrdom”, to lure women to his bed. Hanif’s critique is multibarrelled, targeting not only corrupt power of various kinds – military, religious, patriarchal – but also the gift of salvation such institutions claim to proffer. His feminism is tough and purposive, while on the subject of faith he is unafraid to violate taboos or flirt with heresy. What preoccupies Hanif is the instrumentalisation of the Qur’an. In his debut novel, Zia treats it as an oracle, riffling through its pages for verses that endorse his grand ambitions. Here, Molly uses it to more carnal ends: to justify taking a second wife, cloaking the exploitation of a vulnerable young widow in the language of righteousness.Defined by secular and religious convictions respectively, Baghi and Molly function as ideological counterweights. While Molly embraces a kind of religious absolutism, insisting that “my only politics is Allah”, Baghi is animated by doubt, dismissing religion as the “opium of the masses” and seeing it as his mission to liberate countryfolk from the “twin yokes of capitalism and feudalism”. Hanif presents them both as far from exemplary, and while his book resists any trite allegory of the nation, the pair’s relationship, sustained through uneasy accommodation, gestures toward the limits of ideological purity, as well as the necessity of compromise.Why “Rebel” English Academy? Because for its founder, Baghi, it is where “rebels of tomorrow” are made: children who, while learning English, are taught to doubt and to question; who would be “armed with a language that would pretend to serve power but in the end would smash it”. That canny, insurgent spirit courses through the stories of Sabiha and through every page of Hanif’s remarkable novel. Crackling with incendiary themes and theses, this account of life under authoritarian siege is fiercely local and incontestably universal, harrowing and mutinously entertaining: a sure-fire Booker contender.Rebel English Academy by Mohammed Hanif is published by Grove (£16.99).

No night but mine shall shadeThis day that I have made.This poem by the novelist, journalist and suffragist Stella Benson appears in her collection, Twenty,published in June 1918, shortly before the end of the first world war. (Some of her own reactions to the first world warare recorded here.) Benson (1892-1933) went to California that same year, largely because she was in poor health and her doctor had recommended the climate.I imagine that most of Twenty had been put together before she embarked on her travels. The Secret Day may have emerged from her fears concerning the journey and her future in a strange country. Interestingly, it illustrates the psychological need to find a sanctuary in time rather than space. Benson is aware that the device is an artificial one, but launches a convincing appeal for its necessity, beautifully structured by the constant echoes ofanaphora. She has “built To-day” (a day she was hoping to greet in another form) “Lest joy come not again, lest peace return no more, / Lest comfort come no more.” Each stanza’s concluding line oftrimeteris always effective, but never more than here, with its frank admission of the most basic animal need – for “comfort”.In stanza two, the poet concedes the limits of her “building” metaphor, and creates a specific picture of an English coastal landscape, in which she conjures flowers instantly out of the earth. The day is now bigger than a stage-set, although Benson continues to highlight her original metaphor, as in the third stanza image of peace being “painted” on the sky, and the making of “immense and misty seas …”Besides a separation from her country, there’s the implied rift with a “Secret Friend”. The capitalisation here seems a childish gesture. I don’t know how easily a female poet in 1918 could have solved the problem Benson has set herself, but some Imagist sidestepping might have been recommended. It would have helped her case for “Secret Friend” if she’d at least dropped the capitalisation.Despite its moments of sentimentality, Benson’s poem doesn’t lack intensity and originality. The confessional tone of voice is effective. The speaker trusts the reader with her introspective project, in which simple diction and repetitions imply genuine candour and vulnerability. Do thehexameterlines provide a little too much space to fill? Here and there, perhaps, but at the same time, the rhythms add to the insistence of the speaker, the authority of her first-person account of things.The closing trimeter line of the last stanza emphasises the pathos of her new metaphorical turn: she has built a wall, not a house, and her cherished “To-day” is already fading into nightfall, although the claim to sanctuary remains defiant.Benson’s focus was primarily on fiction and journalism. It seems that Twenty was the only full collection of her poems to have been published during her lifetime. A late-awarded distinction is that two other Benson poems appear in Philip Larkin’s 1972Oxford Anthology of 20th Century English Verse. (Perhaps this was atMonica Jones’s suggestion? But Larkin takes credit for agreeing!)You can read a version of Frost introducing chapter three of her1936 novel Goodbye, Strangerhere. It shows Benson’s later poetic style taking a new direction. I wish there had been time for her to write more.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekFirst world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its Iraqi director Hasan Hadi remembers his own fearful childhoodCath ClarkeMon 2 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 03.06 ESTShareThere were no cinemas inIraqin the 1990s, when Hasan Hadi was growing up under Saddam Hussein’s regime. But he still managed to fall in love with films – after a family member roped him into helping her distribute VHS tapes of banned foreign movies. “I was a kid,” says the 37-year-old, “so no one would suspect me of smuggling. I’d put the tapes up my shirt or in my bag.”Hadi started secretly watching the films, too, everything from Bruce Lee to Tarkovsky. At night, he crept into the living room after everyone had gone to bed, keeping the volume low in case his family woke up.Hadi says that when he was overthrown, the number of statues and portraits of Saddam outnumbered people in IraqHow, I ask, would the authorities have punished you if you’d been caught in possession of banned films? Hadi pauses. “It depends. There were no specific rules. But if it was a political film, or something really forbidden by the regime, it could go to execution.” They would execute a child? Hadi nods. “We’re talking about a period when childhood lost its innocence.”Hadi’s own film, The President’s Cake, is about to be released. Warm, funny and sometimes heartbreakingly sad, it perfectly captures the innocence of childhood. The setting is early 1990s Iraq: Saddam’s brutal rule and the hardship of sanctions are seen through the eyes of a nine-year-old girl called Lamia, played by Baneen Ahmed Nayyef, with her pet cockerel. She is the unluckiest kid in class, her name having been picked out of a hat, meaning she has to make a cake for the president’s birthday – a compulsory national holiday in Iraq.View image in fullscreen‘It really did feel like he was watching you everywhere’ … The President’s CakeEverywhere in the film we see the personality cult Saddam built around him, his portrait hanging on every wall. Hadi says that when he was overthrown in 2003, the number of statues and portraits of him outnumbered people in Iraq. “He was obsessed,” says Hadi, sitting in the London office of his film’s production company. “It really did feel like he was watching you everywhere. You couldn’t go from home to school without seeing him.”The President’s Cake is the first Iraqi movie ever to make the Oscars shortlist for best international feature, though it didn’t make the final cut. The film follows little Lamia as she tries to rustle up cake ingredients at the height of sanctions when food is scarce and prices exorbitant. But she is not alone. Her grandmother gathers up their most precious possessions – a radio and an old watch – to sell, and the two set out on a journey to Baghdad. Lamia brings along her pet cockerel Hindi, which almost steals the movie with his querulous squawking.Hadi, who is due to fly back to Baghdad shortly, tells me that baking a cake for Saddam was obligatory in schools. The kids almost never got to eat them though. “The teacher would usually take it home for his family,” he says. “I didn’t taste cake until I was 13 or 14.” Never? “It sounds unbelievable, but no, not fancy cakes with cream. There were cakes, but they were depressing, just dates stuck together to trick kids.” He’s laughing now. “I’d spend hours sometimes looking at cakes in the window of bakeries.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m not coming with an agenda – I’m coming with stories’ … Hasan Hadi.Photograph: Xavier Galiana/AFP/Getty ImagesLike all Iraqi children, he was raised to fear Saddam. “No one ever told you, ‘Don’t talk bad about Saddam.’ They didn’t need to. Youknew.” His father opposed the regime: “There was lots of hiding, lots of escaping, all of that.”Hadi talks of being raised by strong women, although no one was immune to fear. He remembers one occasion when soldiers stormed their home. His father wasn’t around. “They asked my grandmother her name. In terror she forgot. She looked at her daughters and asked them, ‘What’s my name?’ The powerlessness, the hopelessness – these memories burn into your soul.”One of the most upsetting scenes in the film shows Lamia’s teacher stealing an apple from her schoolbag. It feels like a terrible betrayal, and the apple is a special treat from Lamia’s grandma. These were the times, says Hadi. Corruption was rife. Before sanctions, a teacher might earn $800 a month; afterwards, it could be $5. “I believe sanctions are more violent than bombs,” he says. “The damage is not visible, but it’s deeper.” His cousin went deaf because, thanks to sanctions, there were no antibiotics to treat an ear infection.Hadi studied film in New York. When he sat down to write The President’s Cake, he promised himself not to make a political film. “I don’t want to be political. I want to be loyal to what life was under those conditions. But I’m not coming with an agenda – I’m coming with stories. The real story is about these two kids.” He’s talking about Lamia and her best friend, Saeed, who tags along. Both were played by untrained actors. “There are no drama schools in Iraq.”Hadi shot the opening scenes – of marshlands full of buzzing mosquitoes – by filming on water, a treacherous business it seems. “It was insane,” he says. “I have grey hair now.” Will he continue making films in Iraq? He nods, eyeing his suitcase. “I want to make films about Iraq. Yes.”The President’s Cake is in UK cinemas from 13 February, and Australian cinemas from 2 AprilExplore more on these topicsFilmIraqMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It arrives at these abstractions via the horrific story ofthe 2018 killing of Mawda Shawri, a two-year-old German-born Iraqi Kurd shot during a bungled border control raid on the van she was travelling in with her parents.Director Robin Vanbesien reveals this tragedy through documents and testimony read out for the audience of activists seen here. The infant’s body is dumped in a bin bag by the presiding officers, and her parents, Phrast and Shamden, refused access; the lies of the police, who played to the myth of immigrant barbarity by claiming Mawda had been thrown on to the highway by her fellow passengers; the justice system closing ranks by putting the onus of responsibility on the van driver for dangerous conduct that supposedly forced the police officer to fire.Outrage is obviously the correct response. But, as someone points out here, concentrating on such egregious incidents plays into the authorities’ hands, because they are the outlying exceptions often then used to justify draconian control. They obscure the broader machinery of repression, and the underlying power ideologies, which license the empowered to pull the trigger. Another commentator makes comparisons with the anthropology of hunting: the mythology that differentiates hunter and prey and sanctions bloodshed. Dismantling violence means dismantling language; replacing labels such as “migrant” or “refugee” leads another participant to realise that searching for alternative terms invariably humanises the people concerned.It doesn’t feel, though, as if Vanbesien quite finds his own lexicon for the visual element of this revolution. His distorted sequences of Belgian highways, as if on-ramping into 2001’s Stargate, aren’t a bad attempt at conveying interstitial alienation – but the many, many inserts of fluttering roadside vegetation and lamp-posts eventually pale. Lyrically dwelling in this no man’s land while anonymously conveying its insights through staged readings, the film – ironically – starts to feel deracinated and dispersed. Fully attributed testimony and a rigorous conclusion for Mawda’s story, rather than a healing session of throat-singing, might have closed the loop better. The radical intent is clear to see, but the anger feels scattered by the wayside.Hold on to Her is on True Story from 6 February.This article was amended on 2 February 2026 to correct a misspelling of Robin Vanbesien’s surname.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBelgiumMigrationKurdsEuropeMiddle East and north AfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

Sir Douglas’s writings on the importance of rational self-interest have caused him to be described by his descendant as a lost hero of the Scottish enlightenment: a mix of David Hume, Adam Smith, Dr Livingstone and Walter Scott.Kenneth embarrassingly dresses up in wig and knee breeches as Sir Douglas Weatherford to give excruciating lectures about his hero to uncomprehending tourists. But then a low-rent Game of Thrones-style TV show starts filming in the locality. The tourist centre where Kenneth is employed eagerly throws away all its boring Sir Douglas Weatherford exhibits, repurposes itself as a fan hub and makes Kenneth dress up as one of the show’s silly characters. Kenneth is a powder keg of emotion ready to blow and what makes it worse is that Sir Douglas’s ghost is lurking about the place, full of contempt for his ridiculous and pathetic descendant.I could have done with a lot more of Sir Douglas himself, whose dyspeptic speech at the very beginning is very funny: but that keynote of scabrous satire that he appears to introduce is overtaken by bittersweet sadness as Kenneth takes centre stage. It’s a tender and very sympathetic performance from Mullan.Explore more on these topicsFilmFirst look reviewPeter MullanScotlandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Independently financed horror movie Iron Lung has been smuggled into multiplexes without the usual promotional hoopla, where it was keenly awaited by the massed followers of its Hawaiian writer-director-star Mark Fischbach, better known asYouTubegaming legend Markiplier. Many of us have long sensed culture is making a decisive break with the analogue in favour of the (perhaps terminally) online and Fischbach’s film makes that paradigm shift not just visible but visceral; it feels not unlike spending 12 hours on Twitch with all the curtains closed.Though Markiplier is approaching the horror genre from a notionally fresh angle – by adaptingDave Szymanski’s eponymous space-submarine sim– he lands on the narratively rusty idea of an astronaut straying beyond his depth; this isMoon in dimmer light. Beset by ominous rumbles and mounting doubts about the state of mankind, the begrimed and squalid craft singlehandedly piloted by Fischbach’s straggle-haired convict Simon is indistinguishable from the average teenage bedroom. Our hero staggers round this intergalactic deathtrap completing vaguely specified missions – ram this, repair that, download something or other – like a harassed dad ticking off his Sunday to-do list. In this, Simon proves more proficient than Fischbach’s offscreen self, who is either stumped by or oblivious to the film’s fundamental issues.Hopes that Iron Lung isa new Dark Starare soon sunk by the depressive tone, leaden pacing and near-total absence of spectacle; this is basically a radio-play script that insistently has to tell, because this barebones production has nothing much to show. (The achievement, chiefly entrepreneurial, is almost admirably perverse: Markiplier steering people towards content that makes Solaris seem like Con Air.) Even if you have a major case of Main Character Syndrome to centre yourself for two-plus hours while relegating your co-stars to voices off, Fischbach holds steady before the camera; more money and bigger sets will doubtless come his way. But he can’t pull off the dramatic heavy lifting required to convert a short film’s worth of plot into a watchable feature. At least MrBeast’s stunts get him outside.Iron Lung is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsGamesYouTubereviewsShareReuse this content"

Their omnipresent hits represent the worst of bands who favour stadium-sized grandeur over true ambition. However, I can never truly get behind the idea of trashing Freddie and co when their music helped create one of my most beloved scenes in cinema history.‘Pushes the nostalgia buttons’: why Enchanted is my feelgood movieRead moreEarly in 1992’s Wayne’s World, a bunch of rockers squeeze into an AMC Pacer with custom flames painted on the side. As they drive past the automarts, car washes and beef stands of downtown Chicago, Bohemian Rhapsody plays on the car stereo. The song’s operatic verses are used for laughs (the “Let me go” line becomes a cry for help from a friend who is partied out and might “honk” in the backseat) while the breakdown in the middle creates space for a spot of high-speed headbanging. To me it’s as thrilling a car scene as anything in Bullitt or the Mad Max franchise.At its core the scene, and Wayne’s World as a whole, is about the friendship between Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). They are best friends who, when they’re not moshing behind the wheel, host a show on public access TV. Essentially a pair of irreverent pre-internet YouTubers, they wear ripped jeans and Def Leppard shirts while chatting to eccentrics like the inventor of Suck Kut, a self-hair-cutting device. The DIY show has given them micro-celebrity status, with Wayne dating Cassandra (Tia Carrere), the singer in a band he meets at the Gasworks, a local club.Wayne, switched on and sporting his own merchandise, wants to achieve something big (or “cachunga” in the 90s slang-heavy script) while his spacey co-host is happy to chew on red licorice and ponder on the attractiveness of Bugs Bunny when he dresses as a woman. It’s not clear what precisely Wayne wants in life, but having enough money to buy his dream guitar, a 1964 Fender Stratocaster in classic white, lovingly nicknamed “Excalibur”, would probably help.Enter TV executive Benjamin, played with slippery corporate menace by Rob Lowe. He spots an opportunity to take the scrappy Wayne’s World and make it mainstream, lining his pockets in the process. What ensues is a punk fable that warns of the dangers of accepting a quick buck and what can be lost by selling out.The film is endlessly quotable with both Wayne and Garth breaking the fourth wall to address the audience directly. They praise their heroes with “we’re not worthy” and lovingly refer to attractive women as “Baberham Lincoln”. “I don’t even own a gun. What am I gonna do with a gun rack?” Wayne asks a besotted ex whose idea of a birthday gift is a little unorthodox. It’s a line that runs through my mind any time I receive an underwhelming present.The film’s rock credentials are also unshakable. Alice Cooper makes a cameo and big laughs are mined from Led Zeppelin riffs. Director Penelope Spheeris, best known for her Decline of Western Civilization trilogy of music documentaries, memorably spurned an offer to direct This Is Spın̈al Tap over fears it was poking fun at metal bands. In Wayne and Garth, however, she saw true fans.As a millennial viewer watching from the UK thanks to its endless repeats on Sky Movies, I wasn’t always conscious of the gen X ethics Wayne’s World was instilling in me. One of Wayne’s World’s most beloved scenes involves Wayne and Garth mocking product placement while blatantly advertising products for Reebok and Pepsi. This cultural aversion to chasing money over everything was all but wiped out by the time I graduated into the post-financial crash economy in which influencer brand deals and “securing the bag” became a means of survival. Perhaps it’s idealism, or rose-tinted nostalgia, but I can’t shake the idea that Wayne’s generation had it right. I know for sure that any dreams I have of fighting back against “the man” (I refuse to say late-stage capitalism) have their origins in Wayne’s Aurora basement.The idea of a modern-day Wayne’s World is nigh on impossible; if you need an illustration as to why the dynamic no longer works then watch thecringeworthy 2021 Super Bowl advertisementfor Uber Eats of all things. Perhaps that’s for the best. To me, Wayne and Garth will always be the slackers who time-traveled from the 90s to instill their idealistic and unconventional wisdom when I needed it the most.Wayne’s World is available on Paramount+ in the US and the UK and Binge in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsMike MyersMy feelgood movieComedy filmsComedySaturday Night LivefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In his latest vehicle, he is back playing a former armed-forces operative haunted by his violent past who is compelled to take up weaponry again. This is basically the setup for the Transporter franchise in which he starred, many more works featuring Statham and, to be frank, most action movies, which are (let’s face it) basically variations on Achilles sulking in his tent in the Iliad until he is forced to fight once more. There is nothing new under the sun.Shelter, formulaically directed by Ric Roman Waugh (Greenland) working from a script by Ward Parry (The Shattering), feels populated by indestructible plastic tropes that have cracked and faded after years of scorching sun exposure. Statham plays Mason, once a special-forces super soldier with secrets who is first met hiding on a remote island in the Outer Hebrides, with only goodest boy German shepherd Jack for company. Fans of the John Wick franchise will immediately feel anxious about Jack’s future – although if you’ve seen Leon: The Professional you probably won’t feel so worried about young Jesse (Bodhi Rae Breathnach), an orphaned girl whom Mason takes under his wing when her only relative, her uncle, is killed in a boating accident. That little spark of kindness triggers MI6 to track Mason down, having first falsely identified him as a terrorist, and then sending assassins to kill him all of whom he swats away like so many flies.Even though the new head of M16 (Naomi Ackie) and her minions have control over every camera in the country and could track the progress of a pimple on Mason’s neck using image recognition, he and Jesse manage to make it all the way from Stornoway to London in what seems like mere hours without being caught, in time for a nightclub shootout – cribbed from Collateral but with crappier techno music. The final boss fight ends up being withBill Nighy, MI6’s now-rogue former top man, or at least his own minions, which hardly seems like a fair match given how indomitable Mason has proved so far.Honestly, there isn’t a single step in Shelter’s plot that isn’t entirely predictable, but to the film’s credit the fight choreography is solid (Waugh was a stuntman himself once) and young Breathnach proves, after her turn as Susanna Shakespeare in Hamnet, that she is a find with a future.Shelter is out on 30 January in the UK and US, and on 5 February in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmJason StathamAction and adventure filmsBill NighyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Self-righteous theatre actor Marcin (Łukasz Simlat), is mid-run playing Captain Hook in a production of Peter Pan. His terminally unhappy wife Ola (Agnieszka Duleba-Kasza) announces she is off; then, as their argument spills into the theatre wings where she is playing Tinkerbell, she reveals that she previously slept with someone else. Ziemovit/Peter Pan (Dobromir Dymecki) looks sheepish – before being opportunely hoisted out of reach on wires.A few months down the line, Marcin is essaying Torvald in Ibsen’s A Doll’s House opposite his new love Ewa (Wiktoria Filus) as Nora. But when she falls down a trapdoor, guess who is substituted into the role? The tension is ratcheted up when Marcin and Ola once again find themselves leading the bill as sparring Oberon and Titania, in a production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream on which their company’s future rests.Despite the agitated farce of the first section, in which the spat erupts on stage in front of aghast kids expecting light panto, it seems director and co-writer Michal Grzybowski is more an Ibsen man, with a fairly sombre take on adult relationships. The film however is stolidly literal in what it suggests about life feeding into art; not just in the suddenly extra-fruity Hook/Pan rivalry, but in how Marcin chokes in the A Doll’s House rehearsals when it is Ola he has to summon passion for. With only a little light humour (a pair of backstage thesps eternally bickering about DeNiro; Marcin’s dad never making good on his threats to quit the company), Seasons falls short of the playful Shakespearean intertwining of world and stage it invokes.Simlat does at least have the opportunity for some technically complex work simultaneously showcasing the theatrical role and the actor behind it: he subtly tweaks his features to suggest someone who never passes up an opportunity to let life intrude on his craft, far beyond what his method-advocating director wants. But with Grzybowski also opting for a wistful Woody Allen-esque outro, it feels as if the director, like Marcin, has commitment issues when it comes to tone.Seasons is on Viaplay from 5 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsTheatrePolandEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the world Patrick Bateman inhabits and Bret Easton Ellis’s narcissistic banker is every inch the embodiment of it – a creature of Wall Street’s hedonistic heyday, blinging in designer-wear as he swings his axe at high-end escorts and the homeless.So Rupert Goold’s decision to resurrect this musical adaptation of Ellis’s ghastly 1991 masterpiece is not without risk. Don’t these singing yuppies seem ridiculously passé now in their boxy suits and Ralph Lauren underwear? The satire is amped to 10, licking its lips, it seems, as it sends up the 1980s. But it never spirals into kitsch and our contemporary world of toxic masculinity, Trumpian capitalism and Insta-fuelled solipsism slowly, chillingly, creeps out of it.This was the first show that Goold staged after taking over the Almeida theatre(then it starred Matt Smith and reached Broadway). It becomes his swan song as outgoing artistic director: a bloody, brilliant, full circle. Who could have imagined that a musical version of this story would work so well in the first place? First there is satire, deliciously dark, and then horror, which is not treated in the same maximalist, limb-sawing way as inMary Harron’s film,but still unsettlingly effective when the violence comes.View image in fullscreenAn axe to grind … Daniel Bravo and Arty Froushan.Photograph: Marc BrennerArty Froushan, as Bateman, is nowhere near as sinister as Christian Bale’s chainsaw-wielding film portrayal but his preppy boy-next-door turns gradually lunatic, shirt slicked with sweat by the end. It is an impressive performance in which he shows his range after his lead performance at the same theatre inThe Line of Beauty.Anastasia Martin, as his earnest PA and one of the only likable characters, brings a sorrowful depth to her part of a woman painfully in love with her boss.Duncan Sheik’s score contains one great electro-synth number after another, with a razor sharp book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. Cards captures the absurd one-upmanship of Bateman’s banker bros; You Are What You Wear, sung by his east coast princess fiance, Evelyn (Emily Barber) among others, name-drops period fashion labels with undisguised shallowness. The witty book and lyrics take us back to the fetishisation of fine dining with upscale dishes involving sliced mango, sushi and sun-dried tomatoes that now sound laughably basic.Alongside the original songs there are excellently performed blasts from the past: The Human League’s Don’t You Want Me brings an aggressively tinny sound. Phil Collins’ In The Air Tonight contains menace and melodrama, with some superb singing from a zombie-style ensemble who dance, writhe and bounce in aerobics gear. They sometimes appear robotic, other times plastic, never quite human, with gloriously arch choreography by Lynne Page.View image in fullscreenGloriously arch … (l-r) Emily Barber, Millie Mayhew, Liz Kamille, Hannah Yun Chamberlain, Asha Parker-Wallace and Tanisha Spring.Photograph: Marc BrennerEs Devlin’s fleet set design turns nightclubs into bedrooms into hideous mounds of twitching bodies. Jon Clark’s Stringfellows style lighting and Finn Ross’s projections give off a luminous, hallucinatory quality, insinuating Bateman’s unreliable reality.The seeds of corruption in our world are all to be found here: Trump is Bateman’s hero and makes a brief appearance. Epstein is name-checked. The unspoken analogy between bankers and psychopaths bears resonance. Bateman deals in mergers and acquisitions (or is it “murders and executions”?) and although he is a product of the 1980s, the greed of his peers lays the ground for the economic crashes to come, their nihilistic, coke-snorting hedonism prefiguring the drama ofIndustry.The unreliable narration of the book which renders Bateman a fantasist gives way to metaphor more clearly here: he is an abstraction, he tells us himself. He may not be out there, cutting up women, but his darkness, his abandoning of hope, sits within all of us.At theAlmeida theatre, London,until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsAmerican PsychoAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But doctors recommended an unusual treatment for herMarco De VidiMon 2 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 2 Feb 2026 15.34 ESTShareWhen Stefania “Alos” Pedretti woke from a two-week coma on 9 January 2022, her doctor presented her with bad news. She was suffering from severe encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain possibly caused by her body’s autoimmune response to the breast cancer she had been diagnosed with a few months earlier.For the guitarist and singer Pedretti, however, what came next was even worse. After being intubated in her comatose state, her vocal cords were unable to close and produce sound, meaning that for months she was unable to speak.The therapeutic treatment her doctor recommended was unusual: to return to the rehearsal room with her cult noise duo OvO.Formed with Bruno Dorella in Ravenna,Italyin 2000, the band have built a international following for their uncompromising rhythmic noise and extreme metal, accompanied by Pedretti’s scream-at-the-top-of-your-voice vocals. Roaring, her doctor hoped, might help Pedretti regain her voice.The intubation had not damaged or injured her vocal cords. Rather, her speech therapist Chiara Pavese explains, the cause of her voice impairment was “psychogenic”, stemming from severe mental or emotional stress. “It is a psychological block which, however, has physical repercussions.”The disorder that Pedretti was suffering from, dysphonia, can be cured by relaxing the muscles of the larynx through massages. But in some cases, a psychological approach is recommended. Her doctors hoped that returning to the rehearsal studio would change her perspective and help her regain some sort of normality after months in hospital.View image in fullscreen‘That musical part is entirely the result of my instinct: it is the real me’ … OvO.Photograph: Rachele Maistrello/Annapaola MartinThe first attempts were dispiriting. “I couldn’t even hold the guitar, it was an enormous effort for me,” Pedretti recalls. But when she and Dorella started holding simple rehearsals at his home, they had a breakthrough. “We tried to play our songQueer Fight,” she says. “In my memory, I remembered perfectly how the piece should sound. We played and I screamed, and my voice came out.”The consequences were surprising. “Afterwards, when I spoke normally again, I had volume. I could speak and people could hear me at last.”From a medical point of view, “for those who sing or use their voice for work, it is as if there were two separate channels”, explains Pavese, who works at Ravenna hospital where she trained under the guidance of Franco Fussi, a renowned phoniatrist and surgeon who has treated singers including Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti and Björk. Pavese specialises in clinical vocology and teaches at the University of Bologna.“When Pedretti performs,” Pavese says, “she goes into automatic mode, unconsciously eliminating all the tensions that were present when she was speaking. It’s a muscle memory, but in some people it’s like it’s split in two, as if when singing, that memory kicks in automatically and they perform perfectly”. In these cases, “once the patient’s voice comes out and they hear it, it does not go away, because they understand that there is not an organic problem”.Once her voice was “unlocked”, several months of exercises followed, to re-learn how to speak correctly with various techniques useful for both singing and speaking.“That musical part is entirely the result of my instinct: it is the real me”, Pedretti reflects. “And that’s why it came naturally, since I no longer remembered how to speak. Even now, I still don’t remember what my normal voice sounded like when I speak”.Her new, transformed voice, was showcased on OvO’s latest album, Gemma, released in 2025, on which growls alternate with clean vocals, and more melodic sung parts. With electronics grafted on to heavy noise, the duo’s sound is more joyful than in the past, as if to signal a new beginning after years of turbulence.Gaining a greater awareness of her own voice has made Pedretti want to share her newfound knowledge with others. She took inspiration from Azdora, a project by Swedish artist Markus Öhrn, who formed a black-metal band with 15 old ladies from the small Italian town of Santarcangelo, teaching them how to play guitars and sing in growl. “With Azdora, the point was to teach instinct, to unleash the animal side,” says Pedretti.In 2023, she started holding workshops for children, teenagers, but also adults of all ages. These workshops explore the relationship between voice, psyche and body, with the aim of returning to our deepest and most natural form of expression.“I realise that there are social barriers to shouting and screaming,” Pedretti reflects. “But, for me, that’s our real voice. That has been silenced because it’s not acceptable in society, as it is seen as something bad, ugly, rude, aggressive. And this is even more true for women, or for little girls who can’t scream because they think it’s a bad thing to do. It is very sad. While in some musical styles this is well accepted. It is our right to scream, if we want to.” It can become an unexpected tool for healing.Explore more on these topicsMusicItalyEuropeMetalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I risked tooth decay to track down the quintessential blend of crisp pastry, an oozy centre and sugary cinnamonLaura HallMon 2 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleOpen sandwiches (smørrebrød),meatballs(frikadeller),crispy pork belly (stegt flæsk) …There are many must-eat dishes for food lovers visiting Denmark, though perhaps nothing springs to mind as readily as the Danish pastry. But how are you supposed to choose from the countless bakeries on offer? And once you have decided which to visit, which pastry to eat? As a long-term resident of Copenhagen and pastry obsessive, I took on the Guardian’s challenge to find the best Danish pastry in town.Let’s get started with the shocking fact that Danish pastries are not actually Danish. In Denmark they’re calledwienerbrød(Viennese bread) and made using a laminated dough technique that originated in Vienna. There’s also no such thing as a “Danish” in Denmark – there are so many different types of pastry that the word loses meaning. What we know as a Danish is aspandauer– a round pastry with a folded border and a circle of yellowy custard in the middle. Then there’s thetebirkes, a folded pastry often with a baked marzipan-style centre and poppy seeds on the top; afrøsnapper, a twist of pastry dusted with poppy seeds; and asnegl, which translates as “snail” but is known as a cinnamon swirl in English.View image in fullscreenPastries are an essential energy source for exploring Copenhagen.Photograph: Marco Bottigelli/Getty ImagesI decided to compare bakeries based on theirsnegl– partly because they are my favourite but mainly because you can find one just about everywhere. I’m also clear on what constitutes a good one: it should have a crisp outer circle and a squidgier middle, which Danes regard as the best bit, and should taste of cinnamon and sugar.With a steady stream of often international pastry chefs leaving the city’s high-end restaurants to open their own bakeries, new outlets are popping up nearly every day. There’s a low-key fight going on between old and new, but in this Instagram age it’s not a fair one. While the more traditional bakeries are marked out by the goldenkringle, a sign like a pretzel, hanging outside their shops, the boutique-style bakeries have nearly always got better lighting and more vibrant displays.For me, it’s a classic story of modernisation and renewal: some adaptations may go too far, but others make traditional pastry taste even better, so why not? I explored both types: the traditional bakeries imbued withhyggeand historic charm, and the chic, patisserie-style places. Try them both – it’s fun!Sankt Peders BageriView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mark TanggaardFamous for its “Wednesdaysnegl”, Sankt Peders is the oldest bakery in the city, dating back to 1652, and it looks the part: on a cobbled Old Town street, it has a goldenkringlehanging outside, and the scent of cinnamon perfumes the air. I ask for their classic pastry and am handed a cinnamonsnegl. It’s round, rather flat, and decorated with a splodge of white icing. I bite into its crisp outer edges and find a soft inner section. It’s good, but the lack of height – along with the teeth-achingly sweet icing – means it won’t be in contention for a top spot.30 kroner (£3.50), 5/10BrødView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mark TanggaardHipster vibes abound at Brød, a small modern bakery on Enghave Plads in the vibrant Vesterbro district. Babies are sleeping in prams outside and a man wearing a teeny-weeny beanie pulls up on a cargo bike as I arrive. The young baker serving me is very proud of Denmark’s pastry expertise and advises me to try asnegl, aspandauerand atebirkesto get a fully rounded idea of what they do. How can I say no? Thespandauerandtebirkesare good, not too sweet, but I’m a particular fan of the tall cinnamon swirl and its deliciously squidgy middle.30 kroner, 7.5/10JunoView image in fullscreenCopenhagen Juno the bakeryPhotograph: Kathrine PreislerThis has been consistently rated one of the best bakeries in the city since it was opened by the Swedish baker and ex-Noma pastry chef Emil Glaser in the Østerbro district in 2017. I drop in to try their classic cardamom bun, but there’s nowhere to sit so I take it to work. It’s beautiful to look at, delicately plaited and dusted with sugar and black flecks of cardamom. It’s sweet, slightly chewy and very moreish. At this point I think I should be more like Prue and Paul on Bake Off and just eat a morsel of each pastry to avoid the ensuing sugar crash that will derail my day. But I find I can’t stop myself.34 kroner, 9/10Discount 365View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ellie HallBefore I tell you to shell out for one of the city’s more expensive pastries, I have a responsibility to make sure cheaper versions are represented here. So I visit a local supermarket, Discount 365, and buy a thin, flat and coldsneglfrom the bakery cabinet, topped with a circle of white icing. It’s crisply crunchy nearly all the way through and lacks a soft middle. There’s not much in the way of cinnamon taste and there’s absolutely no lingering flavour, except for maybe margarine. Pay more: you’ll thank me.12 kroner, 1/10Albatross & VennerView image in fullscreenAlbatross and Venner served 10 types of pastry.Photograph: Laura HallThey are still rolling up the shutters of the Torvehallerne food hall when I arrive, but a decent queue is already forming at Albatross & Venner. I count 10 different types of pastry as I wait: next to fat cinnamon swirls, there are chia swirls, feta and spinach swirls and other savoury options. I opt for a cinnamonsnegl, which they make with coffee syrup. The thick, uneven rolls are a little clumsy, but it’s glazed, soft and delicious. There’s no real definition between the outside and the inside so it’s not in the elite league. But it is hearty.35 kroner, 6.5/10LagkagehusetView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ellie HallAlthough I’m a big fan of independents, it would be remiss to not mention the city’s bakery chains. Lagkagehuset is a classic, with a modern concrete and marble interior, and reliable options from a counter that offers everything from great sandwiches to glossy cakes and quintessential pastries. Bakery snobs despair at their mass-produced goods but I remain a fan. I plump for adirektørsnegl, a big chocolate-topped cinnamon swirl, which is messy with an oozy centre. If you don’t love really sweet things you may find it too sickly – but that’s not how I roll.27 kroner, 8/10RivieraView image in fullscreenRiviera is known for its excellenttebirkes(in the foreground)Photograph: Maria Kathrine PreislerRun by Italian chef Chiara Barla, this neighbourhood bakery near Nørreport has a chic minimalist interior and is known in Copenhagen for serving the besttebirkesin the world. I watch the bakers roll out and shape pale dough behind the counter as I try their pastries. After weeks of tasting, I can say hands down that this is the one. The plaited, sticky, orange-glazed cinnamonsneglis a feast for the eyes and a party for the mouth; the lightly lemony vanilla custard of thespandaueris exquisite; and thetebirkesis like the most delicious love child of a traditionaltebirkesand a doughnut.35 kroner, 10/10Laura Hall is the author ofModern Scandinavian, a Substack about life innorthern EuropeExplore more on these topicsCopenhagen holidaysDenmark holidaysScandinavia holidaysCity breaksShort breaksFood and drinkRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bought puff pastry makes an instant (and decadent) alternative. Yes, I know you can buy ready-rolled shortcrust, but I wouldn’t: it’s trash. If this column didn’t have a 30-minute time constraint, I’d blitz 200g plain flour and 100g cold cubed salted butter to sand, then add one egg yolk and a tablespoon of cold water, then blitz for a few seconds, and no longer, until it just comes together. I’m unorthodox, so I then tip the pastry straight into a pie dish, quickly pat it into place and freeze for 15 minutes. Blind bake for 10 minutes at 180C(160C fan)/350F/gas 4, before removing the paper and baking beans and tipping in the filling – it’s really not very much work. But it does add 20 minutes to proceedings, which disqualifies the recipe from this column. So it’s bought, pre-rolled puff pastry instead.Mushroom and artichoke puff pastry quichePrep15 minCook25 minServes42tbsp olive oil, or oil from the artichoke jar300gchestnut mushrooms, roughly sliced2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated100g creme fraiche3eggs1tsp sea salt flakes320g sheet ready-rolled puff pastry150g jarred artichoke pieces, cut into 1cm slices150g goat’s cheese log, slicedA few sprigs fresh rosemaryHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Heat a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, add the olive oil, then tip in the mushrooms and garlic, and stir-fry for five to six minutes, until slightly browned and just cooked through. Transfer the mushrooms to a plate to cool.In a medium bowl, whisk the creme fraiche, eggs and salt. Unroll the puff pastry sheet into a medium roasting tin, so the pastry comes up all four sides; you may end up with an overhang on the longer edges, in which case trim them and use the surplus pastry to make cheese or jam pinwheels.Tip the sauteed mushrooms into the pastry case, then arrange the artichoke slices evenly on top. Pour over the creme fraiche and egg mixture, then arrange the goat’s cheese and rosemary sprigs all over the top. Bake for 25 minutes, until the pastry and filling are golden brown and cooked through, then remove and leave to sit and settle for 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyPastryBakingMain courseEggsStarterVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Follow the ‘wok clock’ and both are ready in about half an hourJeremy PangMon 2 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTShareStir-frying, as its name suggests, is the technique of frying while continuously stirring or circulating heat, and it is the heat that’s all-important. Stir-frying is all aboutwok hei, or ‘wok’s air’ in English, which you can think of as the ‘height of fire’, or the level of heat. It’s said that Chinese cooks have good wok hei if they have a true understanding of the heat of their wok and how to handle it in all situations, and a stir-fry’s success is based on the quality of the cook’s wok hei.Singapore noodles (pictured top)This dish may not actually be Singaporean in origin, seemingly drawing on influences and crossovers in cuisine from various regions throughout Asia, but it’s actually the noodles – Singapore vermicelli – that give it its name. Singapore noodles are supposed to be dry yet packed full of flavour. To get this right, follow the instructions closely and remember to keep your wok smoking hot at all times –never, everlose your sizzle!Prep15 minCook15 minServes2100gdried Singapore vermicelli noodles2 eggs, well beaten½ onion, finely sliced½ red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely sliced6 large raw tiger or king prawns, peeled and deveined1 handful fresh beansprouts, rinsed and well drainedVegetable oil1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced, to garnishFor the spice paste1 bird’s-eye chilli, finely chopped1tbsp water1tbsp light soy sauce½tsp dark soy sauce1tsp sesame oil1tsp madras curry powder1–2 pinches chilli powder, to taste¼tsp saltSoak the noodles in hot water for three minutes, until they have separated, then drain and leave to dry on a clean tea towel for 10 minutes. Mix all the ingredients for the spice paste in a small bowl or ramekin.Build a“wok clock”on a large plate or board. Start at 12 o’clock with the beaten egg, followed by the onion and red pepper at three o’clock, the prawns, beansprouts and noodles at six o’clock and finally the spice paste at nine o’clock.Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok on a high heat. When it’s smoking hot, pour in the beaten egg, leave to bubble for a few seconds, then lightly scramble until cooked through.Push the egg to one side of the wok, to make space for the vegetables and heat again until smoking hot. (If you prefer, you can transfer the egg to a bowl, or scramble it in a small wok with not enough space for the veg as well.) Add the onion and red pepper to the wok, stir-fry for a minute, then add the prawns and stir-fry for 30–60 seconds, until lightly browned.Add the beansprouts to the wok, stir-fry for 20–30 seconds, then add the noodles and stir-fry for a minute. Stir in the spice paste and cook, stirring, until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined, and the noodles have dried out a little and are just starting to stick to the wok. Transfer to a large serving bowl, scatter over the spring onion garnish and serve.Sichuan chickenView image in fullscreenJeremy Pang’s Sichuan chicken stir-fry.The region of Sichuan is situated on the western side of China, and is therefore heavily influenced by ingredients from Tibet and northern India. The most significant of these, Sichuan peppercorns, have become increasingly popular in the west in recent years. These dried red berries, native to China, have a distinct fragrance when crushed and provide a unique numbing feeling all over the tongue, something the Chinese callma la. They can be easily found in most Asian supermarkets and on the world food aisle of large supermarkets.Prep15 minCook20 minServes4400gboneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 3cm-wide strips½ onion, cut into fine matchsticks1 red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh cut into fine matchsticks10 dried red chillies2tsp Sichuan peppercorns, crushed in a mortar3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped1 bird’s-eye chilli, stalk discarded, rest finely chopped200gcashew nutsVegetable oil1 spring onion, trimmed and finely sliced, to garnishFor the marinade1½tbsp cornflour1tsp sugar1 large pinchChinese five-spice2tbsp light soy sauce1tsp sesame oilFor the sauce3tbsp Shaoxing rice wine, or dry sherry1tbsp light soy sauce2tbsp hoisin sauce2tsp chilli paste, or chilli bean pastePut the chicken in a large bowl, add all the marinade ingredients and, using your hands, massage into the strips until evenly coated. Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl or ramekin, and set aside.Build your wok clock on a large plate or board. Start at 12 o’clock with the onion, red pepper and dried red chillies, then work your way round with the marinated chicken, crushed Sichuan peppercorns and garlic at three o’clock, the bird’s-eye chilli and sauce at six o’clock and, finally, the cashew nuts at nine o’clock.Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok on a high heat. When it’s smoking hot, add the onion, red pepper and dried red chillies, and stir-fry for one to two minutes, until the onion is lightly browned and slightly softened.Turn down the heat to medium and push the ingredients to the side of the wok. Add another half-tablespoon of vegetable oil to the centre of the wok, heat to smoking point, then add the chicken and stir-fry for three to five minutes, until golden brown on all sides. Turn down the heat to medium, add the crushed Sichuan peppercorns and garlic, and stir-fry for two minutes.Add the bird’s-eye chilli and sauce, and stir-fry on a medium-high heat for two minutes, until the sauce has thickened and reduced and is sticking to the chicken. Add the cashews and cook for a final 30–60 seconds, tossing the wok to combine all the ingredients.Transfer to a large serving plate, scatter over the spring onion garnish and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from School of Wok – Jeremy Pang’s Chinese Kitchen: Simple Techniques and Recipes to Enjoy Delicious Chinese Food at Home, published this month by Hamlyn at £25.
