The writer explains why this story is so personal to himMon 12 May 2025 11.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareKazuo Ishiguro still remembers where he was when he wrote A Pale View of Hills: hunched over the dining room table in a bedsit in Cardiff. He was in his mid-20s then; he is 70 now. “I had no idea that the book would be published, let alone that I had a career ahead of me as a writer,” he says. “[But] the story remains an important part of me, not only because it was the start of my novel-writing life, but because it helped settle my relationship with Japan.”First published in 1982, A Pale View of Hills is a charged family story that connects England withJapanand the present with the past. Now along comes a film version to provide a new frame for the mystery, a fresh view of the hills. Scripted and directed by Kei Ishikawa, it is a splendidly elegant and deliberate affair; a trail of carefully laid breadcrumbs that link a mothballed home in early 80s suburbia with wounded, resilient postwar Nagasaki. Middle-aged Etsuko is long settled in the UK and haunted by the fate of her displaced eldest child. Her younger daughter, Niki, is a budding writer, borderline skint and keen to make a name for herself. Niki has a chunky tape-recorder and plenty of time on her hands. She says, “Mum, will you tell me about your lives before, in Japan?”In awarding Ishigurothe Nobel prize for literaturein 2017, the Swedish Academy paid tribute to the emotional force of his prose and his focus on “memory, time and self-delusion”. These are the themes that colour all his fiction, whether he is writing about the below-stairs staff at a stately home (The Remains of the Day), sacrificial children at an elite boarding school (Never Let Me Go) or aged wanderers in Arthurian Britain (The Buried Giant), although they seem closest to home in A Pale View of Hills.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t be too reverential’…Kazuo Ishiguro.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APThe story lightly excavates the author’s family history and his own hybrid identity as a child of Nagasaki, transplanted to the UK at the age of five. Fittingly, the movie version premieres at theCannes film festival, where it risks getting lost amid the palm trees, yachts and bling. Cultural dislocation, in large part, is what the tale is about.My mother saw the book as an evolution of her stories about Nagasaki. What a pity she isn’t here to see the filmI’m tempted to view Niki – the bumptious young writer from whom no family secret is safe – as Ishiguro’s alter ego. Actually, he says, she was conceived as “more a ‘reader proxy’ than a writer one”. She’s our entry point to the story; possibly our red thread through the maze. It’s hard to believe today, he adds, but most contemporary British readers were resistant to Japanese stories and characters and needed a reassuring western presence to help ease them in.Niki is played in the film by Camilla Aiko, a recent graduate of the Bristol Old Vic theatre school. She sees the character as the story’s truth-seeker, the eyes of the audience, and the picture itself as the tale of two women who struggle to connect. “It didn’t cross my mind – maybe it should have – that I was playing Ishiguro,” she says.What she shares with the author is the same blended cultural heritage. Aiko is British mixed-race – her mother is Japanese. “And the thing about being mixed-race is that I find it difficult speaking for Japanese people or British people because I’m not sure which side I’m on. In Japan I’m a foreigner; here I’m Asian. As an actor I’m someone who tries to slip through the cracks.”View image in fullscreen‘I try to slip through the cracks’ … Camilla Aiko as Niki.Photograph: ©2025 A Pale View of Hills Film PartnersNiki isn’t Ishiguro. Nonetheless, the author admits that there are parallels. He says, “Where I see myself in Niki – and I was reminded of this watching Camilla Aiko’s fine performance – is in her sometimes uncomfortable, sometimes coy and cunning curiosity when coaxing memories from her mother of another, more troubled time.”It is the mother, after all, who looms largest in the tale. Etsuko in a sense has led two lives and been two different people. In 80s England she is a respectable widowed music teacher. In Nagasaki seven years after the atomic bomb dropped, she’s a harried young bride, contaminated with radiation and a potential hazard to her unborn child. She needs a friend or an escape route, whichever comes first. But she is never an entirely reliable narrator – and the family story she tells Niki finally doesn’t add up.What did Ishiguro’s own mother make of A Pale View of Hills? “I believe it remained special to her among my books,” he says. “A little before I started the book, with cold war tensions intensifying in the Reagan-Brezhnev era, she said to me she felt it was important she should relate to me some of her experiences in Nagasaki. Partly because I was of the next generation, but also because I was wanting to be a writer and had a chance to pass things on … A Pale View of Hills didn’t use any of her stories directly, but I think she thought the book was some sort of evolution of them, and closer to her than the books I wrote later.” Ishiguro’s mother died in 2019, aged 92. After watching Ishikawa’s adaptation, he thought: “What a pity she wasn’t here to see this film.”View image in fullscreenNear perfect … Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REXCinema is an enduring passion for Ishiguro and influences his writing as much as literature does. His favourite recent films include the Oscar-winning animation Flow, about a small soot-grey cat who survives a great flood, plus the French legal dramas Anatomy of a Fall andSaint Omer(“Is French justice really conducted like this? Or are these hallucinatory versions of French courts?”).A few years back, between novels, he wrote the screenplay forLiving– a quietly wrenching adaptation of Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 classic Ikiru, relocated to London and starring Bill Nighy and Aimee Lou Wood. The poster for Ikiru, incidentally, can be glimpsed on the street in A Pale View of Hills.Loving film can be a double-edged sword. Is it a help or a hindrance when it comes to having his own work adapted? Hopefully the former, Ishiguro says, so long as he maintains a safe distance. “I have a strict rule not to attempt to adapt any of my novels myself,” adds the writer, who is speaking to me by email. “As long as I keep well in the background, I don’t think I’m necessarily a hindrance. I always emphasise to film-makers that they have toownthe film – that it shouldn’t be approached reverentially.”Merchant-Ivory managed a near perfect adaptation ofThe Remains of the Day. Mark Romanek and Alex Garland crafted an appropriately haunting, chilly version ofNever Let Me Go. Both films preserve Ishiguro’s distinctive style and flavour. The restraint and simplicity; the sense of deep mystery. Both, though, remain films first and foremost. They have been allowed to migrate and adapt to a new habitat.View image in fullscreenHaunting … Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield in Never Let Me Go.Photograph: Maximum Film/Alamy“This is personal to me,” he says, “but I lean toward the film version moving the story on – not being a faithful translation the way a foreign language edition of a book might be. I know many novelists who’d be annoyed to hear me say this … The thing is, I watch many, many films and when an adaptation of a well-known book doesn’t work, 95% of the time it’s because the film-makers have been too reverential to the source.” Books and films are very different, he thinks. “They’re sometimes almost antithetical.”My favourite Ishiguro: by Margaret Atwood, Ian Rankin and moreRead moreIn A Pale View of Hills, Etsuko hands her story on to Niki. Niki, in turn, will write it up how she likes. So this is a family story about family stories, aware of how they warp and change in the telling. Every tale is subject to the same cultural static. They are adapted and extrapolated, lost and found in translation. One might even say that’s what keeps a story alive.“The other thing,” Ishiguro says. “It might sound like modesty when I encourage film adaptations to ‘move on’ the story. But actually it’s a form of egomania. I have aspirations for my stories to be like those of, say, Homer. Or to become like certain fairytales and myths, moving through the centuries and varying cultures, adapting and growing to speak to different audiences. My novels are themselves made up of materials I’ve inherited, imbibed and remoulded. When something goes from book to film it’s a campfire opportunity: it’s when the story should grow and evolve.”A Pale View of Hills premieres at the Cannes film festival on 15 MayExplore more on these topicsFilm adaptationsKazuo IshiguroJapanAsia PacificCannes film festivalinterviewsShareReuse this content"

You get on the 87 at the Vauxhall depot and you suddenly realise you know no one on the bus. Time was when everyone in the queue would have been best mates. Off for pie, mash and jellied eels together before a knees-up down the Old Bull and Bush. Worse still, some people may not even be talking English. We didn’t beat the Hun in two world wars to hear German spoken on public transport.Then there are all those Polish supermarkets. Who asked them to come over here, pay their taxes and business rates and set up on the high street? They don’t even have the grace to relabel their produce in English. And why can’t they sell something quintessentially British? Like Lurpak. What do you mean, that’s Danish? Butter was invented by the Brits.Truly, we have become an“island of strangers”. There are days when I walk out of my front door and have no idea where I am. Everything has become foreign. Must be the palm trees I planted in my front garden. It can only be days before the thought police come round to have them removed. The same people that were happy to let Keir Starmer echo Enoch Powell’s “strangers in their own country” line from his “rivers of blood” speech at his Monday press conference. Or maybe No 10 is just a bit clueless and hadn’t made the link.‘Cheap foreign labour’ – this is how Keir Starmer denigrates the migrant carers looking after your loved onesRead moreThis was the great immigration reset. Labour’s chance to channel the national mood that we are all fed up with foreigners. Hell, even foreigners have got fed up with foreigners these days. Here in the UK there are definitely hierarchies of foreigners. There are good foreigners and bad foreigners. But if in doubt, just assume the foreigners are bad. It saves time.Keir wanted you to know that Keir has also had his fill of foreigners. Enough is enough. His patience has been tested to the limit. Time to call a halt to the “squalid experiment in open borders”. A charming way of referring to people who had come to this country to work in the NHS and the care sector. But hey, it was time for Keir to deliver some home truths. He could be silent no more.Some might have thought it quite the coincidence that Labour was choosing this moment to target immigration. Little more than a week afterReform had cleaned up at the local elections. But Keir wanted you to know that Keir had always had it in for foreigners. He wasn’t the sort of prime minister who would play politics with other people’s lives. No. He had always believed this stuff. At least he had believed it for the past three years or so. There was nothing more Labour than targeting immigrants.“It’s time to take back control,” he began. Something he went on to frequently repeat. A phrase that had also been borrowed from the Conservatives and Reform. The difference was that Keir insisted he meant it. The Tories had lied through their teeth. Promising to reduce immigration while letting it quadruple in the four years between 2019 and 2023. Keir was going to cut immigration by … a lot.He couldn’t say how much exactly. Setting targets was to fall into the foreigners’ hands. By the end of the parliament you would notice the difference. More white faces everywhere. Even if they were strangers.Not that this was about prejudice. Heaven forbid. It was about fairness.Keir liked diversity, he stressed. It was just that you could have too much of a good thing. Thing was with foreigners, if you did them a favour then sooner or later they would start taking the piss. It’s about time migrants started talking English. That way anyone hearing a foreigner moaning about life in Britain could be reported to the authorities.Then to the details. The great Treasury experiment in using mass immigration to fuel economic growth had been disproved, Starmer insisted. The Tories had tried that and the economy had flatlined. It didn’t seem to have occurred to Keir that the economy might have been in an even worse state without the immigrants. But there is no place for those kind of awkward counterfactuals in Labour’s brave new world. That was one of the benefits of having fewer foreigners. We could go back to having good old British truths. Truths that Brits liked to tell themselves. Truths that weren’t contaminated by awkward foreigner facts.Time also for a major shake-up of the care sector. Keir had also had enough of foreigners come over here to do the jobs looking after our elderly men and women that no Brits were prepared to do. Far better to close the care homes and let the old people die in the street. Because that’s what the aged and those with dementia would have wanted. Pure Brits to the very last. Same with our hospitals. Better understaffed than fully staffed with the wrong people.And if all this didn’t have the desired effect? “If we need to do more, then mark my words, we will,” Starmer said. That was more like it. Here was an immigration policy to get behind. A prime minister who really meant business.None of this was enough to satisfy Kemi Badenoch. She immediately tweeted that she would have been a lot nastier to immigrants. Conveniently forgetting that she never got round to it while she had the chance in government. But give her another chance and just watch her go. No foreigner would be able to sleep easy in their sleep. Give her a chance and she might even deport herself.As for Nigel Farage, he was just a bit blase. This was all the stuff he had been saying for years. Finally, the Tories and Labour were coming round to his thinking. But, ever the opportunist, he used the occasion to muddy the waters. Most Reform voters think illegal immigration makes up half the national figures. Nige wasn’t about to disabuse them. The small boats were full of Iranian terrorists, he said. The race to the bottom is on.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchImmigration and asylumLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

She is now in real danger of dying without ever having known a moment of peace or contentment.The six-month-old Palestinian girl, whose painfully emaciated body symbolised the deliberate starvation of Gaza when sheappeared on the BBCthis week, was only 2.5kg when she was born on 20 November last year.From birth, Siwar had a problem with her oesophagus that has made it hard for her to drink breast milk and left her dependent on specialised formula, which is in critically short supply.Her parents’ home in al-Nuseirat, halfway up the coast on the Gaza Strip, was bombed earlier in the war, which began in October 2023 when Hamas killed 1,200 people inIsrael, leading to an Israeli assault that has so far killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza. They lived in tents for a while but it was almost impossible to get food or water in the camp and it also came under Israeli fire.They tried going back to al-Nuseirat to stay at Siwar’s grandparents’ home, but that was bombed, too. All that was left of the building was a single room, which they shared with 11 other people. That was where Siwar was born.View image in fullscreenSiwar has struggled to breastfeed and is unable to tolerate many different kinds of formula.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“I was exhausted all the time. There was no privacy, and I couldn’t get any rest,” said Najwa Aram, Siwar’s 23-year-old mother. “There was no food or proper nutrition, and when I gave birth to her, she was not like other babies.”“When she was born, she was beautiful despite the weakness visible on her features,” she said. “But now she is unnaturally thin. Babies her age are supposed to weigh 6kg or more – not just 2-4kg.”Najwa found out last month she was pregnant with her second child, but lives in terror of losing Siwar before her brother or sister is born. She has moved to Khan Younis to stay with her mother, but has spent most of the past few months in hospital with her frail daughter.Her husband, Saleh, is blind, and had to stay behind in al-Nuseirat. The relentless bombing has forced the family to move several times, like almost all families inGaza, and has torn them apart.“Even though Siwar’s father is blind, he used to play with her a lot. He visited us in the hospital only once, as he cannot move without someone accompanying him,” Najwa said. “He fears for her even more than I do – he is deeply attached to her.”The family has no source of income so relies on charity kitchens for food and some humanitarian aid, but that too is in desperately short supply as Israel’s total blockade of Gaza approaches the 70-day mark. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief agency, Unrwa,said this week: “the manmade and politically motivated starvation in Gaza is an expression of absolute cruelty”.Gaza mapNajwa and her mother have a single sack of flour left, as well as a few tins.“Once this runs out, we won’t be able to buy anything due to the high prices,” Najwa said. Even more critically, supplies of the special milk formula that Siwar needs are harder and harder to find.“I am also suffering from malnutrition. Still, I try to breastfeed Siwar, but she refuses and continues to cry, completely rejecting me,” Najwa said. “That’s why I’ve had to rely more on formula milk. When I used to breastfeed her, one can of formula would last a month. Now it runs out in less than a week.”Najwa and her daughter spent much of March in hospital in Deir al-Balah, where there was a milk formula that seemed to work, bringing Siwar’s weight up to 4kg.“I noticed that Siwar started to smile and play, which made me happy and gave me hope that her health might improve.”But that fragile moment of hope crumbled when they were discharged, and Siwar started losing weight again. She was referred to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, where mother and daughter remain, for now.“The doctors are doing everything they can to take care of her, but she also doesn’t tolerate the formula they prepare for her,” Najwa said. “The hospital situation is bad. There are six patients in each room. Everywhere you look, there is suffering. There’s a child in worse condition than Siwar.”“Seeing my daughter in this state every day gives me insomnia,” she said. “I’m constantly anxious and overthinking. Sometimes I can’t bear seeing her like this, and I start crying. I’m so afraid of losing her. Can’t the world open the crossings to allow in milk, food, and medicine. All I want is for my daughter Siwar to live like the rest of the children in the world.”Dr Ahmed al-Farah, the director of the children’s and maternity building at the Nasser medical complex, said between five and 10 new malnutrition cases are being recorded there every day.“We’re seeing severe cases.Malnutritionappears in children in a horrifying and extremely visible way,” Farah said. “We have nothing to offer them. They need proteins, but there are none. We try to provide a little milk, perhaps powdered milk, but we can’t offer anything more.“On top of that, the severe overcrowding in hospitals leads to increased disease transmission among children,” he added.There is only enough fuel left at the Nasser complex to keep the generators going for another 48 hours. They have already had to shut off electricity on the administrative floors to make it last a little bit longer, but the power supply will soon have to be cut to the overcrowded patients’ wards.“We are helpless in the face of their needs – we cannot provide food, supplements, medication, or vitamins appropriate for their conditions,” the doctor said. “I studied malnutrition in medical school textbooks. I used to think that study would remain theoretical, something we’d never see in real life. But now, those textbook descriptions have come to life before our eyes in Gaza,” Farah said.“I call on the world to see us as human beings – we were created just like everyone else.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMalnutritionMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

He’s made more than 100.Vampire’s Kiss: Nicolas Cage is unforgettable in this freakishly great cult classicRead moreI had rules about how I watched them. I had to watch them in chronological order. I was allowed to watch other movies during the Cage-watching period but never at my house – if I was home, I had to watch a Cage.

I discovered that Cage is a really good romcom lead – he’s so good inMoonstruck, and a movie called It Could Happen to You, which not many people have seen. I’d love to see him make another romcom.As I was watching all the films my friends were wondering whether it was some kind of sign of mental deterioration. It was the opposite, really. It was so good for me to have a project. It was an easy way to spend time with people, too. Everybody has an opinion about Cage. It’s a really great way to talk to people.My job means I need to have a work persona and a personal one. As a doctor, you’re expected to be warm and personable without necessarily having a distinctive personality. You’re there to help. You’re not there to share your life.

So people would ask about it and the Cage project would come up.View image in fullscreen‘Cage’ and Creagh, with her dog Billie.Photograph: James Gourley/The GuardianI never felt embarrassed about it, or worried about what patients would think.

I saw Joker: Folie à Deux 10 times in cinemas. This wasn’t because I was a big fan of the first Joker – I didn’t even like it that much. Folie à Deux is better – four stars.

Is there anyone in there saying: “This will not halt Reform. This will not make Reform less obnoxious. This will not make them more moderate, and it will not stop people voting for them. All it will do is make your own supporters despair.” If there is, are they screaming it, or whispering it, with a thousand-yard stare?It’s bad enough that the government has swallowed this anti-immigrant rhetoric wholesale; that it’s decided to land its misdirected toughness on the care workers is dumb on so many levels. First, Starmer’s claim that that migrant care workers are “cheap foreign labour”. Pause to note how extraordinary it is, to hear this kind of denigratory language coming from ahuman-rightslawyer. It is also untrue that migrants are driving down wages. People who employ care workers could tell him it’s untrue; datacould tell him it’s untrue. The last vestige of faith in this Labour government was that it rooted its arguments in fact. As it ceased to be the anti-austerity party, and dropped its promises that anything would get better, it would – at the very least, and it wasn’t much – not just say any old bilge that tested well with the imaginary Angry Red Wall Inhabitant.Anyone who’s ever interacted with any care workers feels a huge debt of gratitude to them, and yes, newsflash, this is irrespective of whether they were born in the UK. If you know any care workers, it’s because they’re caring for you or someone you love. It’s a pretty tight bond, far more intimate and meaningful than any you’ve ever had with your MP. To hear that we risk becoming an “island of strangers”, as Starmer has said, because of foreign-born care workers – well, it’s hard to muster the appropriate outrage because it’s just so patently untrue.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I once got sent footage of a few hundred people on either side of a tube track singing it at each other’Interviews by Lee CampbellMon 12 May 2025 09.34 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 12.47 EDTShareGuy Garvey, songwriter, vocalsBy 2007, we’d had a nerve-racking couple of years. We were on the V2 label for our first three albums but they were slowly folding. We signed with Fiction without them having heard a note of our fourth album, Seldom Seen Kid. As the money was running out, it was looking like “proper job” time. I would have been behind a nightclub till. Mark Potter would have been a chef and his brother Craig would have been an auxiliary nurse. But thankfully we got an advance and we were over the bloody moon.It had been an eventful time. Our friend Bryan Glancy, the real Seldom Seen Kid, had died, and I’d just got together withEmma Jane Unsworth, who I was then with for almost a decade.I got a call from David Joseph, who was head of Universal Music. He said: “Congratulations on the album but have you got anything else, to help us out on radio?” I said: “Given that it’s taken us two and a half years to write the 10 tracks that you have, I doubt it. But by all means, I’ll give it a go.”We had just over two weeks to come up with something before the final mastering for the album had to be complete. Over the next couple of days, I started kicking ideas around, recording some simple voice notes at home. The first idea I had was in the bath. I’m literally saying the words: “Blinking in the morning sun.” It had like a weird da-da-da thing about it. I went down to the studio with Craig and we said: “Let’s just take a run at this.”I’d had that lyric – “Throw those curtains wide” – for years. I’d tried the idea once before on anElbowsong called Ribcage, where I sing: “Pull my ribs apart and let the sun inside.” I left home at 17 and was absolutely skint for years but, no matter how dark or miserable I got, if I saw the dawn, it was all right.At Blueprint Studios in Salford, Craig fleshed out the chords. I had the idea of every line being echoed by a string section. You throw strings at a track and the listener feels ennobled, catered for and looked after. I recall analysing Bitter Sweet Symphony by the Verve and Unfinished Sympathy by Massive Attack, as well as Up With People by Lambchop, Loaded by Primal Scream and Spiritualized’s Ladies and Gentlemen. The song exploded into what can only be described as Lion King-esque euphoria.I knew the track was going to be a singalong of some proportions. I was freshly in love and Manchester was looking fantastic. The future was rosy. It was a feeling of, this is too joyous to keep to ourselves.View image in fullscreenGarvey performing with the band at Glastonbury 2008.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA Archive/PA PhotosThe loveliest legacy of the song is that at least twice a week, somebody approaches me in the street and tells me that they walked down the aisle to it. And somebody once sent me footage of a few hundred people on either side of a tube track singing it to each other. That is kind of magic.Craig Potter, keyboard player and producerSeldom Seen Kid was the first album I produced and mixed for Elbow. There were a lot of the influences that we always came back to – bands such as Beastie Boys, but particularly around that time Rufus Wainwright’s album Want One, specifically a track calledBeautiful Child. It is probably the shortest song we’ve written. We often spend months on them, and sometimes revisit them years later, but we turned around One Day Like This in a couple of weeks.Guy had the very basic, rising notes which I formed the chords from. Once the chords at the end were written, we realised that it had that this Hey Jude feel to it. There was no head-scratching to try and mould something that wasn’t quite right. It was pretty immediate from the beginning.People assume we had a big string section or even an orchestra. In fact, as we were short on time, it was actually just our three touring musicians from that period – Stella Page, Jote Osahn and Ian Burdge. We got them into the big room at Blueprint. I sat them up on three chairs with stereo mics and then for each different take moved the players around the room, either one over or one back, as if they were in different positions within an orchestra. With that, you get different resonances coming off the walls depending where they are sat. It’s a great way to blend strings when you’ve only got a few. It gives a much more classic sound.I also got them to bring in spare or older instruments of theirs to swap them around giving varying textures and asked them to play it perhaps not exactly as they normally would, imagining they are a different player for one take.At the end of the song, and this usually happens once on every album where there are some claps needed, we all just stood around one mic and started clapping. It’s then that we realise what we do for a job, and feel very lucky because it’s fun.Elbow’s new EP, Audio Vertigo Echo, is out on 6 June.Their UK tourbegins in Cardiff on 13 June.Explore more on these topicsElbowHow we madePop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said: “Britain is an inclusive and tolerant country, but the public expect that people who come here should be expected to learn the language and integrate.”Long-term net migration to the UKStarmer came under fire after delivering a speech on Monday morning that outlined his new language tests for migrants and a crackdown on visas.At a press conference in Downing Street, Starmer said: “Let me put it this way, nations depend on rules, fair rules. Sometimes they are written down, often they are not, but either way, they give shape to our values, guide us towards our rights, of course, but also our responsibilities, the obligations we owe to each other.“In a diverse nation like ours … we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.”Zarah Sultana wrote that Starmer had “imitated” Powell’s speech, which subsequently became a rallying cry for racists and the hard right in the UK.The independent MP for Coventry South wrote on X: “That speech fuelled decades of racism and division. Echoing it today is a disgrace. It adds to anti-migrant rhetoric that puts lives at risk. Shame on you,Keir Starmer.”Zack Polanski, who is running to be the next Green party leader, suggested that Starmer was deliberately echoing Powell’s phraseology. In a post on Bluesky, above quotes from both speeches, Polanski wrote: “Not even subtle.”SeveralLabourMPs questioned whether Starmer’s policies were fuelling racism. Sarah Owen, the Labour chair of the women and equalities committee, who is of Malaysian-Chinese heritage, said: “Chasing the tail of the right risks taking our country down a very dark path.“The best way to avoid becoming an ‘island of strangers’ is investing in communities to thrive – not pitting people against each other.”Nadia Whittome said anti-migrant rhetoric from the government was “shameful and dangerous”. The Labour MP for Nottingham East said: “To suggest that Britain risks becoming ‘an island of strangers’ because of immigration mimics the scaremongering of the far-right.”Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, appeared to endorse the message by reposting Whittome’s statement on X.Starmer was speaking before the publication of a 69-page immigration white paper that sets out details of how the government intends to introduce restrictions across all forms of visas to the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It suggests net migration could fall to 300,000 by 2029, but the government declined to confirm a target.Net migration, the difference between the number of people moving to the UK and the number leaving, was 728,000 in the 12 months to June 2024. Under the previous Conservative government, the figure rose to more than 900,000.Starmer said that the current immigration system “encourages some businesses to bring in lower-paid workers rather than invest in our young people”.Rain Newton-Smith, the Confederation of British Industry’s chief executive, said: “The reality for businesses is that it is more expensive and difficult to fill a vacancy with immigration than if they could hire locally or train workers … When considered alongside the large fees and accompanying charges, foreign workers are simply not the ‘easy’ or ‘cheap’ alternative.”Critics have claimed that the changes are part of Starmer’s attempts to combat the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party, which made significant gains in this month’s local elections.They include plans to raise foreign workers’ skills requirements to degree level, raise the standards of English language required for all types of visa including dependents, and increase the time it takes to gain citizenship from five years to as many as 10.Migrants who demonstrate a “contribution” to the economy and society through their tax returns, who work for the NHS and other public services, who have engineering jobs or who do outstanding voluntary service will be entitled to fast-track their permanent residency.Starmer said: “Our strategy is about delivering where the previous government failed year after year. It’s about rolling up our sleeves and fixing the broken immigration system to bring control to our borders, ending the open border experiment under the last government.“The immigration white paper gets on with the job that we were elected to deliver: lowering net migration, delivering higher skills, backing British workers and the start of repairing the public’s trust that was so damaged by the last government.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourMigrationImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

He was driven to the border withIsrael, where family who had flown over from the United States were waiting to meet him after initial check-ups.Netanyahu must now work for support of US as Trump tires of Israel’s war in GazaRead moreHe told Israeli soldiers after his release that he had been held handcuffed with other hostages, in a cage inside a tunnel, Israel’s Kan television reported.Hamas said in a statement they had freed Alexander “following contacts with the US administration, to achieve a ceasefire, open crossings, and bring aid and relief to our people in Gaza”.“We urge President Trump’s administration to continue its efforts to end this brutal war,” the statement added.Trump celebrated the release with a post on Truth Social on Monday afternoon. “Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage, is being released. Congratulations to his wonderful parents, family, and friends!”In a previous post he described the release as “a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators – Qatar and Egypt – to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones”.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, thanked Trump for his role in Edan’s release but also claimed credit was due to Israeli forces and his own government’s military strategy.“This was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President Trump. This is a winning combination,” he said in a statement.The Israeli leader has insisted throughout the war that military pressure is the best way to ensure that the hostages return home, even as Trump stepped up calls for a deal to end the conflict.Alexander’s release comes on the eve ofTrump’s first trip to the region since his re-election, with Israel conspicuously missing from his itinerary,and after a series of blunt public snubs to the country’s leadership.Trump to embark on Middle East trip to meet Gulf alliesRead moreTrump’s ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, denied on Monday that the relationship with Israel’s most important ally was strained. “Forget rumours. We’re all on the same page,” he said, after a meeting with Netanyahu and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s regional envoy which he described as “excellent”.Qatar and Egypt, who mediated Alexander’s release, described it as an encouraging step towards new truce talks. After the soldier returned to Israel, Netanyahu also said he had ordered negotiators to Doha to discuss a possible deal for Gaza, ahead of a planned new Israeli offensive there.For now, Israel’s leader appears trapped between Trump’s desire for a deal and pressure from his coalition partners to continue the war.His government relies on the backing of far-right parties who want Israel to keep fighting, including finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who earlier this month vowed that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed” and its Palestinian population will “leave in great numbers”.However Trump, who previously delighted Netanyahu’s far right allies by backing plans to force Palestinians to leave Gaza, has not publicly criticised Netanyahu.The Israeli leader may be hoping that strong support for Israel from the Republican base and other pressing demand’s on Trump’s attention, from the war in Ukraine to tariff talks with China, will divert the US leader’s attention away from Gaza even if fighting continues.Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square to watch footage of Alexander’s release and call for the return of other hostages. Trump said after Alexander’s release that only 20 of those were still alive, a number the Israeli government has not confirmed.Relatives and supporters called for the government to push for a breakthrough to bring back 58 others still in Gaza.Others were blunter. Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker who for a time was held with Alexander, said the prime minister was an “angel of death” and called for mass protests to force him from office.“Instead of ending the war and bringing everyone back, Netanyahu is preparing to expand the war this week. To execute the kidnapped who remain in captivity and to make the dead disappear,” she said. “Instead of saving lives and bringing everyone back, he chose to turn our loved ones into corpses.”Explore more on these topicsGazaHamasIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The door was damaged but nobody was hurt.The prime minister, who resides with his family in his official residence in Downing Street, is reportedly letting out the four-bedroom home.Police said they were treating this blaze as suspicious and said the decision to put the counter-terrorism command – SO15 – in charge of the investigation was a precaution.On Monday night, details of two more fires emerged. The LFB were called on Sunday morning shortly after 3am to a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington. The property is linked to the prime minister.One person was assisted to safety via an internal staircase by crews wearing breathing apparatus, LFB said. The fire was under control by 4am.Officers are also investigating a small car fire that happened just before 3am last Thursday on the same street as Starmer’s Kentish Town property.TheMetropolitan policeconfirmed it was investigating whether the fires were linked and said counter-terror officers were involved.A Met spokesperson said: “At this early stage of the investigation, officers are working to establish the circumstances of all three fires and are keeping an open mind as to whether there is any connection.“All are being treated as suspicious at this time, and inquiries remain ongoing.”In an earlier statement, the Met said: “As a precaution and due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure, officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command are leading the investigation into this fire. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the potential cause of the fire.“The cause of the fire continues to be investigated but at this stage is being treated as suspicious.”A No 10 spokesperson said: “I can only say that the prime minister thanks the emergency services for their work and it is subject to a live investigation. So I can’t comment any further.”News of the blaze came as Starmer on Monday morning revealed the government’s plan tocrack down on migration rules.The house, which he and his wife, Victoria, bought in 2004, has previously been targeted by protesters. Last year three people were found guilty of public order offences after apro-Palestinian demonstration outside the property.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLondonMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

Led by the then chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, signatories agreed to allocate 5% of funds to private assets, with no stipulation about keeping any of that money in the UK.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “We are choosing to back British businesses and British workers. I welcome this bold step by some of our biggest pension funds, which will unlock billions for major infrastructure, clean energy and exciting startups.”However, some pension fund providers are understood to be wary about any government efforts to force firms to put money into British assets, which could result in poorer returns for retirees compared with overseas investments, possibly breaching their fiduciary duties to clients.While the accord itself does not mandate UK investments, there are concerns that the pensions bill, due later this year, could leave the door open for the government to dictate how fund money is used.Zoe Alexander, the director of policy and advocacy at the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association, said the government, for its part, had “committed to take action to ensure there is a strong pipeline of investable assets for pension schemes. With everyone playing their part, there is great potential to boost returns for savers while providing vital funding to productive growth areas.”The voluntary pact covers signatories’ defined contribution pension schemes, which do not guarantee a set income at retirement, and are the default plan for most UK workers.The 17 signatories, which also include Aegon UK, Aon, M&G and Mercer, manage combined portfolios currently worth £252bn, suggesting UK investment commitments worth just £12.6bn.However, the government’s calculations predict those portfolios will grow by about 17% per year, and possibly further under government pressure to consolidate retirement schemes into national “megafunds” that are intended to replicate success stories in Canada and Australia.The Treasury believes that will leave the pension providers with portfolios worth £740bn by 2030, and roughly £50bn of new funds for private market investments, when discounting for existing commitments. Around half that – £25bn – would therefore be aimed at UK projects and startups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Treasury has been juggling competing interests, with lobbyists also calling for reforms that could simultaneously boost ownership of stock-exchange listed companies.London lost out on a raft of blockbuster listings in recent years, including by UK chip designer Arm, which opted to list on Wall Street in August 2023.The buy now, pay later company Klarnafollowed suit, while other companies such as Paddy Power owner, Flutter, and the travel company Tui opted to switch their primary listings from London to rival hubs such as New York and Frankfurt.However, the metals investment company Cobalt Holdings bucked the trend on Monday,announcing plans to float in London in June in a rare boost to the UK stock exchange. Cobalt is planning to raise roughly $230m (£174m), with commodities trader Glencore due to take a 10% stake.The government is also expected to launch a consultation in coming weeks on a possible shake-up of the Isa market to incentivise more investment in British stocks via the tax-free accounts.Explore more on these topicsPensions industryFinancial sectorPensionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sheriff’s officials presume the cause was an anchor failure but are still investigating. Three of the climbers – ages 36, 47 and 63 – were killed at the scene while the fourth person freed themselves and walked back to the trailhead then drove to a pay phone to call for help.Sheriff’s personnel and county search and rescue volunteers responded to the accident late Sunday morning about 16 miles (26km) west of Mazama in an area of rock formations that are popular with climbers, the Okanogan county sheriff’s office said in a social media post on Monday.The fourth climber sustained internal bleeding and a traumatic brain injury in the fall and was taken to a hospital in Seattle, Okanogan county undersheriff David Yarnell told the Seattle Times on Monday.“He didn’t realize he had as significant of internal injuries as he did,” Yarnell said.A helicopter rescue team from nearby Snohomish county helped recover the bodies from the technical, mountainous terrain.Investigators said they will inspect the climbers’ gear to help confirm the cause of the fall.Yarnell told the Seattle Times that all four climbers were locked in to the same anchor point which is “not preferred”. The anchor point will also be investigated to determine if it was pre-existing or their own gear.“All we know is that the anchor point that they were all tied off to failed,” Yarnell said.Explore more on these topicsWashington stateNational parksWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Other significant awards presented at the award ceremony were author of the year, which went to Percival Everett for his novel James and overall book of the year, which went to Patriot by Alexei Navalny, accepted on his behalf by his widow Yulia Navalnaya. “Receiving this award, from across the book community is a powerful recognition of the strength of Alexei’s voice,” Navalnaya said. “It tells us that truth still matters, that integrity matters, that words can break through even the hardest walls and reach hearts everywhere.”Though Atwood did not attend the ceremony in London, she recorded a video acceptance speech to be shown when she was announced winner of the freedom to publish award, which is supported by freedom of expression campaign organisation Index on Censorship and was established in 2022 to “highlight the growing threats to writers, publishers and booksellers, and to amplify those who fight back”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Hand-produced manuscripts were secretly circulated and bad luck for you if you were caught. They’ve also included the recent spate of censorship and book banning, not only in the oppressive countries around the world, but also in the United States. They have included too the attempt to expel from universities anyone who disagrees with the dogmas of their would-be controllers.”Atwood is the fourth recipient of the freedom to publish prize, which is decided on by The Bookseller and Index on Censorship. Previous recipients have included Salman Rushdie and Arabella Pike, a publishing director at HarperCollins who was recognised for her “fortitude and bravery” in defending two of her authors in the face of legal battles brought against them by Russian oligarchs.Philip Jones, editor of The Bookseller and the British Book awards’ chair of judges, said: “From east to west, our writers are now challenged, coerced and threatened in ways we thought were being consigned to history. Margaret Atwood and her books stand against that.”Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, a dystopia about an oppressive society in which women are forced to give birth to children, is one of the books most oftenchallenged or bannedin US schools. In 2022, the novelistannounced an “unburnable” editionof her most famous novel as a symbol against censorship. With “acts of bold creativity” such as this, as well as through her writing and public advocacy, Atwood “confronts repression not with fear but with wit and clarity”, said Jemimah Steinfeld, CEO of Index on Censorship.Explore more on these topicsBooksMargaret AtwoodBritish Book AwardsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

It just seems so heavily weighted in that way.”Allen is accused of sexual abuse by the director’s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow; Allen has always denied the allegations and two official investigations by social services departments in Connecticut and New York state were closed after finding no evidence against him. Allen’s son, investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, has been outspoken in support of Dylan, while adopted son Moses Farrow has been equally outspoken in defence of Allen. Penn worked with Allen onthe 1999 film Sweet and Lowdown, for which he was nominated for an Oscar.Penn said: “I am not aware of any clinical psychologist or psychiatrist or anyone I’ve ever heard talk or spoken to around the subject of paedophilia that, in 80 years of life, there’s accusations of it happening only once. I’m not aware of that. And when people try to associate what were his, let’s say, much younger girlfriends, right or wrong … is to me a different conversation.”He added: “I see he’s not proven guilty, so I take him as innocent, and I would work with him in a heartbeat.”In the same interview Penn cast new light onhis meeting with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2018at the height of the Syrian civil war. Penn was working on a now-abandoned documentary about the Arab Spring uprisings. Penn told Theroux he wanted permission to speak to Isis prisoners and speak to Syrians “on the street … without a minder”. According to Penn, al-Assad’s response was, “Absolutely, we have nothing to hide”, and then invited him to lunch.Penn said: “I got into his car and … we drove about 20 minutes through Damascus. To this day, I have to believe it was The Truman Show. That every block all the way to his house was staged. People driving up next to him and saying, “hello, Mr President”. “Hey, how are you?” This kind of thing. Virtually no visible security.”“We went to the house. Again, no sign of security of any kind. He’s there with his wife and his children. His children are as western as any California kid, and they’re listening to Kanye and dancing around.”However, Penn said as negotiations progressed, access was denied and he decided to drop the film.Penn also had harsh comments on bothDonald Trumpand Elon Musk. Trump, he said, might be “extremely smart for his time and what it valued”, adding: “But what he values is so base. I won’t equate that with intelligence. It’s truly void of soul. And really, it actively engages in cruelty.”Penn said that Musk,who until recently was heading a so-called “department of government efficiency” for Trump’s administrationresulting in the shutdown of swathes of public services, appeared only to “value destruction of things and people”, adding. “I can’t associate that with any intelligence that’s going to do humankind any good.”Saying he had met Musk “on several occasions”, Penn suggested that Musk’s insecurities were down to being a “prematurely balding teenager, white in apartheid South Africa, who has no social skills” and that in his view Musk was a combination of “a lot of destructive energy and a lot of stuff that may end up being very productive for other generations”.Penn also reflected on his tempestuous relationship withMadonna, to whom he was married between 1985 and 1989, and in the course of which he had a number of run-ins with paparazzi. Responding to Theroux’s question about Madonna’s statement in her 1991 documentary In Bed with Madonna that Penn was “the love of her life”, Penn said: “She’s very sweet. Look, she’s been a good friend for a lot of years. It didn’t take us long to realise that we had mistaken a good first date for a wedding partner. It didn’t take us long to recover after we got divorced, maybe a year, in a friendship. I have a lot of fond memories of it – it’s not all jail. But there was a lot of alcohol and she’d be fairly accusing me of that.”Penn also said that he may have helped accelerate the rise of celebrity culture by his occasionally violent responses to harassment by the media. “[It] added to the idea you can go provoke people like this idiot. I’m probably partially responsible for this explosion that led to all this. Extreme creepy fascination with famous people and things like that. My life was much simpler before [meeting Madonna]. But she became a lightning rod of attention. I was there.”Explore more on these topicsFilmSean PennWoody AllenElon MuskDonald TrumpMadonnaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

I just hope it ends very quickly.”Speaking on Thursday, his vice-president, JD Vance, saidsimply it was “none of our business”.But by late Friday night, as both sides escalated the conflict, it was made clear to the Trump administration that leaving the two nuclear armed countries to their own devices posed a danger not just to the region but to the world – and that the only third party mediator acceptable to both sides was the US, as it has historically been over decades. In particular, the US began to fear the escalation towards a nuclear threat was becoming a very real possibility.This threat was seen to escalate further after India launched strikes at three critical Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan air base in the city of Rawalpindi, in the early hours of Saturday – an attack said to be an attempt to pre-empt an imminent strike by Pakistan. The headquarters of the army and military wing who safeguard Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are based in Rawalpindi, and the army chief and the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, were so concerned that the PM called for a meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA), the body in control of Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities. Pakistan later denied ever calling the meeting.“At this point, the fear for everyone was a nuclear war between two arch rivals,” said one Pakistan security official – something Trump referenced on Monday when he boasted on his Truth Social social media network that he had prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two countries.Trump had tasked Rubio with talking down the Pakistan side, while Vance was the one dealing directly with India and its prime minister, Narendra Modi.Rubio made repeated calls not only to Munir, the army chief, but also Pakistan’s national security adviser, Asim Malik, and Sharif. According to officials, the message from Rubio was simple: this needs to stop.Interventions were also made by Saudi Arabia, Iran and the UAE, and the UK also applied pressure through diplomatic backchannels.“We welcomed the US intervention,” said one Pakistan official. “We don’t want war but if it is imposed upon us, then we have no choice to respond with aggression, as we did.”India has since maintained that their fight was “only with terrorists” and that it was “a shame that the Pakistan military chose to intervene”.By 2.30pm on Saturday, the heads of both Pakistan and India’s military operations spoke on the phone for the first time since hostilities broke out. Initially they agreed for the ceasefire to begin at 4pm, but after reports of cross-border firing and drones along the disputed border in Kashmir, known as the line of control, it was pushed back.As well as an end to all aggressions, the ceasefire included an agreement for future truce talks to take place between the two countries, likely in one of the Gulf states such as the UAE, according to officials.Anwaar ul Haq Kakar, the former prime minister of Pakistan who has been privy to high level discussions, said the talks would primarily focus on securing the ceasefire and discussions on India’s ongoing suspension of the Indus River treaty, which governs critical water flow into Pakistan.“Immediately Kashmir issue might not be discussed – but after some confidence building measures, the issue of Kashmir will be on the table,” said Kakar.While Pakistan openly discussed the US role in brokering peace, Sharif publicly thanking Trump for his involvement, India made no mention at all of any outside influence in the agreement – instead later claiming it was Pakistan who had first approached them for a ceasefire.Indian officials did not respond to requests by the Guardian to discuss the ceasefire negotiations. However analysts said India’s refusal to discuss any US role in a ceasefire was indicative of the Modi government’s non-alignment foreign policy and its bullish rejection of outside interference in India’s affairs.On Sunday, Trump – who seemed to have discovered a newfound interest in the subcontinent – tweeted that he was willing to work with India “to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir”.India and Pakistan’s dispute over Kashmir dates back not thousands of years, but instead to 1947, after the partition of India and the formation of Pakistan. The two countries have since fought three wars over the region, which remains divided between both. Indian-administered Kashmir is home to a decades-long violent insurgency, said to be backed and funded by Pakistan, and is one of the most militarised zones in the world.India has historically rejected third-party mediation on Kashmir, viewing it as a sovereign issue, and remains highly sensitive to any discussion over it at an international level.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanDonald TrumpMarco RubioJD VanceSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Must try harder!Suraiya HaddadMon 12 May 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 16.01 EDTShareThis series ofUniversity Challengehas been another corker, and the final a gripping showdown between two brilliantly clever teams fighting tooth and nail for every point. After 36 matches and 26 teams knocked out, Warwick and Christ’s College, Cambridge, are left standing. But these two have met before, coming face to face in their second quarter-finals. Then, Christ’s College emerged victorious (205 – 155).Could Christ’s win again? Or would Warwick claim their third University Challenge victory? All we knew for sure was that the trophy would be presented to a captain called Oscar.First, a word for the fashion. Amol Rajan’s dapper tuxedo: very nice. The students all looked very smart (in both senses), but for me, Christ’s Brendan Bethlehem wins best dressed for his knitted number.To the match then, and Warwick took an early and convincing lead, winning five of the first six starter questions, with buzzes from Benjamin Watson, Thomas Hart and captain Oscar Siddle. Warwick had full conversion of bonuses on poetry, British-Ghanian artist John Akomfrah and Laplace’s equation, taking the score to 105-25.Happily, for Christ’s, a biochemistry starter was won by their biochemist captain, Oscar Despard, marking the start of their comeback. Two buzzes from Bethlehem on Mozart and singing styles and a maths buzz from their mathematician, Linus Luu and Christ’s had soon made triple digits, too, making the score 140 Warwick – 105 Christ’s.Bethlehem got a cracking buzz on a Chinese poem, but the team were unable to get any bonuses from it. Warwick’s final touch of the proverbial ball was a buzz from Watson and an impressive conversion of points on the Yoruba religion found mostly in west Africa.Warwick never lost their leisurely pace and relaxed reasoning through answers, even while time was whittling down and the scores were getting closer. Christ’s was well skippered by Despard, who kept the team moving quickly through the last questions of the series to good effect, closing the gap in the final seconds of the game.The final buzz came 30 seconds before the gong from Christ’s Anniko Firman, (the name of Clytemnestra’s husband and the brother of Menelaus – Agamemnon) and levelled the scores: 170-170. The winning answer came from Bethlehem seconds later (the name of George II eldest son – Frederick). Final score: 175-170. Victory for Christ’s College, Cambridge. They’ll probably let Rajan off for not accepting Alexandrine instead of Alexandrina, all things considered.On to the ADC theatre in Cambridge, then, for the trophy presentation by the great Ian McKellen. The ADC theatre was a fitting venue to host him, given that he made his stage debut there in 1958. Good to hear that he liked the Shakespeare question: me too.Some of the questions felt very sporting for the final, though any year-seven student should be able to tell you the most common isotope of carbon. The Edward Hopper was the most textbook of Hoppers. And I hope I don’t upset Sir Ian in saying this, but Hecate was also a bit of an easy one for the final! It was baffling, too, that none of this brainy bunch knew diesel was both an engine type and a fuel.Thrilling to the end, it was an absolute nailbiter of a finale. Both teams were firing on all cylinders with every member contributing. We all feel for the Warwick team losing by that most narrow of margins at literally the last minute. Oscar Siddle, Ananya Govindarajan, Thomas Hart and Benjamin Watson played a great match and should be tremendously proud of their success. Who knows how the series would have ended had we had just one more question.But the final word must go to Christ’s College, Cambridge: Oscar Despard, Anniko Firman, Brendan Bethlehem and Linus Luu. Huge congratulations on your historic triumph – the first University Challenge win for Christ’s College in the programme’s 63-year history. I’ll even forgive you for knocking out Imperial in the quarter-finals.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewUniversity ChallengeGame showsAmol RajanreviewsShareReuse this content"

No one working here is old enough to vouch for that; the distillery believes they are anywhere from 100 to 125 years old, which is old in the grand scheme of barrels’ lifespans, but not unusual. But it can say with certainty, using records of its vintages, that these barrels are on their fifth use – at least.In the alcohol industry, when ageing liquor can easily take decades, the vessels that house them can also become more covetable over the years. In an age of disposable materials and dire news of plastics polluting our environment, reused wooden barrels exist in stark contrast. The lives of barrels are long, shockingly sustainable and currently imperiled by trade war.Many circumnavigate the globe and end their days in distilleries in remote corners of the world, originating in the forests of Hungary and moving from mountain towns in Canada to distilleries in the Caribbean and Mexico. At Hamilton, new American oak barrels hold fresh distillate, alongside the dinosaurs: French cognac barrels that show their age. They’re gray, stained and a little warped.Laws Whiskey House in Denver, Colorado, considers itself a “terroir-forward distillery”, the distillery’s brand manager, Casey Rizzo, told me over the phone. Terroir, the flavor that emerges from a specific environment, comes from both grain and barrels. “White American oak has a lot of natural wood sugars and natural vanillin. When you’re charring a barrel, you’re caramelizing it like a creme brulee. A barrel pulls whiskey in and then pushes it back out. Whiskey goes into the barrel clear and comes out with all that color, and vanilla and caramel flavors.”View image in fullscreenCognac barrels in Cognac, France, in 1999.Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianRizzo added: “We think of barrels as teabags. It gets used first for bourbon, like the first steep of a teabag. You get a lot of color and flavor from the barrel quickly. If you use the barrel again, it’ll take longer to impart, so maybe it’s used for scotch, which sits and ages longer. You mute the barrel’s flavors along the way.”Modern distilling relies on increasingly sophisticated technologies for monitoring conditions in cellars and fermentation, but distilleries still depend on lo-tech barrels to impart flavor and color to their products. Barrels consist only of wood and steel hardware, held together with no glue or nails. Remove its rings and give it a smack, and a barrel can unfurl like a chocolate orange. At some distilleries, employees still rotate their barrels by hand, a practice called clocking (rolling barrels according to a clock’s face). “This ensures proper exposure to the varying temperatures within the warehouse and adds consistency from barrel to barrel,” said Frank Krockenberger, director of hospitality forLoretto, Kentucky’s Star Hill Farm, home of the Maker’s Mark distillery.It was one stop on my journey to follow how barrels – so important for the beverage industry – are made. As a food and beverage writer, much of my work dredges up stories about monumental food waste, and the struggle to repurpose materials. But when it came to barrels, I found practices that were surprisingly sustainable, of wood being reused for centuries, and forests being protected.How to make a wine barrelJust as Kentucky is the epicenter of bourbon, so too is it the headquarters of bourbon barrel production. An hour away from Maker’s Mark, in Louisville, I witnessed the birth of American oak barrels at the Brown-Forman Cooperage, which produced barrels exclusively for the Cooper’s Craft and Jack Daniel’s brands, at least in terms of their first use(however,the cooperage recently closed, with the Kentucky Distillers’ Association citing changing consumer trends, European Union tariffs and taxes as reasons for the industry’s decline).Machines carved staves (the vertical planks of a barrel), and master coopers (the craftsmen who make barrels) hammered hoops around them before charring them on a rotating belt with enormous bursts of flame. The scene blended with modern efficiency and ancient technology (the Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote about coopers near the Alps who stored their wine in hooped wooden vessels, and there is archaeological evidence of barrels from ancient Egypt). The business had churned out barrels since 1945 and produced more than 60,000 barrels annually. But starting this year, Brown-Forman will now source barrels externally.Oak is commonly used for barrels, due to the ease of carving it, its durability in holding liquid (it is unlikely to warp or crack) and its ability to impart desirable flavors to spirits. But not all barrels are made of oak. I encountered barrels made from chestnut, hickory and maple, as well as more exotic woods used in the ageing of specialty products (Hawaiian koa used to age sugarcane rum, andBrazilian amendoim bravo used to age cachaça, for example). I also found hybrid barrels in Patron’s distillery, their bodies composed of Brown-Forman American oak staves, and their heads (the ends of the barrels) made of French limousin oak.View image in fullscreenBarrels being made at the Jack Daniel’s distillery.Photograph: David HandschuThe barrel-making process is zero-waste and astonishingly fast. It takes a cooper about 45 seconds to raise a single barrel. Sawdust is collected and used for horse and cow bedding. These barrels are frequently shipped flat, so “we don’t ship air”, one cooper told me, and are reassembled at their destinations.I found Brown-Forman’s trademark “B” stamp on dozens of rusted hoop rivets, 1,900 miles away in the cellars and storage rooms of Don Fulano in Jalisco, Mexico. In the ageing rooms of adifferent tequila distillery, Volcán, I found barrels containing decade-old tequila held together by rivets stamped with Bs. The trained eye can spot other signs of where a barrel came from, said Greg Roshkowski, the vice-president of wood planning, procurement and processing at Brown-Forman, Jack Daniel’s and Cooper’s Craft’s parent company, wrote via email. He said some experts “will be able to spot Brown-Forman barrels by other various characteristics, such as the head placement, chime (the beveled edge of a barrel, where the staves meet), locations of hoops, etc. It’s certainly fun to walk through other countries and their warehouses and see 50- to 60-year-old Brown-Forman barrels ageing all sorts of spirits from rum to scotch and Irish whiskey.”Meet the seed collector restoring California’s landscapes - one tiny plant at a timeRead moreThe international use of barrels is part and parcel of the global liquor industry. Large conglomerates like LVMH, Brown-Forman and Suntory have multiple spirits brands in their portfolios, and barrels make their rounds internally. A Kentucky-made barrel might end up in Scotland to age scotch because Brown-Forman owns both the Jack Daniel’s and Glendronach brands.Given the barrels’ long lives and travels, makers are investing in regenerative cultivation of their raw materials. Though mature white oak trees are plentiful, the species could be on the decline, primarily due to a “lack of active management that creates the conditions needed for oak seedlings to thrive”, according to the US Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service. Maker’s Mark, part of Suntory, partnered with the University of Kentucky in a genome-mapping project of the American white oak to preserve the species. The partnership has also led to the establishment of the world’s largest repository of American white oak trees. It’s 24 acres with nearly 10,000 trees representing more than 400 varieties of white oak, amongother sustainability initiatives.The barrel-flavor equationSustainability isn’t the only concern. Manipulating flavors with barrels is a science and art. Roshkowski said: “[The barrels] are part of their recipes. You’ll see callouts for once-used Jack Daniel’s barrels from Scotland to Guyana, Russia to Malaysia and beyond. These barrels will live on for another 30 to 50 years ageing fine spirits, coffee beans, honey, soy sauce or Tabasco.”Lucas Assis, an agave and sugarcane spirit educator, said: “Fortaleza usedcharanda[a rare Mexican sugarcane rum] barrels for their winter blend [last year],” he said. “Barrels tell a story. It doesn’t matter how many times you use it. French oak is still going to bring back chocolate or spiciness. Brazilian amburana wood gives a cinnamon finish.”Distilleries that aren’t owned by large conglomerates enlist the help of a barrel broker who can source unique barrels. Mara Smith sources old pinot noir barrels from France through a broker, as they give her Inspiro tequila a rosy hue and flavors like “berries, some nuttiness, a floral [aroma] on the nose”.Barrels foster circular economies. I see Whiskey Del Bac barrels at Tucson’s Monsoon Chocolate. “We get mesquite-smoked whiskey barrels a couple days after they’ve been drained, then we take refined chocolate, put it into nut milk bags, cut the top of the barrel off, and age the chocolate for four to six months. Cocoa butter is the carrier of aroma in chocolate, so it’s sitting there, absorbing the barrel’s aroma,” said Adam Krantz, the company’s founder.I bite into the barrel-aged chocolate, tasting whiskey and smoke. A barrel is near the end of its life when it gets to Monsoon. Slicing it open for chocolate renders the barrel useless for anything other thanfurniture,plantersand a rather stunning variety of items such as golf ball holders,ax targets, lazy susans and more, all under the Wine Enthusiast product umbrella.View image in fullscreenA winery cellar worker pumps fermented pinot noir juice into new French oak barrels for ageing near Healdsburg, California, in 2012.Photograph: George Rose/Getty ImagesIn remote, mountainous Banff, Canada, Park Distillery sources barrels from wineries and other distilleries. “We are looking for sweet and rich flavors from the barrel. Lignin, vanillin, tannins and lactones are some of the important compounds in the wood,” said master distiller Scott Coburn. Like Tucson’s Hamilton Distillers, the operation is relatively small, and it receives assembled barrels. After about three uses for whisky (which must be aged for a minimum of three years in Canada), it uses them for barrel-aged gin and cocktails. Then the barrels are passed on to breweries for barrel-aged beer. Once spent, the barrels meet their end in Banff’s restaurants as decoration.Rizzo outlines a Laws Whiskey barrel’s typical lifespan. “We age our Four Grain Bourbon and send those used bourbon barrels [after four to 10 years] to a local apiary, Bee Squared, in Berthoud, Colorado. They age their honey in those used barrels for 90 days to produce a glorious local barrel-aged honey. We then get those barrels back and put more bourbon into them to make a natural honey-aged bourbon [which takes a year and a half of ageing]. One went to our friends at Lady Justice Brewing, who aged a honey bock beer in the honey barrel. Once that was finished in six months to two years, they put malted barley grain inside the barrel for another six months to two years to flavor the grain to produce another beer. And then the barrel is made into furniture.” These barrels had seven lives.But barrels’ travels are in dangerRecent tariffs are making the very aspect of manufacturing barrels, distilling alcohol and selling its finished product more expensive. In American winemaking, particularly in California, French oak barrels will be affected by the EU’s retaliatory tariffs. Since barrels are essentially an ingredient in any given type of alcohol’s recipe, a winemaker would not be able to easily switch out a type of wood they have used previously for something available domestically.Since tariffs are duties placed on imported goods, used barrels costs are spiking, whether they are entering the US or departing it (due to retaliatory tariffs).American spirits companies saw the effect that potential tariffs had on Canada immediately, as their products werepulled off Canadian shelves in February, in response to the 25% tariffs on Canadian goods that the Trump administration had put in place then. This has been a particular blow to American bourbon and cooperages, conjoined industries already imperiled by changing consumer tastes.“Even when barrels aren’t directly targeted by tariffs, they’re deeply tied to the global trade of the products they help create – bourbon, wine, tequila, rum.Tariffson those goods ripple down to the barrel market. Producers are scaling back how much they’re ageing and how far ahead they’re willing to invest, and that’s hit the barrel world hard. Used bourbon barrel prices have dropped nearly 50% in the past six to eight months. “Some days, it feels like they’re falling by the hour,” said Matt Albrecht, owner of River Drive Cooperage in Buxton, Maine, who also sells and sources used barrels.“It’s a perfect storm,” said Albrecht. American producers are now rushing to empty barrels and bottle their spirits ahead of expected tariffs and are flooding the market. “Meanwhile, international buyers, many of whom were paying top dollar for barrels just last year, are holding off, betting that prices will drop even further if the US economy stumbles. That’s led to a standoff: supply is high, demand is frozen and prices are volatile.”The consequences of this current disruption in the barrel economy might not be seen for years. “What’s on the market today started as trees harvested years ago. It takes at least two to four years to go from log to freshly emptied bourbon barrel, often longer,” said Albrecht.After the 2008 recession, there was a barrel shortage in 2012, which meant there was four-year lag in the barrel supply chain. One can only hope that these emblems of sustainable, circular economies may continue to age gracefully, their journeys unhindered by tariffs.Explore more on these topicsWineOur unequal earthFood & drink industryTrump tariffsTariffsAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nope. I just move on to the next task. Relishing the accomplishment feels superfluous, because I’ve only done what’s expected of me.Does it matter if I don’t feel proud of my accomplishments? Dr Chu Hui Cha, a clinical psychologist based in California, believes it does. You could end up in a place where “nothing ever feels good enough, nothing you do feels really good, and you’re always looking to aim higher, up the ante in terms of successes and achievements”, she says. “It’s a formula for chronic unhappiness and dissatisfaction.”Conversely, feeling pride in your achievements is linked tobetter mental health,self-esteemand your belief in your capabilityto face challenges.I asked experts why some of us are unable to celebrate our wins, and for practical tips to help with doing so.Why is it so hard to take a break from work – even if we want to?Read moreWhy don’t I feel proud of my achievements?Those who fear failure may believe that succeeding at something is “a test of who they are and their ability”, says Cha. Their self-worth is tied to achievement, and failure can be excruciating.They see failure as a threat, fear it and are hypervigilant about avoiding it at all costs, says Dr Jessica Rohlfing Pryor, a clinical psychologist and clinical assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University. During the process of working toward their goal, they “might be white-knuckling it until they get there”, says Cha, because “the process of getting there feels anxiety-provoking or very pressured”.Attaining a goal means they have averted failure, shame and rejection, so the emotion they experience is relief, says Pryor. Cha adds that it can “be difficult to segue into feeling good or proud from that place of high pressure, anxiety and fear”.Who is likely to feel this way?Cha says “this is a topic that comes up a lot in therapy”, particularly for clients from families that expected high achievement but didn’t necessarily celebrate it.“There is certainly a familial component, such as perfectionistic parenting or critical parenting,” says Pryor. For example, “a lot of Asian American women have grown up in a family that communicates that they need to succeed”, says Cha, where consequently achieving was a way to avoid criticism.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Even if caregivers, teachers or coaches did celebrate your accomplishments, Pryor says this “can turn into a sense of pressure to continue to produce or act or accomplish in the ways and at the rate that others have learned to expect from you”. You develop a “worry about shame and rejection”, says Pryor – if you don’t churn out success after success, you may not be good enough to be loved by others.People with unhealthy perfectionism are driven to meet exceedingly high standards, and feel crushing distress if they fail to meet them. They have a “high motivation for avoidance of failure, shame and social rejection”, says Pryor.Many of the perfectionistic individuals Pryor treats and studies report next to no experience in failing during their childhood and teen years. When they eventually experience failure, this can “create a sense of confusion about their identity, and a wonder about their capability”, says Pryor. From then on, they invest “robust energy and effort to avoid failure”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to Mead, working on a task and facing challenges can evoke guilt and shame in many individuals with ADHD. They may also have an intense emotional reaction to rejection or failure, known as rejection sensitivity dysphoria. When they finally achieve the goal, they feel relieved that “they’ve done the unpleasant thing”, and “crossing it off the list brings a sense of catch-up, not celebration”.How do I feel pride in my accomplishments?First, consider why the stakes of success feel high. Reflect on why an achievement feels so important and why you are afraid to fail, suggests Cha.Do you believe you’re only worth something if you achieve something? “Our value doesn’t come from what we do but from just being who we are, from just existing,” Cha counsels. If this is hard to internalize, she encourages exploring the roots of your beliefs about self-worth with a therapist.Cha also suggests imagining what it would look like if you didn’t succeed, and asking yourself how much of the consequences you could “reasonably survive”. This might help lower the stakes and anxiety, she says. If fear of failure is significantly disrupting your enjoyment of life, it might be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional.Second, celebrate the small steps while you are still working toward a bigger goal, says Pryor.It can be helpful to “track what was meaningful, not just successful”, during the process, says Dr Aimee Martinez, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles. Think about what you have risked to carry out the task, what you have learned and what you have brought to the table.These elements may be more subtle for those with ADHD, says Mead. Encourage yourself to get specific: celebrate that you started the project at 9am instead of 10am, or that you remembered to eat lunch while completing the task.How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something newRead more“There is more of a cognitive element to pride than something like happiness,” says Dr Leah Dickens, an associate professor of psychology at Kenyon College in Ohio. “People experience happiness relatively easily and automatically when they experience something good,” Dickens says, while pride in personal success “involves a bit of self-reflection in order to experience it”.Give yourself some kudos, says Pryor. Speak these meaningful moments aloud. Write them on Post-it notes and stick them on your wall or in your journal. Treat yourself to barista-made coffee or a midweek dinner with a friend.“Research shows that there’s a bidirectional relationship between behavior change and attitude change,” says Pryor. Changing your behavior, even if you do not believe in it, can lead to an internal attitude shift. If a critical thought about celebrating a small win pops up, notice it without judgment, then do it anyway, says Pryor.Celebrating the small steps helps you develop “an internal praise structure”, says Pryor. When you finally achieve the larger goal, cast your mind back to all these smaller moments, says Martinez. Celebrating the larger goal will feel less foreign because you’ve already done it in many little ways before the final moment of victory.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyUS work & careersMental healthPsychologyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it risks driving voters towards the Lib Dems and GreensMon 12 May 2025 12.49 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareImmigration is a tinderbox. No one listening to voters on doorsteps in recent local elections could deny this. Nothing Labour does will satisfy those few who rate immigration as their top concern, but its new immigration plan is a serious endeavour to stop cheap labour undercutting pay. How will it go down? If Labour HQ celebrates a splash of rightwing front pages whooping up its toughest measures, those same headlines may propel more Labour people into the arms of the Liberal Democrats and Greens. But there is more depth to Labour’s policy than merely chasingNigel Farage.An old theory – that immigration squeezes out British people by taking available jobs – is being turned into a real-life social experiment. We shall now see if what sounds plausible works in practice. Is cheap labour really the cause of Britain’s high rate of economic inactivity and businesses’ rotten record in training new employees?There will be no more visas for low-skilled workers, especially foreign care workers. That creates a problem for all of the care homes that have come to depend on immigrants. Will the country’s1.5 million out-of-work people, or its 9 million economically inactive people, take on the estimated150,000 vacanciesthat exist in the care sector? Another group the government is targeting are the10,000 peoplewho paid a fortune to fraudulent recruiters for visas to do jobs that didn’t exist. The government is due to match them with care jobs, while people already here on visas who want to stay longer will be able to get extensions if they, too, take on these roles.But will it work? Nearly a fifth of care workers come from overseas, and care providers protest vigorously that their jobs attract no applicants. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, has said the plans deal “acrushing blowto an already fragile sector”. But only higher pay will entice people who can earn more in Aldi. The government has delayed its promised fair pay agreement for care workers to 2028. Decadesof failure to reform care will stretch into the blue yonder. Now we’ll see if people in Britain will take the place of barred migrants.Yvette Cooper says there will be 50,000 fewer low-skilled visas issued this year. It’s a modest target. It’s good to make employers wanting to bring in staff from overseas prove they are training British employees first. For those employers that are cutting home apprenticeships, Starmer has warned that the cost of engineering visas will rocket.But blocking visas is itself a risky experiment that may limit Labour’s other big ambition: growth. If care homes or other businesses fold (chefs, florists and more are on the list of occupationsbarred from having low-skilled visas issued), Keir Starmer may beat a retreat. Politically, it may not be wise to take another swing at the rising number of elderly voters by assaulting their threadbare care sector. Since old people are the mostopposed to migration, maybe the dilemma should be put to them: immigration or care?Universities have largely escapeda raid on the already diminished numbers of foreign students. Many universities are already teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. But a proposed new levy on foreign students risks undermining them, weakening their soft power. This seems madness:more than a quarter of the world’s countrieshave leaders who were educated here in Britain. Meanwhile, highly skilled workers will still get visas. That’s sensible: a rich supply of scientists will be fleeing stricken US universities, and the EU Horizon programme has granted Britain £500m in research funding.Eye-catching announcements that pleased the rightwing press included the requirement for a higher standard of English to get a visa. So did the plans to make it easier to deport foreign criminals. A law that toughens interpretation of article 8 of the European convention on human rights to make judgments on the “right to a family life” more consistent is sensible, though the suggestion that immigration lawyers were using this to make deportation more difficult was bogus. When Theresa May told the Conservative party conference in 2011 about “the illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat”, the judiciary quickly pointed out that she was the onemaking things up.UK risks becoming ‘island of strangers’ without more immigration curbs, Starmer saysRead moreThough this month’s figures will show total migration falling fast since last summer, the politically explosive details are rising numbers of people arriving by boat and the 38,000 asylum seekers currently housed in hotels. Runcorn’s425-bed hotelfull of asylum seekers waiting without work has caused deep local resentment. Starmer’s message of “compassion and control” talks across a divide within his own party: some MPs have many large migrant constituencies, while others fear anti-migrant voters. Hismessage of integration, based on rewarding those who contribute most, will strike the right chord for some, but not others.This immigration reform should be an opening for new honesty about trade-offs and choices. Treat voters seriously. Don’t take fright at Reform, and confront these cynical manipulators and untruth tellers head-on. Just over half of voters want fewer migrants (I would have expected more), but it’s the priority issue for only 27% of those polled. Reform’s policies are impossible: on Monday, its deputy leader, Richard Tice, repeated manifesto pledges of “net zero migration” and promised to “freeze migration” (except doctors and nurses). Really?Labour should be looking its enemy in the eye and defying this utter nonsense. The old rightwing trick of casting anyone who challenges their impossibilism as the “metropolitan elite” has often paralysed politicians who fear being seen as out of touch. Debate over this policy should expose the Faragists for the snake-oil charlatans they are.Many people, particularly on the left, will accuse Labour of shoddy vote-chasing, and Starmer of resorting to nativist language, focusing on his warning about an “island of strangers”. Labour MP Nadia Whittome talked of “anti-migrant rhetoric” as being both “shameful and dangerous”. Zarah Sultana, elected in 2019 as Labour MP in Coventry South but since suspended, also weighed in quickly. “Did Nigel Farage write this speech?”she asked on Bluesky. Managing turbulence and blowback, keeping the Labour coalition on board while being seen to address wider concerns, will be the challenge now.Still, there is more depth to this policy than chasing populists. Yvette Cooper has long believed there’s nothing social democratic about loose borders letting in cheap labour to undercut stagnating British pay. If cheap labour was so good for growth, how come the economy has been flatlining while immigration rose? And exactly whose growth was is it good for in this most unequal country? These old arguments are now being subjected to a real-time experiment. Soon we will know, either way.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

UK pension funds have agreed to invest more of their assets in the UK, specifically in private markets, and specifically from their defined contribution (DC) schemes. Most of the big names are on the list of signatories to the expanded Mansion House accord: Aviva, Legal & General, Phoenix and more. And they’ve agreed to do their patriotic duty on a voluntary basis. “I welcome this bold step by some of our biggest pension funds,” said the chancellor,Rachel Reeves.There is another way to view the fanfare. There are so many conditions attached to the “pledge” to invest in the UK that this looks more like an exercise in virtue-signalling. It is not helped by the adventurous arithmetic behind the government’s claim that the accord will “unlock up to £50bn” for the economy by 2030.The first problem is the qualified nature of the pledge to invest 10% from default DC schemes into private assets (think infrastructure projects and unlisted companies) with half the slice going to UK assets. As the signatories emphasised, but the Treasury did not, the commitment is “subject to fiduciary duty and the consumer duty [a regulatory requirement to act in clients’ interests]” and “is dependent on implementation by the government and regulators of critical enablers”.Pension funds ‘to unlock up to £50bn’ of investment, with half for UK firmsRead moreSuggested translation: we will invest in your nuclear power stations, windfarms and Thames crossings, dear chancellor, as long as the risk/return profiles look juicy; just don’t expect our investment committees to sign off if we think we can do better elsewhere.That, of course, is exactly how a pension fund saver should expect the manager to behave. The first duty is to maximise returns for the benefit of the pensioners, rather than to wave a flag. The industry’s lobbying against the government’s flirtation with mandatory allocations seems to have worked.It is why one should take the Treasury’s “up to £50bn” figure – with £25bn for the UK – with a large helping of salt. It flows from an assumption that, not only will the loose investment promises be kept, but that the value of the assets covered by the pledge could rise from £252bn to £740bn by 2030. That’s one hell of a leap. One element in the calculation is an assumed growth rate of 17% per annum in the assets, which feels punchy, to put it mildly; the other is “further consolidation in the pensions market”, which may or may not happen.Declarations of good intentions are still worth something, of course. Even in fuzzy form, these commitments may encourage a few more fund managers to think about home bias. The playing field may tilt a little.But the big crisis in UK capital markets is surely in the public arena, rather than the private one. Consider the decline in the number of companies on the London Stock Exchange, the lack of new arrivals and the ease with which firms can be snaffled by foreign buyers. Possible remedies on that score are on the way, including merging local government pension schemes into big international-scale entities. That looks to be the properly bold policy challenge for the Treasury: talk about “mega funds” has been heard for decades without ever happening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the joy of this moment is about more than just jokesMon 12 May 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 12.33 EDTShareWhile most good Catholics spent the early days of this week in solemn contemplation, praying that the church’s new leader would be a person of character and someone who could unite us in these tense, ungodly times, the rest of us were on X cackling at our screens and repostingchimney memes.Social media has been having afield daysince Pope Francis passed and the race was on for a new pope. And now that Pope Leo XIV from Chicago has been selected, the jokes have been top-tier – references to the TV show The Bear, videos of the new popewalking outto music by the Chicago legend Chief Keef,Spike Leesomehow making this a win for the New York Knicks – I don’t remember the last time I had this much fun in the hellish digital town square formerly known as Twitter.An American has become pope. Will he be the moral leader we desperately need? | Arwa MahdawiRead morePope Crave, a parody Vatican stan account that started as a fan page for the 2024 film Conclave, has led the charge in keeping everyone updated with a mix of actual reporting and pitch-perfect humor. Now, at almost 100,000 followers, it has become a de facto source for all Vatican news. Pope Crave was the first to report that a new pope had been chosen (sharing the newsbeforethe actual Vatican), and even had a reporter on the ground in Rome to cover the whole thing.The meme-ification of the new pope is enjoyable on multiple levels, not least of which is the fact that it’s revived one of the last remaining good parts of internet culture: laughing together. Much of my time online these days is spent avoiding trolls, blocking bad-faith actors and trying to reset my algorithm so my feed isn’t just full of rightwing ads (or in Canada’s very specific case, weird fakehit piecesabout Howie Mandel?). Butthis. This is what social media was made for.The pope memes have picked up on all the best (and most ridiculous) things about this moment: the ritualistic selection process, Leo being the first American to hold the title, the fact that weliterallysaw this movie last year and the new pontiff’s Chicago roots. There’s also just the ridiculousness ofhavinga pope to begin with, and continuing to engage with this kind of decadent ritual while the world burns down around us. This week felt like the kind of nonsectarian, cross-cultural punching up that offers mild respite from our collective and constant disgust at the state of the world. At the same time, it’s an opportunity for real action – Pope Crave’sConclave Charity Zine, for instance, has raised more than $15,000 for charities such as the Intersex Human Rights Fund.The other great thing about this moment is the ways in which it signals our irreverence and disdain toward institutions like the church. The Catholic church remains one of the most powerful institutions in the world and papal supremacy is an ideal that almost transcends denominations at this point. But it’s also the same institution that has covered up systemic abuse within its ranks for decades, and still holds deeply problematic views on women and queer people.The arrival of a new pope has come at a time when people are interrogating the distribution of power in the world, when the formerly devout are questioning their faith (no matter what the American religious right would have you believe), and when there’s an urgent sentiment that the global establishment and its supporters (like the church) need to be transformed.Pope Leo XIV’s ascent is taking place at the cultural intersection of social media obsession, power and religion. But the way we’ve responded to it – the return to our collective ideals that moments like this inspire – gives some meaning to all the pomp and circumstance.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVOpinionSocial mediaThe papacyCatholicismReligionInternetChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

The only thing the government has to offer is that it’s the least worst optionMon 12 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 10.33 EDTShareIt is less than a year into thisLabourgovernment and we are already in another cycle of scare tactics. During the general election, any concerns expressed over Labour’s policies (or lack thereof) were quickly shut down by the pressing need to get a disastrous Tory government out.Now in power, concerns have been once again pushed aside. There is no time for the luxury of scrutiny of accountability, because nowReform is risingand the party must be stopped. Once again, the voter is asked to park their issues with Labour and save the nation from a worse alternative. “A vote for anyone but Labour risks more chaos under a Farage-Tory coalition,”posted the Labour partyon its X account in early May. “Vote Labour. Stop Reform.”This is hostage politics.When voters are asked constantly to make decisions not on the kind of government they want, but the one they don’t want, something is broken. The voter is held captive and presented with a series of escalating threats that only a vote for Labour can prevent. Reform’sbig gainsin the local elections, like a severed finger in a bloody envelope, are proof that no one is bluffing. Vote Labour, stop Reform.In the meantime, there can be no discussion of Labour’s record in office so far, its cutting ofdisability benefits, winter fuel allowance, preservation of the two-child limit, or its leadership’s excruciating failure to inspire or carve out a clear identity. You could argue that Reform has, in fact, been a gift to Labour, and you wouldn’t be wrong. According to reports, Labour insiders “see asilver lining in the rise of Reform”, because it means the government can terrorise Green voters on the doorstep and say “it’s fine if you want to vote Green, but you’ll have Nigel Farage in Downing Street”.With extortion as an organising principle of politics, what you definitely have whether Farage makes it into Downing Street or not is a system that cannot be defined as democracy. And it is not a phenomenon limited to Britain’s own particular microclimate. Centrist parties as a whole across the developed world are posting poor results. This is because they have few answers to the historic diminishment in prospects we are seeing across the world. Many people are unable to secure a life in which basic rights – housing, stable employment, a decent income – are guaranteed. Cost of living crises, weak economic growth,wage stagnation, decreasing upward mobility, and an inability to live the generally dignified lives their parents had, is hitting younger generations the hardest. An entire cohort of people is entering participatory democracy and realising that their future is cancelled.Fixing England’s water isn’t just the right thing to do – it can be the start of Labour’s fightback | Clive LewisRead moreThe result is a growing and logical loss of faith in the system.Polling showsthat among young adults in the west, satisfaction with democracy is “plummeting further and faster … than any other group”. The 2008 financial crash produced a system in whichwealth became so concentratedthat in the US, the result was the “largest spike in wealth inequality in postwar American history”.Elsewhere in Europe, austeritydeepened inequalityand shrank public services. Political and economic policies, from quantitative easing that favours the wealthy, to cuts to the public sector that by their nature affect the middle and working classes, were all decisions that chose to privilege one set of people and institutions over another. And today, parties like Labour are hellbent on maintaining the system those bequeathed those decisions, while demanding that voters stabilise it by stifling their frustrations and aspirations for a better life.There is contempt here. Labour’s escalatinganti-immigration rhetoricand its promotion of fiscal prudence, which is just austerity by another name, are the policies not of a party doing its best in difficult circumstances, but one making active ideological decisions. Instead of changes, say, to the tax system, and a commitment to thinking differently about an economic paradigm that has reached an undeniable dead end, Labour looks at the rising wave of populist politics, scratches its head, and decides to tell voters that the populism is the problem, not the world that created it. “Serious pragmatism defeats performative politics,” Keir Starmer drones. OK. But there comes a point at which you have to ask why “performative” politics, something which Starmer believes is the hallmark of the right and the left, is snapping at your heels less than a year into your tenure.The galling thing is that yes, of course, Reform and far-right parties are worse. But Labour is not only complicit, it is instrumental in ensuring that those forces are in play at all. It is all resonant of the pre-Arab spring warning to would-be revolutionaries – there will be chaos once the dictators are gone. The dictators went and the chaos did follow. But the reason for that wasn’t that wanting freedom and dignity is wrong. For too long economic mismanagement and political oppression were allowed to build up in the system, only held together by brute force of fear and inability to imagine or generate what could come after. The self-defined custodians of stability in fact make instability inevitable by not creating the conditions for the emergence of another viable alternative, and in fact, destroying it when it does threaten to emerge.But fear can only go so far. And constantly using fear only for things to stay the same, rather than for them to get better, is a dangerous strategy. It only proves that the government does indeed have nothing to offer. The bare-minimum management of an economic model that has long ceased to work for too many people, and in which voters feel they have no power, can only go in one direction – towards an unhinged right. Labour can threaten all it likes, but in doing so it may push voters in that direction.Sometimes – and you only need to look across the Atlantic for a chilling example of this – the potential possibilities in a chaos voters feel they have chosen are better than the stalemate they feel they have not. A hostage thatbegins to lose hope of ever being released sometimes takes a calculated risk and tackles its captor.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next three yearsExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Moves to decriminalise abortion, in response to thecontinued prosecution of women for having one, could unintentionally enable the restriction of access under a future regressive government. To prevent this and protect services, it is time to write into our statute that safe and legal access to abortion is a human right across our nation.It still shocks many people to realise that in 2025 abortion is not actually legal for most of the UK. Only in Northern Ireland do women have a right to an abortion. Everywhere else they are exempted from prosecution if it is determined they have met certain access conditions. This is not a quaint jurisprudence debate – it is driving the explosion in recent years of investigations and prosecutions of women and girls for having abortions in England. A vulnerable 15-year-old girl who didn’t know she was pregnant and had alate-term miscarriagefound a police constable at her hospital bed. Others have spent years under suspicion and investigation, andin some cases in jail.These cases, and the chilling effect they have on services, come at a time when the anti-abortion movement is turning its attention to our shores. Millions of pounds isflowing into campaigning and networking, pushing not for an explicit end to services but “safeguards” – all ruses to make getting a termination harder. Incendiary language abounds, as decriminalisation is claimed to mean “abortion at birth”. The US vice-president, JD Vance, hasopenly criticisedour buffer zones that protect women going to clinics from harassment as “anti free speech”. Ever the opportunist, Nigel Farage has argued parliament should debate a reduction in the time limit under which women can secure a termination. At the heart of this is a simple premise – women cannot be trusted to make decisions about their own bodies and should be policed accordingly.I recognise the appeal of simple solutions to stop the prosecutions – including using the upcoming policing bill to insert a clause removing women from the application of the 18th-century act that puts having an abortion on a par with assaulting a clergyman, bigamy and manslaughter. But in our toxic political environment this is to play Russian roulette with abortion access. It is a standard feature of any legislation that it gives the right to make secondary regulations to government about the topics in the bill – the Henry VIII powers that are the mainstay of executive overreach. Inserting the issue of abortion into any act of parliament without directing what happens next is like handing a future government a loaded gun to point at women’s rights – if passed, this would give powers to restrict or even end access to abortion with minimal democratic opportunity to intervene.The case of Nicola Packer tells us this: Britain is shamed by its abortion laws – and must change them | Jonathan LordRead moreThis risk doesn’t mean we shouldn’t act. The battle to provide abortion at all in Northern Ireland began in earnest once we passed a law requiring the secretary of state to deliver treatment as a human right. Resistance came not just from the Democratic Unionist party, but also from those charged with delivery, including the civil service and healthcare departments. The secretary of state had to intervene or face direct censure. That meant when those in positions of power used their role to prevent services from being set up, ministers knocked heads together and got things moving again. We can learn from this now in protecting existing services such as buffer zones and shape future provision too. It is time that women in Birmingham, Bristol and Barry had the same constitutionally protected right as women in Belfast to a safe medical treatment if they choose not to continue a pregnancy.This week we will lay an alternative amendment to the policing bill that doesn’t just repeal the antiquated criminal law and free women from the threat of prosecution. It also puts in place a plan for what happens next – an explicit human rights framework to ensure safe access and prevent the rolling back of abortion rights, whoever is in power.It would not alter the settled time limit for a termination, nor would it prevent prosecution of anyone who forces a woman to have an abortion. It would mean, for the first time in history, women here could point to their right to choose – and demand it is protected, as it is in France, Mexico, Colombia and Ireland. Any subsequent regulation affecting how abortions are provided, or equally importantly the work of those who offer them, would also have to uphold this human right too.Crucially in our febrile political climate, this amendment comes with a democratic lock to prevent the use of secondary legislative powers to change these rights. If a future government wanted to destroy abortion provision it would have to get the consent of the whole parliament – giving all citizens the ability to lobby their MP accordingly. Pandora’s box contained both chaos and hope – getting these proposals right could not only prevent further attacks on women’s rights, but also finally put abortion access here on the health and human rights footing it deserves.Stella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for WalthamstowExplore more on these topicsAbortionOpinionWomenHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

As the government’s lawyers take the floor to deliver their opening remarks – in a case that was brought by the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq and is supported by Human Rights Watch – thousands of children in Gaza will be starving. This is the result of an Israeli blockade on food, aid and medical supplies that defies the binding orders of the international court of justice.Thousands of mothers will be mourning the children they have lost in an assault on Gaza that is estimated to have cost the lives ofmore than 50,000 people, according to the Gaza ministry of health. Thousands of people will be homeless,forcibly displacedand living among the rubble of the towns and cities they no longer recognise.Israel is committing widespread and systematic violations of international law. This is plain to see. Organisations like my own have documented how the Israeli government iscommittingan array of atrocity crimes against Palestinians in Gaza,includingacts of genocide and the crime against humanity of extermination. An independentUN inquiryhas found the same.Under British and international law, arms licensing should be suspended if there is a “clear risk” that arms might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law. That threshold hasn’t just been crossed, it has been bulldozed.Last September, the governmentadmittedthe threshold has been crossed and halted about 30 export licences for military equipment that is used by the Israeli army in Gaza. But it left one critical loophole: F-35 fighter jet components that go into a globalF-35 supply programme,which isoverseenby the US, that Israel sources parts from.Fifteen per centof the F35 fighter jet – arguably the most lethal UK export used by Israeli forces in Gaza – is manufactured in the UK. It is reported that an F-35 was used in astrike on al-Mawasi, a designated safe zone, where Israeli forces dropped at least three 2,000lb bombs, apparently killing 90 people, including women and children.So if Keir Starmer, the prime minister, accepts that this critical legal threshold has been met, how can the government stand up in court and justify this breach of international law? Well, the government argues that the obligation to avoid selling arms that will be used in potential war crimes does not apply in this context because the F-35 programme iscrucial to ensuringglobal “peace and security”. What this means in practice is still unclear, but one component of delivering global peace and security, exposed during the last court hearing, appears to be that the UK doesn’t want a foreign policy at odds with the United States. According to documents submitted in evidence, upholding its obligations “would undermine US confidence in the UK and Nato at a critical juncture in our collective history and set back relations”.UK’s F-35 exports more important than stopping genocide, lawyers to argueRead moreThis argument is highly dangerous. It would allow states to flout their international obligations simply in order to appease an ally; and it risks running a coach and horses through the international arms control framework, including the UN arms trade treaty (ATT), which the UK ratified in 2014. It will have far-reaching consequences for the lives of people in Gaza and risks the conflict there becoming a blueprint for other armed conflicts, where international law is treated as optional and relationships with a powerful ally considered paramount. This is dangerous in any context but withDonald Trumpat the helm in the White House, it borders on the grotesquely absurd.Trump has aggressively attacked vital organs of justice and order such as the international criminal court (ICC) and the UN, often in defence of Israel, including byauthorising a sanctions programmethat targets the critical work of the ICC,withdrawing the USfrom the UN’s human rights council, and proposing to slash funding to the numerous UN programmes and institutions. His administration hassanctionedthe mass deportation and imprisonment of immigrants without respect for their due process rights.In the context of current hostilities in Gaza, Trump has further entrenched and hardenedJoe Biden’s approach, deepeningUS complicityin Israeli atrocities. Trump hassupportedthe ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, supported the campaign to liquidate the UN relief works agency for Palestine refugees in the near east (Unrwa), the main UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees. He hasencouragedIsrael to break the ceasefire,reverseda halt on the supply to Israel of the devastating 2,000lb bombs,lifted sanctionson violent actors in the West Bank, andthreatensforeign nationals who criticise Israel in the US with deportation. It is unsurprising that repression of Palestinians, settler violence and land seizures in the occupied West Bank have spiked since he took office.It is time for the UK to re-evaluate the so-called “special relationship” with the US and take a stand. Abandoning its legal defence of licensing F-35 fighter jet components to the global programme is the legal and moral thing to do, it is the humane thing to do, and it is also the popular thing to do, with polling showing that amajority of Britonssupport a suspension of arms exports to Israel. At a time of incredible uncertainty and geopolitical upheaval, Britain needs to stand up for and be committed to international law – even if it upsets Donald Trump.Yasmine Ahmed is UK director of Human Rights WatchDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Laws are required to establish the terms under which migration to the UK is allowed, and to deal with the complexities surrounding irregular arrivals. But the decision to publish animmigration white papera week after Reform UK made significant gains in local elections, when it is riding high in national polls, is hard to defend. Rather than defusing public concerns, the prime minister risks playing into the hard right’s hands – andundermining the community cohesionhe says he wants to protect.Some of the proposed measures are reasonable. Others are not. Visa rules are complicated and ministers have identified real concerns about the way the system works. But the timing and language, particularly the prime minister’s references to an “island of strangers” and forces“pulling our country apart”, were awful choices. The danger is that such rhetoric ends upreinforcing divisions and xenophobia.Sir Keir’s target is the opposition’s record. He is right that the policies of the Conservatives were a cynical disgrace. Legal migration rose from 224,000 in 2019 to 906,000 in 2023. Voters who were entitled to think they had opted for reduced inward migration, both in the Brexit referendum and by electing a prime minister, Boris Johnson, who vowed to “take back control” of borders, instead got a free-market experiment. While the Tories used their inhumaneRwanda schemeas a distraction, employers ramped up overseas recruitment as skill thresholds were lowered.In manufacturing, transport and engineering, the subsequent increase in foreign employees is correlated with adecline in the UK workforceand apprenticeships. The failure of this laissez-faire approach to the economy has not been limited to jobs. Living standards have stagnated, with lower rates of growth than in the eurozone and US. The government is right that employers should invest in people here, as well as scouting in other countries. If it is well run, the newLabour Market Evidence Groupcould play a positive role in a more industrially activist government. It is good to signal a looser approach to refugees working, and reasonable to expect migrant workers’ dependants to learn English. Councils should support this.However, thewhite paper, in both tone and substance, is distinctly illiberal. It uses the language of “fairness”, “integration” and “public confidence”. But its core proposals represent a consolidation of executive power, a curtailment of individual rights and a weakening of judicial independence. These are not reforms – they are regressions.The pledge to deport more foreign criminals smacks of tabloid politics. Granting counter-terrorism-style powers to the Border Force risks stoking, not easing, fear. Cancelling social care visas on the grounds of “abuse” threatens a sector already on thebrink. Raising salary thresholds for those with dependants penalises lower-paid workers. And while it is right to review student visas, the real issue is the crisis inunderfundingof higher education – not the students themselves.Sir Keir’s anger about the Tories’ track record is justified. It harms democracy, and helps opportunists likeNigel Farage, when parties tell voters one thing while doing another. But past mistakes do not justify present ones. Migrants have been and will remain a vital part of the UK’s labour force and student bodies. The government and its MPs must highlight these positives clearly and loudly.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last week’sUK-IndiaandUS-UKagreements reveal a curious asymmetry: in both, the larger partner, in terms of GDP, leveraged the relationship for political ends, while the UK supplied what matters – regulatory prestige and high-income consumers. The former deal offers India a chance to climb the “value chain” and access markets it cannot replicate at home. Donald Trump used his pact to stage aspectacleof grievance and control.Ironically, Britain – the smaller economy – behaves like the grown-up in both rooms. India turns the agreement intogenuine gains. The UK’s trade concessions offer a glimpse of Delhi’s broader ambition: to pry openrich-worldmarkets and access critical tech, as India positions itself as the west’s manufacturing alternative to China. By contrast, Mr Trump’s America focuses onimage over impact. But Washington has tacitly conceded that the real action – on AI, digital servicestaxand UKpharmatariffs still in place under thedeal– has yet to begin. The pact falls well short of the sweeping agreement Britain once sought with the US, and lacks the depth of the UK-India deal.The UK, once the imperial core, is now too small to be intimidating but too useful to discard. It is flattered and exploited not for its size, but for its ability to confer market credibility and post-Brexit validation. But it is on Europe that the spotlight is about to fall. Sir Keir Starmer knows closer ties are in the economic interests of the country, even if local elections remind him thatBrexitwounds still fester. He should do the right thing – and seek abetter dealwhen he meets the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, next week in London. The EU’sshareof total UK trade is 20 times that of India.The UK’s post-Brexit “reset” with the EU is taking shape not through grand gestures but through a cautious choreography of selective re-engagement. Sir Keir is quietly rebuilding institutional ties – especiallydefence– while studiously avoiding the language of reversal. His promise of an “ambitious” closer trade partnership sounds reassuring, but offers little beyond aspiration. There are limits to such low-key rapprochement: a proposedyouth mobility schemehas run aground on the rocks of political symbolism. Ironically, in seeking to stabilise relations without unsettling a domestic narrative, he’s inching towards alignment while insisting he’s doing nothing of the sort. It is pragmatic but painfully performative.The UK should approach its trading relationship with the EU as a responsible nation, respecting shared rules without demanding the perks of membership. Sir Keir is doing that – a victory given past Brexitdelusions. Britain need not rejoin the single market – freedom of movement remains politically unviable – but it can pursue adeeper customs partnershipthat reduces trade frictions and anchors regulatory cooperation without breaking Labour’s manifesto pledges.In a sane world, fixing theNorthern Ireland post-Brexit messwould be part of the plan: closer alignment on customs and standards with the EU would ease internal UK trade, reduce friction and help safeguard peace. A bespoke customs arrangement, coupled with deals in the energy, science and services sectors, would allow Britain to contribute toEuropean growthwhile advancing its own strategic interests. This is not submission but mature interdependence. That is a role Britain is well suited to play in a multipolar, crisis-prone world.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The nondescript, windowless TV interview room below the Allianz Arena could not be more of a contrast to the giddy, beer-soaked, firework-lit riot of celebration going on outside as Bayern Munich savoura 34th league title. There’s also something different about Kane,and it’s not just the gold medal.The Kane visage that usually accompanies him at the end of a cup final, that little-boy-lost look of overwhelming disappointment, is gone. You cannot help but notice the broad grin, the relaxed body language and the tactile ease in the greeting, a man intoxicated by euphoria. “It’s been a long night,” he says, beaming. “And it’s just the beginning.”Xabi Alonso basks in hero’s sendoff but Dortmund ruin Leverkusen party | Andy BrassellRead moreThomas Müller, who has been playinghis last home game after 25 years at Bayern, is hosting a late-night soiree in one of Munich’s more fashionable bars to which Kane is invited. First, though, he will be rejoining his wife, Katie, and three of his four children, who have just been celebrating with him on the pitch following Bayern’s 2-0 win against Borussia Mönchengladbach, alongside Tim Sherwood, the coach who gave him his chance at Tottenham, and John McDermott, now the Football Association technical director but previously Tottenham’s head of academy. Both have flown in for the evening. It is typical Kane wants to share this moment with fellow travellers on what has been a very long journey.There is no player in the modern age who has been as good as Kane and won nothing. Of course there have been extraordinary individual goalscoring awards, World Cup and Premier League golden boots, and the BundesligaTorjägerkanone, the German equivalent. Yet never a club trophy. “So many jokes, so many sneers” is a lyric that could have been written for Kane, as well as the England team, given the Euro, Champions League and League Cup finals where he has had to stand manfully applauding the victors while staring glumly at another losers’ medal.Kane’s 71 goals and counting for England won’t be beaten any time soon; he took Jimmy Greaves’s record at Tottenham; yet the role of gallant loser seemed to be the one life’s casting director had assigned to him. His Jonah status can’t have improved when he turned up at pretty much the most successful club in Europe last season and Bayern had their first campaign in 12 years without a trophy. “It’s nice to be on the other side to be honest, to have that celebration I’ve not had before,” he says. “I’ve seen my fair share of other teams lifting trophies.”In the hour preceding this interview, Kane has been making good on his celebration deficit, gallivanting up and down the Allianz Arena like an excited schoolboy, chasing his teammate Eric Dier in an attempt to douse him with a huge three-litre glass of beer. His compatriot showed an impressive turn of pace to escape, though Kane himself was cornered by Leon Goretzka and showered in Bavarian brew, a traditional celebration in these parts. This was what he came to Germany for.View image in fullscreenKane gets a beer shower at the Allianz Arena.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/AP“It doesn’t change me as a player,” Kane reflects. “I’m no different to what I was before I had won. It was something that was missing from my résumé. Maybe once you’ve won your first one there’s a little less to talk about and throw my way, but again it comes with it.”He’s reminded of Rory McIlroy’s quip that journalists would have nothing to talk about after he ended his 11-year major droughtat the Masters last month. “In a way, [it’s] a little bit [like that],” Kane acknowledges. “That was one of the best tournaments I ever watched and my emotions were through the roof because I’m good friends with Justin Rose. But part of me wanted Rory to win and you saw the emotions that he went through. I can’t imagine what they were going through.”Except, of course, he absolutely can. “It is a weight on the shoulders. I’m very aware of the fact that I hadn’t won it. I put myself under more pressure than anyone else. As the years go by you start to think: ‘Is it going to happen?’ You keep going, you keep pushing yourself and good things come and this is definitely one of those. And we’ll see what people talk about now. I’m sure they’ll find something and I’ll take it in my stride.”Kane, Dier and their teammates had watched on TV the previous weekend as their rivals Bayer Leverkusen drew a match thatconfirmed Bayern as champions. It wasn’t long before the watchalong descended into tuneless renditions of We Are the Champions and more Bavarian beer-swilling. “Once it was official, a switch just went off and me and Eric especially started getting the champagne going, the songs going and everyone else just turned up,” Kane says. “That was a special night when everyone completely let free.”On Saturday in Munich they could celebrate in front of their own fans and receive the trophy. It seemed fitting that once the team captains, Manuel Neuer and Müller, had lifted theMeisterschale, the player to whom they presented it first was Kane. He had waited long enough. This is why two years ago he had wrenched himself away from Spurs, who themselves have become a byword for underachievement.“It was a big decision,” Kane says. “I could have easily stayed at Spurs, played in the Premier League and carried on scoring goals, but I wanted to push myself. I wanted to see how good I could be and play in the biggest games, the biggest title run-ins and Champions League games. I’ve done that. Though we’ve not been successful in the other competitions we’ve played in big games and big nights. And I think that tonight is just the start of something special.”View image in fullscreenKane celebrates with Vincent Kompany, the Bayern manager.Photograph: Marco Steinbrenner/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockThat he could share this night with his family and children (other than the youngest, Henry, 21 months old and safely home asleep) made it extraordinary. Louis, aged four, had joined him in front of Munich’s most passionate fans on theSüdkurveand, encouraged by dad, shot a penalty into an empty net. Only a curmudgeon, or an Arsenal fan, could fail to be moved, though the ensuing roar of celebration was an unforeseen problem. “He was scared of the celebrations. He’s going to have to work on that,” Kane says with a laugh. “Those are the memories that last a lifetime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His is not the gilded path of the teen prodigy. At 19 he was loaned to Norwich for five months, played five times, scored zero goals, had one assist and is principally remembered for a terrible miss on his debut. He was relegated to the under-21 team where they wouldn’t let him take a penalty they had been awarded.An equally unsuccessful loan at Leicester followed, where he famously sat on the bench with Jamie Vardy. He would stay out after training with a bag of balls, honing his finishing while some teammates scoffed at his assiduousness. The experience still animates him. “I think back to Norwich and Leicester. I wasn’t playing but doing extra training and finishing and had some players laughing and saying: ‘I don’t know why you’re doing that!’ All those little moments made me who I am. It’s the stuff you do behind the scenes, that no one sees, that really makes a difference.”At that time he came across The Brady Six documentary about the legendary quarterback Tom Brady. The six referred to the sixth round of the NFL draft to which Brady was assigned, the rank of an ­also-ran foot soldier. “It definitely helped me because I saw a lot of similarities between me and him,” Kane says. “No one expected him to do what he went on to do. I think mine is a story that people can relate to, of hard work and never giving up.”Bayern Munich v Leverkusen has been a great rivalry. But is it over? | Andy BrassellRead moreThat is why Kane wants to promote Mental Health Awareness Week, which is also the goal of theHarry KaneFoundation. “There’s a lot of causes that need help and a lot of situations that I could have used my platform for but I just think that mental health is something I had a little bit of understanding with,” Kane explains. “There wasn’t just a straight line to the top [for me]. I had to really go through some tough times. Of course, not tough in terms of life threatening, but I felt like I had a connection especially for the younger generation. I’ve been on this journey. I’m learning more and more [about mental health] and for sure it’s something that I’ll really try to take on and help as much as I can when my career has finished.”He is sympathetic towards gen Z, raised amid Covid and the rise of smartphones. “It is tough,” he says. “Sometimes you can be carried away or get taken away from yourself, especially nowadays with social media.” Kane’s principal advice, though, is fairly obvious given his life story: “Never give up. Take the ups with downs. In sport, in life, [it] isn’t perfect. You’re going to have moments where things don’t go your way and you have to find it within yourself to get through that.“I’ve been lucky enough to have great family, a great wife, great friends around me. I’m learning more and more that mental health is about talking to people, whether family members, friends, people in a coffee shop. It’s good to talk. When you go through life you have to expect some great moments and some tough moments but always carry on. That’s the message I would say to anyone. Always carry on. Don’t give up.” It is a personal pep talk as well as sound advice.Now Kane has won a trophy, it is not as though social-media sceptics will melt away. “In football, it’s always going to be: ‘OK, you’ve won this, but you haven’t won that,’” Kane says. “Until you’ve won it all – and there’s not many people who have won it all – you have to keep going.” Whatever happens now, he will always have a beer-soaked night in Munich to remember.Explore more on these topicsHarry KaneBayern MunichinterviewsShareReuse this content"

There is no division or dissent on that score.Arsenal’s visit to Anfield should also have been one long celebration, as well as an opportunity to demonstrate the gulf between the Premier League’s first and second-placed teams this season. The first half played out exactly that way. Arsenal may have produced a reaction that increased Mikel Arteta’s anger before Alexander‑Arnold’s introduction – “I hate reaction, I like action” – but the party was over as soon as the Real Madrid‑bound defender replaced Conor Bradley in the 67th minute.Football Daily | Trent Alexander-Arnold and the Anfield jeers of fans who feel jiltedRead moreThe boos that greeted the announcement of Alexander‑Arnold’s name before kick‑off and his entry on to the pitch were a bigger surprise for their intensity and mass than the fact they were voiced at all. Anfield cannot be praised for its passion and noise on a European night then castigated for adopting an entrenched and emotive position when one of its own decides toleave the club on a free. Equally, the boos that subsequently accompanied almost every touch of the ball from the feetthat brought youthatcorner, those record Premier League assists by a defender and countless moments of breathtaking ingenuity, were grim and self-defeating. Arsenal equalised seconds after the right‑back was jeered playing a pass, his teammates appearing momentarily stunned by the sound. At least the title wasn’t on the line.In some respects the timing of Alexander-Arnold’sannouncement that he was leaving Liverpoolwith three games of a triumphant season remaining did everyone a favour apart from himself. It has given those infuriated by his desire for a fresh challenge, with Real Madrid almost certainly his next destination, plus the manner of his departure, a chance to vent their spleen before Crystal Palace arrive at Anfield on the final day. Better to condemn in the penultimate home game than overshadow a trophy presentation in which Alexander‑Arnold will deservedly play a part. Van Dijk said: “We want to win two more games and after the final whistle, including him, lift the trophy up and celebrate like we have never done before.”It will give Arne Slot food for thought the next time Bradley’s energy levels drop and he looks to the bench for a replacement. The head coach justified the substitution on Sunday on the basis thathe was hired to win gamesand that the world-class full-back almost helped him to achieve another. However, Slot has exceeded what he was hired to do in his first season at Liverpool. He can afford to take the easy way out against Brighton next Monday and Palace. Overlooking Alexander‑Arnold in the final two games would generate fresh headlines, of course, but they would be more palatable than what unfolded on Sunday.That, in turn, will allow the rest of theLiverpoolsquad to enjoy the finale their efforts this season merit. There was dismay among Liverpool’s players at the treatment meted out to their colleague against Arsenal. Curtis Jones and Cody Gakpo made a point of standing up in the dugout and applauding his free-kick following Mikel Merino’s dismissal.Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, both of whom could have been in Alexander-Arnold’s position on Sunday had they notsigned fresh deals a few weeks ago, showed their appreciation of the defender when he entered the fray. A disbelieving Dominik Szoboszlai gestured towards the Kop when Alexander‑Arnold’s applause for the fans was met with more boos after the final whistle. It is ridiculous that a season of unexpected glory should contain an element of rancour as it nears the conclusion.View image in fullscreenEvery touch Trent Alexander-Arnold made after coming on as a substitute was met with loud boos on Sunday.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“Everyone has different opinions or different phases of their career so you can’t compare our situation – me and Mo in this case – with Trent,” Van Dijk said. “I was very happy to eventually come to an agreement with the club. Obviously it’s not really a Liverpool thing to go about it the way we did with me and Mo but, like I said when it was announced, I’m happy and proud to extend because for me there is no other place to be at this point.“Everyone shares different opinions and he feels like he has done it all – and he did it – and he wants to try something different. You are speaking about one of the biggest clubs of all in Real Madrid, who he might go to as I read in the media. The decision is made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the final whistle is there we will miss him after that but we still have two more games, the trophy lift and a parade so there are plenty of moments we can share together.”Almost every player on the pitch on Sunday has, at some point, disappointed a fanbase by moving on. The professionalism that has shaped Alexander-Arnold’s decision was evident in Van Dijk’s response when asked whether he had tried to convince the homegrown talent to stay. “What do you think I was doing?” he replied.“I was sorting my own stuff out, I had to secure my future as well and I was quite busy doing that. As club captain I was trying to secure my future. I’m not the youngest any more and I have a family to provide for and I don’t want to be left in the dark. There were loads of other options but Liverpool is the place for me.”Liverpool is no longer the place that a unique talent from West Derby wants to be after 20 years at his boyhood club, having won every trophy available to him and with designs on experiencing a new life. Good luck to him, although Alexander‑Arnold must have known there would be torment as well as another trophy on his way out.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

Sheffield United ultimately made light work of the challenge here though, with back-to-back 3-0 wins to end Bristol City’s impressive season and move to within one win of an instant return to the Premier League with Wilder at the helm.There has never been a greater points gap between the teams finishing third and sixth inChampionshiphistory than the 22 that separated these two teams. In truth, that gulf was evidenced even further here – with the biggest winning margin in playoff history a fair reflection of how good Sheffield United have been this season.Goals from Kieffer Moore, Gus Hamer and substitute Callum O’Hare ensured a six-goal winning margin over the two legs, meant the nerves were ultimately minimal on the night and that only Sunderland or Coventry stand between the Blades and the promised land once again. For a side who were embroiled in financial chaos in the summer, Wilder deserves credit for the job he has done.“You’ve got to enjoy nights like these,” he said. “It’s been a challenging season and to have a night like this in front of our fans will give them a boost that they deserve. To get through that first 25 minutes was key and then we found a bit of rhythm. We can sit back and watch tomorrow night and enjoy it.”View image in fullscreenGustavo Hamer (centre right) celebrates after making it 2-0 to Sheffield United on the night.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesThis city was host to the greatest comeback in playoff history two years ago when Sheffield Wednesdayoverturned a four-goal deficitto defeat Peterborough on the way to promotion back to the Championship. In truth, despite a game effort from the Robins, there was not really a chance of anything like a repeat here under the lights at Bramall Lane.“I’m really proud of the players,” Liam Manning, the Bristol City manager, said. “You can come here and sit off but we tried to play like us. We had a go.”He deserves immense praise for taking Bristol City to the playoffs, and his side did not go down without a fight here. They had the better of the early chances and had they claimed an early goal, the nerves may have ramped up a shade or two.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

United grew in authority and when a smart corner led to Moore heading home, the nerves evaporated inside Bramall Lane. There was no complacency from the Blades, and they finished the job emphatically after half-time with not only two more goals, but a controlled and measured display that reflected how well they have performed this season.Another set-piece led to Hamer doubling the lead on the night with a well-worked finish and a big ­deflection, a moment which allowed Wilder the opportunity to rest some of his big guns, Moore and Hamer included, with Wembley in mind. Those substitutes also made an impact, with one of them, O’Hare, adding a third in the 83rd minute to nudge Wilder about his chances of a start in the final.Incredibly, the Blades have not won at Wembley for 100 years: the 1925 FA Cup final. Few know more than Wilder what it would mean for that wait to come to an end next Saturday. These two semi-final performances hint that moment could finally be about to arrive.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedBristol Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

At the end of another wild, joyous and exhausting afternoon, anotherclásicowon their way, the captain called them all into the middle of Montjuïc. And whereRaphael Dias Bellolicalls, his teammates follow, all the way to the title. Which was why, an arm raised, a wrist wrapped in a blue bandage lifted above the crowd like a symbol of strength, the Brazilian who has been better than anyone anywhere, now gathered them round and led them into a lap of honour together. It was time to give thanks; time to get thanks, too.They had earned it. Real Madrid, who were supposed to be invincible, had been beaten again. Sunday was the fourth time time this season, a record unmatched in 125 years: four victories in as many cities, Barcelona scoring four goals to go with thethree,fiveandfourin the previous clásicos, a circle closed. The first was the statement that started it all, adeclaration of intentat the Bernabéu; the second won the Super Cup in Saudi Arabia; the third brought the Copa del Rey back from Seville; now they had virtually secured the league,a 4-3 wintaking them seven points clear with nine left, double almost done.Carlo Ancelotti confirmed as first foreign manager of Brazil men’s team in a centuryRead moreOff they went, clapping and waving and bouncing about because whoever didn’t was aMadridista, the words say. In the directors’ box, Travis Scott was stargazing. Below him, where a fan had offered Vinícius Júniora beach ball to play with, they were flying flags and singing. Almost all the 50,319 people in the Olympic Stadium were in no hurry to head home, happy to take it all in, and the hundred or so behind the glass cage high in the away end were given no choice but to stay for a while and wonder what might have been. No one had expected to be herewhen it all beganin August, not like this.Some didn’t imagine being here at all. Back then, the goalkeeper who had just won the double wasn’t even a goalkeeper any more. Wojciech Szczesny was beginning retirement in Marbella, sitting on the beach with a cigarette. When they called, he was playing golf with his son; now, they were playing again, only this was football on the Montjuïc pitch, the families who had been through it too invited to join in. Raphinha didn’t think he would be here either, let alone leading them to the league. And yet here he was, scorer of two more on the day they had done it, holding another player-of-the-match award – even if he insisted Barça still needed a win and he would have given it to someone else.View image in fullscreenFermin Lopez of Barcelona celebrates with Alejandro Balde during the win over Real Madrid.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesActually,and yet? Maybe that should readbecause? Maybe it isbecauseRaphinha thought he might not be here at all,becausesome people really didn’t want him to be and others really,reallydid, that he did so much to ensure that they were. “Not even in my wildest dreams did I imagine living these moments,” he said, but maybe it is the possibility of leaving that turned him into such a leader. In part, perhaps, it was the combination of rejection and affection that fuelled him; maybe that is what made him Spain’s best player this season.Nowbestis another word you might want to put a question mark next to. No one has played like Pedri, and probably no onecanplay like Pedri. Robert Lewandowski is their top scorer, a goal a game at 36. Lamine Yamal is ludicrous,you know that. You may want to talk about Iñigo Martínez and Jules Koundé, and you would be right to. And Szczesny is the story of this or any season. Besides, this is a collective success,at the hand of Hansi Flick. Yet Flick says Raphinha is “a clear example of how this team works”, racing into every battle, relentlessly taking them all with him, and there is no one who has done what he has: a double winner with 34 goals and 25 assists, when it’s not even about the stats. “I have never had a player like him,” the coach says.Raphinha had never been a player like this, either. Flick believed in him when others had not, when even he wasn’t entirely sure any more. The day Flick was announced as coach, he called the Brazilian and told him he was counting on him. Barcelona werevery publicly pursuing Nico Williams, trying torecreate the partnership and friendshipwith Lamine Yamal that hadbeen so good for Spain, and doing so meant Raphinha not only vacating his place on the wing but also accepting a transfer that would generate the money they needed to force Athletic to sell.View image in fullscreenFerran Torres celebrates after Raphinha’s third goal for Barcelona.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersA picture soon circulated of Williams in aBarcelonashirt with a No 11 on the back, Raphinha’s No 11. And if that was only a photoshop, posted by an influencer, if it shouldn’t have mattered, it did – Raphinha admitted it hurt and called it a “lack of respect.” He knew that dream was not just coming from outside, some in the boardroom looking at him and seeing dollar signs. He knew too that his previous coach didn’t have faith in him either, or at least that is how it felt. It wasn’t just his imagination, either. In 60 games under Xavi, Raphinha played 90 minutes only seven times: twice in the first season, five times in the second.“The call from Flick was very important in my decision to stay,” Raphinha said, an invitation to resist the pressure, to not allow anyone to push him towards the door. There was something striking about the fact that his retelling of that story included the observation that Flick had put his mind at rest “without even knowing me or seeing me in person”. And then when he did, the promise was fulfilled. This season, he has played the full 90 in 22 of his 29 league starts and has been on the pitch every minute of the last eight Champions League games, playing 11 in full across the competition.That’s a product of performance of course but it can be self-creating and self-perpetuating. “Now, I have no fear, I’m not under pressure, needing to do something well [to stay on],” he admitted, and there was also a tactical variation: the change of wing, Lamine Yamal playing right, Raphinha playing left with Alex Balde flying up behind him, suited him more than he could have imagined. A more direct approach, the space into which to run, worked too.The results have been extraordinary, a relentlessness to him all over the pitch. He scored 13 goals and provided nine assists in the Champions League, directly involved in more goals than anyone else, ever. In the league, only Alex Baena has created more chances and only Lamine has more assists. There have been 18 goals and 11 assists inLa Liga, including the two assists and a goal at 3-1 down to beat Celta 4-3 and the goal that levelled against Valladolid, allowing them to come into the clásico knowing that a win would end it. He it was who scored the late goal thatshouldhave taken them into a European Cup final four days earlier. And then this Sunday, he scored the third and fourth, completing the comeback against Madrid that virtually clinched the title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet it is not just the numbers and not just the manager. In the summer, Barcelona’s players voted on the new club captains. “I never imagined they would choose me,” he admitted, but they saw something special in him and the unexpectedness of that vote, the way it came as a very tangible expression of trust, served to increase his commitment, to deepen the collective responsibility he already felt. There was warmth, even gratitude. There were also now people to prove wrong and people – more important people – to prove right.View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti will become Raphinha’s head coach when he takes the Brazil job later this month.Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters“After reading that you’re going, that the club doesn’t have faith in you, after hearing the press speak ill of you, I never imagined being one of the captains,” he said. “A captain has to fight for the club, the badge, his teammates. I’ve always tried to make sure everyone felt part of the group. It’s not just about wearing the armband. I started this season with a different mentality. It’s a tactical and mental issue. The faith the coach and the players have in me is very important.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowReal Betis 1-1 Osasuna, Athletic Bilbao 1-0 Alavés, Barcelona 4-3 Real Madrid, Leganés 3-2 Espanyol, Atlético 4-0 Real Sociedad, Girona 0-1 Villarreal, Mallorca 2-1 Valladolid, Celta Vigo 3-2 Sevilla, Valencia 3-0 Getafe, Las Palmas 0-1 Ray Vallecano.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The faith he has in them too, the willingness to lead, do anything for them: to embody this team, its identity and its people. When Raphinha admitted that he felt for Dani Olmo when his registration wason hold because of the club’s financial difficulties, that he could understand players thinking twice about coming, it might have seemed like the kind of thing a captain shouldn’t say but it was in fact exactly the kind of thing a captainshouldsay, not just some naive, anodyne public platitude. Instead, there was empathy, awareness, support. And redemption: for all the doubts he had stayed, and now look. He knows football can be shit inside; he also knows that, despite that, it can still be brilliant out there and appreciate it all the more for the dark times. That in the end, there’s nothing better than being here for something like this, calling his teammates over to celebrate something extraordinary earned together.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona3559822Real Madrid3535753Atletico Madrid3533704Athletic Bilbao3525645Villarreal3514616Real Betis3510587Celta Vigo351498Rayo Vallecano35-5479Mallorca35-74710Osasuna35-84511Valencia35-84512Real Sociedad35-94313Getafe35-33914Espanyol35-93915Girona35-123816Sevilla35-103817Alaves35-123518Leganes35-183419Las Palmas35-173220Valladolid35-5916Explore more on these topicsLa LigaBarcelonaReal MadridEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This was reinforced on a windy Monday afternoon as ­Raducanu was outclassed by a supreme display from the fourth seed Coco Gauff. Fresh off her run to theMadrid Open final, Gauff played another brilliant match in a contest between two former US Open champions to reach the quarter-finals in Rome with an emphatic 6-1, 6-2 win.Jannik Sinner returns with a win to leave rocking Rome celebrating againRead more“I found it really hard today,” ­Raducanu said. “I think the conditions were so different. It was really windy and so high bouncing, and I just found like every ball was out of my strike zone, so I couldn’t really get a good hit. And then it just kept getting higher and higher. And it was really hard. And Coco played a great match too, and found great shape, great width, great depth. I felt outplayed today, but it was good to kind of see where I’m at in these conditions.”After starting the season with some of thebest tennis of her career at the United Cupin ­January, Gauff’s first few months of the year were disappointing, with early defeats by ­players ranked outside the top 50. But the 21‑year‑old’s fortunes have ­rapidly turned on clay, which ­generally gives her more time to set up her forehand and impose its heavy topspin while ampli­fying her defensive skills.So far in her career, Gauff’s biggest titles have come on hard courts, but she is equally ­dangerous on clay. As she carefully pushed ­Raducanu back and moved her around the court, Gauff used her forehand to overwhelm her opponent, spinning the ball high out of the Briton’s strike zone. Alongside her superior weight of shot and immaculate depth, Gauff’s defence made it so difficult to hit through her.View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff’s relentless depth and weight of shot pinned her opponent back.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP“You feel like there’s no space on the court,” Raducanu said. “You don’t really know where to hit, especially when she’s playing like that. I think both sides held up really well. I think her serve held up really well. So, yeah, it was a good testament to her. She’s two [No 2 in the live rankings] in the world for a reason, and I definitely felt that. And so that’s it.”This is not the first time ­Raducanu’s game has looked underpowered against the elite. Although the 22-year-old times the ball sweetly and is a solid athlete, she was outmatched in both departments by Gauff, as was the case duringher defeat against Iga Swiatek in Australia. The challenge for Raducanu is to continue adding layers to her game to more effectively disrupt a player of Gauff’s calibre. She also has to learn how to perform better in windy conditions, which has been a consistent issue.Raducanu took an optimistic view on the defeat, stressing the importance of learning from it. “For me to see the ball today that I was receiving was really valuable. I haven’t really played these top opponents very often, because I haven’t been in the tournament for long enough, so for me to be kind of playing them now is good exposure.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She played quality tennis, blending her ­attacking instincts with greater variety and she now sits at No 42 in the live rankings, two places behind the British No 1 Katie Boulter. Raducanu should head into the French Open full of confidence.“I take good confidence [from this].

Three sources have told the Guardian that Gupta is favourite to succeed the Australian, moving across from the broadcast company that holds the ICC’s $3bn (£2.2bn) rights deal for global events.India’s Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket: ‘I’ve given everything I had’Read moreIf so, Gupta would become the first major appointment at the ICC since Jay Shah, the former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket inIndia, was made chair of the global ­governing body last December. Both men have worked closely together in the past, with Jiostar also the domestic broadcaster of the Indian Premier League.The next chief executive of the ICC faces significant challenges, not least ongoing negotiations over the fee that Jiostar (formerly Disney Star) agreed to pay for global events. Should India and Pakistan stop playing each other at these, something that was floated in response to recent cross-border hostilities, the deal’s value would be affected further.Then there is an overhaul of the World Test Championship. The ­existing structure is to remain in place for the 2025-27 cycle but there is a growing push to recalibrate the competition in time for the start of the next future tours programme.More broadly, on top of ­expanding international women’s cricket and overseeing the sport’s Olympic return in 2028, there is the task of navigating the international men’s game through a calendar increasingly swamped by franchise leagues. The IPL, for example, is looking to move from 74 games per year to 94 per year from 2028.Notably, Gupta was among those spoken to by the World Cricketers’ Association (the global umbrella group of player unions) when producing a recent report that called for dedicated windows for international cricket. Tom Harrison, the former chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, was another to be spoken to and has been linked to the ICC vacancy previously. The ICC has declined to comment.The IPL, meanwhile, is to resume on Saturday, with the 17 ­remaining games to be held across six ­venues. The T20 tournament – comfortably the richest event in cricket – was ­suspended last week amid the military ­hostilities between India and Pakistan.It remains to be seen how many overseas players, including the 10 English players contracted to franchises, will be tempted back having left the region as tensions between the nuclear powers escalated.The matches are scheduled for Bengaluru, Jaipur, Lucknow, Mumbai and Ahmedabad – with Dharamsala notable by its absence after the last game before the hiatus was abandoned in dramatic fashion.The ­destination of the ­knockout games and final have yet to be determined, but the final has been rescheduled for 3 June.Explore more on these topicsCricketSport politicsIndianewsShareReuse this content"

As it was, with the title won and Arsenal secure in the Champions League qualification slots, a clash between the top two became the stage for discussion of thebooing of Trent Alexander-Arnoldand a weird confected online fury about whether Myles Lewis-Skelly had applauded Liverpool with sufficient gusto in the guard of honour.At least, from Arsenal’s point of view, the game followed the opposite pattern to the one with which we’ve become familiar.Arsenalhave dropped 21 points from winning positions this season (Liverpool just 13), while Liverpool have gained 22 (Arsenal just 13). If they’d matched each other in those respects, Arsenal would be two points clear at the top of the league; that essentially is the difference between them.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreMikel Arteta will almost certainly be aware of that. As has become apparent this season, he is a manager who takes statistics very seriously. He takes a scientific view of the game, in which everything is about maximising the likelihood of winning. “Over the season there are many things you need to go your way,” he said in the build-up to Sunday’s fixture, although he has been saying similar things all season, usually in the aftermath of games Arsenal have drawn when they should probably have won. “In the clinical moments, does the ball hit the post and come out, or go in? That’s the fine margins. What we have to try to do is to amplify the margins. The bigger the margins are, even if those things happen, then it will be very difficult for the opposition.”With that in mind, it’s worth asking why Arsenal have failed to win 10 games this season in which they’ve taken the lead. Squad depth is probably an issue; they lack high-level options on the bench to transform the dynamic of games, while leading players are probably playing more than they ought to.“We knew from the beginning of the season that our squad was super short,” Arteta admitted. “Being super short we had some players that had a high probability of getting injured.”It’s an admission that raises a lot of questions, but it is at least an acknowledgement of responsibility, which is not something often heard from either Arteta or Arsenal. Arteta’s post-match press conference on Sunday was a bizarre mix of anger at his players and veiled raging at the fates. He condemned “the defending standards and the errors after we gave the ball away, which is totally prohibited against this team” in the first half, continuing, “We were very far off it. I was really upset. Yeah, we had a reaction but I hate reaction, I like action.”But he also spoke of “having to play for the sixth time this season with 10 men”. Written down, that could be seen as further criticism of his squad, but the tone suggested this was a bizarre misfortune that had befallen Arsenal when in truth the wild lunge that brought Mikel Merino a second yellow card was as clear a booking as there could ever be. Arsenal have lacked discipline, their record of six red cards not only the worst in the league, but at least twice as bad as all but two other sides.David Beckham tells Minnesota to ‘show a little respect’ after Pink Phony Club jibeRead moreAlongside that, though, has been something else, something harder to define. Successful teams have a capacity to weather adversity, to get the job done. Arsenal do not. They are not ruthless in front of goal – which may in part be down to the lack of a high-class centre-forward. They have the best defence in the Premier League, yet have a capacity for giving up cheap goals.Wednesday’s Champions League defeatoffered a classic example, as Arsenal failed to take three good early opportunities against Paris Saint-Germain, then immediately offered up four chances, the third of which was taken.“I don’t think there’s been a better team in the competition from what I’ve seen,” Arteta said after that defeat, before clarifying what he meant. “Watching it back, watching the stats. It’s very clear but it’s not about the winning probability, it’s about making it count.”It may even be that he is right, depending what statistical indicators he is employing. But football is not just about stats; it is also about getting it done. All other statistics fade away next to the scoreline. Perhaps he tries to control too much, struggles to accept the chaos that lies at football’s heart. The sense, unfortunately, was of delusion, of Arteta morphing into one of Arsenal’s legions of online propagandists.Winning the metrics should only ever be the means to an end; winning the game is what matters and, at the moment, Arsenal don’t have the necessary edge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By half-time, Arsenal, who had finished the league in seventh, led Manchester United, who had come in ninth, 2-0 thanks to goals from Brain Talbot and Frank Stapleton. As Terry Neill, the Arsenal manager said, at that point it seemed “just another Cup final”. But, with four minutes remaining, Gordon McQueen hooked in as Arsenal struggled to clear a free-kick. Two minutes later, Sammy McIlroy ran on to a Steve Coppell pass, slithered though two challenges and tucked in a low finish to level the score.The momentum seemed to be with United.“I thought, ‘We’re going to win this match,’” said United’s Lou Macari. “But you never count your chickens at Wembley.”A minute later, Liam Brady surged forward and pushed the ball out to his left. Graham Rix’s cross evaded everybody in the United box – apart from Alan Sunderland coming in with a calm sidefoot finish at the back post. Brady admitted his run had largely been designed simply to get the ball into the United half, but Arsenal had won it 3-2 at the last and what Neill called the “most remarkable four minutes ever played at Wembley” were complete.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Aidan O’Brien will be hoping to complete an unprecedented clean sweep of the five major trials for the Derby at Epsom with the current ante-post favourite for the Classic, The Lion In Winter. Charlie Appleby, fresh from a double in the 2,000 Guineas and 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket, has supplemented the unbeaten Alpine Trail.Andrew Balding, the early leader in the trainers’ title race, has the current third-favourite, Royal Playwright, while football super-agent Kia Joorabchian’s Amo Racing operation, in itsfirst season based at the famous Freemason Lodge yardin Newmarket, fields Tuscan Hills, an unbeaten grandson of an Oaks winner.The reappearance of a long-term favourite for the Derby in Britain’s most significant trial is always a moment to savour, but the fact that O’Brien has won the previous four adds an extra dimension to Thursday’s contest.His dominance at Chester, Lingfield and Leopardstown is not unprecedented, as he also hoovered up the Chester Vase and the Dee Stakes, and the Derby Trials at Lingfield and Leopardstown in 2013, 2019 and 2022.His Dante runners in those years, though, were not seen as potential Ballydoyle first-strings for Epsom. Only one, in fact, even set off as the favourite, and that was a swiftly forgotten twice-raced maiden winner Indian Chief, who finished third in the 2013 Dante, and required 21 subsequent starts and two changes of stable before finally adding to his win tally, off a mark of 65 at Chepstow in 2016.View image in fullscreenAlpine Trail, trained by in-form Charlie Appleby, faces Derby favourite The Lion in Winter at York this week.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe Lion In Winter is a very different proposition, having been on top of the Derby betting since his win in the Acomb Stakes at York last August, with Ruling Court, this year’s 2,000 Guineas winner and current Derby second-favourite, back in third. He was as short as 6-1 for Epsom at that early stage of his career, and despite not having seen a racecourse since, The Lion In Winter is now no bigger than 3-1 to give his trainer a record-extending 11th win in the Derby.In a year when, uniquely, the reigning champion trainers both on the Flat and over jumps in Britain are both based in Ireland, the impression that O’Brien has saved his best Derby contender for last seems to fit with an overall narrative of increasing Irish dominance under both codes.But the memory of O’Brien’s most recent Dante favourite – in fact, his only Dante favourite since Indian Chief – offers at least a little encouragement for The Lion In Winter’s opponents on Thursday. Like The Lion In Winter, High Definition arrived on the Knavesmire having won his two starts as a juvenile and spent the winter at the head of the Derby betting. He set off at 13-8, finished third – and then, 11 races and as many defeats later, finally got another win on the board a few days short of his fifth birthday, in a maiden hurdle at Leopardstown.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowWorcester:2.00 God’s Own Getaway 2.30 Jet Of Dreams 3.00 Captain Hugo 3.30 Ice In The Veins 4.00 Jena D’Oudairies 4.30 Sirekoff 5.05 The Wire Flyer 5.35 Hey Mister Dj.Beverley:2.12 Homestrait 2.42 Larchill Lass 3.12 Opal Storm 3.42 Casilli (nb) 4.12 Zappata 4.42 Call Me Audrey.Chepstow:2.20 Fishermans Cottage 2.50 Steel Drum 3.20 Johnjay 3.50 Devas Boy (nap) 4.20 Saffredi 4.55 Forest Spirit.Sedgefield:5.40 Jackpot Cash 6.10 Vanilla Dancer 6.40 Delpotro 7.10 Lillistar 7.40 Gavin 8.10 Scairp Dubh.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.If The Lion In Winter fails to live up to expectations on Thursday, there are several interesting candidates in the lineup that could yet head to Epsom as serious contenders for the Derby, and none more so, perhaps, than Raphael Freire’s Tuscan Hills.Freire has had a solid start to his time at Freemason Lodge, with four wins from 22 runners so far, but Celestial King, Amo’s sale-topping £1.75m purchase at the Newmarket breeze-ups in April, was only fourth on debut at Ascot on Saturday, when he faded to finish nearly six lengths behind the winner.Joorabchian has already seen his colours carried into second place aboard big outsiders in the Derby in both 2021, when Mojo Star, at 50-1, wasfour-and-a-half lengths behind Adayar, and 2023, when King Of Steel, at 66-1, was justa half length behind Auguste Rodin.In an apparent partnership with Evangelos Marinakis – most recently seenventing his spleenat Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espírito Santo, after hisside conceded a late equaliser against Leicesteron Sunday – Joorabchian has been on a spectacular spending spree ever since last October’s Book One sale at Tattersalls in Newmarket, where he went bid-for-bid with Sheikh Mohammed, no less, over a series of seven-figure yearlings.Quick GuideBlackmore announces retirement from the saddleShowHistory-maker Blackmore retires from racingRachael Blackmore, one of the most successful riders in National Hunt history and the first female jockey to ride the winner of the Grand National aboard Minella Times in 2021, has announced her immediate retirement from race-riding at the end of a ground-breaking 16-year career in the saddle.In the space of a remarkable 12 months from March 2021 to March 2022, Blackmore became the first female rider to win the Champion Hurdle, aboard Henry de Bromhead’s Honeysuckle; landed the Grand National at Aintree on Minella Times; and then completed the set of jumping’s most prestigious prizes by winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup on A Plus Tard.Subsequent victories in the Champion Chase, on Captain Guinness in 2024, and Bob Olinger, in the Stayers’ Hurdle two months ago, ensured she will retire having won all four of the Cheltenham festival’s feature events. She was also the first, and so far only, female rider to be crowned leading rider at the Cheltenham festival, winning six races in all at the four-day meeting in 2021.“My days of being a jockey have come to an end,” Blackmore said in a statement on Monday. “I feel the time is right. I’m sad but I’m also incredibly grateful for what my life has been for the past 16 years. I just feel so lucky, to have been legged up on the horses I have, and to have experienced success I never even dreamt could be possible.”Blackmore’s statement concluded: “It is daunting, not being able to say that I am a jockey anymore … who even am I now! But I feel so incredibly lucky to have had the career I’ve had.“To have been in the right place at the right time with the right people, and to have gotten on the right horses – because it doesn’t matter how good you are without them. They have given me the best days of my life and to them I am most grateful.”Greg WoodPhotograph: David Davies/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.He snapped up Freemason Lodge afterSir Michael Stoute announced his retirement, was busy in the market again at the December foal sale in Newmarket, where he paid 2.5m gns (£2.63m) for a sister to Chaldean, the 2023 2,000 Guineas winner, and splashed out a further 3.2m gns (£3.3m) on seven lots – including Celestial King – at the breeze-ups.There have been enough hirings, firings – and re-hirings – in Amo Racing’s relatively brief existence to date to suggest that Joorabchian will be expecting some tangible return on his investment in the not-too-distant future. A big run from Tuscan Hills on Thursday would be timely, to say the least.Explore more on these topicsThe DerbyTalking HorsesHorse racingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Much of what he unveiled that day has since been shelved.“The talks in Geneva were very friendly,” said Trump. “We’re not looking to hurt China.”The US president, who has claimed for months that tariffs could raise trillions of dollars for the US federal government, appeared to change tack on Monday. “The biggest thing to me is the opening up,” he said of China. “I think it would be fantastic for our businesses if we could go in and compete.”At an event largely focused on his administration’s efforts to lower drug prices, Trump signaled he may now turn his focus to the European Union, which he claimed had been “nastier” than China.“We have all the cards,” the president claimed, using similar rhetoric to describe relations with the EU that he was using about China just weeks ago. “They treated us very unfairly.”The 90-day lowering of tariffs applies to the duties announced by Trump on 2 April, which ultimately escalated to 125% on most Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with equivalent measures.China also imposed non-tariff measures, such as restricting the export of critical minerals that are essential to US manufacturing of hi-tech goods.The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said China’s retaliation had been disproportionate and amounted to an effective embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies.With the 115 percentage point deduction, Chinese duties on US goods will be lowered to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%. That is because the US tariffs include a 20% rate imposed by Trump before the latest trade war, which the president said was related to China’s role in the US’sfentanyl crisis.The fentanyl-related tariff will still apply, and Trump stressed that sector-specific US tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium will be unaffected.A spokesperson for China’s ministry of commerce said: “This move meets the expectations of producers and consumers in both countries, as well as the interests of both nations and the common interest of the world.“We hope that the US side will, based on this meeting, continue to move forward in the same direction with China, completely correct the erroneous practice of unilateral tariff hikes, and continually strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.”China’s yuan jumped to a six-month high on the signal that the trade war would be paused. Up to 16m jobs wereat risk in China, according to some estimates, while the US faced rising inflation and empty shelves thanks to dizzying tariffs on the biggest supplier of US goods.Bessent said he was impressed by the level of Chinese engagement on the fentanyl problem during the talks in Switzerland. “For the first time the Chinese side understood the magnitude of what is happening in the US,” Bessent said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previously, the hope was just that the two sides can sit down to talk, and the market had been very fragile. Now, there’s more certainty. Both China stocks and the yuan will be in an upswing for a while.”Hu Xijin, the former editor of the nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, said on social media the agreement was a “great victory for China in upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect”. Hu noted on Weibo that the recently agreedUK-US trade dealmaintained the US’s 10% tariff on UK imports, “while the UK did not implement reciprocal measures”.Wang Wen, the head of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said: “This is an unexpected achievement in Sino-US tariff negotiations.”However, Wang also urged caution, as he said the agreement “does not represent the resolution of the structural contradictions between China and the United States, nor does it mean that there will be no friction and serious differences between China and the United States in the future”.Stock market chartStock markets across Europe rose in the aftermath of the US-China announcement. Germany’s Dax index jumped by nearly 1%, as Mercedes-Benz, Daimler Trucks and BMW were among the biggest risers. France’s Cac 40 index rose by 1.3%. Shares in the Danish shipping group Maersk rose 12%.Brent crude rose almost 3% at $65.75 a barrel, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, jumped by 1.2%.After the announcement of the US-China agreement, analysts at the Dutch bank ING lifted their forecast for China’s growth this year. ING predicted a jump in exports from China to the US, reverting to forecasting 4.7% growth in theChinese economythis year.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsTariffsGlobal economyInternational tradeTrump tariffsChinaUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Putin made the offer in a bid not to alienate the US president, and avoid the growing European pressure on Trump to impose harsher sanctions. Western diplomats say they have no reason to believe that Trump acted in collusion with the Russian leader.The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland hadfor the first time gone together to Kyiv at the weekendto underline the call for a 30-day ceasefire that they said should start on Monday.The aim of the visit by Keir Starmer,Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk was to put pressure on Trump to admit that Putin was stalling, and that the US had no political option but to put swingeing economic sanctions on Russia.The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has prepared a sanctions package that has broad congressional support.Foreign ministers had also been in Lviv on Friday in a bid to put pressure onRussia, including by saying plans existed to try Russian leaders for the crime of aggression in front of a special tribunal. The UK had announced further sanctions on the Russian shadow fleet.Partly due to Trump’s intervention, the UK has now postponed further measures due to be announced on Monday, but the EU is continuing with its plans for another package of sanctions later this month. A German government spokesman said on Monday that the EU would begin working on the sanctions if there was not a ceasefire by the end of the day.The gamechanger, however, would be extra US sanctions, not just because of the economic impact, but also due to the political symbolism in Trump acknowledging that Putin has been the chief obstacle to a settlement.On Sunday, Trump issued a statement on his Truth Social website blaming both Russia andUkrainefor his ceasefire plan not coming into being. He said Ukraine should agree to meet Russia immediately. “At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible,” Trump wrote. “If it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!” Trump said he was “starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin”.European chiefs, meeting in London on Monday, are waiting to see if Putin will himself go to Istanbul to hold talks with Zelenskyy, a leader that he does not recognise as legitimate.In the previous round of talks in Turkey in 2022, the Russia foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, led the Russian delegation. Putin’s attendance might be a sign that he recognises he is under real pressure from Trump.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Monday did not directly answer questions on talks with Zelenskyy, saying instead the Kremlin was “focused on a serious search for ways to achieve a long-term peaceful settlement”. Peskov also criticised what he called EU “ultimatums” over Ukraine in a conference call with reporters. “The language of ultimatums is unacceptable to Russia, it is not appropriate. You cannot talk to Russia in such a language,” he said.On Monday Trump suggested Putin would attend and that he himself might take part. “You may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey … and I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over. I don’t know where I am going be on Thursday, I’ve got so many meetings … There’s a possibility there I guess if I think things can happen.”A key demand, backed by Europe, will be that Putin stops prevaricating about the 30-day ceasefire.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, will also be in Turkey on Thursday for an informal summit on overall Nato defence spending, but European ministers intend to discuss their view that Russia’s terms for a peace deal effectively involve the dismemberment of Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ukraine is ready for that. Germany now expects Russia to agree to a ceasefire and then be prepared to negotiate.”The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said: “What we are seeing from Moscow is not promising. He’s trying to gain time and possibly occupy more Ukrainian territories.”Kaja Kallas, the EU head of foreign policy, said: “To start peace talks, there must be a ceasefire We must put pressure on Russia because it is playing a game.”Zelenskyy’s strategy ever since the disastrous public falling out with Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, in the Oval Office, has been as much as possible to stay close to Trump’s demands, fearing that if he does not Trump will pull the plug on US support for Ukraine, something that has not yet happened.Maria Zakharova said Ukraine had “misread” Putin’s statement. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson told state newswire Tass: “Putin said it very clearly: negotiations about the initial reasons [for the war] first, then a conversation about a ceasefire.” Russia’s demands include a bar on Nato membership for Ukraine and recognition of Putin’s annexation of four south-eastern regions, as well as an end to western military support for Kyiv.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropeKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

A copy was obtained by the Guardian.“And it’s all Biden,” Plouffe adds, reflecting on the former US president’s decisions to run for re-election and then to cling on for more than three weeks after a catastrophic debate performance against Trump raised questions about his mental acuity and age. “He totally fucked us.”Plouffe, along with some other former Obama staffers, haspreviously been criticalof Biden and his role in the Democratic defeat. In the wake of Harris’s loss he posted a message on X – formerly known as Twitter – that the Harris campaign had begun in a “deep hole”. Helater deletedhis account.The book describes how Plouffe had received calls from donors worried about Biden’s diminishing energy, cognitive skills and ability to deliver a speech. He in turn pressed the White House and Democratic party if they felt sure that the then president could win another election and was repeatedly told he could.ButTapper, chief Washington correspondent for CNN, and Thompson, a national political correspondent for Axios, spoke to around 200 people for the book, including members of Congress and White House and campaign insiders. Some had been sounding the alarm about Biden’s mental acuity and about desperate efforts by his close staff and allies to hide the extent of his deterioration.One senior aide, who quit the White House because they did not think Biden should run, admits to the authors that “we attempted to shield him from his own staff so many people didn’t realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023”.“I loveJoe Biden. When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.”A prominent Democratic strategist says of Biden’s determination to seek re-election: “It was an abomination. He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people.”Original Sin is one of several eagerly awaited books about the 2024 election and an alleged White House conspiracy.Biden, 82, seemingly tried to preempt its revelations last week with media appearances on BBC Radio 4’s Today program and ABC’s talkshow The View. Biden has signed with Creative Artists Agency for representation andhired communications strategist Chris Meagherto help burnish his public reputation.But the 27 June 2024debate in Atlantawas no anomaly, the book argues. Since at least 2022 Biden has been increasingly prone to lose his train of thought and struggle to remember the names of top aides. His speeches can be incoherent and difficult to hear. When he proved incapable of delivering a two-minute video address without stumbling, aides filmed him with two cameras so the edit would be less obvious.Original Sin tells how prominent figures tried to intervene in various ways. Obama visited the White House in 2023 and warned Biden: “Just make sure you can win the race.”Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood powerbroker and significant Democratic donor, yelled at longtime Biden ally Ron Klain: “Joe Biden cannot run for re-election! He needs to drop out! He can’t win! What’s the plan B?” Klain admitted there was no plan B.AndChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, confronted the president after the debate last July at his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, and appealed to his desire to preserve his legacy. He warned Biden that, he if stayed in the race and lost to Trump then 50 years of “amazing, beautiful work goes out the window. But it’s worse than that – you will go down in American history as one of the darkest figures.”On their way out, the book reports, Biden put his hands on Schumer’s shoulders and told him: “You have bigger balls than anyone I’ve ever met.”Biden stepped aside on 21 July and quickly endorsed Harris, but it was too late, the authors contend. He had already helpedusher in the fatethat he most wanted to avoid: the return of Trump to the White House.Explore more on these topicsJoe BidenUS politicsKamala HarrisDonald TrumpDemocratsUS elections 2024newsShareReuse this content"

In the UK they are available on the NHS only for adults with a BMI above 35 with a weight-related condition, although in certain circumstances specialist paediatric clinics can prescribe them.Dr Annika Janson, of Karolinska university hospital in Sweden, the lead author of the study, whose findings were presented at the European Congress on Obesity, said the beneficial impact of weight loss jabs on children’s weight could accelerate in future years.“Only a fraction of the children had GLP-1 drugs and most of those who did started on them six to 12 months into the treatment programme. Longer-term treatment may lead to greater improvements in BMI,” she said.In addition to helping to curb hunger, families reported reduced conflicts around food and improved capacity for other lifestyle adaptations.“It was . Portions could be downsized. For some children, not being hungry all the time is a new feeling,” Janson said. “GLP-1 receptor agonists are clearly beneficial to many children with severe obesity and, while they won’t help in all cases, more children should have access to these important medications.”NHS England has announced it is rolling out “smart scales” that monitor children’s weight remotely in an attempt to “nudge” behaviour towards healthier eating habits.Being overweight as a young child could double risk of adult obesity, research showsRead moreAbout 350 families are already using the technology in 15specialist paediatric weight management clinics. NHS England said on Monday it would deploy the scales to a further four clinics in the summer.The digital weighing scales connect to an app and have “hidden digits” so families don’t see the specific weight. The data is automatically transferred to the patient’s clinical team, who send the family overall weight trends and supportive messages, which experts said could be more encouraging for young people.Prof Simon Kenny, NHS England’s national clinical director for children and young people, said: “This gamechanging tool is helping our specialists support and keep track of children’s weight loss progress without them needing to leave home, while offering regular advice to them and their parents to help build healthy habits.”Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: “I think there is a worry that some people will think this is nanny state or Big Brother but I think actually people are so confused about weight and BMI, especially when it comes to children, that I think this might be a better way to go.“We have to find ways to help families to change their habits, and if it’s about nudge and going a bit softly but keeping people under close surveillance, that may be the way to do it.”Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthMedical researchChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

It escalated into drone and missile strikes by both sides, and deadly shelling along the disputed border dividing Kashmir.Both Trump and Pakistani officials credited the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the vice-president, JD Vance, with brokering peace between the two countries, after hours of intense negotiations withIndiaand Pakistan.How India and Pakistan conflict turned from brink of war to ceasefire in daysRead moreBut Modi made no reference to the US’s role in the ceasefire. Instead he maintained India’s line that it was Pakistan that first reached out to India’s head of military operations on Saturday for a ceasefire, and it was Pakistan that had called on the global community for help.In comments at the White House on Monday, Trump claimed the US had “stopped a nuclear conflict” in its interventions with India and Pakistan. He said: “I think it could have been a bad nuclear war, millions of people could have been killed. So I’m very proud of that.”Modi’s speech also alluded to the nuclear threat that had hung over last week’s escalating tensions, adding that in any future conflict with Pakistan, India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmailing”.On Monday, Pakistan security officials said one of the terms of the ceasefire was an agreement that future talks would be held in a third country, with the United Arab Emirates floated as a possible venue.In his speech, Modi made reference to possible future negotiations but said that “if we talk to Pakistan, it will be about terrorism only … it will be about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”.By Monday, it appeared as if the fragile ceasefire would continue to hold. Along the line of control, the disputed border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan, all the cross-border shelling and aggressions of last week showed no sign of resuming. India also reopened 32 airports across north India that had been shut down as cross-border hostilities escalated.The Indian army said in a statement on Sunday night: “The night remained largely peaceful across Jammu and Kashmir, and other areas along the international border.” In a phone call between military officials from India and Pakistan, both sides also agreed to reduce troop presence at the border.In Indian-administered Kashmir, expert teams were dispatched to the border areas to defuse unexploded bombs, as tens of thousands of people who had been evacuated from their villages in border areas returned home.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanKashmirNarendra ModiDonald TrumpSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Many farms rely on these payments.The pause was implemented suddenly despite farmers applying for SFI funding having been shown a message on the government website saying that if the scheme was to close, they would be given six weeks’ notice.The decision to reopen the schemes to farmers who had been shown this message was taken after the National Farmers’ Union submitted a legal complaint to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), arguing it was unlawful.Daniel Zeichner, the farming minister, said in a statement to parliament that he had “remade the decision to close the SFI 2024 scheme to new applications, without notice, on 11 March 2025, taking into account the message that was published in error on the screen”.He said about 3,000 applications had been affected, and those farmers would be given a new opportunity to apply for the funding.A Defra source said: “We are taking responsibility, apologising and reopening the scheme to those affected.”A new SFI scheme will be opened after the June spending review. Ministers say the new version will be “better value for money”, and areconsidering excludingthe wealthiest farmers from the scheme.The farming sector hasfelt embattledunder the Labour government after the Treasury implemented an inheritance tax on agricultural businesses, which some farmers have said could prevent them passing on their business to their children.Explore more on these topicsFarmingBrexitEuropean UnionForeign policySteve ReedLabourEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But right now, the government is failing to meet the challenges facing workers and communities. As jobs disappear and the cost of living soars, communities are being left behind. This plays right into the hands of those who wish to weaponise the government’s inaction for their own profits, under the guise of caring about workers.”One of Labour’s manifesto pledges was to end the issuance of new licences in the North Sea, which has come under fierce attack from the Conservatives and Reform, which argue for continuing to exploit the resources.However, fossil fuel reserves in the North Sea are rapidly dwindling, which will mean a decline in jobs whatever happens. Harris said: “We need to see the government take the needs of workers seriously, through coordinated, purposeful and, crucially, funded interventions to support them. It should be clear to everyone at this point thatwe cannot rely on the market and industry bosses to deliver these.”OCI also advocates closing tax loopholes, such asthe “carried interest” provision in capital gains tax. That allows private equity fund managers to pay a much lower rate on their investment tax than they would if they had to pay income tax on it. Closing it would boost revenues by about £490m a year, OCI estimates.Fossil fuel producers are benefitting from £17.5bn a year in UK government assistance, according to the campaign group Global Justice Now (GJN). This is the highest level in nearly a decade and is on course to increase over this parliament.Tax breaks for fossil fuel producers, such as those on extracting oil and gas from the North Sea, and decommissioning oilfields, are worth about £2.7bn a year, according to the report. Nearly £900m a year of investment incarbon capture and storage technology, intended to help meet the UK’s goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, is also classed as a subsidy to the fossil fuel industry by GJN.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These include a reduced rate of VAT on gas and other fuels, worth about £6bn a year, and £4.7bn in fuel duty relief, which is supposed to help drivers in rural areas who would otherwise face higher costs for vehicle fuel.The authors said amending some measures would need to be done carefully to ensure low-income households were not hit.A government spokesperson said: “We are making the UK a clean energy superpower so we can protect family finances and our national finances. The UK does not give fossil fuel subsidies and supports international efforts on reform. This government has delivered on its manifesto commitment to remove unjustifiably generous investment allowances from the energy profits levy regime, and extended it to 31 March 2030.”Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsOilGasEnergyClimate crisisTax and spendingGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2013, a bloom of a different species,Alexandrium catenella, had “covered the entire east coast of Tasmania and shut down their aquaculture and seafood industries for about four months”, she said.Large blooms could also reduce the amount of oxygen in the water, said Prof Martina Doblin, a UTS oceanographer who specialises in algal blooms.Karenia mikimotoiis an unusual algae that could feed on sunlight as well as other organisms, she said. And it is these characteristics, combined with unusually high and stable water temperatures, that enabled the algal bloom to become so large and sustained.“In low abundance, it is part of the natural food web. But in high abundance, it can become very problematic,” Doblin said.Such events were rare, but they can be devastating for local economies, she said. Improved early warning systems and management had the potential to limit the damage.Strong westerly winds were ultimately needed to dissipate the algae, according to a spokesperson for SA’s environment department. “However, persistent high-pressure systems affecting southern Australia have delayed these winds,” they said.Explore more on these topicsSouth AustraliaAustralian climate and environment in focusClimate crisisCoastlinesMarine lifeWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Mingyang has emerged as the preferred manufacturer, but the company has sought advice from ministers on whether to proceed.Green Volt, which is jointly owned by Flotation Energy, a Scottish company and Vårgrønn, a Norwegian one, is constructing the first commercial-scalefloating offshore windfarm in Europe. The project will deliver electricity to oil and gas platforms, replacing power currently generated by gas and diesel turbines, andprovide electricity to the UK grid.The decision over whether to source its wind turbines from Mingyang will be closely scrutinised after the governmentstepped in to take control of British Steelamid claims that its Chinese owner, Jingye Group, wanted to shut down its Scunthorpe plant to make the UK a dumping ground for Chinese steel.The incident triggered calls for Chinese companies to be locked out of involvement with critical national infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said at first that he would not bring another Chinese company into the British steel sector before softening his position.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary,travelled to China earlier this springto discuss closer cooperation on energy and climate.China to snub UK energy summit amid row over infrastructure projectsRead moreThe decision over whether Mingyang can supply the turbines is not subject to any formal government process, but the company is unlikely to proceed if ministers say they have security concerns.The Sun reported three months ago that some officials in the Ministry of Defence and Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero had raised concerns about the proposed deal. Green Volt has been waiting for a verdict from the government for weeks, according to people familiar with the discussions.An industry source said the UK did not currently have the heavy manufacturing capability to produce the turbines domestically. “They have tried to get European manufacturers to no avail,” the source said of Green Volt. “Miliband is on to something here. We all want to get to where he wants to get to, but if it’s not from Chinese companies, who is going to [supply wind turbines] to us?”The project would be an important contributor to the government’smission to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Progress towards that suffered a blow this week when the Danish company Ørstedcancelled its plansto build one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, the Hornsea 4 project. Ministers are hopeful that Ørsted will return to the table, however.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Guardian contacted Mingyang for comment.A Green Volt spokesperson said: “We are developing the largest commercial-scale, floating offshore windfarm in the world, working to hugely ambitious timelines to deliver the government’s goal of 43-50 GW of offshore wind by 2030. Having secured a contract for difference from the government last year, we are identifying supply chain partners to help us build the windfarm. As yet, no turbine supplier has been confirmed for Green Volt. We will comply with any government regulation and guidance around security of critical national infrastructure in the selection of all our suppliers.”A government spokesperson said: “We would never let anything get in the way of our national security, and while we would not comment on individual cases, investment in the energy sector is subject to the highest levels of national security scrutiny.“We are undergoing rigorous processes to look at the role of China in our supply chain and investment in critical infrastructure – taking into account the national security considerations, as well as our need for investment in the supply chain.”Explore more on these topicsWind powerEd MilibandChinaAsia PacificEnergyRenewable energyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

And often when we did that we put ourselves in danger.”He added: “To hear now that the elite soldiers were casting aside those rules deliberately lets us down.”UK special forces have operated secretly in 19 countries since 2011Read morePanorama also claimed that David Cameron was repeatedly warned during his tenure as prime minister that British special forces were killing civilians in Afghanistan.His spokesperson said it was “right that we await the official findings of the inquiry”. They added that “any suggestion that Lord Cameron colluded in covering up allegations of serious criminal wrongdoing is total nonsense”.The allegations are based on interviews conducted by investigators from the BBC’s Panorama programme, from more than 30 veterans who served with or alongside UK special forces inIraqor Afghanistan.Richard Bennett, the UN-appointed special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, said the allegations highlighted “the need for comprehensive accountability and justice for victims and their families”.AMinistry of Defencespokesperson said: “We are fully committed to supporting the independent inquiry relating to Afghanistan as its work continues.“It is not appropriate for the MoD to comment on allegations which may be within the scope of the statutory inquiry, or to speculate on outcomes.“Anyone can provide evidence to the inquiry, no matter where in the world they are.

While the judge made an allowance for a claustrophobia diagnosis, he told her that she knew what she was doing was for Russia and had found it “exciting and glamorous.”Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, one of two lieutenants, was given a sentence of eight years by the judge, who noted reports of good behaviour and the fact his involvement in the ring stopped before their arrest in 2023. The other, Ivan Stoyanov, 33, was given five years and three weeks’ imprisonment after pleading guilty, albeit at what the judge noted was a late stage.Mr Justice Hilliard told each defendant that they would need to serve half their sentence before being eligible for parole and then would be liable for automatic deportation to Bulgaria.People tree of members of spy ringEarlier, he detailed six identified spy plots carried out by the defendants, some of whom he said were more culpable.Directed by Roussev’s second-in-command, Dzhambazov, he said the defendants were “motivated by money”, with “substantial” sums of up to €1m (£842,000) discussed.This, he said,demonstrated the “value” of their covert activities to Russia. “Some of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all. This enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value.The spy ring wasengaged in surveillance and intelligence operations between 2020 and 2023, targeting journalists and Russian dissidents.Working out of a guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, it was directed from abroad by Jan Marsalek, an Austrian businessman who had fled to Russia in 2020 after the payments company he helped to run, Wirecard, collapsed amid a €1.9bn (£1.6bn) fraud.Marsalek, who is believed to be in Moscow but is wanted in Germany over the Wirecard scandal, was working for the Russian FSB state security service and the GRU military intelligence agency.He directed surveillance in Bulgaria, Austria and Spain of Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist who had helped implicate Russian spies in the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the risk to them was obvious and Roussev would have been aware of the “extreme actions” Russia had taken against those it regarded as an “enemy” of the state.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command,said after sentencing that the strength of the investigation into the group’s surveillance operations had left the ringleaders – Roussev and Dzhambazov - with no option but to plead guilty to the charges.“This case is a clear example of the increasing amount of state threat casework we are dealing with in the UK. It also highlights a relatively new phenomenon whereby espionage is being ‘outsourced’ by certain states.Frank Ferguson, Head of the CPS Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said that,by targeting individuals in the UK fleeing persecution as well as journalists opposing the Russian regime,the the group had undermined the message that the UK is a safe country for those people.“This prolonged activity also undermined the security and safety of the UK; and there can be no doubt that each of the defendants knew exactly who they were spying for,” he added.Explore more on these topicsCrimeEspionageNorfolkEnglandBulgariaRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Non-essential spending, such as on entertainment or takeaway food, rose by 5.1% last month, its highest rate in almost two years.Thewarmest April on record, combined with a long Easter weekend, also meant more shoppers were out on the high street. Spending in physical shops increased by 6.9% after it dropped by 1.9% in March on a year-on-year basis.Julien Lafargue, a strategist at Barclays, said economic sentiment was “surprisingly positive” even amid uncertainty around the impact of US tariffs on the economy.“The recent decision by the Bank of England to further lower interest rates should add to this momentum. Similarly, the trade agreement reached between the US and the UK should provide some much needed visibility to businesses.” he said.Last week the Bank agreed tocut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25%and Keir Starmer announced he had reached a trade agreement with Donald Trump, the US president.The Barclays data chimed with separate research by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), an industry body. It found retail sales rose by 4.3% across the March and April period. Food sales in April grew 8.2% against last year, while non-food sales grew by 6.1%.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said Easter falling in April this year had contributed to the sales boost and the sunny weather had led to a boost in consumer spending.She said: “Food sales performed well as people brought together their family and friends for Easter celebrations, while sales of DIY, homeware and gardening goods shone bright as people made the most of the weather.”Online furniture sales rose by 7% in April, with household appliances up 8%. Linda Ellett, of the consultancy KPMG, said that this was likely a result of a rise in new homeowners due to stamp duty changes last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was given brief news of his lengthy sentence by the lawyer appointed to him by the Saudi government.Foreign Office officials at the hearing were able to pass news of the sentence to Doush’s British lawyers, it is understood.Haydee Dijkstal, a barrister at 33 Bedford Row chambers and the international counsel for Doush, said: “Online expression, even if expressing concern or criticism of a government, should not be criminalised or lead to detention and imprisonment. Using anti-terrorism legislation to punish and repress online expression on social media with severe prison sentences is inconsistent with international law and human rights standards.”Speaking before the sentence, Nour said: “I rarely speak to my husband but in the few snatched conversations we have managed it is clear that Ahmed is struggling.“He has thyroid problems and is tormented by mental distress. He worries about his family particularly as he was the sole breadwinner. He missed the birth of our fourth child and our 10-year wedding anniversary.“Because Ahmed is a British citizen we expected the UK to provide clarity amid a storm of uncertainty. But the Foreign Office refused to share information with me for months – citing data protection – while at the same time accepting assurances from Saudi Arabia at face value.”The Foreign Office has also said the Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, had raised the case multiple times with Saudi officials but Nour said she had been refused a meeting with the foreign secretary, David Lammy.Her husband had received only three consular visits since he was imprisoned in August.She said: “We think Ahmed is being charged for a tweet he posted seven years ago and subsequently deleted.“Ahmed has been sleeping in an overcrowded cell that is filthy. My husband is a dedicated family man who is devoted to his children, spending weekends taking them to restaurants and the park. They are distraught and are constantly asking when he will be back. I no longer know how to answer their questions.“For me the night-time is an empty void where I question over and over why this has happened to us.“What Ahmed has endured over the past eight months is tortuous prolonged solitary confinement, unclear charges, a forced confession and excessive surveillance by prison authorities all managed by a powerless state-appointed legal counsel.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The incumbent party had garnered 53% of the vote compared with 34% for its main opposition rival.Preliminary turnout in Sunday’s election was almost 42.16%, or 4% lower than four years ago.“It’s a result exceeding all expectations even before the ballots have been fully counted,” said a well-placed source in Tirana. “A fourth consecutive win is phenomenal. Edi has cause to be very happy.”In office since 2013, Rama had campaigned on his ability to fast-track reforms deemed vital for the ex-communist state to accede to the EU. The 60-year-old has promised to deliver membership within five years after formally opening accession negotiations last October.View image in fullscreenMembers of the electoral commission count ballots in Tirana.Photograph: Malton Dibra/EPAThe goal, seen by many as highly ambitious, has been aided by the desire of some European leaders to see Albania and other western Balkan states join the bloc following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The country’s first president after the fall of communism more than three decades ago, Berisha, 80, argued Albania was far from ready for EU admission. Once the personal physician of the late Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha, the cardiologist had run a US-style campaign overseen by consultants brought in from Washington DC, including Chris LaCivita, the Republican strategist credited with helping secure Donald Trump’s victory in November. Berisha had made his campaign motto “Make Albania Great Again”.The Democratic party had joined forces with 20 other political groups in the hope of removing Rama from office. But by early on Monday, as ballots were counted by hand, it was clear the Socialists were in the ascendancy.Analysts said the Socialist party appeared to have won backing from overseas voters after Albania’s large expatriate community was allowed to cast ballots by post for the first time. More than 192,000 votes were received from the nearly 246,000 Albanians who had registered to vote abroad before Sunday’s election in the 2.7 million-strong nation.An overwhelming 83% of Albanians support EU membership, the highest endorsement of any population in the western Balkans, according to a Eurobarometer survey released in November.Rama, who served as mayor of Tirana before going into mainstream politics – livening up the capital’s drab cityscape by having its communist-era buildings painted in an array of colours – has made the country’s EU accession a priority. Supporters attending his weekly rallies turned the quest into a hallmark by donning white T-shirts emblazoned with a large multicoloured “5” – indicating the years left until 2030.The promise of EU membership was a big draw for diaspora voters, said Albania’s ambassador to Greece, Luela Hajdaraga.“Albanians living abroad were very eager to participate in this historic process and have their voices heard,” she told the Guardian. “In Greece, especially, where the issue of gaining citizenship has been so difficult, the prospect of Albania joining the EU is seen very positively.”Rama has said that Albania, for decades the continent’s most isolated state, is “at the gates of Europe”. The country has opened 16 of the 35 negotiating chapters for membership of the bloc. But in a land blighted by corruption and organised crime, he also faces challenges, not least mass emigration as young Albanians seek better lives abroad.Explore more on these topicsAlbaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There is tech. It is like understanding the stage as an actor but for a lot of artists it is not taught in film school: how to understand the lens and what it can do, and why there is eye movement and recognise the effect it has.Final reckoning? Trailer for Mission: Impossible 8 suggests end to franchiseRead more“I always tell actors: spend time in the editing room, produce a movie, study old movies, recognise what the composition is giving you, know what those lenses are, understand the lighting and how to use it for your benefit. Understand the art form to that degree. Brando absolutely understood lighting; all the greats did.”Cruise, 62, said that after scoring his breakout role as Joel Goodson in Risky Businessin 1983, which went on to be a box-office and critical smash, he leveraged that success with the producers of Top Gun to gain more of a say in the film-making process.“I negotiated a deal where they had to allow me into every production meeting and to see every aspect behind the scenes,” he said. “This is when I started to get more creative controls.”He also paid tribute to Briton Tony Scott, who directed Top Gun and Days of Thunder, saying working with himhad been an “amazing experience”.“What he accomplished with those jets on Top Gunwas extraordinary and also [with cars] on Days of Thunder. He changed aerial photography, and the way you see motorsports being filmed today is because of Tony Scott. What an artist he is.”Cruise also mentioned working with people who “didn’t know how to make movies”, mentioning his experience starring in the critical and financial failure Losin’ It in 1982.“The quality wasn’t there nor was the intention to make a great film,” he said of the comedy directed by Curtis Hanson. “It was the first time I realised that some people didn’t know how to make movies.”Cruise made headlines on Sunday after he was spotted on the roof of theBFIImax building wearing a tuxedo. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, the eighth film in the franchise, is released on 21 May.Explore more on these topicsTom CruiseBFInewsShareReuse this content"

Campaigns by his supporters have been dominated by calls for him to be returned to thePhilippines.It is unclear how Duterte would take his oath to assume office as mayor. His daughter, impeached vice-president Sara Duterte, said this was being discussed by “his ICC [international criminal court] lawyers and his Filipino lawyers”.It is expected that, given the former president is imprisoned in the Netherlands, duties could instead be assumed by the vice-mayor – a race his son, Sebastian, was also on track to win.Duterte’s children and grandchildren have accused the state of having “kidnapped” him. In a video message posted after his arrest, he said he would take responsibility for his policies.The wider electoral picture for the family was mixed. Sara Duterte said late on Monday night that “the outcome was not what we had hoped for”, though her allies seeking seats in the senate appeared to have performed better than some pre-election surveys had predicted.She did not appear on the ballot papers on Monday, but the elections will prove crucial to her survival.Thevice-president was impeached in Februaryover claims that she misused funds, and in relation to a speech she gave in which she appeared to threaten the lives of the president, the first lady and speaker of the house.She is due to face trial in the 24-seat senate, where half of the members were being elected on Monday.If Sara Duterte were to be found guilty by the senate, she would be barred from office – preventing her from running for president in 2028.A two-thirds vote, of at least 16 senate members, is needed to convict an impeached official.As of midnight, five Duterte-aligned candidates were on course to secure seats in the senate, while allies of Marcos were projected to win six seats, fewer than had been predicted. A senator who has been associated with both the Marcos and Duterte campaigns has been included in each of their counts of successful candidates.Opposition candidates who are critical of both families performed better than expected.Sara Duterte said in a statement: “We will continue to hold the government accountable, advocate for the issues that matter, and work tirelessly to serve as a strong and constructive opposition.”Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificRodrigo DutertenewsShareReuse this content"

Among those in line were journalists, content creators,New Yorkresidents and fans of the music mogul.Before opening statements began, the jury of 12 New York residents was selected and seated. In the courtroom, members of Combs’s family, including his mother, Janice Combs, and children, sat in the front row.Prosecutor Emily A Johnson accused Combs in her opening statement of threatening, drugging and violently coercing women into sex. She said that Combs had an inner coterie who helped him cover up the alleged crimes, and that company resources were used to fulfill his sexual desires.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead more“He sometimes called himself the king, and he expected to be treated like one,” she said.Combs, the prosecution alleged, along with his inner circle, “committed crime after crime” over 20 years.The prosecution’s case, per Johnson’s opening statement, will include accounts by three women, Combs’s former girlfriend Casandra Ventura (known as Cassie), and two Jane Does. One of the unnamed women is a former employee who is slated to testify that Combs forced himself on her sexually on multiple occasions.At the center of the prosecution’s case is an assault that took place with Combs and Ventura in aLos Angeleshotel in 2016. Surveillance footage of that incident rocked headlines when it broke last year, despite – as Johnson noted – an attempt by Combs and his chief of staff to “broker a deal” with the hotel.Combs’s lawyer, Teny Geragos, began her opening statement by saying that Combs “is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case”. Geragos said that prosecutors were attempting to dub consensual sexual relationships as sex trafficking, and said that Combs and his girlfriends engaged in a “swingers lifestyle”.“It will not work,” she said, later adding: “This case is about Sean Combs’s private, personal sex life, which has nothing to do with his lawful businesses.”Geragos said the women in Diddy’s life “were strong, capable, and they were were in love with him” and that “the evidence is going to show you a very flawed individual, but it will not show you a racketeer, a sex trafficker or somebody transporting for prostitution”.Geragos added that the women had “freedom to make the choices they made” adding that they made “free choices every single day for years”.View image in fullscreenMembers of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’s family arrive at federal court in New York City on Monday.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesOf the aforementioned video with Ventura, Geragos conceded that while it was “overwhelming evidence of domestic violence”, “it’s overwhelming evidence that this domestic violence is over a phone, and not over sex trafficking.”The first witness called after opening statements was Israel Florez, a Los Angeles police officer who was a security guard at the InterContinental hotel in March 2016 when Combs was seen on video physically assaulting Ventura.Florez testified that he was called about a “woman in distress on the sixth floor” and later found Ventura wearing a hoodie in a corner while Combs was seated with “a devilish stare”.Florez then said he escorted Combs and Ventura back to their room, and testified that he witnessed Combs allegedly telling Ventura that she couldn’t leave the hotel, but then shortly after, telling her to leave.After Ventura left the room,Combs allegedly offered Florez money. “He was telling me: ‘Don’t tell nobody,’” Florez said, adding that he “100%” thought Combs was bribing him.The jury was shown the hotel surveillance footage that was published by CNN last year of Combs wearing a towel, hitting, kicking and dragging Ventura down a hallway. They were then shown images of the aftermath of assault, which included broken items and dirt on the walls. Additional video footage of the assault was also shown, which was surveillance footage recorded on Florez’s personal phone.Florez testified that he did not call the police because Ventura had not answered his questions when he spoke with her and kept saying she wanted to leave, before leaving the hotel with a driver.During cross-examination, Brian Steel, one of Combs’s lawyers, questioned Florez on why his initial incident report did not mention that he had heard Combs tell Ventura she couldn’t leave. Florez told the court that he didn’t believe it was a “significant fact” worth including at the time.Following Florez, the prosecution’s second witness called on Monday was Daniel Phillip, a former manager of a “male revue show”, which he has called a strip show for women.Phillip testified that in 2012, he was paid by Ventura to have sex with her in front of Combs, which he says was “something special” for her then partner. After that event, Phillip said he would return to have sex with Ventura several more times over the next year or two in various hotels in New York, as well as in Combs’s and Ventura’s homes in the city.Of the first encounter, Phillip testified that Ventura paid him a few thousand dollars before having sex with her in front of Combs, who wore a white robe, a baseball cap, and a bandana over his face, while he masturbated. Combs, in an attempt to conceal his identity, told Phillip he was in the importing and exporting business, though Phillip testified that he recognized the voice as Combs’s.Phillip testified that Combs asked for his driver’s license and took a picture of it, telling him at the time that it was “just for insurance”.“I understood it to be that he was threatening me,” Phillip told the court.Phillip said that during the sexual encounters, Combs would “direct” him and Ventura, telling them to act out certain scenarios and what sex acts to perform.Phillip recalled a few incidents when he said he witnessedCombs either throw something at or hit Ventura. He said he was “shocked” and “terrified” and said that he did not intervene out of fear, as this was “someone with unlimited power and chances are even if I did go to the police, that I might still end up losing my life”.On another incident when Ventura was struck by Combs, Phillip testified that he “tried to explain to her that she was in real danger if she stayed with him”.As testimony got increasingly explicit, Combs’s three daughters in attendance left the courtroom. His sons stayed seated and were seen passing notes periodically.The trial began in earnest after attorneys on both sides removed several jurors on Monday morning, with Combs’s lawyer Marc Agnifilo noting that prosecutors eliminated seven Black potential jurors. The prosecution said it did not demonstrate any bias during jury selection and selected a “very diverse group of jurors”. The judge denied Combs’s lawyer’s challenge and then proceeded with opening statements.Federal prosecutors allege that Combs used his expansive multimedia empire as a “criminal enterprise” with the help of associates and employees, to engage in or attempt to engage in crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution, and obstruction of justice, over several decades.Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges and firmly denies any wrongdoing. Earlier this month, herejected a plea deal during his final pre-trialhearing.If convicted, Combs, who has been in custody since his September arrest, faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life behind bars.The trial is expected to last about eight weeks, with testimony from at least three, possibly four, accusers, according toReuters.On Monday, court adjourned at 5pm ET. The trial is set to resume on Tuesday morning, with Phillip expected to re-take the stand again to continue his cross examination.The proceedings are taking place at the federal district court in lower Manhattan. Due to federal court regulations, the trial will not be televised.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Foreign films? Not his thing.At campaign rally in 2020 he reacted to the South Korean movie Parasite winning the best picture Oscarby demanding: “What the hell was that all about? We got enough problems with South Korea with trade. On top of that they give them best movie of the year? Was it good? I don’t know. Let’s get Gone With the Wind. Can we get Gone With the Wind back please?”Trump’s attack on the film industry is a sign of xenophobic contempt | Jesse HassengerRead moreNow the US president is bringing his brand of nativist-populism to the film industry. Last Sunday he announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the US industry was dying a “very fast death” due to the incentives that other countries offer to lure film-makers. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Not for the first time, Trump had latched on to a genuine concern: Los Angeles is currently experiencing its lowest levels of local production in decades,prompting comparisonswith the manufacturing decline of Detroit. But while the Motion Picture Association of America declined to comment, industry figures interviewed by the Guardian expressed scepticism about the president’s proposed solution due to its lack of detail, unclear legal basis and potential to provoke retaliation.Ava DuVernay, the award-winning film-maker whose credits include Selma and Origin, says:“It was thoughtless and lacked any business foundation, any knowledge of how the industry works. There are people in our industry who’ve stepped up to say this would do more harm than good.“It’s not about tariffs; it’s about tax incentives; that’s what drives our industry. Hopefully more light can be shed on that and there could be a reconsideration of this with proposals that actually get people back to work and don’t take away from an industry that’s already struggling.”View image in fullscreenJon Voight speaks at welcome celebration in Washington DC before inauguration of Donald TrumpPhotograph: APIn January Trump appointed acting veterans Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson to bring the industry back “bigger, better and stronger than ever before”. On 3 May Voight and business associates Steven Paul and Scott Karolvisited Trumpat his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss a carrot-and-stick approach to the revival of Hollywood.Voight, the 86-year-old star of Coming Home, Deliverance and Midnight Cowboy,told the trade magazine Variety: “Thank God the president cares about Hollywood and movies. He has a great love for Hollywood in that way. We’ve got to roll up our sleeves here. We can’t let it go down the drain like Detroit.”According to theentertainment news site Deadline, Voight and his associates proposed a 10 to 20% federal tax credit that would be “stackable” on what states already offer. But a US producer who chooses to shoot in a foreign country would face a tariff equal to 120% of the value of the foreign tax incentive received, the report said.Ben Allen, a member of the California state senate, subsequently met Voight and his two associates to discuss the plan. He says: “There’s a lot more to the proposals that came before the president this weekend than just tariffs. We might want to pursue a national tax incentive as we’re also pursuing a statewide. Obviously Trump took the tariff idea and ran with it, which is not a surprise given what we know he feels about tariffs.Allen adds: “If this is going to be successful it’s going to have to be done carefully and thoughtfully. What are the implications for the international market? This is a different kind of product. Does it mean that there’s going to be some sort of tax on arthouse foreign films? Is that really what we want?“But if it’s the tentpole stuff like thebig Marvel moviesthat could just as easily be made in the US but often times we’re losing to Canada or the UK or Australia or elsewhere, maybe there’s something to this idea. I don’t know: this was a Truth Social post. It wasn’t some thoughtful policy brief that came out delineating a plan.”It is unclear how tariffs on the film industry would work. Trump did not say whether he envisaged applying them to streaming platforms as well as theatrical releases, or whether tariffs would be based on production costs or box office revenue. It was also not certain whether productions split between the US and other countries – such as the James Bond or Mission: Impossible films – would be exempt in some fashion.Industry professionals argue tariffs are a blunt instrument that would hinder rather than help Hollywood compete with Australia, Britain, Canada and elsewhere. They could drive up production costs, leading to less output, more disruption for distributors and fewer choices for consumers. And reciprocal tariffs against US films overseas could have disastrous consequences.Jeff Most, a writer, producer, director and financier whose credits includeThe Crowand The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, says: “The idea of of providing a stick with a tariff is quite counterproductive because it unquestionably will give rise to other territories doing a similar protectionist move and will ultimately then result in penalties to the consumer who ends up paying the price to the availability of material on streaming platforms.“This is a wonderful moment in time that attention is actually being paid to this but it needs the right attention. It needs the right programme. At the end of the day tariffs are not the way to address this problem. That will only result in less being made, giving us fewer options as consumers in terms of what we see. It would decimate the independent film market.”Trump, who has frequently called tariffs “the most beautiful word in the dictionary”, in effect declared a trade war last month by announcing sweeping import taxes on dozens of countries. But many experts doubt the feasibility and legality of implementing a tariff on movies, which are considered intellectual property or a form of service, not physical goods that pass through ports of entry.View image in fullscreenTom Cruise in Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning which was shot in locations including the UK, Norway, Malta and South Africa.Photograph: Paramount Pictures and Skydance/APMost adds: “Trump is focused on promoting his use of tariffs to address whatever inequalities he sees. But at the end of the day you’re talking about a business in which there is a tremendous trade surplus for American producers because the streamers offer their services globally, as they have as theatrical distributors. It’s one of the bright spots of what our economy can tout as a winning area.“To do anything of a protectionist nature will ultimately have devastating effects if other territories around the world put up barriers. It’s our produced material and distributed material, even if it is shot anywhere around the world, which generates a great tax revenue base for the US treasury; that would be impacted significantly, as we’ve already seen with some of the industrial tariffs that have been implemented.”The concerns are shared byLaura Friedman, a Democrat who says she is the only current member of Congress who has worked in the film industry. Her 20-year career as a film and TV producer included spells at HBO and Paramount and credits such as It Takes Two, a romantic comedy starring Kirstie Alley, Steve Guttenberg, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.Friedman says: “We do not want to have a trade war over screening of films. I’m also worried about a tariff making it more expensive to go to the movies. We are trying to lure people back to the box office, back to the movie theater. I got into this business because I’m a filmophile. I love going to the movies. I don’t want to see that experience gone.“As far as we know, it affects streaming services as well. Does this mean that if you watch Parasite you have to pay twice as much as you would watching a different movie? I don’t understand how this is supposed to work. I don’t want a policy that makes it more expensive for Americans to stream content or to go to the movies.“That would be a policy that would be counterproductive. It would hurt the industry and it would kill jobs here. I want to work with the administration on a solution that brings production back, creates a healthy industry, increases our ability to produce content right here in America.”The idea of transplanting cast and crew overseas dates back 75 years to William Wyler’s Roman Holiday, the Hollywood Reporternoted recently. Most of this year’s best picture Oscar nominees were filmed outside the US, while a ProdPro survey among studio executives about their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026 showed that the top five choices were all elsewhere.View image in fullscreenAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyCalifornia also faces intensifying competition domestically. Georgia, where many Marvel superhero films are shot, has offered a tax credit since 2005. New Mexico, the setting for the drug dramaBreaking Bad, has been doing the same since 2002. Texas, which has offered tax breaks since 2007, wants to increase its budget allocated to such funding.Many in Hollywood are advocating for increased tax incentives to fight back. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, hasoffered to work with Trumpand called for doubling the state’s tax credits and proposed a $7.5bn federal tax credit.Friedman agrees that state incentive must be coupled with a national film tax credit. “LA can’t do it alone. It’s not enough money to compete when other countries have their federal government putting in tax incentives. California is struggling with recovery fromthe tragic wildfiresthat we had here in Los Angeles. California needs the federal government to be a better partner with us on wildfires and also on keeping jobs local.”But others question Trump’s motives, noting that he lost California by 20 percentage points in last year’s presidential election and has craved acceptance by the Hollywood elite only to find it elusive. He once said: “I think you learn in Citizen Kane that maybe wealth isn’t everything.”Drexel Heard, a political strategist who has worked as an actor, producer and writer, says: “If he shows his supporters that he’s sticking it to California, sticking it to Gavin Newsom, sticking it to the legislature, sticking it to voters who didn’t vote for him then that’s all he thinks he needs to do.“But ultimately it will only hurt a large swath of people, especially union workers that rely on that work. If I’m a studio I’m going to be like, well, how do I make cuts to that? How much AI work can I use? And then that opens up a whole new world of problems.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryDonald TrumpTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Still, you will watch the excruciating bits through your fingersRebecca NicholsonMon 12 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareOn paper, almost everything about Virgin Island sets off alarm bells. This “unique experiment” sees 12 virgins, mostly in their 20s (one is 30), heading off to a “radical retreat” on a Mediterranean island, where a team of professional sexperts will work on and guide them through some of their issues with intimacy. It looks like a reality show, but it is apparent from the beginning that those taking part are not reality show contestants. Nor is there a prize, as such, though some would like to have sex by the end of the experience.The first and most obvious question is whether sticking people on telly to pore over their innermost fears and psychological struggles will prove to be in any of their best interests.Billing it as an experiment does not place it in the most illustrious of company, either. Channel 4’s other experiment,Open House: The Great Sex Experiment, has couples trying non-monogamy in order to learn ... something? If they look really, really hard? Virgin Island is a little more probing. Despite sounding as if they had to fit a concept to the title – as possible sequels, I’ve scribbled down Isle of Men and Caveman Islands – Virgin Island does at least come with a pinch of statistical motivation. According to the headline-grabbing 2018 findings of a long-running study, one in eight young people remain virgins at the age of 26. This show sets out to ask why that might be and, if people are unhappy with this state of affairs, what can be done to help them.Presentation aside, the show turns out to be surprisingly empathetic. Their stories vary enormously, but all of the participants have signed up because they feel stuck, miserable, uncomfortable, or a combination of the three. It doesn’t do much to assuage fears of this being a cult, at first; they have to wear plain “retreat outfits”, in order to focus on the self rather than the body. But there is a collective sense of British reserve and dry humour, which means that they do, at least, get to joke about its cult-like leanings. This humour is noted by the therapists, who attempt to explore why they are using jokes to deflect attention. Apparently that’s not always good. Maybe this is educational, after all.There are people here with a phobia of touch, such as Jason, a 25-year-old admin assistant who is at the front and centre of the first two episodes. Others, such as Zac, a 28-year-old delivery driver, feel as if they’ve missed out on something that came naturally to their peers, and that they might have left it too late. Emma, a 23-year-old who works in fast food, has serious issues with self-esteem and body image, as does Taylor, a 29-year-old receptionist for whom the experience is initially deeply upsetting.I am less cynical about the show than I thought I might be, in part because bringing these 12 people together seems to override one of the broader experiences they share, which is a sense that they are not like everyone else. The common ground here is important. But they are not just on Virgin Island to meet like-minded people. There is a team of sex therapists who offer workshops, demonstrations and even sexual surrogacy, with a trained, stand-in sexual partner for the sake of learning and guidance.‘My body deserves pleasure’: is Virgin Island the most awkward TV sexperiment ever?Read moreThis is where my own British reserve kicks in. I want to not find it excruciating that “sexological bodyworker” is a job title, or that something called “Up Against the Wall” – not in any way a symbolic name – is a therapeutic exercise, or that what is clearly important work on shame and desire involves pretending to be animals and rolling around on the floor moaning. I know my response is not very helpful. WhyamIusing jokes to deflect attention? But I don’t think I will be the only one watching some of this with my hands over my eyes.Virgin Island is far from perfect. In the early stages, it appears to brush over very big questions; perhaps it will start to look deeper in later episodes. But the courage of the participants is admirable, and their willingness to open up on camera, partly, it seems, to show other people that they are not alone, is touching. As some of them make breakthroughs, their confidence grows, and you can see that the process is having a positive effect on them. Virgin Island might sound like an Alan Partridge pitch, but stick with it, and it is more complex than it first seems.Virgin Island is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

In that earlier film, the wildlife and nature presenter used his own experience of neurodiversity to help other people explore and demonstrate the impact of autism on their lives, for the benefit of their family, friends and a wider TV audience. Inside Our ADHD Minds uses the same formula – Packham walks through woodland as he explains something important, anecdotes about his own life, informative chats with experts, and art therapy in the form of expressive short films – to dig deeper into the condition, and, in the following episode, dyslexia.The result is a beautiful and revelatory programme which feels educational without being didactic; Packham rejects the name “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder”, for example, explaining that it is not a deficit of attention, but a struggle to regulate it. The documentary takes a two-pronged approach. Packham interviews experts, who deliver the framework of information. One suggests that having ADHD is like having six televisions in your brain, blaring at the same time, and trying to watch them all at once, and explains that people with ADHD have lower dopamine levels and an increased risk of anxiety and depression. Another expert talks about how boys and girls often presentADHD symptomsdifferently at school, and how diagnoses were heavily gendered until shockingly recently, which might be why it is more common for women to receive a diagnosis at a later age.But the primary focus is on two individuals, Henry and Jo, who are given the chance to articulate their inner worlds by making short films about them, much like the participants in Inside Our Autistic Minds. Henry is in his early 20s, and was diagnosed with ADHD at school, during his A-levels. He tried the medication he was prescribed, but did not like the way it made him feel. He works as a tour guide in Soho, and you can see why he is good at it: he is a garrulous and energetic presence. But to Packham, he is open about his difficulties in managing day-to-day life and his fears that his family don’t know who he really is. He sometimes forgets to eat. His room is a mess. He worries that he is lazy, incapable, and he worries about what his parents would think if they knew the truth about him.View image in fullscreenCrisis point … Chris Packham with Jo, who was diagnosed late.Photograph: Joe Myerscough/BBCJo, meanwhile, was diagnosed later in life, after years of being unable to settle, and being told that she was “too much”. She explains that she has had 14 different careers, and talks about reaching a crisis point at work, where she couldn’t do what she was there to do. It wasn’t until her eldest daughter told her about a friend at university with ADHD that Jo started to realise what might be going on. For her, medication did help. But, like Henry, there are overwhelming feelings of shame and sadness; there is a sense for both that they are frequently misunderstood, even judged negatively.This programme is tuned in to the complexities and sheer variety of neurodiversity and personal experience. There are gendered, generational, environmental and perhaps even class-based differences here. Henry is seeking the understanding of his parents, who have been supportive throughout his teenage years, but is resistant to any sense that they might want to “fix” him. He appears to be asking for acknowledgment that he operates, and will continue to operate, in a different way. In his film, he is setting out a practical task: he wants his family to see how he lives and what supposedly ordinary activities, such as remembering to attend an important meeting, are like for him.For Jo, the task is more emotional. She would like her family to see the impact of her diagnosis and to understand the grief that she feels, about the person she might have been had she received help and support earlier in her life. The menopause, she explains, “played havoc” with her ADHD and this put a strain on her relationships. She is still working through guilt and grief. For both Jo and Henry, talking to Packham, then making their films, offer a form of self-expression that they have struggled to find elsewhere.Inside Our Minds comes at a crucial time. One woman interviewed here, at an art workshop in Bristol for women with ADHD, says that her doctor suggested she had been influenced by TikTok fads. BBC-ishly, this documentary says nothing of the far-right, anti-woke rhetoric that has now hitched parts of its rickety wagon to what it calls an overdiagnosis of neurodiversity. Nevertheless, Packham and his team offer a calm and clear refutation of these harmful notions, simply by telling real-life stories, and using the humanising power of artistic expression.Inside Our ADHD Minds aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsChris PackhamTV reviewTelevisionDocumentaryNeurodiversityAutismAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderNeurosciencereviewsShareReuse this content"

Is she in too deep?Graeme VirtueMon 12 May 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 17.02 EDTShareThis article contains spoilers for theThe Last of Usseason two. Please do not read unless you have seen episodes one to five.She may be an impulsive 19-year-old but we know Ellie (Bella Ramsey) isn’t stupid. Her headstrong nature may have something to do with her immunity to the cordyceps infection that has ravaged the world for more than two decades, but she could still have been shot or drowned or mortally wounded in countless other ways. Even if she has not been a particularly good student – “Non-school-oriented,” is how the diplomatic Dina (Isabela Merced) puts it – she has been smart enough to navigate the brutal realities of the post-apocalypse.So perhaps it should not be a surprise that Ellie has worked out the secret that the rest of us have been carrying sincethe season one finale. Five years ago, her surrogate father Joel (Pedro Pascal) would not simply abandon her to die even if it meant the possibility of creating a cure, so he gunned down 18 soldiers and a doctor – Abby’s father – to save her. Then, crucially, he lied to Ellie about it.View image in fullscreen‘Shooting is the last resort’ … Ramsey as Ellie.Photograph: HBOAt the climax of this episode, when the desperate, wheezing Nora (Tati Gabrielle) threw that sharpened truth at her tormentor in the hope of inflicting some reciprocal pain, it simply bounced off. “I know,” replied Ellie. When did she put it together? Why is she still so focused on avenging Joel’s murder at the hands of Abby (Kaitlyn Dever)? Those seem like burning questions for this season to address. But first let’s review how we ended up in that horrible, spore-filled Seattle hospital basement.‘It’s in the air …’Until now, the infected inThe Last of Ushave broadly followed classic zombie rules: you get bitten, you turn into a horrible mushroomy monster. But tonight’s opening scene reveals that the threat has evolved again. A tense debrief between shellshocked troop leader Elise (Hettienne Park) and veteran Washington Liberation Front (WLF) lieutenant Hanrahan (Alanna Ubach) – who we last saw recruiting Isaac (Jeffrey Wright) inepisode four’s opening flashback– confirms that the infection can now be transmitted via airborne spores. The immediate upshot of that knowledge was Elise sealing off the contaminated basement floors of the hospital, abandoning her son and his recon squad members to a horrible fate. No wonder she is chain-smoking hand-rolled cigarettes.Behind enemy linesView image in fullscreenHigh on the hitlist? … Tati Gabrielle as Nora.Photograph: HBOThe blissfully unaware Ellie and Dina have that same hospital in their sights as the last known position of Nora. (As the person who held Ellie down while Joel was being killed by Abby, Nora is presumably near the top of the hitlist.) By monitoring the constant WLF radio chatter, Dina has plotted what she thinks is a safe route to the hospital that avoids various patrols. She also theorises that the WLF are unconcerned about broadcasting their troop movements because their enemies the Seraphites do not use technology. (It still seems like bad operational security.)Advancing through the deserted streets of Seattle, Ellie and Dina see a pile of Seraphite bodies dumped in front of a makeshift shrine to their late prophet, complete with “Feel Her Love” graffiti. Dina opens up about her life in Santa Fe before she and Ellie met in Jackson. She took her first life when she was eight years old after a raider murdered her mother and sister. It’s a disturbing origin story but it clearly informs Dina’s decision to support her new girlfriend in their revenge quest. “I’ll go back if you want; I’ll go on if you want,” she says. They resolve to keep going.Jesse to the rescueView image in fullscreenNon-tech threats … Laine MacNeil as a Seraphite.Photograph: HBOThat soon seems like a terrible decision. During Ellie and Dina’s nocturnal attempt to sneak through an abandoned building they stumble on a pack of stalkers, that particular strain of infected smart enough to flank their target. Having just discussed the importance of stealth and how “shooting is a last resort” the pair are firing wildly and about to be torn apart by shrieking infected when an unexpected saviour appears. Jesse (Young Mazino) has tracked them all the way from Jackson. While his booming shotgun neutralises the infected threat, the trio are rapidly pursued by WLF troops alerted by all the gunplay.They find refuge in a nearby park that the WLF seem very reluctant to enter. That’s because this is Seraphite territory. If Dina and Ellie have alreadypieced together some idea of how the whistling cult operates, Jesse gets a crash course in their love of ritual disembowelment as the three of them watch a Seraphite priest string up a WLF soldier and carve him open with a wicked-looking sickle. They may eschew tech but it turns out the Seraphites are pretty handy with a bow and arrow. When Dina takes a hit to the leg our heroes split up to evade capture, hurriedly agreeing to rendezvous at the theatre later.Going undergroundHaving escaped the park alone, Ellie sees that the hospital is temptingly close, even if she will need to sneak past a vigilant guard dog to infiltrate it. At this point, our viewpoint switches inside to Nora, tending to WLF wounded from what sounds like an escalating war with the Seraphites. When Nora heads to a supply room, Ellie holds her at gunpoint and demands to know where to find Abby.If it initially looks as if Nora is shaken enough to beg for her life and give up her friend, it’s all a feint. She flings some sort of medical solvent at Ellie and makes a run for it. Unfortunately, the only escape route is into a lift shaft leading to a basement level absolutely choked by mulchy cordyceps corruption. Under hellish red emergency lighting, Nora ends up coughing on the floor while Ellie – whose lifelong immunity seems to be holding up even in the face of airborne spores – looms over her.That’s when Nora thinks she’ll score a hit by revealing the truth about Joel’s violence and why Abby was so determined to kill him. But if anything it just seems to harden Ellie’s resolve. She holsters her gun and picks up a nasty-looking pipe to start beating the information she wants out of the already doomed Nora. It seems a deliberately bleak and ugly note on which to end. But there’s a dream-like chaser: a brief, gauzy glimpse of Joel and Ellie in better days. “Hey, kiddo,” he says, and all the ugliness melts away. From hell, to a kind of heaven.Notes and observationsSomething intangible in the air that could infect and kill you horribly? The dread-inducing descent into the hospital’s B2 level felt as if it had some thematic overlap withChernobyl, the previous HBO series from The Last of Us co-showrunner Craig Mazin.Anyone hoping for anotherlovely acoustic singalong from Elliewas disappointed. She barely got through the first few chords ofFuture Days by Pearl Jambefore ditching the guitar and tooling up for revenge instead.Thank goodness shotgun-toting Jesse turned up to save the day. But when he first appeared in deliberately vague silhouette it looked briefly as if Joel had somehow returned to save Ellie again.That’s presumably the last we’ll see of poor Nora, but actor Tati Gabrielle is keeping busy. She plays the bounty hunter lead in upcoming PlayStation 5 adventureIntergalactic: The Heretic Prophetfrom Naughty Dog, the game development studio that created The Last of Us. Perhaps she andThe Mandalorianstar Pedro Pascal exchanged notes on how to play cool sci-fi outlaws hunting down bad guys?What did you think? Has Ellie gone too far? How did it feel to see Joel again, albeit briefly?

For British audiences, The Marching Band might call to mind Brassed Off, The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, movies from the heartland which dared to dream that showbusiness or cultural community adventures can somehow survive the wreckage of industrial capitalism.Benjamin Lavernhe plays Thibaut, a distinguished and sensitive orchestra conductor who collapses mid-rehearsal in Paris and is told he has leukaemia and needs a bone marrow transplant donor. Thibaut is adopted and this means tracking down his biological brother out in the boondocks: factory worker Jimmy, played by the formidable Pierre Lottin (recently seen inFrançois Ozon’s When Autumn Falls), whose gift for deadpan comedy really only gets free rein at the very beginning of the film.Thibaut has the tricky task of asking someone who is a total stranger if he wouldn’t mind donating his bone marrow. But this fraught situation reveals – a little programmatically, perhaps – that Jimmy has a real musical talent, like him, plays trombone in the raucous factory band and nurses a passion for jazz on vinyl. Thibault sees in Jimmy a vision of what his own life could have been without his adoptive mother’s comfortable middle-class background, and sees Jimmy and himself through the lens of class, politics and society, and not the supposed destiny of pure talent.But then Jimmy’s band needs a conductor … well, there are no prizes for guessing what happens next. Director and co-writer Courcol has to manage the plot so that the question of Thibaut’s own emotional life and relationships is more or less forgotten, but the bromance chemistry works well enough and the final concert encore is touching.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His attention, though, is on a bank of equipment, from which he’s attempting to pull sounds that match the interstellar scope of the visuals spread across the gargantuan screen that hangs over him. Across the course of almost threehours, he does so with remarkable regularity.View image in fullscreenCosmic … Steven Wilson at the Bristol Beacon.Photograph: Hajo MüllerAppearing initially in profile, all in black and ensconced in a keyboard array that makes it look like he’s fallen to Earth in a pod, Wilson’s opening move during his first solo tour in seven years is to play his recent concept record, The Overview, in full. Its two vast songs (one 23 minutes, the other 18) are musings on our cosmic insignificance greeted with rapt attention by an audience relishing his return to prog after a run of works that tested his mettle in art-rock and bubbling electronica.Part one, Objects Outlive Us, encompasses mundane stills from English life, pristine melodies and Baroness-worthy sludge as Wilson trades snarling leads with guitarist Randy McStine, who also does a neat line in elegiac solos and metallic experiments. The ensuing title track voyages through flickering synthetic beats and Floydian grandeur as the imagery becomes increasingly transportive. “Better than drugs,” Wilson says at its conclusion, amid a standing ovation.The rest of the evening more obviously resembles a rock show, but Wilson neatly uses musical and thematic threads to tie things in with The Overview. The Harmony Codex, its voiceover describing thousands of cities and trillions of stars, is like ambient cartilage between sets, while King Ghost’s delightful falsetto hook calls back to the early moments of Objects Outlive Us. Opening the encore, Pariah dissolves into time-bending post-rock bliss.If there’s one issue it’s that the all-seater room naturally prevents there being much of a physical exchange of energy between band and crowd. It’s something Wilson notes, not unkindly, at one point and in reality it does render Harmony Korine’s squalling octaves and Vermillioncore’s thunderous riffs somewhat inert. Fittingly, in the cosmic scheme of things tonight, it barely registers as a complaint.Touring until 25 NovemberExplore more on these topicsMusiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

In this no-frills concert staging, mezzo-sopranosBeth Taylor(Cornelia) andPaula Murrihy(Sesto, a trouser role) faced each other, barely projecting, their vocal lines – locked in sighing parallel thirds – ringing absolutely true.It was one of the powerfully intense moments in a performance that ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous. Also sublime: countertenorChristophe Dumaux’s lucid, liquid ornamentation as Caesar admits he has fallen for “Lydia” (Cleopatra in disguise), entering competitive musical dialogue with a solo violin and shrugging at a flurry of musical leaps he was never going to imitate. Or his extraordinary control of a single unaccompanied sustained note at the start of his heartfelt aria in the final act, shaping an achingly slow crescendo and decrescendo in a way that was little short of bewitching. OrJohn Holiday’s compelling turn as Cleopatra’s brother Ptolemy, his countertenor flexible, his ornamentation nimble. Or theEnglish Concertunder artistic directorHarry Bicket– always energetic, always neat, never flamboyant – whose string tone was warm or frozen as the emotional temperature demanded, the horns burnished, the occasional woodwind solos elegantly shaped.View image in fullscreenChristophe Dumaux with Morgan Pearse (Achilles) plus Waitrose bag and all-important bloodied head.Photograph: Mark AllanAt the opposite end of the spectrum was the appearance of Achilles (baritoneMorgan Pearse) carrying a Waitrose bag, from which he produced the plot’s all-important bloodied head to delighted giggles from the auditorium. Later – now mortally wounded – he arranged himself onstage with a grin at the audience. Meanwhile, after Ptolemy’s death, Holiday picked himself up, dusted himself down and hoiked his trousers before walking off. And in the absence of “staging” beyond that plastic bag, an urn and a plastic knife, there was a lot of dramatic walking: striding and shuffling, a few tentative steps and the occasional full-pelt dash.Some of this seemed mannered and self-conscious alongside an unequivocally world-class musical performance. The constant movement on and off stage also gradually began to pall. But one standout turn negotiated the rapid switches between carry-on comedy and searing tragedy with ease.Louise Alder’s Cleopatra treated the stage like a fashion runway, her first aria a heady cocktail of charisma and confidence, crooning and ferocious coloratura. Yet it was her later sincerity that hit home above all: lines sustained with tenderness and poise, her ornamentation exquisitely graceful – all utterly compelling.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Most focus on her flawed inner world, and claim to uncover her “true” self. Edward White’s lively, deeply researched Dianaworld gives us something very different.White, whose previous work includes an acclaimed biography ofAlfred Hitchcock, approaches Diana’s story through the people who saw themselves in her – the doppelgangers, opportunists and superfans who found parallels between the princess’s life of extraordinary privilege and their own. His subjects are the frequently ridiculed devotees who fuel celebrity culture: women rushing for the Diana hairdo; impersonators opening supermarkets; psychics jolted awake the night of the fatal crash. It is, White says, “less a biography of Diana, more the story of a cultural obsession”.He marshals an impressive range of sources – diaries, oral histories, teenage scrapbooks, adverts and comedy skits. There is the woman who, eight months pregnant and living in a homeless hostel, feels a deep bond with the princess also expecting her first child; the sex worker who sees in Diana’s rejection of royal pomp her own disdain for British hypocrisy; the owner of an Ealing boutique specialising in Shalwar Kameez who, after Diana wears one on a trip to India, encourages her customers to “look like a princess”. There are nationalists and internationalists, royalists and republicans, conservatives and progressives, those who pitied, admired, were beguiled or infuriated by Diana. In their stories it is very hard to see where Diana ends and the rest of us begin.Such intense connections to celebrities are easily dismissed as “parasocial relationships”, one-sided, delusional versions of love. But the strength of White’s approach is his desire to take seriously the stories that drew people to Diana and continue to shape her afterlives. There is no single explanation for her enduring appeal – and in fact, any attempt to provide one will seem foolish after White’s book. Instead, he traces what sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild calls the “deep stories” that power our gut reactions.Some of White’s subjects connected with Diana through narratives of the “doomed family”, seeing their own generational histories of trauma in hers. Others, particularly immigrants and gay people, recognised her as a kind of outsider. White demonstrates how some of the most radical images in Diana’s life derived their power from older tropes. Photos of her shaking hands with HIV-positive men certainly challenged the stigma and misinformation surrounding the disease. But they also summoned more ancient ideas: the laying on of royal hands and the religious concept of the “healing touch”. As White’s subjects try to explain why Diana mattered to them, they often find themselves inside these deep stories, repurposing them for the modern age. As White astutely puts it: “Blair once told an interviewer that Diana invented a ‘new way to be British’. It might be more accurate to say that through Diana, the British invented a new way of fantasising about themselves.”Above all, what Diana offered was a new way for British people to imagine the place of emotion in public life. Again and again, White’s subjects tell us that what drew them to Diana was her messy but apparently authentic expression of emotion, the way she challenged British reserve. The historian Thomas Dixon argues that the stiff upper lip was only a brief, 20th-century anomaly in the emotional history of Britain, where sobbing in the streets has been far more common than not. Yet, by the 1980s and 90s, Britain seems to have felt like a place where a reservoir of long-repressed sentiment was ready to overflow.Right from the start, people were fascinated by Diana’s feelings. First it was her tears, her blushes, her bitten fingernails, her self-conscious head tilt. Later, it was her weight loss, reckless outbursts, and her penchant for what Julie Burchill called “damp, self-dramatising American therapy-speak”. Finally came the endless cruel speculation about her mental state and accusations of borderline personality disorder and paranoia. Her seemingly excessive or apparently unwanted emotions resonated with people struggling to express their own in a world only too eager for them to quietly conform. Though, as White observes, Diana’s pain was also an essential tool in neutralising potential resentment towards her gilded life: “Poor Di, so human, so lovable,” as one man put it.As have others before him, White sees this emotionality as a watershed moment, when Britain was forced to reckon with the new self-actualisation culture that had been gathering momentum for some time on the other side of the Atlantic. “Arguably of greater social significance than her embrace of any specific cause – homelessness, domestic abuse, addiction, mental illness, Aids – was the emotional tenor in which she approached them,” writes White. As bouquets mounted up outside Kensington palace after Diana’s death, some grieved, while others found the public spectacle coercive, seeing it as synthetic as the plastic wrapping on all those flowers. Today, with far more terrifying spectacles of public emotion to contend with, worrying about the authenticity of mass grief seems quaint.This book is an ingenious solution to the problem of biography in an age of global celebrity, where identity seems much less stable, a jumble of ever-changing projections and imaginings. It is hard to know what White himself makes of the continuing obsession with his subject. Dianaworld is a kaleidoscopic place, stuffed full with contradictory perspectives. But perhaps that is appropriate for a life that ultimately seemed so mercurial and slippery, so un-pin-down-able. As one visitor to Althorp comments at the end of a rather lacklustre tour of Diana’s childhood home, “Is there nothing else Diana?Is that it?”Dianaworld by Edward White (Penguin Books Ltd, £25).

In Find Me, they alternate in the quick gasps and strings of melody carried by the movement from couplet to couplet, in the pauses created by punctuation and line-ending, and in the embedded gems of the rhyme-scheme (“sunrise”//”skies”//”cries”// “sighs”// “butterflies”// “high-rise”// “lies”).The many “forsaken cities of grief” the poem inhabits belong both to present and historical time. Shifts of perspective in the scenes we’re shown mirror processes of devastation and tentative renewal. In the first stanza, we begin by looking down into “a child refugee’s orphaned eyes”, then focus upwards and outwards to “the daily promise of sunrise”. The “voices” in stanza five are “rising from shallow graves” and, between the penultimate stanza and the last, our gaze travels down from the “cracks of abandoned high-rise”, where seed-like souls cling to survival, towards “the bones of exiles” where hidden stories are still to be found.Stanza one establishes the emotional movement between low and high, grief and hope, and the contrast essential to the repetition-centred vitality of Acharya’s chosen form,the ghazal. A mystery too begins to be felt – the identity of the voice that utters theradif– “find me”. In the first line it emanates from the unspeaking, desolate gaze of the parentless child. In the second, however, the speaker may be invisible, or hidden in the elliptical sentence structure. “In the daily promise of sunrise, find me.”In stanza two there’s clearly a specific voice: the italicised plea, “Findme”, is that of the gaunt old woman who, as “a bag of bones” is herself beginning to resemble the rubble in which she has long been trapped. The phrase “bag of bones” is a colloquial, familiar one, but it’s a visually effective choice here. The starving woman is rescued by soldiers: less fortunate are the “women and children” who “disappear without a trace”. It seems their cries are returning with their un-reclaimable bodies to sand or soil. A focus on female protagonists here might suggest a feminist emphasis in the poem, but the breadth of compassion infusing the poems of Dear Life suggests that the “women and children” and “old woman” in Find Me are figures that merge in a form of synecdoche, embracing all innocent victims of disaster, war and exile.Stanza four becomes a small, unpeopled tone poem, in which only the wind speaks. In the fifth, souls take on their traditional form, freshly enlivened as “a flutter of butterflies”. The winged “seeds” give them a biological force beyond the mythical. From seeds, the poem turns to “stories” – which, like poems, contain the power to unfurl and reveal identities, even if the “bones of exiles” are seemingly “forgotten in the annals of history’s lies”. The bones themselves refuse their silence in this powerful, defiant conclusion.The ghazal is traditionally a love poem, and one of the form’s requirements is the final disclosure of the writer-lover’s identity. Acharya rejects the convention and sustains the mystery she has so enticingly created. I am happy simply to hear the voice, a haunting insistent voice, changing its identity as the poem unfolds. At the same time, my imagination is drawn in the direction of the book’s guiding principle, the intense conviction of life’s “dearness” and fundamental value. Acharya’s religion, influenced by Hinduism, is not one of dogma, nor even continuous certainty, but I feel we are close to hearing it speak in Find Me, with a voice demanding expression through enacted love. It asks to be found in all the stanzas of this poem, and throughout the pages of the collection.Shanta Acharya was born in Cuttack, Odisha, India. She came to England initially to study for her doctorate at Oxford University.Dear Lifeis dedicated to her brother, Susanta Acharya, who died in May 2024.

Juliette has three layers of tinfoil wrapped around her limbs and a tinfoil cone hat plonked on her head before she clocks that she’s fallen for a prank. It’s a pleasing bit of sibling slapstick in Slags, the new novel from Emma Jane Unsworth about desire, dissatisfaction and the ferocious loyalty of sisters. And sisterhood, as Unsworth writes it here, is an unbreakable connection for which no prank antenna is needed.When Sarah takes Juliette on a Highland road trip for her birthday they find themselves revealing secrets and reckoning with their younger selves. Candid and comic, Slags is Thelma & Louise with a campervan and without a clifftop. There are shades of Fleabag, too, in the fractious sisters, the sexual escapades of one countered by the suburban righteousness of the other.The novel focuses on Sarah, with chapters alternating between her teenage self, obsessing over a teacher in a desperately pining first-person confessional, and the adult woman, who puzzles over the percolations of midlife desire (narrated by an older, omniscient authorial voice). The present-day Sarah is single, sardonic, bored with sobriety. She lives in London, where no one seems to party any more and “everyone was thinking about their gut health, or their crochet, or the state of the economy”.It's an undeniably fun read, the levity often lifted by an underlying sense of sympathy, affection and tendernessJuliette, by contrast, is married with children, and lives in Manchester. Her husband, Johnnie, is into ice plunges andAndrew Hubermanpodcasts. Unsworth is especially merciless in her portrait of a particular kind of modern masculinity, captured here in all its absurdity. “Longevity seemed pointless,” Sarah reflects, “when you were as tedious as Johnnie.” Johnnie doesn’t have much of a role in the novel, but it’s often through the minor characters, those merely glanced at in the rear-view mirror, that Unsworth demonstrates the sharpness of her perceptions.Deanna, Sarah and Juliette’s mother, for instance, only periodically swings into view. She is a fleeting memory of neglect – abandoning her young daughters on a broken-down train, stumbling into a party humiliatingly drunk – but Unsworth allows her to cast a long shadow. Later, Sarah reflects more forgivingly on her mother’s abortive efforts to escape suburban life and “the stocks of domesticity”. Suburbia, in general, is efficiently demolished here, reduced to “bin wars, magnolia tree one-upmanship, brick drives, chest freezers, double garages, weedkiller, Chicken Tonight in Le Creuset, Laura Ashley in perpetuity.”Sarah wants none of it, but her job and her life in the city also leave her empty. Unsworth describes how “late at night, after video calls with the East Coast of America, she often stayed on as a host, alone, in those abandoned Zoom rooms, her own face staring back at her, the glow of the ring-light ashyggeas any wood-burning stove, sipping a glass of something moderately alcoholic, feeling a dystopian peace …” It’s not quite loneliness, more a beautiful desolation. “I don’t want to sort my life out,” she tells Juliette during a heated drunken argument. When Juliette protests “But you feel bad”, she replies: “Only sometimes …”One of Sarah’s distinguishing qualities is this lack of clarity about what it is that she desires. She belongs, as she explains, to gen X, that “lost generation”, too young to be old, too old to be millennial, sexually liberated and yet still searching for something. WhereUnsworth captured the erratic hedonism of twentysomethings in her 2014 novelAnimalsand the online dysfunctions of thirtysomethings in 2020’sAdults, here she plumbs the muddles of midlife. Sarah is a rare female character: she’s not a mother, but neither is she full of fraught questions about fertility or menopause. She is, instead, frank about “getting her rocks off” and the difficulty of how to do that without the aid of drink or drugs.How to contend with sexual desire is a question for the 15-year-old Sarah, too. She shrugs off unhappy sexual encounters, including an experience of indecent exposure, with a swaggering bravado. How that shapes the adult Sarah’s attitude to sex is not straightforward, and there’s an intelligence in Unsworth’s refusal to present clear cause and effect. Comedy, rather than tragedy, is the response she most often prefers. Perhaps this is symptomatic of the Fleabagification of women’s stories – where farce somehow feels more truthful than straight-up trauma. Is comedy a deflection or a pragmatic approach to getting on with things in a world of misunderstanding and confusion? Certainly, Slags culminates in a confrontation that is more chaotic than climactic. But this is an undeniably fun read, the levity often lifted by an underlying sense of sympathy, affection and tenderness. Unsworth is riotous, rewarding company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Graffitied in the shadows of the steelworks, “Season’s Greetings” appeared to festively depict a child with their tongue outstretched, catching snowflakes. Seen from a different perspective it was revealed to be falling ash.Written by Tracy Harris and Paul Jenkins (who also directs) and edited from more than 150 hours of interviews with those whose lives were affected by Banksy’s intervention, Port Talbot Gotta Banksy is a verbatim account of what happened next: the welcome and unwelcome attention, political inertia compounded by austerity, and how working-class communities are always subject to the whims of global market forces, be those of steel or the art world.Designed by Cai Dyfan and with a strikingly effective lighting design by Cara Hood, it is sensitively staged and performed by a superb ensemble of six, with Jalisa Phoenix-Roberts particularly affecting. As the text is delivered while the performers listen to the original interviews through earpieces – put on at the performance’s beginning, touchingly removed towards the end – the technique’s precision speaks to the care with which the production regards its interviewees. Throughout, this feels like an important theatrical corrective, giving voice to those who are so often sidelined.But what the verbatim text gains in authenticity also exposes the constraints of the form. Narrative momentum is mostly driven by prerecorded journalistic reports, and episodic scenes of descriptive direct address often hint at potentially richer dramatic currents; the subtext in a pregnant pause, the wife and mother with a vodka bottle in her dressing gown who has buried a husband and son, the barely suppressed urgency with which an unemployed steelworker offers his phone number.One feels that there are other compelling stories here that deserve to be told, without needing to be refracted through a single artwork. But in its most stirring moments, this is a heartfelt celebration of a community’s resilience and agency, attested to in a triumphant closing montage of the street art that has sprouted in Port Talbot in the intervening years.At The Plaza, Port Talbot 15-17 May; then touring Milford Haven, Swansea and WrexhamExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreBanksyWalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The question permeates writer and performer Eleanor Hill’s show, a tour through personal crises, mediated by the compulsion to broadcast it all online.Hill livestreamed her very real breakdown on Instagram in 2020, when she was struggling to access mental health support during the Covid pandemic. She turned that experience into video monologues, whichbecame a 2023 Edinburgh fringe show. This expanded version, pertinently re-branded as Overshare, tells us “90% of these stories are real”.View image in fullscreen‘Eyes are drawn to her digital presence’ … Eleanor Hill in Overshare.Photograph: Joe TwiggThat initial breakdown is replicated here. While Constance Villemot’s set portrays a bedroom in chaos, Hill clings to her phone throughout, and footage from her front-facing camera appears to us, supersized, as we become part of her live stream’s audience.The effect is interesting. It’s sometimes difficult to see Hill – instead eyes are drawn to her digital presence, sound slightly out-of-sync, creating a distance. It’s one her persona feels too: “If I could see you, I would not share this much.” Pop-up memes and clips from Hill’s real Instagram account create a busy backdrop.We hop between different live streams, piecing together Hill’s story – the loss of her mum, life with her greengrocer dad, low moods and an increasingly toxic relationship with older man Mark. The show succeeds in showing the repetitive, unglamorous slog of psychological survival: every day as a new start, finding something positive to see you through the night. There’s humour too, particularly in scenes about stalking Mark online and using her live streams to catch his attention.Overshare poses intriguing questions about both online life and autobiographical theatre, but the interrogation is frustratingly ambivalent. What led her to livestreaming? Did it help or hinder her mental state? Who was watching? There are shades of Netflix drama You, as Hill turns the camera on the theatre audience and asks why we want to consume her pain. “My life isn’t a movie,” she reminds us. “I’m a real person.” Being invited to pass judgment on a show like this is an interesting provocation.AtGreenwich Theatre, London, until 25 MayIn the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

As he heads for Britain, founder Bobby Weir talks Vegas spectaculars, bootleggers and life after Jerry GarciaHarry SwordMon 12 May 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘We didn’t want to be the cops,” says Bobby Weir, guitarist and founder member of theGrateful Dead, laughing as he describes his band’s legendarily lax attitude to people taping their concerts. Bootleggers were given their own area at gigs on the proviso their tapes were traded, not sold – an illustration of the band’s generosity of spirit. “It was an easy decision to make,” Weir says.Decisions like those have ensured that, decades before today’s obsessional Swifties and K-pop stans, the Dead have cultivated one of music’s most passionate fandoms. They are surely the world’s best-documented band. This year, they’re marking their 60th anniversary with a 60-CD box set, just one of many gargantuan packages over the years. Their 2024 Friend of the Devils box set only covered a single month of live music (April 1978) yet it stretched to 19 CDs.To really get what we’re doing, what we’re up to, you’ve got to be there at a gig“When we first got started,” says Weir, “it quickly became apparent that the business of music was pretty much populated by people who were only a notch above – or maybe notevena notch above – the level of professional wrestling. The business was really tawdry. And so we went about things in our own way.”The Dead have duly operated largely outside the mainstream: not so much a band as a fiercely independent travelling circus that could comfortably sell out 100,000-capacity stadiums, while only ever having had one single grace the US Top 40 (Touch of Grey in 1987). While the original lineup ended in 1995, with the death of bandleader Jerry Garcia, a plethora of Dead-related projects have spiralled out ever since.View image in fullscreen‘What are the storytelling possibilities?’ … from left, Bill Kreutzmann, Ron Pigpen McKernan, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart and Phil Lesh,Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/AlamyIn June, Weir’s band Wolf Bros will play the Royal Albert Hall in London, alongside a full orchestra. Meanwhile, the wildly successful spin-off band Dead & Company has just finished a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere, the immense dome that dominates the strip skyline. Formed in 2015, the lineup includes 77-year-old Weir on guitar and vocals, with original drummer Mickey Hart and various guests. Dead & Company are big business: their 2023 tour grossed $115m, not far behind Metallica, Depeche Mode and Coldplay.The Vegas show featured a mind-bending AV element. “For us,” says Weir, “it’s a matter of what are the storytelling possibilities on stage?” He adds that in the 1960s, “we’d do liquid light shows. It’s a part of what we do, always has been.”Emerging from the San Francisco Bay Area’s countercultural maelstrom in 1965, the Dead gained a reputation for hypnotic, freewheeling, improvised jam sessions. No two gigs were ever the same. Psychedelic in their sheer unrelenting scope, yet grounded in a rootsy, bluesy Americana, theirs was music you couldmoveto. It was the time ofKen Kesey’s Acid Tests– LSD advocacy parties with a rotating lineup of acts at the author’s farm at La Honda, California. These provided a natural setting, though today Weir is surprisingly loth to attribute too much importance to chemical influence.View image in fullscreenDead & Company live at the Las Vegas SpherePhotograph: Anna Lee/Anna Lee Media“I don’t think drugs had all that much to do with our development, actually,” he says. “I was in and out of that scene. But after a year or so of taking LSD, I felt it just wasn’t bringing me much in the way of clarity or new direction. So I stepped out of it. Some of the guys smoked pot for decades but I don’t think you’d find – certainly with what’s going on in Dead & Company – that there’s much in the way of drug use. We’ve really been there and done that.”As the Dead’s popularity grew, a significant number of their fans – known as the Deadheads – began dedicating their entire existence to the band, planning their lives around tours, where they would set up food stalls or sell clothes to support a full-time nomadic lifestyle.John Kilbride, author of The Golden Road: The Recorded History of the Grateful Dead, recalls “going down the Barras market in Glasgow in the early 80s and getting a load of live cassettes, and just being completely spun around by the sound. Even some of the more underground bands in the UK were nowhere near as radical from a business perspective, encouraging fans to tape shows and so on. Not even Hawkwind did that!”It didn’t stop at taping: the Dead set up publishing companies and record labels, booked their own gigs and tried to keep everything DIY. The back cover of 1971’s Skull and Roses live album bore the promise: “Tell us who you are … we’ll keep you informed.” By the 1980s, the Dead boasted a mailing list of over half a million fans, and were also frequently handling their own ticket distribution – no mean feat when it came to stadium shows.The full Dead experience was, to many fans’ ears, never captured on a studio recording. “I mean, we gotsomeof it down,” says Weir. “American Beauty and Workingman’s Dead fell together pretty well. But I won’t say they reached some of the loftier moments that we got to on stage. In order to really get what we’re doing, and what we’re up to, you’ve got to be there.”Weir uses the extremely Dead-coded phrase “gestalt linkage” to describe the quasi-telepathic feeling that has resulted from more than half a century of playing. “That’s what we bring to the table,” he says, “although it’s not all that unusual: a good jazz band will have that going. We’ve learned to trust each other. That makes a big difference.” The linkage wasn’t even broken by Garcia’s death, aged 53. “The feeling that we had to carry it on was immediate,” says Weir. “Jerry wouldn’t have had it any other way. It was a major blow to us for sure, but there was no fighting it, so on we went.”View image in fullscreenWeir and his band.Photograph: Todd MichalekBut how have they kept such passionate fans onside for six decades? Sam Bedford, co-founder of Brighton record label None More Records, is one, and he emphasises a lack of polish and predictability. “They were different toeveryoneelse,” he says, “and yet they couldn’t find stadiums that were big enough.” He marvels at how they’d play “10 minutes of feedback during the 60s, or in the 80s, doing 20-minute ambient interludes. It’s incredible that they were playing to 90,000 people and there’s an ambient interlude in the middle. I love all that stuff!”I wonder if there are tensions between the countercultural, DIY, rootsy aspects of the band, and a project such as the Las Vegas Sphere residency. “The Dead have always been a broad church,” Kilbride argues. “There’s people who want to go to a big slick show and spend hundreds of dollars on merchandise, but they had that element in the 70s, too. The well-heeled fans who would jump on a plane to shows and stay in the same hotels as the band – that’s always been there. So have the people who’ve spent hundreds of miles on the road and make a living selling T-shirts. It works on every level and there’s space for both.”Part of the ongoing attraction is that, even today, the band don’t just trot out a steady setlist of classics. Kilbride has just bought a ticket to see Weir and Wolf Bros at the Royal Albert Hall in June. Even as a diehard fan, he says: “I have no idea what to expect.”The London gig will feature two sets: Dead classics and music from Weir’s solo repertoire, all with the orchestra. “We’ve been hearing enormous philharmonic renditions of what we do all along,” says Weir. “That’s what’s been going on in our heads – it’s been great to be able to flesh that out.”Bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024and it’s not clear how long the Grateful Dead’s legacy can last after they stop playing shows, without a definitive run of studio albums. But Weir says that isn’t really the point of the band: “We initially learned to play from a place of profound disorientation and fun – where wedidn’thave much legacy to draw from, when we were playing at the Acid Tests and that stuff. Every time we pick up our instruments, it’s a new situation.”Bobby Weir & Wolf Bros play the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 21 JuneExplore more on these topicsGrateful DeadPop and rockPsychedeliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over the past 30 years, he has become almost as famous as the game itself. The escapades surrounding his deal to buy its distribution rights from Russian agency Elektronorgtechnica (Elorg) were dramatised inan Apple TV+ filmstarring Taron Egerton. “I suggested that Johnny Depp or Keanu Reeves should play me, but apparently they were way too old,” Rogers says.Tetris review – rise of 80s game makes for mostly entertaining dramaRead moreThe casting wasn’t his only concern when he read the screenplay. “It was terrifying. I didn’t know anything about how a script becomes a movie. I thought: ‘This is a crap movie … a car chase?! There is so much bullshit in there!’”View image in fullscreenTrance-inducing … Tetris on the Nintendo Game Boy.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianStill, it can’t have been more terrifying than the KGB interrogation awaiting Rogers when he made that fateful trip to Russia in 1988. Tetris may now be one of the most successful video games in history, with more than 520m sales, yet it was conceived by Alexey Pajitnov while he was working on artificial intelligence and automatic speech recognition at the state-owned computing centre of the Academy of Sciences in the Soviet Union – and he certainly wasn’t supposed to be coding puzzle games. Those trance-inducing tetrominos were almost sealed away behind the iron curtain, the exclusive property of the Soviet regime.Alexey had never met a game designer before … there were no game designers in the Soviet UnionThankfully, however, a complex series of shaky international rights deals involving several companies, including Robert Maxwell’s Mirrorsoft, finally culminated in the Japan-dwelling Dutchman Rogers snapping up the Japanese computer rights, and then hopping on a plane to Russia hoping to secure a similar deal for handhelds. After he arrived in Moscow on a tourist visa, the KGB watched Rogers’ every move. Sneakily – and very much illegally – he managed to gain entry into Elorg, the state-owned company with a monopoly on all Soviet-made computer software. As he came face to face with the reclusive coder behind this mesmerising game, Rogers swiftly discovered he’d been duped. The Tetris rights Rogers “owned” had been sold without Russian knowledge – and the Soviets weren’t too pleased.“I was in a room with seven people, some of them KGB types, being given the third degree for a couple of hours, like: ‘Who the hell are you coming into the Soviet Union?!’” says Rogers. It was there that he first met Pajitnov. “Alexey was suspicious of me at first, because he’d met other people who had come sniffing for Tetris’s rights. He always felt that they were just slimy capitalists looking to make a dollar.” The film’s retelling of this encounter feels surprisingly faithful, with the tense interrogation scene and resulting paranoia of KGB surveillance matching Rogers’ own descriptions.“When he figured out I was a game designer, Alexey’s demeanour changed completely,” recalls Rogers. “Alexey had never met a game designer before … Therewereno game designers in the Soviet Union, because there was no game business in the Soviet Union. You had your job, and games would be something that you did on the side.”View image in fullscreenPajitnov in 1989.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex FeaturesIntrigued to meet a fellow nerd, Alexey quietly asked Rogers to find him after the meeting. With the KGB watching their every move, and millions of dollars on the line, Rogers was aware of the danger that they both faced. “As a foreigner, I had to be careful. So I waited downstairs by the door and escorted him to my room in the middle of the night, quietly showing him my version of Tetris.”Rogers and Pajitnov have been friends ever since, and once the Soviet Union was dissolved and Elorg’s stake sold, they formed the Tetris Company together in 1996. Up to that point, Pajitnov had made no money from the game at all.Despite the 2023 film taking some factual liberties (“I cried about things in the movie that never happened, I cried about my daughter singing after I missed her recital – they made that shit up!”), Rogers says that he got a kick out of seeing his story on the big screen. “It premiered at South by Southwest and the audience can be very critical. But they were cheering when I first saw the Game Boy. They were cheering for a device! At the end, we all got to come on stage: Alexey, myself, and Taron. We got the biggest standing ovation from the audience. It felt like I won an Oscar.”However, compelled to share a more grounded retelling of his story, Rogers has just released a book:The Perfect Game: Tetris, from Russia With Love. It’s a fun, if slightly arrogant look at the events that brought the puzzle sensation to the world, littered with endearing, memory-correcting interjections from Pajitnov.View image in fullscreenPajitnov, Rogers and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi at Nintendo HQ in Kyoto, Japan.Photograph: Nintendo Company LimitedWhile the film highlights Rogers’ undeniable charm and business acumen, it buries his contributions as a game developer. While living in Japan in 1983 he founded Bullet-Proof Software and created the influential role-playing game The Black Onyx, which gave the genre the iconic health bar and also introduced RPGs to a Japanese audience. The game’s manual was written by Hisashi Suzuki who would go on to become president of Squaresoft, creator of the Final Fantasy series. The Black Onyx was apparently also a huge influence on legendaryNintendodesigner Shigeru Miyamoto: “Miyamoto credited Black Onyx – thereby crediting me – for teaching him about role playing games,” says Rogers. “He said it was what led to him creating Zelda.”Is it strange though, that Rogers’ story has overshadowed that of Tetris’s creator, Pajitnov? “Alexey and I play very different roles,” replies Rogers. “The role that I’m playing right now, telling the story, he would never play that role. He’s more of an introvert. If you give him a chance, he’ll sit in a room and do mathematical proofs. In terms of connecting Tetris to the world, the world would have to search him out and he would come kicking and screaming.”View image in fullscreen‘We blue-skyed it in the desert’ … Tetris Effect (2019).Photograph: Enhance GamesNew versions of Tetris are released every few years, a recent highlight being 2019’s psychedelic Tetris Effect, which saw the creator of the Dreamcast classic Rez, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, reimagine the game as a transcendental audiovisual experience complete with VR version – a concept dreamed up during a hedonistic weekend at Burning Man. “Gucci – we call him Gucci – is a good friend,” says Rogers. “We went toBurning Mantogether, where we blue-skyed in the desert about what Tetris Effect would be – a Tetris in VR – and he built that product.”While Rogers still enjoys games (“Minecraft really did something outside the box.”), his priorities changed after a near fatal heart attack in 2005. “I’m done with game publishing,” he says. “I know how much work it is and how much money it takes and my heart has to be in it. And now, my heart is in fighting climate change.”Rogers now lives in Hawaii, and over the last 20 years his Blue Planet Foundation has successfully lobbied the island nation to commit to clean energy by 2030. He is slowly convincing neighbouring islands to stop purchasing foreign oil and to invest in sustainable alternatives. If anyone can save the planet, it’s the man who outsmarted the Maxwells, escaped the KGB, and got us all dreaming of little blocks endlessly falling into place.The Perfect Game by Henk Rogers is published by Di AngeloExplore more on these topicsTetrisGamesRetro gamesNintendoPuzzle gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We go behind the scenes at Bottoms, a thrilling new show about the cancanLyndsey WinshipMon 12 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 06.19 EDTShare‘Our chorus line was never going to look like the Moulin Rouge’s,” says Katherina Radeva. And everyone knows whatthatone looks like, don’t they? The high-kicking cancan chorus line with long legs flying up in a blur as women show off their bloomers to the sound of Offenbach’s irresistibly infectious music – a riot of frills, thrills, whoops and garters. Well, that’s certainly one version. But Radeva is talking about Bottoms, a show she has put together with co-director Alister Lownie and their company Two Destination Language. Bottoms takes the cancan as its muse, its creators having discovered that the real story of the dance phenomenon is much more interesting than the tourist-friendly cliche.It turns out that the identikit all-female spectacle that we know so well is the opposite of how the cancan first began in the working-class dancehalls of Paris, where it was a social dance full of spontaneous improvisation – and performed primarily by men. It was only much later that it became a theatrical spectacle for the well-to-do. “What we really latched on to, which we relate to deeply, is this,” says Radeva. “Working-class makeup shit-hot dance. People go, ‘Oh, I really love that. I’ll have it.’ Then they commercialise it and almost take it all away.’”Cancan dancers were the influencers of their day – like the KardashiansBottoms, which opens this week at Tramway in Glasgow, is a theatre show with dancing, courtesy of Radeva and a cast of four fellow performers drawn from dance, theatre and cabaret. What Radeva and Lownie wanted to address was “value, labour and art”: how artists and creativity are valued, and exploited, in a capitalist system. The fascinating history of the cancan provided a rich backdrop for such an exploration, as well as the opportunity to conjure up the wild spirit of the dance’s early performers.View image in fullscreenWild spirit … BottomsThe cancan came from the quadrille, a social dance with set steps performed by four couples, but there would beun galopat the end, with people galloping down the room and starting to improvise, showing off and getting more and more boisterous. The cancan’s predecessor waslechahut, meaning commotion or uproar, a very working-class dance with untramelled energy and a melting pot of influences from French and Spanish colonies: fandango, chica, cachucha. As for the name, there are competing theories: one, that it’s fromcanard, meaning duck, perhaps because practitioners did a waddling movement; another, that it’s fromles cancans, meaning gossip or tittle-tattle.The dance was a form of “expressive resistance” says Clare Parfitt, who is working on a book about the cancan and popular dance across the Atlantic world. This was Paris in the 1820s, when it was under the Bourbon monarchy, “a repressive environment for working-class people, who so often held the flame of revolution, so they had to do a lot of things in secret”.There were policemen around every corner, she says, ready to make arrests for indecency – although there was no definition of what indecency meant. It wasn’t necessarily sexual, just anything that strayed from the norm. As Parfitt puts it: “The white male bourgeois model of the self.” Consequently, the reason we know that the early cancan dancers were men is because of their arrest records. Women start turning up there in the 1840s, says Parfitt.View image in fullscreenRevolutionary … an 1867 illustration showing a Parisian ball.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesWe do have some idea of what the early cancan looked like, though, from bohemian writers and cartoons of the day. There were kicks, yes, but nothing like the ankle-to-ear feats that show up later. The aim was to be the opposite of “upright” and proper, with couples holding their bodies scandalously close to each other, leaning on a diagonal, slouching, or dragging their feet along the floor. Elsewhere, there are reports of “windmilling arms” and the influence of acrobatic dancer Charles-François Mazurier, who could leap up into the air and land in the splits.The cancan, says Parfitt, walked a tightrope between outlandish improvisation and what was legally acceptable. Soon it became well established in the dancing gardens of mid-19th century Paris, from the Grande Chaumière in Montparnasse to the Bal Mabille near the Champs-Élysées. This was still not as a stage show, though. It was still social dancing, with certain featured participants taking to the floor. Women started to become the face of the dance, often working-class women trying to find a way out of poverty. “They use the whole ball culture to hustle,” says Parfitt. “They’re always trying to get lunch bought for them, or dinner, or a few pennies here and there. A sort of courtesan culture emerges and the cancan is involved because those dance forms become their way of marketing, of putting their bodies on display.”Writer David Price details many of these formidable women in 1998’s Cancan! Céleste Mogador (real name Élisabeth-Céleste Vénard) was an early star for whom dance was a way out of sex work. Élise Sergent (AKA La Reine Pomaré – stage names and personas were common) was a woman with a graceful body and a potty mouth, who died of consumption at 22.View image in fullscreen‘The Glutton’ … Louise Weber would down spectators’ drink while dancing.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesThen there was Rigolboche, who danced at Casino Cadet and was described by one writer as “a whirling mass of limbs and lingerie”. Rigolboche claimed to be attacked by a form of madness when she danced. “She was just completely taken over by the vibes,” laughs Radeva. “Intoxicated! And that’s great, that’s what I think dance should do.” Finally, there was Finette (AKA La Bordelaise, AKA Josephine Durwend), a former ballet dancer whose party piece was a kick so high she could knock off a gentleman’s hat. She was one of the first to dance the cancan on a London stage in the 1860s.“They were the influencers of their day, like the Kardashians,” says Lownie. “They were very charismatic,” adds Radeva. “People became infatuated with them, like Toulouse-Lautrec.” One of Toulouse-Lautrec’s favourite people to paint was the dancer Louise Weber, nicknamed La Goulue or The Glutton, since she liked to down spectators’ drinks when she was dancing.La Goulue danced at the Moulin Rouge, marking cancan’s move towards the establishment in the later 19th century. Parfitt talks of an increasing nationalism at that time. “Countries are attempting to differentiate themselves” she says, “and show what modern nations they are. One way is through dance. There was a push inFranceto have a national dance form – and the cancan moves from being this really peripheral form that’s repressed into the absolute centre of French national identity.”When the cancan was performed on stage at the beginning of the 20th century, it started to shift in style and feature a line of dancers addressing the audience. Critics in the 1920s talked about such mass movement echoing mass production, the individual subsumed into the machine. “The complete opposite of what it was before,” says Parfitt. “In the 19th century, it was all about the individual – they all had their signature moves and special nicknames. Now it was all about unison.”The cancan is full of contradictions. It was a dance of freedom, even anarchy. Then it came to fuel both the empowerment of women and the fetishisation of them, before becoming an exacting, athletic feat performed by professionals. It continues to be an instantly recognisable symbol of Paris, but has also spread to some unlikely corners of the world. “There is this amazing community of cancan dancers in the Yukon in Canada,” says Parfitt.View image in fullscreenScandalous … the Bal Tabarin in Montmartre c1900.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveA2023 BBC documentary revealed life backstage at the still-kicking Moulin Rouge, a place of hard graft and megawatt smiles, where donning the showgirl’s jewels and feathers is the pinnacle of many young dancers’ careers. The real star of the show, though, was Janet Pharoah, artistic director and a no-nonsense Yorkshirewoman who sadly died earlier this year.Lownie feels conflicted about how the cancan has ended up. “There is something joyous in seeing skilled people doing something to the highest quality,” he says. “It’s enthralling in its way. But it’s also a highly sexualised setup that’s made for the champagne dinner that goes with it.”Radeva adds: “We’re not criticising that – but we are pulling at the edges.” Radeva – whosesolo piece 40/40brimmed with the joy of the amateur performer lost in the music – is not so interested in mechanical steps or matching angles. She’s more in tune with those early dancers ofle chahut. “The workers left work and went to the pub to throw some shapes,” she says. And the politics was baked into how they danced. “Hopefully some of the joy of Bottoms will be in reclaiming a bit of that, with our different bodies, our different abilities.”How does she feel about the show’s chorus line? “We’re really happy with it!” she says. “We make a motley crew. And I think that’s glorious to watch.”Bottoms is at Tramway, Glasgow, 14-15 May, part of Dance International GlasgowExplore more on these topicsDanceFranceEuropeHistoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The studios’ own promotional posters serve as a template, but Austrian-born Valien, 65, adds a distinctive pop art flourish to each image coupled with the beauty of imperfection – part of the reason he has managed to extend his career well into the 21st century.“Advertising is about drawing attention and I add the human touch, which is why it works,” he said. Valien’s work plays up the image’s essence: the imposing bow of a ship, the haunting eyes of a screen siren, a mysterious smile. He jokingly calls himself aKinosaurier– a play on the German words for cinema and dinosaur.View image in fullscreenGötz Valien with his portrait of Nicole Kidman in Jane Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady (1996).Photograph: Götz ValienHis nearly-7x9-metre canvases long-graced the “film palaces” of the German capital, including the majestic Delphi in the west and the socialist modernist masterpiece Kino International on Karl Marx Allee in the east. But the former’s adverts finally went digital in 2024, while the latter is closed for a years-long, top-to-bottom revamp. Dozens of independent cinemas among his clients have simply gone out of business. The century-old Filmtheater am Friedrichshain (FaF) is the last movie theatre in Berlin still employing Valien to tout its new releases, with his large-format posters covering its facade and interior walls around the ticket-and-popcorn counter.View image in fullscreenValien’s poster for Pedro Almodóvar’s Volver.Photograph: Steffen Rothwww.steffenroth.com/The GuardianGazing up at his rendering of the kohl-eyed, flower-rimmed visage of Penélope Cruz from Pedro Almodóvar’s 2006 melodrama Volver, a classic still hanging in the lobby, Valien sighed: “Isn’t she magnificent?”Beyond vestiges of a proud tradition in countries such as Ghana, Nepal and India, Valien said only a vanishing number of movie theatres worldwide still used hand-painted posters. He knows of only two colleagues in Germany: in Munich and Bremen. “Paris, Portugal – they all say sure, we had them, but those days are over.”The FaF manager, Andreas Tölle, said the posters had become a cherished part of the neighbourhood. “People now come by when the new ones are up and take pictures,” he said. “And that fascination also brings people into the cinema.”Movie posters have existed as long as the nearly 130-year-old film industry. But these days, few releases stay long enough in cinemas to justify bespoke art to advertise them, communications studies professor Patrick Rössler of the University of Erfurt, who has studied the history of film posters, told local media. And most independent cinemas don’t have the profit margins to afford them, even at what Valien calls his bargain-basement prices.View image in fullscreenGötz Valien’s posters outside Filmtheater am Friedrichshain in Berlin.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The GuardianBack at the home studio that he and his wife, Silke, bought decades ago in the heart of the Schöneberg neighbourhood’s historic queer red-light district, Valien recounted his arrival in West Berlin in the 1980s. When the Wall finally fell, he was unimpressed with what he found in the east. “It just seemed sad and colourless, and then one day I realised what was missing – the billboards,” he said.After failing to gain admission to film school – “in my opinion, the avant garde had lost its way – it got too philosophical,” he said – Valien returned to his first love, painting, which he had learned in Vienna using “old master techniques”.View image in fullscreenGötz Valien in his Schöneberg studio.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The GuardianIn the early 1990s, he found work with an advertising firm – one of two Berlin studios producing painted movie billboards. His first poster was for Steven Spielberg’s Hook, and Valien quickly gained a city-wide reputation as he churned out photorealistic posters in just two days, in time for the movies’ releases on Thursdays. “Not to brag, but I was a Ferrari among horse-drawn carriages,” he said of his competition. After the death of two elderly colleagues, Valien found himself the last man standing.In his heyday he could ride down the elegant Kurfürstendamm, once home to dozens of cinemas, and all the film billboards up and down the boulevard were his handiwork. “Now they’re H&Ms, Zara, Tommy Hilfiger …,” he said.View image in fullscreenValien’s artworks were once a common sight on Berlin’s cinemas.Photograph: c/o Götz ValienThe spectacular success of the 1997 blockbuster Titanic nearly broke his business as it stayed in the cinemas for months, blocking new releases in need of fresh posters. Last year, Valien finally had to give up a much larger dedicated studio and an assistant as the orders dwindled. There he had used a mechanical lifting platform to cover the floor-to-ceiling canvases. “Painting almost every day in that huge format is like running up Mount Everest barefoot,” he said. “Exhausting.”Valien estimated he has created more than 3,000 posters over the years using the acrylic paints that lie scattered among the brushes and spray guns around his sunlight-flooded workshop. He declined to say how much he earns per poster, but says his film work is essentially “non-profit” and a “labour of love” while he pursues other art projects.He remains unsentimental about the posters themselves, noting that he used to simply paint over previous works to save money on canvases. FaF has a small archive while Valien maintains anactive Instagram accountshowing himself in ironic, hammy poses in front of his work. In honour of its 100th anniversary and Valien’s decades of service, FaF is running aMovies on Canvas homage seriesof screenings paired with an exhibition of some of his best-loved posters: Walk the Line, Frances Ha, Brokeback Mountain, Little Miss Sunshine and, not least, The Artist.Explore more on these topicsArtGermanyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was no indication of this when I made the purchase.Since then I have been trying to find a resolution with its customer support team and they have saidthe tickets will become transferable nearer the time.However, this is quite impractical since my grandson would need to wait until then to arrange travel from Dundee and book accommodation.I believe Ticketmaster is ignoring my consumer rights and have told them so. It suggested I contact theSociety of Ticket Agents and Retailers, which I did but it rejected my complaint.PC,StonehavenThe ticket-buying process is unrecognisable these days, not least because of themight of Ticketmaster, which is behind about 70% of concert tickets sales globally. In this new world it is usually e-tickets changing hands and it is becoming essential to own a smartphone if you want to buy entrance to an event.You were frustrated to discover it was not possible to transfer the tickets straight away but if paper ones were being issued perhaps they might not have arrived by now either as the festival takes place in late August.These days ticket distribution is far more tightly controlled in large part to make things hard for touts, who were buying up tickets and selling them on. A growing number of promoters for in-demand events issue tickets very late in the day to stop them ending up on resale sites.Consumers can transfer tickets bought on Ticketmaster for most events but some have their own rules and restrictions. For example, the option may not be available if the artist or venue has asked for it to be turned off.For Leeds, the transfer window is determined by the organiser, Festival Republic, not Ticketmaster and has still not opened yet. When it becomes available all ticket holders will be notified via email.Ticketmaster had been in touch to reassure you that it will then be possible to transfer the tickets to your grandson but you remain dissatisfied with the whole experience.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Put the trout fillets in a small, lined baking dish, ideally one small enough to hold them fairly snugly. Mix the peanuts, half the soy sauce and 10g of the honey, stir to dissolve the honey, then pour over the trout, making sure the peanuts are evenly scattered over the top.

I’m concentrating on ideas, rather than recipes as such, because using up the odds and ends from the fridge needs to be part of the flow of your cooking to avoid waste. Everything is quick, easy, involves minimal prep and, crucially, is endlessly open to adaptation.Leftover naan with egg, chilli crisp, chutney and spring onion (pictured top)Prep5 minCook15 minServes11 mediumeggLeftover naanor roti, or frozen paratha cooked from frozen in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes1spring onion and/orfresh herbs– coriander is perfectChutney,such as mango, raita, mint, lime pickleChilli crisp– I like LaoganmaBring a small pan of water to a boil, then add the egg and set a timer for six and a half minutes. (To save time, boil and peel a few eggs, then keep them in a sealed container in the fridge, where they’ll be fine for three days.)Meanwhile, sprinkle a little water over the leftover naan and stick it under the grill for a minute on each side, to wake it up a bit. (If you are using frozen paratha, remove from the packaging and put directly into a large, hot frying pan and cook as per the packet instructions.)Finely slice the spring onion and roughly chop the herbs, if using. Spread some chutney over the naan, then peel and quarter the boiled egg and arrange it on top. Add the spring onion, herbs, if using, and chilli crisp, then roll or fold up and eat over a plate.Leftover greens on toast with cottage cheese, melted chilli jam and toasted seedsView image in fullscreenElly Curshen’s leftover greens on toast with cottage cheese, chilli jam and toasted seeds.Prep5 minCook10 minServes12 tsp olive oil1 small handfulleftover greens(cooked or raw), such as cabbage, green beans, kale, cauliflower leaves, peas and/or broccoli, all roughly chopped2 slicesbread2-4 tbsp cottage cheese, or cream cheese or creme fraiche1 tbsp chilli jelly or jam, or sweet chilli sauceFlaky sea salt2 tsp toasted mixed seeds– toast a whole bag, then store in a jar to have to handHeat the oil in a large frying pan and add the leftover greens. If they are already cooked, just let them heat through and char a bit (avoid the temptation to jiggle them around too much); if they’re raw, stir-fry with a splash of water until tender, then leave to char. You want hot, slightly blistered greens that retain their bite.Meanwhile, toast the bread, then spread it with the cottage cheese. Pile the hot greens on top, then immediately stir the chilli jam into the empty hot pan, add a splash of water and warm through for 30 seconds, until the jam liquefies (if using sweet chilli sauce, skip this step). Spoon the sauce over the greens, finish with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt and some toasted mixed seeds, and serve hot.Olive, red onion and mint salsa with hummus on toastView image in fullscreenElly Curshen’s olive, red onion and mint salsa and hummus on toast.Prep5 minCook10 minServes130g mixed olives, pitted and roughly chopped20g very finely diced red onionA few mint leaves, roughly choppedAsplash of red-wine vinegar(about ½ tsp)A few grinds of black pepper2 slicesbread,such asseeded sourdough,or crackers, or cruditesHummus– you’ll need about 1 tbsp per slice of breadMix the olives, onion and mint in a small bowl, then stir in the vinegar and black pepper, and set aside while you toast the bread.Spread the toast with the hummus, pile the olive salsa on top and eat immediately.Elly Curshenis a food writer based in Bristol.Explore more on these topicsFoodLeftoversSnacksBreadVegetablesCheeseEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

From multiple sclerosis and lupus to type one diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, these conditions all share a common trait: the body’s own immune system turns against itself.Current treatments aim to suppress that response, but dialing down the entire immune system comes at a steep cost: it leaves patients vulnerable to other illnesses and often requires daily, invasive care.A revolution is now afoot, as researchers are developing a new approach that targets only the specific part of the immune system that’s gone rogue. These treatments are known as “inverse vaccines” because they suppress a particular part of the immune system, rather than amplifying it, as existing vaccines do.“This is the holy grail,” says the Northwestern University immunologist Stephen Miller. “We want to use a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer to treat these diseases.”Miller’s2021 paper, published in 2022 in Gastroenterology, was the first to demonstrate that inverse vaccines could be effective in humans. The study looked at celiac disease, in which the immune system attacks the intestinal lining when it detects the presence of gluten, a protein found in wheat and other grains.Over two weeks, 33 celiac patients who were in remission ingested gluten; about half had received the inverse vaccine beforehand, while the other half got a placebo. After two weeks, researchers examined the subjects’ intestinal lining and found that the inverse vaccine group had no damage, while the placebo group showed a noticeable worsening of symptoms.It re-educates the immune system, so then it says: ‘OK, I’m good, I don’t need to attack this, because I see that it’s not a threat’Jeffrey Hubbell, bioengineerThe basic idea of inverse vaccines rests on using certain synthetic nanoparticles attached to particular disease-related proteins – called antigens – as targeted messengers to retrain the immune system. The nanoparticles mimic dying human cells, a normal ongoing process. Although these dying cells are “foreign”, the immune system knows not to attack them. The immune system learns to ignore both the nanoparticles and the attached proteins, and stops attacking the body.“What this does is, it re-educates the immune system,” says NYU bioengineer Jeffrey Hubbell. “So then it says: ‘OK, I’m good, I don’t need to attack this, because I see that it’s not a threat.’”In 2023, Hubbell and his colleaguespublished a peer-reviewed paperin Nature showing that this method could halt the mouse version of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease in which the immune system attacks nerve cells in the brain and body. Over the past eight months, Anokion, the company started by Hubbell and others to commercialize their work, has announced successful early trials in humans in bothceliac diseaseandMS.“There have been more than a few tears of happiness shed by me and my team when we’ve seen the clinical results,” Hubbell says.Pollen is everywhere. But do I have allergies or a cold?Read moreThe discovery that certain negatively charged molecules could retrain the immune system to stop attacking our own tissues was “absolute serendipity”, says the University of Calgary immunologist Pere Santamaria. He was among the first scientists to uncover this. “I would never have guessed it,” he says. “Not even in my wildest dreams.”Santamaria has spent most of his career focusing on type one diabetes, a disease in which the immune system attacks the pancreas cells that produce insulin. Recently though, he has begun exploring inverse vaccines for other autoimmune disorders, including a disease called primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) that affects bile ducts in the liver. One advantage of working on PBC is that because it is rare, clinical trials don’t require nearly as many patients; as a result, the drug approval process can move more quickly. “And once we get approval for one indication, we may be able to go faster with others,” Santamaria says.One of the key advantages of inverse vaccines is their broad versatility; it appears that the approach can work for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. “It works all the time in animals,” says Santamaria. “We’ve tried this in many different animal models of autoimmune disease.” (Of course, success in animal studies doesn’t automatically translate to success in humans.)Last year, Bana Jabri, the director of Institut Imagine in Paris, cowrotea review of inverse vaccine efforts. She is cautiously optimistic about their potential, but also notes that the immune system is immensely complex. Some immune cells, for example, circulate throughout the body, while others reside permanently in specific tissues. Jabri says it’s not yet clear that current inverse immune treatments can affect both kinds of cells.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnother potential advantage: most researchers say that the effect will probably last for months or perhaps longer – similar to the pattern seen for many non-inverse vaccines. “The immune system is incredible,” Hubbell says. “It has a memory, and that memory lasts.” Currently, most treatments for autoimmune disease require more frequent treatment, often a regimen of daily medicine.In addition, inverse vaccines seem to have benefits beyond autoimmunity. They may work for allergies, which also involve an overreaction by the immune system – in this case to a food or environmental trigger rather than one’s own body. In 2022, Miller and his colleague, the University of Michigan biomedical engineer Lonnie Shea, published asmall studywith mice with peanut allergy. The animals who received an inverse vaccine were able to consume significantly more peanuts without symptoms than those who did not get the vaccine.Last month, Hubbell and several colleagues published a paper in Science Translational Medicineshowing that their inverse vaccine could protect allergic mice from house dust mite antigens, a frequent cause of asthma, as well as antigens to chicken egg whites, a common experimental model for allergy. The protection held up through repeated exposures to the allergens over several months.And last year, Shea, the University of Michigan biomedical engineer, published apaperlooking at alpha-gal syndrome, a potentially severe allergy to meat caused by tick bites. Infected mice who were given an inverse vaccine showed significantly fewer symptoms than those who were given a placebo. “We were able to basically convince the immune system that these proteins are not dangerous,” Shea says.I was sufficiently vaccinated against measles in childhood – or so I thoughtRead moreAt this point, it is difficult to say how long it will be before inverse vaccines are approved for human use. Miller, Shea, Hubbell, Santamaria and other researchers are involved in startup biotech companies working to develop them. Some larger pharmaceutical companies are also bullish on the approach, and are partnering with startups.In December, Genentech announced a partnership with Cour, the company started by Miller and Shea, that could beworth up to $900m. Last year, Parvus, the startup founded by Santamaria, entered into acollaboration with the pharmaceutical company AbbVie. Several inverse vaccines are now in the midst of or about to start phase two trials, small studies looking at how effective the treatment is in humans.Some scientists estimate that the first inverse vaccines could be available for use in three to five years. Others are less certain. “I think it will take 10 years to have it nailed down,” Jabri says. “But it could be shorter, or it could be longer.”Even so, nearly all are optimistic. “Twenty years ago, I would have told you this wasn’t possible, absolutely not,” says Miller. “Today, I can say that it will happen. No doubt.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyMedical researchVaccines and immunisationAllergiesDiabetesMultiple sclerosisHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It took nine months to nail it. Now, a decade on, MacColl can pump out 17 of them in a row. It’s hard to argue with her when she says: “You can get stronger with age.”MacColl has since competed three times in the reality TV showAmerican Ninja Warrior. She’s the oldest person to complete an obstacle, and the oldest female ninja athlete, according to Guinness World Records. It was watching her daughter, Jessie Graff, a stuntwoman, compete on the show that made her want to grow stronger herself.“What do I do?” she asked Graff, who told her: “Pull-ups.”As a former professional dancer, MacColl, now 73, had always been fit. But she had been diagnosed with osteopenia, a precursor to osteoporosis, and had never been in a gym before.Graff’s challenge called for a different kind of strength – and a mental shift.“When I grew up, women weren’t encouraged to lift weights,” MacColl says. “It was: ‘You don’t want to get bulky. It’s not feminine …’” Seeing Graff in action, cheering her on, MacColl saw “such strength and grace – and she had muscles! I realised that the things people had always said about muscles were so wrong. It was a disservice to women.”There’s a saying I like: ‘Change the way you look at things, and the things you look at change’A shy child, MacColl was enrolled in dance lessons by her parents, initially to draw her out of her shell. “Movement is a way of talking. It is an expression of what’s inside you,” she says.In fact, she fell so completely in love with dance that, aged 20, she left Tennessee for New York. “The goal was just to dance all day. Everybody said: ‘You’re not going to make it.’” But in 1974, she landed a part in Pippin, a Broadway show with Bob Fosse. “I felt on top of the world,” she says.She branched out into TV commercials during the 70s and 80s, acting as “a housewife and mum, smiling with my product beside me … Folgers coffee, Jordache jeans, Charmin … ”View image in fullscreenOn top of the world … Ginny MacColl.Photograph: Allison Joyce/The GuardianHer off-screen life mirrored those ads. She got married and had two children, even shooting one commercial three days after giving birth.“A golden time,” she says.But “all good things come to an end”, and MacColl got divorced after 13 years of marriage, moving with her two children into the family’s lake house in the Poconos, surrounded by 160 hectares (400 acres) of forest. There she needed a different kind of strength.“It was a magical but very hard place,” she says. “We had blizzards, bats in the house, bears outside. It took a sense of determination: ‘I will make this work.’”Teaching dance alone didn’t pay enough, and nobody wanted to hire her. Eventually, she got a sales job at the local radio station. She kept fit, swam in the lake with her kids and devised improvised obstacle courses in the woods with sticks and string. She told herself that if she ever returned to acting, she would “come back as a granny”.At 62, she retired from her 20-year career in radio sales, having remarried and seen her children through college. Then she got an agent, auditioned for roles and began to swim competitively. She’d seen her parents grow sedentary in their retirement, and wanted something different for herself.To complete that first pull-up, she broke it down into sections, working on each element in turn. But when she debuted on American Ninja Warrior, she fell at the first obstacle. “I was devastated. I felt I’d let down all the seniors in the world.”The biggest obstacle she has overcome in life, MacColl says, is failure itself. She felt like a failure at school, when she and her classmates were lined up in order of their IQ scores, and also when her first marriage ended. Now here it was again.A new start after 60: I was never a great swimmer – but I took up diving and now somersault into the poolRead more“It took me a while to get over that,” she says. “There’s a saying I like to tell myself: ‘Change the way you look at things, and the things you look at change.’ So I try to look at failure as a motivator. Iwillget this. Social media was my way of getting out of the doldrums. I started posting some of the things I could do.”She has more than 130,000 followers on Instagram, and over the past six years has landed parts in films including Poms (with Diane Keaton) and You’re Cordially Invited (with Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon). She has just filmed her next appearance on American Ninja Warrior. In the process of all this, she has reversed her osteopenia.MacColl believes she can continue to get stronger into her 80s and 90s. “Muscle is the organ of longevity,” she says.Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When conditions are right, snorkelling in British waters brings a connection with a variety of species and stunning terrain: sea lochs, sheltered bays, shipwrecks, tidal pools, kelp forests, sandy seabeds and rocky reefs. You might see sharks, seals, scorpionfish, octopus and cuttlefish. These are our 10 favourite spots.Treyarnon tidal pool, CornwallView image in fullscreenThe pool is particularly good for kids to wade in and discover submerged wonders.Treyarnon, near Padstow, is a great place to combine a family day at the beach with a spot of rockpooling or snorkelling. The tidal pool here is large enough to snorkel around, but shallow enough that even the most wary can wade in confidently, don a mask or goggles, and peek at the wonders below the water’s surface. Particularly good for introducing kids to the underwater world, the pool is mostly natural, with a small concrete barrage complementing its otherwise watertight rocky walls. The beach can get very busy in the summer, but that popularity has its benefits – an ice-cream van is often parked at the top of the beach for post-snorkelling refreshments.Chesil Cove, DorsetView image in fullscreenWonderfully prehistoric-looking john dory may be found at the far south of the cove.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyAn 18-mile (29km) shingle tombolo formed by the accumulation of pebbles over 7,000 years, Chesil Beach is significantly exposed to stormy weather from the south and west. At its southernmost end is Chesil Cove. As with the rest of the coastline here, the cove’s exposed aspect results in variable visibility, oscillating between nil and fabulous depending on the weather. Pick the right day, however, and it’s a perfect place to snorkel. The best area to explore is at the far south of the cove, where uniform small pebbles give way to larger rocks and boulders covered in kelp and other seaweeds. Here, you’ll find sand eels, wrasse, bass and, on occasion, wonderfully prehistoric-looking john dory. Cephalopods such as cuttlefish and their less commonly seen cousins, squid and octopus, are also occasional visitors to the area; keep your eyes peeled for these masters of disguise.Eastbourne pier, East SussexView image in fullscreenEastbourne pier’s pilings make the ideal home for molluscs, which, in turn, attract starfish and crabs.Photograph: Fadi Al-barghouthy/AlamyOriginally built in the late 19th century, and restored after afire in 2014, Eastbourne pier makes a pleasant focal point for a snorkel in calm weather. Shingle beaches along this stretch of the southeast coastline are relatively inhospitable: the churning action of the waves gives marine life little chance to establish itself on the pebbles. However, the pier pilings provide a more stable footing and are covered with barnacle-encrusted common mussels and patches of sea lettuce. In turn, the mussels attract predators such as starfish, crabs and dog whelks. The regular presence of fishers on the pier suggests this site also attracts its fair share of fish – so watch out for those lines! You may catch a fleeting glimpse of sand eels which, in turn, draw in larger fish such as bass. Swimming around the pier at sunset is an atmospheric way to end the day.Boggle Hole, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenThe shoreline’s exposed rock ledges provide a fantastic habitat for crabs.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyGeology and strong currents (particularly at high tide) mean snorkelling opportunities are few and far between on this stretch of coastline but, in calm conditions, after a spell of settled weather, Boggle Hole is an excellent spot. There is so much life to see, even in the shallows. The shoreline is laced with ledges of exposed rock that provide a fantastic habitat for smaller marine life such as blennies, gobies and smaller crabs. Larger boulders, meanwhile, are covered with a patchwork of molluscs, clinging on against the ebb and flow of the tides, plus vivid patches of purple algae, and shoals of small fry dart among the seaweed. When we visited this site in August, hundreds of hermit crabs were also present, some snoozing, some tussling over shells, and some just taking a walk along the seafloor.Charlie’s Garden, NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenCollywell Bay’s distinctive sandstone sea stack is excellent for spotting bottom-dwellers.Photograph: Wirestock/AlamyCharlie’s Garden is a distinctive sandstone sea stack sitting on the tidal foreshore of Collywell Bay. Local lore has it that the rock is named after one Charles Dockwray, who cultivated a garden on the rock in the mid-19th century, when it was still part of the mainland. A fabulous place for rockpooling at lower tides, the rock now forms a permanent feature of the bay, which is broad and shallow, with a rock and sand seabed that’s home to seaweeds of all types as well as barnacles, limpets, gobies, blennies and other bottom-dwelling species. Seals are also known to visit the bay – a wonderful sight if they choose to swim nearby. As with much of this coastline, water visibility can take some time to clear after storms, but in sunny, settled conditions it’s a wonderful place to experience east-coast marine life.Scottish Seabird Centre, East LothianView image in fullscreenThe tidal pool is home to hermit crabs, limpets, barnacles, snails, seaweeds and the odd anemone.Photograph: Emma and Gordon TaylorThiscentre, in North Berwick, is a great place to get your fill of nature, both above and below the waves. Looking out towards Bass Rock, home to the 100,000 birds that make up the largest northern gannet colony in the world, the centre is a conservation and education charity that also operates as a visitor attraction, and organises nature-based sightseeing trips. It’s also a brilliant spot for snorkellers. For beginners and younger marine explorers, the neighbouring tidal pool – home to hermit crabs, limpets, barnacles, snails, seaweeds and the odd anemone – is a great place to start. More experienced snorkellers can head to the rocky gullies of the headland. Here, barnacled rocks decorated with kelp gently descend to a sandy seabed, providing habitat for crabs and small fish species.High Shore Beach, AberdeenshireView image in fullscreenThe rocky fingers projecting into the sea at Macduff harbour form reefs where starfish lurk.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyA great day out for marine life enthusiasts, the town of Macduff is home to both a recently refurbished aquarium and High Shore Beach. Like some of the other locations in this list (the Scottish Seabird Centre and Gruinard Bay), High Shore features in one of theScottish Wildlife Trust’s snorkel trails. Visit theMacduff Marine Aquariumto gen up on the underwater habitats of the Moray Firth and learn what to look out for, then hit the water to explore for yourself. Directly in front of the aquarium is a line of rocky fingers projecting into the sea. These form a series of parallel reefs and a maze of kelp-filled gullies packed with life. As you peer into cracks in the rocks, watch for the red eyes of a velvet swimming crab, or a starfish slowly walking over the reef or seabed – orangey-pink common starfish, knobbly white spiny starfish and common sunstar have all been spotted here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the lowest of tides, the beaches at Gruinard are joined, but the incoming waterline soon makes it impossible to move between them without getting wet. The best snorkelling is at the northernmost end of the beach, around a small islet just off the shore. Here, rocky reefs and seagrass meadows exist side by side and provide excellent shelter for various fish and shellfish. Look out for sea slugs and hermit crabs making their way slowly along blades of seagrass, and for flatfish burrowing their way into patches of sand to protect themselves from predators. Watch also for spiky, vivid purple maerl, a hard seaweed that deposits lime in its cell walls as it grows, creating a brittle skeleton. Maerl is very fragile and slow-growing, so take care not to knock into it.Porth Castell, Ynys Môn(Anglesey)View image in fullscreenA magnificent narrow gully makes this bay a great place to look for lobsters.Porth Castell is a small bay that’s sheltered from the open sea by a large offshore island. This fortuitous natural layout provides a wealth of snorkelling opportunities around the rocky reefs that surround the island and run up the bay edges. Arrive at high-ish tide and you can swim through a magnificent narrow gully on the left-hand side of the bay, between the shore and the island. Look into the recesses in the rocks as you go to spot vibrant orange and blue spiny squat lobsters, and more common residents such as crabs and blennies. If you’re very lucky, you might encounter a small-spotted catshark; these are relatively common in British waters but not often glimpsed by snorkellers because they spend relatively little time in the shallows.Rockham Bay, DevonView image in fullscreenComplex rock formations at the bay form tidal pools teeming with marine life.A quiet place to be at one with nature and to get away from the well-worn tourist spots of Devon, Rockham Bay is an excellent example of the stratified rock formations that typify this stretch of the north Devon coastline. The unforgiving nature of the sea is apparent here, with the remains of the steamer ship SS Collier strewn over the intertidal rock; wrecked in 1914, there’s not much left to see but the remains of rusted chainworks, a well-weathered winch assembly and other miscellaneous metalworks. Low tide is a good time to explore by land, with the wreckage exposed and the complex rock formations forming tidal pools packed with marine life. Snorkelling around the rocky extremities reveals kelpy reefs: watch out for small spotted catsharks dozing on the sandy seabed as you move from one rocky spur to the next. The nearest car park is at Mortehoe.How to snorkel safely …Like open water swimming, snorkelling comes with risks that should be considered when planning your adventure. While experienced swimmers will already be aware of many of the considerations, here are 10 safety tips:1Assess your fitness to snorkel before getting in the water2Consider undertaking formal snorkelling qualifications3Always snorkel with a “buddy”4Know how to use your kit and ensure it’s in good condition5Assess the site and conditions before entry6Regularly monitor your position in the water7Use a swim buoy so that boats can easily see you8Never swim into underwater structures or caves while snorkelling9Get out of the water before you feel cold, and especially before shivering10Immediately leave the water if you feel excessively fatigued or short of breath… and responsiblyJust as important as your own safety is that you don’t cause harm to the eco-systems you’re exploring. Here’s how to snorkel without doing any damage:1Follow the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’smarine and coastal wildlife code2Avoid damaging habitats: refrain from stepping on, touching, or holding on to coastal habitats or species3Dispose of litter responsibly4Use eco-friendly products such as sun cream that’s compatible with the marine environment and, ideally, invest in swimwear that’s been produced by sustainable means5Respect marine life, particularly when snorkelling among seals and seahorses, which should not be disturbedSnorkelling Britain: 100 Marine AdventuresbyEmma & Gordon Tayloris published byWild Things Publishing(£18.99).Readers can receive a 20% discountand freepostage and packaging withdiscount code ‘TheGuardian’atwildthingspublishing.comExplore more on these topicsWater sports holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysDiving holidaysBeach holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Are you craftier than a cat burglar?The answers to today’s puzzlesAlex BellosMon 12 May 2025 11.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 12.05 EDTShareEarlier today I set these two puzzles. Here they are again with solutions.1. Go compare!A dealer places one hundred cards on a table. On their face-down sides are the numbers from 1 to 100. The cards are randomly arranged so you have no idea at the beginning which card is which. Your task is to identify the 1 card and the 100 cardwithoutturning any of them over.The only way to learn information about the cards is by comparison. At any stage, you may choose two and ask the dealer which is smaller and which is larger. The dealer always knows. They will never tell you the number on the cards, just which is smaller and which is larger.It is possible to identify the 1 card after asking the dealer to make 99 comparisons. First, ask them to compare any two cards. Make a note of the lower card, and ask them to compare it with one of the 98 remaining cards. Make a note of the lower card, and ask them to compare it with one of the 97 remaining cards. And so on. The lower card in the 99th comparison must be lower than all other cards, and thus is the 1 card. Likewise you can identify the 100 card after 99 comparisons, making a total of 198 comparisons to find both highest and lowest cards.Can you find a method to identify the 1 and the 100 cards using less comparisons? What’s the optimal strategy?SolutionYou can do it in 148 comparisons.STEP 1: Divide the cards into fifty pairs. Ask the dealer to compare the cards in each pair. (Total: 50 comparisons.)STEP 2: Consider the 50 lower cards from these comparisons. This group contains the 1 card. It will take 49 comparisons to identify with 100 per cent certainty which is the 1 card, which we do by comparing any two cards, taking the lower one, etc, and going through the remaining 48 as we did above.STEP 3. By the same logic, the remaining 50 cards contain the 100 card. It will take 49 comparisons of this group to identify with 100 per cent certainty the 100 card. TOTAL: 50 + 49 + 49 = 148 comparisons.This strategy is optimal. The proof is somewhat technical for a general audience, but if any mathematicians want to write it down in full in the comments below I’m sure some readers will be grateful.2. The rope trickYou are a burglar at the top of a 20m building, which has a ledge half way down on which it is possible to stand. There are hooks at the top of the building and on the ledge. You have a 15m length of rope and a knife. You can cut the rope if you like, and also make any type of knot anywhere on the rope, which uses up no length, and which can be placed on either hook.How would you use the rope to descend the building safely? You are not allowed to jump off the building or the rope.SolutionCut the rope into two pieces of 5m and 10m. Make a knot at one end of the 5m rope. Thread the 10m rope through this knot and tie its ends together. Make a knot at the other end of the 5m rope and attach it to the hook. Dangle the ropes down the side of the building and climb down them. The joined ropes have a combined lenth of 10m (5m + 5m), which gets you to the ledge. Untie the ends of the 10m rope and pull it through the other rope. This rope will get you down the final 10m when you attach it to the hook on the ledge.Thanks to Geza Bohus for suggesting today’s puzzles.

You’re not alone. Ginger shots have become a trend in recent years, thanks to the perception that they’re good for immunity. But are they?Dr Emily Leeming, a dietitian at King’s College London, says it’s unlikely they are a miracle cure. She says there has been only a small amount of research that shows that gingerol extracts, the active polyphenols in ginger, may help lower some markers of inflammation (an immune response), but the evidence is pretty weak.“I could only find a limited number of studies with very small numbers of participants, published in low-quality journals, and they tend to use concentrated extracts of the active component ginger, rather than fresh juice like that in stores,” says Leeming. With the juices she wonders: “Is that active component in large enough quantities? Is it staying active? Is the juice being stored for a long time? Is it heat-treated?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A daily ginger shot might contribute to this slightly, but there are easier, cheaper ways to have a more proven impact on your immunity.“If you want to take ginger shots, there’s no harm to it, and there might be a slight benefit,” she adds. “But maybe it’s better to spend that money on some wholefoods, like berries or cooked grains, that are going to help you keep your fibre up and feed your gut microbiome, which acts to support your immune system.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …Health & wellbeingFoodMedical researchNutrition (Life and style)Nutrition (Science)featuresShareReuse this content"

Plus a letter fromHoward SpencerMon 12 May 2025 12.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe local election results in the north-east of England have been understandably portrayed as disastrous for the Labour party, which lost Durham county council (The Guardian view on Labour’s drift and Tory collapse: Reform fills a vacuum they created, 6 May). Labour also lost seats in Northumberland, but there was one area of success. In the Tyne Valley, the Hexham constituency Labour party held one seat, gained another two (one from a Conservative, the other from a Socialist Independent) and came within a handful of votes of unseating two other Conservatives.Reform UK was much less successful than elsewhere, even in “red wall” towns such as Prudhoe and Haltwhistle. The success was based on credible local candidates who exposed the poor record of the Conservative-run Northumberland county council for the past eight years.On the doorstep, there was much unhappiness with theLabourgovernment and many voters were considering voting for Reform. We kept Reform at bay by listening to concerns, agreeing that we wanted a change of direction from the government and by promoting a positive vision of local Labour policies for Northumberland.We made a point of talking about the positive contribution of immigrants to our locality. The government needs to reset its political compass and not make the mistake of trying to mimic Reform. There is also the need for the Labour party to listen to members, particularly those who have run campaigns that have successfully defeated Reform at the ballot box this month. I look forward to hearing fromMorgan McSweeney.John HanleyChair, Prudhoe, Wylamand Stocksfield Labour partyYour editorial writes of the first-past-the-post electoral system being “designed” to keep out extremism. In fact it wasn’t designed for anything and was simply the consequence of the introduction of equal electoral districts, each returning a single MP, in 1885. Since then, it has suited the purpose of the major parties to keep this 19th-century relic. But whether its retention is truly in the interests of Labour – which has held power for just 28 years in the last century – seems very doubtful.Howard SpencerHove, East SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He points to the excessive delays afflicting English criminal courts, which he attributes to the 1% of cases that are decided by juries. He provides little evidence for this, while making no mention of the true causes – Covid and chronic underfunding.There is no evidence that jury trial causes delay in contested cases as opposed to judges sitting alone. Judges would have to provide reasoned arguments for each factual decision (subject to review) and, for this reason, the vast majority of British criminal judges strongly favour jury trial.Jenkins adds that we should join “the rest of Europe” and end jury trial, without telling us what systems those countries enjoy and whether they are to be emulated. Yet the inquisitorial system in, say, France, with its many complications including dual investigation by examining justices, is subject to horrendous delays, historically far worse than their adversarial equivalent in the UK.Jenkins attributes jury trial to a “medieval hangover, judgment by one’s peers, over the whim of an unelected manorial lord or other authority” as though this were undesirable. In fact, it is far more likely to originate in an adversarial democratic culture inherent in British history and observable in parliament.But the greatest concern is the absence of any mention of the libertarian value of jury trials in an increasingly totalitarian world. As one of Britain’s greatest jurists, Lord Patrick Devlin, observed: “The first object of any tyrant would be to overthrow or diminish trial by jury. It is the lamp that shows that freedom lives.”Bob Marshall-AndrewsKCLabour MP forMedway, 1997-2010Simon Jenkins’ article struck a strong chord with me. Having served on two juries, I am less than impressed. How are you meant to have a sensible discussion in the jury room without a transcript of the trial proceedings? Your only written record is whatever you can write in pencil on a sheet of paper, despite the fact that an official record is being taken. You are given no advice about how to run the jury proceedings, presumably because English yeomen all know intuitively how to do this. Not every member wants to be there, and some members’ contributions can be negligible.For my first trial there were six charges, all related. For one charge, evidence from the victim indicated the rough date of the alleged offence quite accurately. It was revealed at a different point in the proceedings, and I noted this on my bit of paper, that the accused was in prison at the time. Despite this, the accused was convicted by 11 to one. I have also had to sit through the verbatim acting out of a police interview, where the prosecution barrister played the accused and the police interviewer played himself.The jury room may well be little more than a glorified broom cupboard. On my second trial, I was encouraged when I saw a whiteboard, which I thought would be quite useful. Naturally, the marker pens all needed replacing, and their replacements were highlighter pens.Name and address suppliedSimon Jenkins thinks that members of the public who serve on juries are incompetent to decide complicated factual issues. If he is right, then voting in elections should also be left to experts.Francis FitzGibbon KCLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

My father was a Jewish Kindertransport refugee to the UK from Vienna in May 1939. My grandfather wrote it in 1934 as the clouds of fascism were massing.Khalil’s letter speaks to courage and kindness, a father’s love for his son. It speaks from a place where it is clear that Palestinians have no security at all in their future, where their hopes are being systematically crushed.My grandmother survived a concentration camp and remained there for some months after liberation to ensure the trial of her SS captors. She delayed being reunited with her son because she believed that she had an obligation to his future.She spoke to me of the perils of Zionism when I was too young to understand what she meant.

Then, in February, hesigned an executive orderdirecting officials to grant refugee status to Afrikaners, whose leaders ruled during apartheid while violently repressing the Black majority.“It’s a genocide that’s taking place,” Trump told reporters at the White House, when asked why white South Africans were being prioritised for resettlement above victims of famine and war elsewhere on the continent, echoing a far-right conspiracy theory that has also been amplified by hisSouth African-born billionaire adviser Elon Musk.Trump added that the Afrikaners’ race “makes no difference to me”. He said South Africa’s leaders were travelling to meet him next week, but that he would not attend the G20 leaders’ meeting in Johannesburg in November unless the “situation is taken care of”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Black South Africanunemployment rate is 46.1%, compared with 9.2% for white people.Laura Thompson Osuri, executive director ofHomes Not Borders, a refugee care nonprofit in the Washington area, stood in the airport check-in area with a sign reading: “Refugee. Noun. A person who has been forced to leave his or her country due to persecution, war or violence. Afrikaners are not refugees.”Osuri said of Trump’s policy: “It’s for showing: ‘Look at us. We do welcome people as long as they look like us.’”Democrats also condemned the Afrikaners’ resettlement. Maryland senator Chris Van Hollentold a thinktank event: “To watch the Trump administration apply what I call their global apartheid policy … is just an outrageous insult to the whole idea of our country.”Meanwhile, the Episcopal church said it was ending its decades-long work with the US government supporting refugees, after it was asked to help resettle the white South Africans, citing its “commitment to racial justice and reconciliation”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpSouth AfricaRaceUS immigrationAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It holds the continent’s largest collection of contemporary art.She was previously the founding artistic director of Raw Material Company, an art centre in Dakar, Senegal, which had a big impact on her. “It’s the place I came of age professionally, where I really became a curator and an exhibition-maker,” she recentlytold the Financial Times. “Dakar made me who I am today.”As curator of the Biennale she was due to present the exhibition’s title and theme in Venice in a week’s time, on 20 May.In a statement, the management of the Venice Biennale said they were “deeply saddened and dismayed to learn of the sudden and untimely passing of Koyo Kouoh”.They said Kouoh had “worked with passion, intellectual rigour and vision on the conception and development of the Biennale Arte 2026”.The statement added: “Her passing leaves an immense void in the world of contemporary art and in the international community of artists, curators and scholars who had the privilege of knowing and admiring her extraordinary human and intellectual commitment.”The Biennale confirmed it was “likely to hold the press conference on 20 May”, which would also be livestreamed from its headquarters.Zeitz MOCAA said it had closed its doors and suspended all programming until further notice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, Lula is scheduled to meet China’s leader,Xi Jinping, who is expected to return the visit in July, when Xi travels to the Brics summit in Rio.“China has often been treated as though it were an enemy of global trade when actually China is behaving like an example of a country that is trying to do business with countries which, over the past 30 years, were forgotten by many other countries,” said Lula, who is expected to seek major Chinese investments in Brazilian infrastructure projects.The visit of the three South American leaders to China underlines the east Asian country’s rapidly growing footprint in a region where, over the past 25 years, it has become a voracious consumer of commodities such as soybeans, iron ore and copper. Chinese companies have also poured into the region. Electric cars made by the Chinese manufacturer BYD can be seen cruising the streets of Brazilian cities, from Brasília to Boa Vista, deep in the Amazon.The visits also come amid global jitters over Trump’s volatile presidency and Latin American anxiety and suspicion over the US president’s plans for a region where he hasthreatened to “take back” the Panama canal– by force if necessary.Matias Spektor, an international relations professor at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian thinktank and university, said the presence of the three South American presidents in Beijing underscored how, in the Trump era, with the US in retreat, such leaders were increasingly reaching out to other parts of the world.US-Panama relationship was ‘very strong’. Then Trump upended the diplomatic playing boardRead more“It tells us that countries around the world are willing to go out … to exploit all the opportunities that are there in the international system – and there are many. Because, as America turns away from free trade and as America adopts a policy that is … instead of transactional, predatory – countries have an incentive to engage with those who are transactional,” Spektor said, pointing to recent trips Lula made to Japan and Vietnam.“[Lula] is very proactively trying to open trade for Brazil at a time when America is undoing the previous rules of the game, and the new rules of the game are not yet born … These [Latin American] countries want to shape the norms that are likely to emerge now. And those rules are not going to emerge in Washington DC. They are going to be made globally,” Spektor added.Spektor said Latin American leaders such as Lula had long considered the world a multipolar place. “What happened on 20 January [with Trump’s return to power] is that the barrage of policy change coming from Washington DC has accelerated the belief that was already in place that the axis of global power has for a while been moving towards the east, and somewhat towards the south.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilChinaDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasAsia PacificUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the number of murders per capita has been falling this year, with a marked decline between January and April.“April 2025 has marked another historic milestone. For the second time this year, we have recorded the lowest number of murders in over two decades,” Dr Kevin Blake, the police commissioner, said in a statement.‘I want more joy, less killing’: Jamaicans say police alone cannot quell gang crimeRead moreHe added that this “progress is not accidental” but a result of “careful planning, tireless execution, and a commitment to excellence” by theJamaicaConstabulary Force, the Jamaica Defence Force and their strategic partners.According to Blake, compared with the same period last year, between January and April, there has been an 18% decline in overall major crimes, and murders are down by 37%.“These are not just statistics. Each number represents lives saved, communities stabilised, and a signal that the tide is turning,” he said.But the human rights groupJamaicans for Justice (JFJ)has raised concerns about a corresponding “significant and alarming increase” in fatal police shootings in the same period.According to Jamaica’s police complaints authority, theIndependent Commission of Investigations (Indecom), 111 people were fatally shot by security forces between January and April 2025, compared 44 in the same period last year – a 152% increase.Indecom is calling for strengthened accountability through mechanisms such as body-worn cameras amid an “elevated increase in use of force by the State”.Their concerns and recommendations are echoed by JFJ, which recently staged a protest against the “significant and alarming” increase in fatal shootings by police.Joining the calls for more body-worn cameras, JFJ’s executive director, Mickel Jackson, said: “Outside of the numbers, which in and of itself calls for greater scrutiny, we have received complaints, where citizens are giving a different account from the police’s official account.” She added that there were instances where amateur videos contradict police accounts of fatal shootings.These “conflicting accounts”, she said, were “enough to take pause and certainly to advocate for body-worn cameras”.Carla Gullotta, the executive director for the human rights groupStand Up For Jamaicastressed the importance of building relations between the police and people in “fragile and volatile areas”.Katrina Chin, whose cousin, Andrew Richards, 39, was killed by police in January, also called for greater transparency from police. Indecom isstill investigatingRichards’s shooting, but his family has maintained that he was innocent.Recalling the morning that she watched her cousin’s body being removed from his house covered by a sheet after an early morning defence forces raid, Chin said: “I understand that our country seriously has a problem with crime. We’re not denying that.”JFJ’s work, she added, is not anti-police. “We’re just advocating for it to be done the right way. We can’t just be so desperate to lower our crime rate that we’re willing to kill innocent people,” she said.She added that politicians should be careful that, in their defence of police actions, they are not “fueling” the view that the police are “untouchable”.Ahead of the JFJ protest against the increase in killings, for which they asked their supporters to wear black, a counter-protest was launched on social media, which invited people to wear blue in support of the police. Major businesses such as Jamaica’s popular pharmacy chain, Fontana, supported the “blue” campaign.Executive director Kevin O’Brien Chang said he and staff decided to wear blue because the plummeting crime rates were making people feel safer. “Every day, the police and soldiers put their lives on the line, and they pay the ultimate price,” he said.During the protest, the Jamaican prime minister, Andrew Holness, was pictured in a blue suit speaking to a police superintendent, withlocal media reportingthat he wore blue to support the counter-protest.Addressing concerns about the increasing number of killings by police, Holnessreportedly said: “Obviously, the JCF’s increased activities in interdicting criminals and in dealing with the gangs would have caused a significant increase in the loss of life of those who challenged them. But I think the country should also understand that the gang warfare is at a level where we must respond and respond decisively.”Jamaican city gripped by violence after police shooting of gang bossRead moreBlake, the police commissioner, defended his officers, saying: “We are a disciplined, modern law enforcement agency with a constitutional mandate to serve and protect all Jamaicans without fear, favour or ill will.”Jackson stressed that everyone, including the police, had the right to defend themselves. But, she added, “you can support the police and still be pro-accountability. You can support the police and the reduction in murder rates and their efforts, and still call for the body-worn cameras.”The police themselves would benefit from having the independent account from a camera, she said, adding she was disappointed to see the head of government appearing to choose sides, even if that was not his intention.“A call for accountability should never be seen as anti-police, and this was a moment, in my humble opinion, that I believe that the prime minister of the country should have come out and say that ‘I stand with law enforcement officers – but I support the call for increased accountability,’” she said.Explore more on these topicsJamaicaAmericasGangsnewsShareReuse this content"

About 80% of bananas grown globally are for local consumption, and more than 400 million people rely on the fruit for 15% to 27% of their daily calories.Our food system isn’t ready for the climate crisisRead moreAn estimated 80% of banana exports which supply supermarkets around the world come from Latin America and theCaribbean– one of the most vulnerable regions to extreme weather and slow-onset climate disasters.And yet the crop is under threat from the human-made climate crisis, and threatens a vital food source and the livelihoods of communities that have contributed virtually nothing to the greenhouse gases driving global heating.“Climate change has been killing our crops. This means there is no income because we cannot sell anything. What is happening is that my plantation has been dying. So, what has been happening is death,” Aurelia Pop Xo, 53, a banana grower inGuatemala, told Christian Aid researchers.Bananas, especially the cavendish, are sensitive fruits. They require a temperature range between 15C and 35C (59F and 95F) to thrive, and just enough water – but not too much. They are sensitive to storms, which can cause a banana plant to shed leaves, making it much harder for the crop to photosynthesize.While there are hundreds of banana varieties, the cavendish accounts for the vast majority of exports since it was chosen by the fruit conglomerates for its decent flavor, hardiness and high yield.It’s this lack of genetic variation that makes bananas particularly vulnerable to the rapidly changing climate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Black leaf fungus can reduce the ability of banana plants to photosynthesize by 80% and it thrives in wet conditions, making bananas at risk from erratic rainfall and flooding. Rising temperatures and changing rain patterns are exacerbating another fungus, fusarium tropical race 4, a soil-borne microbe which is devastating entire cavendish plantations across the world.Christian Aid is calling on wealthy polluting nations most responsible for the climate crisis to urgently transition away from fossil fuels and fulfil their obligations to provide financing to help communities adapt to the changing climate.“Bananas are not just the world’s favourite fruit, they are also an essential food for millions of people. We need to wake up to the danger posed by climate change to this vital crop,” said Osai Ojigho, Christian Aid’s director of policy and campaigns. “The lives and livelihoods of people who have done nothing to cause the climate crisis are already under threat.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOur unequal earthFruitFoodCaribbeanColombiaGuatemalaCosta RicanewsShareReuse this content"

Campaigns by his supporters have been dominated by calls for him to be returned to thePhilippines.It is unclear how Duterte would take his oath to assume office as mayor. His daughter, impeached vice-president Sara Duterte, said this was being discussed by “his ICC [international criminal court] lawyers and his Filipino lawyers”.It is expected that, given the former president is imprisoned in the Netherlands, duties could instead be assumed by the vice-mayor – a race his son, Sebastian, was also on track to win.Duterte’s children and grandchildren have accused the state of having “kidnapped” him. In a video message posted after his arrest, he said he would take responsibility for his policies.The wider electoral picture for the family was mixed. Sara Duterte said late on Monday night that “the outcome was not what we had hoped for”, though her allies seeking seats in the senate appeared to have performed better than some pre-election surveys had predicted.She did not appear on the ballot papers on Monday, but the elections will prove crucial to her survival.Thevice-president was impeached in Februaryover claims that she misused funds, and in relation to a speech she gave in which she appeared to threaten the lives of the president, the first lady and speaker of the house.She is due to face trial in the 24-seat senate, where half of the members were being elected on Monday.If Sara Duterte were to be found guilty by the senate, she would be barred from office – preventing her from running for president in 2028.A two-thirds vote, of at least 16 senate members, is needed to convict an impeached official.As of midnight, five Duterte-aligned candidates were on course to secure seats in the senate, while allies of Marcos were projected to win six seats, fewer than had been predicted. A senator who has been associated with both the Marcos and Duterte campaigns has been included in each of their counts of successful candidates.Opposition candidates who are critical of both families performed better than expected.Sara Duterte said in a statement: “We will continue to hold the government accountable, advocate for the issues that matter, and work tirelessly to serve as a strong and constructive opposition.”Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificRodrigo DutertenewsShareReuse this content"

Much of what he unveiled that day has since been shelved.“The talks in Geneva were very friendly,” said Trump. “We’re not looking to hurt China.”The US president, who has claimed for months that tariffs could raise trillions of dollars for the US federal government, appeared to change tack on Monday. “The biggest thing to me is the opening up,” he said of China. “I think it would be fantastic for our businesses if we could go in and compete.”At an event largely focused on his administration’s efforts to lower drug prices, Trump signaled he may now turn his focus to the European Union, which he claimed had been “nastier” than China.“We have all the cards,” the president claimed, using similar rhetoric to describe relations with the EU that he was using about China just weeks ago. “They treated us very unfairly.”The 90-day lowering of tariffs applies to the duties announced by Trump on 2 April, which ultimately escalated to 125% on most Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with equivalent measures.China also imposed non-tariff measures, such as restricting the export of critical minerals that are essential to US manufacturing of hi-tech goods.The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said China’s retaliation had been disproportionate and amounted to an effective embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies.With the 115 percentage point deduction, Chinese duties on US goods will be lowered to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%. That is because the US tariffs include a 20% rate imposed by Trump before the latest trade war, which the president said was related to China’s role in the US’sfentanyl crisis.The fentanyl-related tariff will still apply, and Trump stressed that sector-specific US tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium will be unaffected.A spokesperson for China’s ministry of commerce said: “This move meets the expectations of producers and consumers in both countries, as well as the interests of both nations and the common interest of the world.“We hope that the US side will, based on this meeting, continue to move forward in the same direction with China, completely correct the erroneous practice of unilateral tariff hikes, and continually strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.”China’s yuan jumped to a six-month high on the signal that the trade war would be paused. Up to 16m jobs wereat risk in China, according to some estimates, while the US faced rising inflation and empty shelves thanks to dizzying tariffs on the biggest supplier of US goods.Bessent said he was impressed by the level of Chinese engagement on the fentanyl problem during the talks in Switzerland. “For the first time the Chinese side understood the magnitude of what is happening in the US,” Bessent said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previously, the hope was just that the two sides can sit down to talk, and the market had been very fragile. Now, there’s more certainty. Both China stocks and the yuan will be in an upswing for a while.”Hu Xijin, the former editor of the nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, said on social media the agreement was a “great victory for China in upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect”. Hu noted on Weibo that the recently agreedUK-US trade dealmaintained the US’s 10% tariff on UK imports, “while the UK did not implement reciprocal measures”.Wang Wen, the head of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said: “This is an unexpected achievement in Sino-US tariff negotiations.”However, Wang also urged caution, as he said the agreement “does not represent the resolution of the structural contradictions between China and the United States, nor does it mean that there will be no friction and serious differences between China and the United States in the future”.Stock market chartStock markets across Europe rose in the aftermath of the US-China announcement. Germany’s Dax index jumped by nearly 1%, as Mercedes-Benz, Daimler Trucks and BMW were among the biggest risers. France’s Cac 40 index rose by 1.3%. Shares in the Danish shipping group Maersk rose 12%.Brent crude rose almost 3% at $65.75 a barrel, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, jumped by 1.2%.After the announcement of the US-China agreement, analysts at the Dutch bank ING lifted their forecast for China’s growth this year.

Mingyang has emerged as the preferred manufacturer, but the company has sought advice from ministers on whether to proceed.Green Volt, which is jointly owned by Flotation Energy, a Scottish company and Vårgrønn, a Norwegian one, is constructing the first commercial-scalefloating offshore windfarm in Europe. The project will deliver electricity to oil and gas platforms, replacing power currently generated by gas and diesel turbines, andprovide electricity to the UK grid.The decision over whether to source its wind turbines from Mingyang will be closely scrutinised after the governmentstepped in to take control of British Steelamid claims that its Chinese owner, Jingye Group, wanted to shut down its Scunthorpe plant to make the UK a dumping ground for Chinese steel.The incident triggered calls for Chinese companies to be locked out of involvement with critical national infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said at first that he would not bring another Chinese company into the British steel sector before softening his position.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary,travelled to China earlier this springto discuss closer cooperation on energy and climate.China to snub UK energy summit amid row over infrastructure projectsRead moreThe decision over whether Mingyang can supply the turbines is not subject to any formal government process, but the company is unlikely to proceed if ministers say they have security concerns.The Sun reported three months ago that some officials in the Ministry of Defence and Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero had raised concerns about the proposed deal. Green Volt has been waiting for a verdict from the government for weeks, according to people familiar with the discussions.An industry source said the UK did not currently have the heavy manufacturing capability to produce the turbines domestically. “They have tried to get European manufacturers to no avail,” the source said of Green Volt. “Miliband is on to something here. We all want to get to where he wants to get to, but if it’s not from Chinese companies, who is going to [supply wind turbines] to us?”The project would be an important contributor to the government’smission to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In a speech at a rally last week, Duterte said her name, and her family’s name “have been dragged through the mud”. “Who will really benefit if the Duterte family is gone from this world? Not the Filipinos, not the victims of crime, the unemployed, the poor or even the hungry.”Duterte’s long-simmering feud with former ally Marcos exploded in February when she was impeached by the House for alleged “high crimes” including corruption and an assassination plot against the president. She has denied the allegations, adding that she had presented the assassination plot as a hypothetical scenario.Barely a month later, her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, wasarrested and flown to the international criminal court(ICC) the same day to face a charge of crimes against humanity over his deadly anti-drugs campaign.View image in fullscreenPhilippine vice-president Sara DutertePhotograph: Basilio Sepe/APSara Duterte will need nine votes in the 24-seat Senate to preserve any hope of a future presidential run.Heading into Monday, seven of the candidates polling in the top 12 were endorsed by Marcos while four were aligned with his vice-president.Two, including the president’s independent-minded sister Imee Marcos, were “adopted” as honorary members of the Duterte family’s PDP-Laban party on Saturday.The move to add Imee Marcos and television personality Camille Villar to the party’s slate was intended to add “more allies to protect the vice-president against impeachment”, according to the resolution.At her final rally in Manila on Thursday, Duterte invoked the spectre of “massive” electoral fraud and once again referred to her father’s transfer to the ICC as a “kidnapping”.Despite his detention at The Hague, theelder Duterte remains on the ballotin his family’s southern stronghold of Davao city, where he is seeking to retake his former job as mayor.At least one local poll is predicting he will win comfortably.National police in the archipelago nation have been on alert for more than a week, and about 163,000 officers have been deployed to secure polling stations, escort election officials and guard checkpoints.Thousands more personnel from the military, fire departments and other agencies have been mobilised to keep the peace in a country where battles over hotly contested provincial posts are known to erupt in violence.A city council hopeful, a polling officer and a village chief are among the at least 16 people police say have been killed in attacks in the run-up to Monday’s election.On Saturday, a candidate for municipal councillor was one of two men in an “armed group” killed in a shootout with police and the military in southern Mindanao island’s autonomous Muslim region, a notorious hotbed of election-related violence.Farther north, a group of men were arrested the same day at the Cebu airport while transporting 441m pesos (nearly $8m) in cash, a crime under election rules aimed at preventing the exchange of bribes for votes.Both cases were still under investigation.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They escaped with up to an estimated €10m (£8.4m) in jewellery, including a 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to Kardashian by her then husband, the rapper Kanye West, estimated to be worth $4m (£3.4m).Ouatiki, who is Algerian, said he was working as a night receptionist to fund himself as he completed a Sorbonne University PhD thesis on the semiotics of extremist discourse. He was alone that night at the reception desk of an exclusive apartment building in central Paris, known as a “no address” site, where celebrities visiting Paris often rented sumptuous suites.Ouatiki said that after 2am he saw three masked men “with police jackets on” approach the glass door to reception and gesture to him to open up. Thinking they were police officers, he opened the door.“They pushed me to my knees and said: ‘We’re here for the money’,” he told the court. He said they handcuffed him, showed him an automatic pistol and held another gun to his neck as they asked him: “Where is the rapper’s wife?” He knew that meant Kardashian.The robbers held a gun to Ouatiki and took him in the lift with them to Kardashian’s apartment, he told the court. As they approached her bedroom, Ouatiki said Kardashian called out “Hello? Hello?” thinking it might be her sister Kourtney Kardashian returning from a nightclub.He said the robbers burst into the room and roughly pushed Kardashian.Ouatiki said she was shouting and hysterical. Fearing the lead robber was “very nervous, unstable, aggressive”, Ouatiki said he felt he had to “calm things down and contain it” so he shouted at Kardashian to “shut up!”.He said she was shocked but it had an effect. He said the robbers spoke no English but were asking in French for money. Ouatiki, still with a gun to him, tried to translate. Kardashian said she had “a thousand” – either in dollars or euros. He said she gave the robbers the ring that was on a bedside table. She then nodded towards a Louis Vuitton jewellery box, the robbers allegedly opened it and poured its contents into two bags.Kardashian was roughly pushed on to the bed by the lead robber who tied her hands and feet and put black tape over her mouth, Ouatiki said.Asked by the judge if the robbers would have seen Kardashian’s nudity under her towelling hotel robe, Ouatiki said: “Yes, when they pushed her on to the bed.” He said the robber then dragged Kardashian to a bathroom and left her there, tied up.The lead judge asked Ouatiki if he thought Kardashian feared she would die. He said: “Yes.” He said he also feared he would die.Ten suspects, whose ages range from 35 to 78, are on trial until 23 May. Some are accused of aiding in the organisation of the robbery. Eight of the accused deny any involvement.Kardashian, 44, will testify on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsKim KardashianParisFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The incumbent party had garnered 53% of the vote compared with 34% for its main opposition rival.Preliminary turnout in Sunday’s election was almost 42.16%, or 4% lower than four years ago.“It’s a result exceeding all expectations even before the ballots have been fully counted,” said a well-placed source in Tirana. “A fourth consecutive win is phenomenal. Edi has cause to be very happy.”In office since 2013, Rama had campaigned on his ability to fast-track reforms deemed vital for the ex-communist state to accede to the EU. The 60-year-old has promised to deliver membership within five years after formally opening accession negotiations last October.View image in fullscreenMembers of the electoral commission count ballots in Tirana.Photograph: Malton Dibra/EPAThe goal, seen by many as highly ambitious, has been aided by the desire of some European leaders to see Albania and other western Balkan states join the bloc following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The country’s first president after the fall of communism more than three decades ago, Berisha, 80, argued Albania was far from ready for EU admission. Once the personal physician of the late Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha, the cardiologist had run a US-style campaign overseen by consultants brought in from Washington DC, including Chris LaCivita, the Republican strategist credited with helping secure Donald Trump’s victory in November. Berisha had made his campaign motto “Make Albania Great Again”.The Democratic party had joined forces with 20 other political groups in the hope of removing Rama from office. But by early on Monday, as ballots were counted by hand, it was clear the Socialists were in the ascendancy.Analysts said the Socialist party appeared to have won backing from overseas voters after Albania’s large expatriate community was allowed to cast ballots by post for the first time. More than 192,000 votes were received from the nearly 246,000 Albanians who had registered to vote abroad before Sunday’s election in the 2.7 million-strong nation.An overwhelming 83% of Albanians support EU membership, the highest endorsement of any population in the western Balkans, according to a Eurobarometer survey released in November.Rama, who served as mayor of Tirana before going into mainstream politics – livening up the capital’s drab cityscape by having its communist-era buildings painted in an array of colours – has made the country’s EU accession a priority. Supporters attending his weekly rallies turned the quest into a hallmark by donning white T-shirts emblazoned with a large multicoloured “5” – indicating the years left until 2030.The promise of EU membership was a big draw for diaspora voters, said Albania’s ambassador to Greece, Luela Hajdaraga.“Albanians living abroad were very eager to participate in this historic process and have their voices heard,” she told the Guardian. “In Greece, especially, where the issue of gaining citizenship has been so difficult, the prospect of Albania joining the EU is seen very positively.”Rama has said that Albania, for decades the continent’s most isolated state, is “at the gates of Europe”. The country has opened 16 of the 35 negotiating chapters for membership of the bloc. But in a land blighted by corruption and organised crime, he also faces challenges, not least mass emigration as young Albanians seek better lives abroad.Explore more on these topicsAlbaniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the PKK announcement of a “new phase”, the decision to disarm and dissolve appeared to be unilateral, with few public indications about authorities in Ankara offering dialogue.The decision follows months of outreach to Kurdish political leaders in Turkey by the nationalist politician Devlet Bahçeli, a coalition partner of the president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP). Local reports suggest Bahçeli has sought pathways to extend Erdoğan’s rule beyond two presidential terms through bolstering support from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) party.Erdoğan welcomed the PKK’s decision, saying: “With terror and violence being completely disengaged, the doors of a new era in every area, namely strengthening politics and democratic capacity, will be opened.”He added: “The winners will be our people and country, and actually all our siblings in our region.”The PKK leadership called their decision to halt armed struggle “a solid foundation for lasting peace and a democratic solution” and reiterated calls for Öcalan to be freed in order to oversee the group’s dissolution. The Kurdish leader has been held on an island prison off the coast of Istanbul since he was captured by Turkish forces in Kenya in 1999.Why has PKK leader called on group to dissolve – and why does it matter?Read moreFounded in 1978, the PKK led an armed insurgency primarily targeting Turkish military infrastructure, seeking greater recognition and independence for Kurdish communities in Turkey’s south-east. Amnesty Internationalaccusedthe group of harming rural Kurdish communities due to its activities in the 1990s.Tens of thousands of people are estimated to have been killed in the fighting with Turkish forces since the PKK officially began an armed insurgency in 1984,accordingto the International Crisis Group. The ICG found that in the year that followed the breakdown of the last ceasefire between the PKK and Turkey in 2015, more than 1,700 were killed including civilians, Kurdish fighters and members of the Turkish armed forces.The PKK’s decision to disband has further isolated allied Kurdish fighting forces in north-east Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) remain under increasing pressure to integrate into Syria’s new military after the collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad last year and thewithdrawal of hundreds of supporting American troopsfrom areas in the north-east under their control.The SDF commander-in-chief, Mazloum Abdi,signed a dealwith the new authorities in Damascus in March to merge SDF-led institutions into those of the fledgling Syrian state.Abdi previously dismissed any suggestion that the PKK’s dissolution would affect his forces,saying: “To be clear, this only concerns the PKK and is nothing related to us here in Syria.”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyKurdsEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

While the judge made an allowance for a claustrophobia diagnosis, he told her that she knew what she was doing was for Russia and had found it “exciting and glamorous.”Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, one of two lieutenants, was given a sentence of eight years by the judge, who noted reports of good behaviour and the fact his involvement in the ring stopped before their arrest in 2023. The other, Ivan Stoyanov, 33, was given five years and three weeks’ imprisonment after pleading guilty, albeit at what the judge noted was a late stage.Mr Justice Hilliard told each defendant that they would need to serve half their sentence before being eligible for parole and then would be liable for automatic deportation to Bulgaria.People tree of members of spy ringEarlier, he detailed six identified spy plots carried out by the defendants, some of whom he said were more culpable.Directed by Roussev’s second-in-command, Dzhambazov, he said the defendants were “motivated by money”, with “substantial” sums of up to €1m (£842,000) discussed.This, he said,demonstrated the “value” of their covert activities to Russia. “Some of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all. This enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value.The spy ring wasengaged in surveillance and intelligence operations between 2020 and 2023, targeting journalists and Russian dissidents.Working out of a guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, it was directed from abroad by Jan Marsalek, an Austrian businessman who had fled to Russia in 2020 after the payments company he helped to run, Wirecard, collapsed amid a €1.9bn (£1.6bn) fraud.Marsalek, who is believed to be in Moscow but is wanted in Germany over the Wirecard scandal, was working for the Russian FSB state security service and the GRU military intelligence agency.He directed surveillance in Bulgaria, Austria and Spain of Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist who had helped implicate Russian spies in the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the risk to them was obvious and Roussev would have been aware of the “extreme actions” Russia had taken against those it regarded as an “enemy” of the state.Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command,said after sentencing that the strength of the investigation into the group’s surveillance operations had left the ringleaders – Roussev and Dzhambazov - with no option but to plead guilty to the charges.“This case is a clear example of the increasing amount of state threat casework we are dealing with in the UK. It also highlights a relatively new phenomenon whereby espionage is being ‘outsourced’ by certain states.Frank Ferguson, Head of the CPS Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said that,by targeting individuals in the UK fleeing persecution as well as journalists opposing the Russian regime,the the group had undermined the message that the UK is a safe country for those people.“This prolonged activity also undermined the security and safety of the UK; and there can be no doubt that each of the defendants knew exactly who they were spying for,” he added.Explore more on these topicsCrimeEspionageNorfolkEnglandBulgariaRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was driven to the border withIsrael, where family who had flown over from the United States were waiting to meet him after initial check-ups.Netanyahu must now work for support of US as Trump tires of Israel’s war in GazaRead moreHe told Israeli soldiers after his release that he had been held handcuffed with other hostages, in a cage inside a tunnel, Israel’s Kan television reported.Hamas said in a statement they had freed Alexander “following contacts with the US administration, to achieve a ceasefire, open crossings, and bring aid and relief to our people in Gaza”.“We urge President Trump’s administration to continue its efforts to end this brutal war,” the statement added.Trump celebrated the release with a post on Truth Social on Monday afternoon. “Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage, is being released. Congratulations to his wonderful parents, family, and friends!”In a previous post he described the release as “a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators – Qatar and Egypt – to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones”.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, thanked Trump for his role in Edan’s release but also claimed credit was due to Israeli forces and his own government’s military strategy.“This was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President Trump. This is a winning combination,” he said in a statement.The Israeli leader has insisted throughout the war that military pressure is the best way to ensure that the hostages return home, even as Trump stepped up calls for a deal to end the conflict.Alexander’s release comes on the eve ofTrump’s first trip to the region since his re-election, with Israel conspicuously missing from his itinerary,and after a series of blunt public snubs to the country’s leadership.Trump to embark on Middle East trip to meet Gulf alliesRead moreTrump’s ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, denied on Monday that the relationship with Israel’s most important ally was strained. “Forget rumours. We’re all on the same page,” he said, after a meeting with Netanyahu and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s regional envoy which he described as “excellent”.Qatar and Egypt, who mediated Alexander’s release, described it as an encouraging step towards new truce talks. After the soldier returned to Israel, Netanyahu also said he had ordered negotiators to Doha to discuss a possible deal for Gaza, ahead of a planned new Israeli offensive there.For now, Israel’s leader appears trapped between Trump’s desire for a deal and pressure from his coalition partners to continue the war.His government relies on the backing of far-right parties who want Israel to keep fighting, including finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who earlier this month vowed that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed” and its Palestinian population will “leave in great numbers”.However Trump, who previously delighted Netanyahu’s far right allies by backing plans to force Palestinians to leave Gaza, has not publicly criticised Netanyahu.The Israeli leader may be hoping that strong support for Israel from the Republican base and other pressing demand’s on Trump’s attention, from the war in Ukraine to tariff talks with China, will divert the US leader’s attention away from Gaza even if fighting continues.Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square to watch footage of Alexander’s release and call for the return of other hostages. Trump said after Alexander’s release that only 20 of those were still alive, a number the Israeli government has not confirmed.Relatives and supporters called for the government to push for a breakthrough to bring back 58 others still in Gaza.Others were blunter. Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker who for a time was held with Alexander, said the prime minister was an “angel of death” and called for mass protests to force him from office.“Instead of ending the war and bringing everyone back, Netanyahu is preparing to expand the war this week. To execute the kidnapped who remain in captivity and to make the dead disappear,” she said. “Instead of saving lives and bringing everyone back, he chose to turn our loved ones into corpses.”Explore more on these topicsGazaHamasIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She was given brief news of his lengthy sentence by the lawyer appointed to him by the Saudi government.Foreign Office officials at the hearing were able to pass news of the sentence to Doush’s British lawyers, it is understood.Haydee Dijkstal, a barrister at 33 Bedford Row chambers and the international counsel for Doush, said: “Online expression, even if expressing concern or criticism of a government, should not be criminalised or lead to detention and imprisonment. Using anti-terrorism legislation to punish and repress online expression on social media with severe prison sentences is inconsistent with international law and human rights standards.”Speaking before the sentence, Nour said: “I rarely speak to my husband but in the few snatched conversations we have managed it is clear that Ahmed is struggling.“He has thyroid problems and is tormented by mental distress. He worries about his family particularly as he was the sole breadwinner. He missed the birth of our fourth child and our 10-year wedding anniversary.“Because Ahmed is a British citizen we expected the UK to provide clarity amid a storm of uncertainty. But the Foreign Office refused to share information with me for months – citing data protection – while at the same time accepting assurances from Saudi Arabia at face value.”The Foreign Office has also said the Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, had raised the case multiple times with Saudi officials but Nour said she had been refused a meeting with the foreign secretary, David Lammy.Her husband had received only three consular visits since he was imprisoned in August.She said: “We think Ahmed is being charged for a tweet he posted seven years ago and subsequently deleted.“Ahmed has been sleeping in an overcrowded cell that is filthy. My husband is a dedicated family man who is devoted to his children, spending weekends taking them to restaurants and the park. They are distraught and are constantly asking when he will be back. I no longer know how to answer their questions.“For me the night-time is an empty void where I question over and over why this has happened to us.“What Ahmed has endured over the past eight months is tortuous prolonged solitary confinement, unclear charges, a forced confession and excessive surveillance by prison authorities all managed by a powerless state-appointed legal counsel.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They said that elected officials, including the president, were not allowed to accept large gifts from foreign governments unless authorized to do so by Congress.Cory Bookerfrom New Jersey, Brian Schatz from Hawaii, Chris Coons from Delaware and Chris Murphy from Connecticut cast the reported gift of the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a clear conflict of interest and a serious threat to national security.“Air Force Once is more than just a plane – it’s a symbol of the presidency and of the United States itself,” the senators said in a joint statement. “No one should use public service for personal gain through foreign gifts.”News of a possible gift of the luxury jet prompted immediate scathing criticism from seniorDemocrats. Though the Qatari government has stressed that no final decision has yet been made, Trump appeared to confirm it on Sunday when he commented on social media that the transfer was being made “in a very public and transparent transaction”.Trump says planned gift of luxury plane from Qatar is a very ‘transparent’ dealRead moreThe plan appears to be for the 13-year-old plane to be fitted out by the US military for use as Air Force One and then, when Trump leaves the White House, for it to be put on display in his presidential library – in effect being handed to Trump for his own personal use.The reported arrangement comes as Trump sets off for a tour of the Middle East, including Qatar. Another of the countries on the tour, theUnited Arab Emirates, has also become embroiled in controversy over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump.Last week it was revealed that an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi hadinjected $2bninto a stablecoin venture launched by Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto company as an investment into the crypto exchange Binance.Senate Democrats are also gearing up to challenge Trump’s conflicts of interest under congressional rules governing the sale of military weapons to foreign countries.Murphy, the senator from Connecticut who has been at the forefront of sounding the alarm over conflicts of interest in the secondTrump administration, has said he will use his powers to challenge arms sales as a way of forcing a full debate and Senate vote on both the Qatar plane and UAE stablecoin issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a meeting late on Sunday with former hostages and relatives of those still held in Gaza, he told themIsraelis drawing out a war the US wants to end, local media reported.On the eve of the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held by Hamas, Witkoff spelt out the gulf between his boss and the government ofBenjamin Netanyahu.1:48Hamas releases Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander from Gaza – video report“We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. Israel is prolonging it – despite the fact that we don’t see where else we can go and that an agreement must be reached,” Witkoff told the meeting, according to Channel 12 Television, quoting sources who were present.It was the latest in a series of high-profile and high-stakes snubs from the White House which suggest that Israel’s most important ally is frustrated with its government – and possibly losing interest in its fortunes.“Trump’s not against Israel, but he doesn’t care about Israel,” said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat. “As far as Trump is concerned, Netanyahu has become an irritant and an irritant that doesn’t contribute to the bank account.”Trump may not have embarked on the open attacks that have characterised his relationship with other leaders fighting a war he wants to end, such as Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, but recent policy moves have undermined Israeli security, weakened its diplomatic standing and flown against Israeli defence policy, particularly over how to handle Iran.Last weekTrump announced a ceasefire deal with the Iranian-backed Houthisin Yemen which excluded Israel. He described the Houthi rebels as “brave” just days after one of their missiles hit Israel’s main airport, prompting many international airlines to suspend flights. Houthi attacks on Israel have continued.He previously dismissed Israeli calls for military action against Iran, instead opening talks with Tehran on ending its nuclear programme.Days after the Houthi ceasefire deal, news leaked that the Trump administration had dropped a Biden-era demand that linked progress on a Saudi Arabian civilian nuclear programme to normalising relations with Israel.Saudi Arabia has ruled out normalisation while Israel is at war inGaza. Trump’s move made clear he doesn’t want his hands to be tied as he heads to Riyadh later this week to seal billions of dollars in expected deals.His first trip to the region since returning to the White House will also include visits to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but not Israel. That conspicuous absence from the presidential itinerary would have been unthinkable in recent decades.Trump to embark on Middle East trip to meet Gulf alliesRead moreIlan Baruch, a former Israeli ambassador who now chairs the Policy Working Group, which advocates for a two-state solution, said: “Trump, it seems, has embarked on a bluntly new trajectory.“Israel was expecting the Trump administration to stay the course within a paradigm of ‘shared convictions and mutual strategic interests’. Trump is the first president in a generation to put this equation in doubt.”Strong, long-term support for Israel among much of Trump’s Republican base means Netanyahu is in a better position to hold on to US support than a leader like the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Nadav Eyal, a research scholar at Columbia University and a commentator with the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.“As to how serious the damage is, I would say right now it is not lasting … not a full blown crisis yet,” he said. “I suspect that both sides will try to mitigate, negotiate, and not make it a public confrontation.”Still, Netanyahu’s celebration of Israel-US ties at the start of the year, when he was the first foreign leader invited to Trump’s second-term White House, now look premature.Although Alexander’s release was agreed without Israeli input, Netanyahu responded initially not by thanking Trump but by in effect claiming credit for it.“The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander without anything in return will be possible due to the vigorous policy that we have led with the backing of President Trump, and thanks to the military pressure of IDF soldiers in the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a statement before his planned release.He is already facing the fury of hostage families and their supporters,who say he is extending the war – and their suffering – for personal political gain.One, Einav Tsengauker, described the prime minister on Monday as an “angel of death”.But Netanyahu’s truculent response to the release of Alexander risks stirring up the anger of a far more potent enemy, whose endless appetite for praise and deference is now the basis of global foreign policy from Beijing to Brussels.Trump’s post celebrating Alexander’s release spelt out what he wants to see next. “Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”There is broad support inside Israel for ending the war in return for the release of all hostages, with opinion polls showing more than two-thirds of the country back a deal.But those who want to carry on fighting include the leaders of two far-right parties at the heart of Netanyahu’s coalition. That leaves Netanyahu potentially facing a choice between shoring up his government, or shoring up Israel’s most important relationship.“If he wants Trump back on his side, then he needs to do things that would cost him the coalition,” said Pinkas, the former diplomat. “If you look at his biography and experience, he should be fully aware of all this. If you look at his behaviour, it’s as if he has no idea what’s going on.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpGazaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It escalated into drone and missile strikes by both sides, and deadly shelling along the disputed border dividing Kashmir.Both Trump and Pakistani officials credited the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the vice-president, JD Vance, with brokering peace between the two countries, after hours of intense negotiations withIndiaand Pakistan.How India and Pakistan conflict turned from brink of war to ceasefire in daysRead moreBut Modi made no reference to the US’s role in the ceasefire. Instead he maintained India’s line that it was Pakistan that first reached out to India’s head of military operations on Saturday for a ceasefire, and it was Pakistan that had called on the global community for help.In comments at the White House on Monday, Trump claimed the US had “stopped a nuclear conflict” in its interventions with India and Pakistan. He said: “I think it could have been a bad nuclear war, millions of people could have been killed. So I’m very proud of that.”Modi’s speech also alluded to the nuclear threat that had hung over last week’s escalating tensions, adding that in any future conflict with Pakistan, India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmailing”.On Monday, Pakistan security officials said one of the terms of the ceasefire was an agreement that future talks would be held in a third country, with the United Arab Emirates floated as a possible venue.In his speech, Modi made reference to possible future negotiations but said that “if we talk to Pakistan, it will be about terrorism only … it will be about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”.By Monday, it appeared as if the fragile ceasefire would continue to hold. Along the line of control, the disputed border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan, all the cross-border shelling and aggressions of last week showed no sign of resuming. India also reopened 32 airports across north India that had been shut down as cross-border hostilities escalated.The Indian army said in a statement on Sunday night: “The night remained largely peaceful across Jammu and Kashmir, and other areas along the international border.” In a phone call between military officials from India and Pakistan, both sides also agreed to reduce troop presence at the border.In Indian-administered Kashmir, expert teams were dispatched to the border areas to defuse unexploded bombs, as tens of thousands of people who had been evacuated from their villages in border areas returned home.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanKashmirNarendra ModiDonald TrumpSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Starmerjustified the cutby saying the money was necessary to fund defence.Chapman will tell the international development select committee on Tuesday that UK aid will be focused more on sharing British expertise than spending money.She will argue that supporting economies will be at the heart of how the UK spends its overseas aid budget, arguing helping countries to grow is the surest way to reduce poverty and deliver the UK’s plan for change by discouraging foreign populations from seeking to migrate.The unapologetic tone about the coming aid cuts may disturb someLabourMPs, as will her emphasis that her changes are likely to be welcomed by African countries.The Foreign Office said Chapman would say: “Partners across Africa, from Ethiopia to Zimbabwe, want to move on from receiving aid from the UK and that the government’s new approach will focus on the UK as an investor, not just a donor, and on partnering, not paternalism.” She will add that Britain will increasingly be sharing with countries the incredible expertise it has to offer, instead of direct funding.“The days of viewing government as a global aid charity are over,” she will say in remarks that are reminiscent of theclaim by Boris Johnsonthat the aid budget was seen as a “giant cashpoint in the sky”.Denying the government is opposed to international aid, Chapman will tell MPs: “We need to prioritise, be more efficient, and focus on impact above all else. We have to get the best value for money – for the UK taxpayer, but also for the people we are trying to help around the world.“We need to draw on all the expertise the UK has to offer, such as our world-class universities, the City of London, Met Office, Land Registry, HMRC, education, and health.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Non-essential spending, such as on entertainment or takeaway food, rose by 5.1% last month, its highest rate in almost two years.Thewarmest April on record, combined with a long Easter weekend, also meant more shoppers were out on the high street. Spending in physical shops increased by 6.9% after it dropped by 1.9% in March on a year-on-year basis.Julien Lafargue, a strategist at Barclays, said economic sentiment was “surprisingly positive” even amid uncertainty around the impact of US tariffs on the economy.“The recent decision by the Bank of England to further lower interest rates should add to this momentum. Similarly, the trade agreement reached between the US and the UK should provide some much needed visibility to businesses.” he said.Last week the Bank agreed tocut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25%and Keir Starmer announced he had reached a trade agreement with Donald Trump, the US president.The Barclays data chimed with separate research by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), an industry body. It found retail sales rose by 4.3% across the March and April period. Food sales in April grew 8.2% against last year, while non-food sales grew by 6.1%.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said Easter falling in April this year had contributed to the sales boost and the sunny weather had led to a boost in consumer spending.She said: “Food sales performed well as people brought together their family and friends for Easter celebrations, while sales of DIY, homeware and gardening goods shone bright as people made the most of the weather.”Online furniture sales rose by 7% in April, with household appliances up 8%. Linda Ellett, of the consultancy KPMG, said that this was likely a result of a rise in new homeowners due to stamp duty changes last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Led by the then chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, signatories agreed to allocate 5% of funds to private assets, with no stipulation about keeping any of that money in the UK.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “We are choosing to back British businesses and British workers. I welcome this bold step by some of our biggest pension funds, which will unlock billions for major infrastructure, clean energy and exciting startups.”However, some pension fund providers are understood to be wary about any government efforts to force firms to put money into British assets, which could result in poorer returns for retirees compared with overseas investments, possibly breaching their fiduciary duties to clients.While the accord itself does not mandate UK investments, there are concerns that the pensions bill, due later this year, could leave the door open for the government to dictate how fund money is used.Zoe Alexander, the director of policy and advocacy at the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association, said the government, for its part, had “committed to take action to ensure there is a strong pipeline of investable assets for pension schemes. With everyone playing their part, there is great potential to boost returns for savers while providing vital funding to productive growth areas.”The voluntary pact covers signatories’ defined contribution pension schemes, which do not guarantee a set income at retirement, and are the default plan for most UK workers.The 17 signatories, which also include Aegon UK, Aon, M&G and Mercer, manage combined portfolios currently worth £252bn, suggesting UK investment commitments worth just £12.6bn.However, the government’s calculations predict those portfolios will grow by about 17% per year, and possibly further under government pressure to consolidate retirement schemes into national “megafunds” that are intended to replicate success stories in Canada and Australia.The Treasury believes that will leave the pension providers with portfolios worth £740bn by 2030, and roughly £50bn of new funds for private market investments, when discounting for existing commitments. Around half that – £25bn – would therefore be aimed at UK projects and startups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Treasury has been juggling competing interests, with lobbyists also calling for reforms that could simultaneously boost ownership of stock-exchange listed companies.London lost out on a raft of blockbuster listings in recent years, including by UK chip designer Arm, which opted to list on Wall Street in August 2023.The buy now, pay later company Klarnafollowed suit, while other companies such as Paddy Power owner, Flutter, and the travel company Tui opted to switch their primary listings from London to rival hubs such as New York and Frankfurt.However, the metals investment company Cobalt Holdings bucked the trend on Monday,announcing plans to float in London in June in a rare boost to the UK stock exchange. Cobalt is planning to raise roughly $230m (£174m), with commodities trader Glencore due to take a 10% stake.The government is also expected to launch a consultation in coming weeks on a possible shake-up of the Isa market to incentivise more investment in British stocks via the tax-free accounts.Explore more on these topicsPensions industryFinancial sectorPensionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The door was damaged but nobody was hurt.The prime minister, who resides with his family in his official residence in Downing Street, is reportedly letting out the four-bedroom home.Police said they were treating this blaze as suspicious and said the decision to put the counter-terrorism command – SO15 – in charge of the investigation was a precaution.On Monday night, details of two more fires emerged. The LFB were called on Sunday morning shortly after 3am to a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington. The property is linked to the prime minister.One person was assisted to safety via an internal staircase by crews wearing breathing apparatus, LFB said. The fire was under control by 4am.Officers are also investigating a small car fire that happened just before 3am last Thursday on the same street as Starmer’s Kentish Town property.TheMetropolitan policeconfirmed it was investigating whether the fires were linked and said counter-terror officers were involved.A Met spokesperson said: “At this early stage of the investigation, officers are working to establish the circumstances of all three fires and are keeping an open mind as to whether there is any connection.“All are being treated as suspicious at this time, and inquiries remain ongoing.”In an earlier statement, the Met said: “As a precaution and due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure, officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command are leading the investigation into this fire. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the potential cause of the fire.“The cause of the fire continues to be investigated but at this stage is being treated as suspicious.”A No 10 spokesperson said: “I can only say that the prime minister thanks the emergency services for their work and it is subject to a live investigation. So I can’t comment any further.”News of the blaze came as Starmer on Monday morning revealed the government’s plan tocrack down on migration rules.The house, which he and his wife, Victoria, bought in 2004, has previously been targeted by protesters. Last year three people were found guilty of public order offences after apro-Palestinian demonstration outside the property.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLondonMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

If the government removes the Kidron amendment, it will set the scene for another confrontation in the Lords next week.Lady Kidron said: “I want to reject the notion that those of us who are against government plans are against technology. Creators do not deny the creative and economic value of AI, but we do deny the assertion that we should have to build AI for free with our work, and then rent it back from those who stole it.“My lords, it is an assault on the British economy and it is happening at scale to a sector worth £120bn to the UK, an industry that is central to the industrial strategy and of enormous cultural import.”The government’s copyright proposals are the subject of a consultation due to report back this year, but opponents of the plans have used the data bill as a vehicle for registering their disapproval.The main government proposal is to let AI firms use copyright-protected work to build their models without permission, unless the copyright holders signal they do not want their work to be used in that process – a solution that critics say is impractical and unworkable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sheriff’s officials presume the cause was an anchor failure but are still investigating. Three of the climbers – ages 36, 47 and 63 – were killed at the scene while the fourth person freed themselves and walked back to the trailhead then drove to a pay phone to call for help.Sheriff’s personnel and county search and rescue volunteers responded to the accident late Sunday morning about 16 miles (26km) west of Mazama in an area of rock formations that are popular with climbers, the Okanogan county sheriff’s office said in a social media post on Monday.The fourth climber sustained internal bleeding and a traumatic brain injury in the fall and was taken to a hospital in Seattle, Okanogan county undersheriff David Yarnell told the Seattle Times on Monday.“He didn’t realize he had as significant of internal injuries as he did,” Yarnell said.A helicopter rescue team from nearby Snohomish county helped recover the bodies from the technical, mountainous terrain.Investigators said they will inspect the climbers’ gear to help confirm the cause of the fall.Yarnell told the Seattle Times that all four climbers were locked in to the same anchor point which is “not preferred”. The anchor point will also be investigated to determine if it was pre-existing or their own gear.“All we know is that the anchor point that they were all tied off to failed,” Yarnell said.Explore more on these topicsWashington stateNational parksWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

A copy was obtained by the Guardian.“And it’s all Biden,” Plouffe adds, reflecting on the former US president’s decisions to run for re-election and then to cling on for more than three weeks after a catastrophic debate performance against Trump raised questions about his mental acuity and age. “He totally fucked us.”Plouffe, along with some other former Obama staffers, haspreviously been criticalof Biden and his role in the Democratic defeat. In the wake of Harris’s loss he posted a message on X – formerly known as Twitter – that the Harris campaign had begun in a “deep hole”. Helater deletedhis account.The book describes how Plouffe had received calls from donors worried about Biden’s diminishing energy, cognitive skills and ability to deliver a speech. He in turn pressed the White House and Democratic party if they felt sure that the then president could win another election and was repeatedly told he could.ButTapper, chief Washington correspondent for CNN, and Thompson, a national political correspondent for Axios, spoke to around 200 people for the book, including members of Congress and White House and campaign insiders. Some had been sounding the alarm about Biden’s mental acuity and about desperate efforts by his close staff and allies to hide the extent of his deterioration.One senior aide, who quit the White House because they did not think Biden should run, admits to the authors that “we attempted to shield him from his own staff so many people didn’t realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023”.“I loveJoe Biden. When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.”A prominent Democratic strategist says of Biden’s determination to seek re-election: “It was an abomination. He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people.”Original Sin is one of several eagerly awaited books about the 2024 election and an alleged White House conspiracy.Biden, 82, seemingly tried to preempt its revelations last week with media appearances on BBC Radio 4’s Today program and ABC’s talkshow The View. Biden has signed with Creative Artists Agency for representation andhired communications strategist Chris Meagherto help burnish his public reputation.But the 27 June 2024debate in Atlantawas no anomaly, the book argues. Since at least 2022 Biden has been increasingly prone to lose his train of thought and struggle to remember the names of top aides. His speeches can be incoherent and difficult to hear. When he proved incapable of delivering a two-minute video address without stumbling, aides filmed him with two cameras so the edit would be less obvious.Original Sin tells how prominent figures tried to intervene in various ways. Obama visited the White House in 2023 and warned Biden: “Just make sure you can win the race.”Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood powerbroker and significant Democratic donor, yelled at longtime Biden ally Ron Klain: “Joe Biden cannot run for re-election! He needs to drop out! He can’t win! What’s the plan B?” Klain admitted there was no plan B.AndChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, confronted the president after the debate last July at his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, and appealed to his desire to preserve his legacy. He warned Biden that, he if stayed in the race and lost to Trump then 50 years of “amazing, beautiful work goes out the window. But it’s worse than that – you will go down in American history as one of the darkest figures.”On their way out, the book reports, Biden put his hands on Schumer’s shoulders and told him: “You have bigger balls than anyone I’ve ever met.”Biden stepped aside on 21 July and quickly endorsed Harris, but it was too late, the authors contend. He had already helpedusher in the fatethat he most wanted to avoid: the return of Trump to the White House.Explore more on these topicsJoe BidenUS politicsKamala HarrisDonald TrumpDemocratsUS elections 2024newsShareReuse this content"

It just seems so heavily weighted in that way.”Allen is accused of sexual abuse by the director’s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow; Allen has always denied the allegations and two official investigations by social services departments in Connecticut and New York state were closed after finding no evidence against him. Allen’s son, investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, has been outspoken in support of Dylan, while adopted son Moses Farrow has been equally outspoken in defence of Allen. Penn worked with Allen onthe 1999 film Sweet and Lowdown, for which he was nominated for an Oscar.Penn said: “I am not aware of any clinical psychologist or psychiatrist or anyone I’ve ever heard talk or spoken to around the subject of paedophilia that, in 80 years of life, there’s accusations of it happening only once. I’m not aware of that. And when people try to associate what were his, let’s say, much younger girlfriends, right or wrong … is to me a different conversation.”He added: “I see he’s not proven guilty, so I take him as innocent, and I would work with him in a heartbeat.”In the same interview Penn cast new light onhis meeting with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2018at the height of the Syrian civil war. Penn was working on a now-abandoned documentary about the Arab Spring uprisings. Penn told Theroux he wanted permission to speak to Isis prisoners and speak to Syrians “on the street … without a minder”. According to Penn, al-Assad’s response was, “Absolutely, we have nothing to hide”, and then invited him to lunch.Penn said: “I got into his car and … we drove about 20 minutes through Damascus. To this day, I have to believe it was The Truman Show. That every block all the way to his house was staged. People driving up next to him and saying, “hello, Mr President”. “Hey, how are you?” This kind of thing. Virtually no visible security.”“We went to the house. Again, no sign of security of any kind. He’s there with his wife and his children. His children are as western as any California kid, and they’re listening to Kanye and dancing around.”However, Penn said as negotiations progressed, access was denied and he decided to drop the film.Penn also had harsh comments on bothDonald Trumpand Elon Musk. Trump, he said, might be “extremely smart for his time and what it valued”, adding: “But what he values is so base. I won’t equate that with intelligence. It’s truly void of soul. And really, it actively engages in cruelty.”Penn said that Musk,who until recently was heading a so-called “department of government efficiency” for Trump’s administrationresulting in the shutdown of swathes of public services, appeared only to “value destruction of things and people”, adding. “I can’t associate that with any intelligence that’s going to do humankind any good.”Saying he had met Musk “on several occasions”, Penn suggested that Musk’s insecurities were down to being a “prematurely balding teenager, white in apartheid South Africa, who has no social skills” and that in his view Musk was a combination of “a lot of destructive energy and a lot of stuff that may end up being very productive for other generations”.Penn also reflected on his tempestuous relationship withMadonna, to whom he was married between 1985 and 1989, and in the course of which he had a number of run-ins with paparazzi. Responding to Theroux’s question about Madonna’s statement in her 1991 documentary In Bed with Madonna that Penn was “the love of her life”, Penn said: “She’s very sweet. Look, she’s been a good friend for a lot of years. It didn’t take us long to realise that we had mistaken a good first date for a wedding partner. It didn’t take us long to recover after we got divorced, maybe a year, in a friendship. I have a lot of fond memories of it – it’s not all jail. But there was a lot of alcohol and she’d be fairly accusing me of that.”Penn also said that he may have helped accelerate the rise of celebrity culture by his occasionally violent responses to harassment by the media. “[It] added to the idea you can go provoke people like this idiot. I’m probably partially responsible for this explosion that led to all this. Extreme creepy fascination with famous people and things like that. My life was much simpler before [meeting Madonna]. But she became a lightning rod of attention. I was there.”Explore more on these topicsFilmSean PennWoody AllenElon MuskDonald TrumpMadonnaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

But its economic policies appear to be a major stumbling block to that ambition. Of those who originally planned to have a child in 2025, a majority say the current economy has affected their plans in some way, by either being unable to afford having a child (32%) or being uncomfortable having one in the current economy (33%).Bar chart listing the goals people have that they now are foregoing because of the economy. Such as buying a house, making a large purchase, having kids.Large percentages of those surveyed said they wanted to make major financial decision: 45% said they wanted to make a big purchase – a car, for example, or appliances – and 42% said they wanted to buy a house.But 75% of those who said they wanted to buy a home said the current economy had derailed them.Buying a home has long been seen as the benchmark for the American dream, but has become increasingly unaffordable for many Americans.Home pricesrocketedafter a buying frenzy during the pandemic, when interest rates were at zero, and have not come down since. Thoughmortgage rateshave fallen slightly since their recent peak of about 7.5%, the average 30-year mortgage rate in March was 6.7% – more than double what it was four years ago.The economic anxiety disproportionately affects the long-term goals of younger Americans, who are less likely to own a home already, be married or have kids. A majority of Gen Z and millennials renters (68%), for example, said they had a goal of buying a house, compared to just 29% of renters who are older.Much of the instability appears to come from the rising cost of living: 65% of Americans said they thought the cost of living had worsened since the start of the year, and half said it had made it more difficult to afford their living expenses.A vast majority (78%) said they had noticed increased grocery prices over the last few months, while 60% said they had also noticed monthly bills and everyday essentials getting more expensive.Although nearly half (48%) of Republicans said the cost of living has gone up this year, Republicans appear to be more optimistic about the overall state of the economy, particularly compared to when Joe Biden was in the White House.A line chart of the percent of people who say the US is currently in recession, over time. In 2024, 67% Republicans thought this was true, with Independents and Democrats hovering around 50%. However after Donald Trump’s inauguration that sentiment has flipped, with 59% of Democrats, and only 40% of Republicans agreeing.When respondents were asked last May whether they thought the US was experiencing a recession, 67% of Republicans said they believed the country was in a recession. Nearly a year later, the number has dropped to 40% of Republicans.On the other hand, 49% of Democrats believed the country was in a recession last May, compared with 59% who think the US is in a recession now. The US is not in recession and has not been since February to April 2020, during the Covid pandemic.Perhaps most concerning for Trump is that although only 33% of Republicans believe theUS economyis worsening, 64% of independents believe it is getting worse, more in line with Democrats (73%). More independents believed that the economy was in a recession last May (53%) compared to this April (46%), though the switch in opinion is much smaller than for Republicans.A bar chart of the things people say is going to be most financially hurtful to their families in 2025. Tariffs, at 29%, it the most common response, followed by government policies (23%) and companies (12%).Though Trump has said that his tariffs will “make America wealthy again”, it appears few Americans believe him.Tariffs came out on top in a list of things that Americans believe will most likely hurt their household financially in 2025. Nearly a third (29%) of respondents, including 39% of Democrats, 28% of independents and 21% of Republicans, said that tariffs will do the most harm. Over 20% said that government policies will be the most harmful, including 24% of independents.This survey was conducted online within the US by the Harris Poll from 24 to 26 April, 2025, among a nationally representative sample of 2,102 US adults.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump administrationTrump tariffsEconomicsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Much of what he unveiled that day has since been shelved.“The talks in Geneva were very friendly,” said Trump. “We’re not looking to hurt China.”The US president, who has claimed for months that tariffs could raise trillions of dollars for the US federal government, appeared to change tack on Monday. “The biggest thing to me is the opening up,” he said of China. “I think it would be fantastic for our businesses if we could go in and compete.”At an event largely focused on his administration’s efforts to lower drug prices, Trump signaled he may now turn his focus to the European Union, which he claimed had been “nastier” than China.“We have all the cards,” the president claimed, using similar rhetoric to describe relations with the EU that he was using about China just weeks ago. “They treated us very unfairly.”The 90-day lowering of tariffs applies to the duties announced by Trump on 2 April, which ultimately escalated to 125% on most Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with equivalent measures.China also imposed non-tariff measures, such as restricting the export of critical minerals that are essential to US manufacturing of hi-tech goods.The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said China’s retaliation had been disproportionate and amounted to an effective embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies.With the 115 percentage point deduction, Chinese duties on US goods will be lowered to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%. That is because the US tariffs include a 20% rate imposed by Trump before the latest trade war, which the president said was related to China’s role in the US’sfentanyl crisis.The fentanyl-related tariff will still apply, and Trump stressed that sector-specific US tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium will be unaffected.A spokesperson for China’s ministry of commerce said: “This move meets the expectations of producers and consumers in both countries, as well as the interests of both nations and the common interest of the world.“We hope that the US side will, based on this meeting, continue to move forward in the same direction with China, completely correct the erroneous practice of unilateral tariff hikes, and continually strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.”China’s yuan jumped to a six-month high on the signal that the trade war would be paused. Up to 16m jobs wereat risk in China, according to some estimates, while the US faced rising inflation and empty shelves thanks to dizzying tariffs on the biggest supplier of US goods.Bessent said he was impressed by the level of Chinese engagement on the fentanyl problem during the talks in Switzerland. “For the first time the Chinese side understood the magnitude of what is happening in the US,” Bessent said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previously, the hope was just that the two sides can sit down to talk, and the market had been very fragile. Now, there’s more certainty. Both China stocks and the yuan will be in an upswing for a while.”Hu Xijin, the former editor of the nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, said on social media the agreement was a “great victory for China in upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect”. Hu noted on Weibo that the recently agreedUK-US trade dealmaintained the US’s 10% tariff on UK imports, “while the UK did not implement reciprocal measures”.Wang Wen, the head of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said: “This is an unexpected achievement in Sino-US tariff negotiations.”However, Wang also urged caution, as he said the agreement “does not represent the resolution of the structural contradictions between China and the United States, nor does it mean that there will be no friction and serious differences between China and the United States in the future”.Stock market chartStock markets across Europe rose in the aftermath of the US-China announcement. Germany’s Dax index jumped by nearly 1%, as Mercedes-Benz, Daimler Trucks and BMW were among the biggest risers. France’s Cac 40 index rose by 1.3%. Shares in the Danish shipping group Maersk rose 12%.Brent crude rose almost 3% at $65.75 a barrel, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, jumped by 1.2%.After the announcement of the US-China agreement, analysts at the Dutch bank ING lifted their forecast for China’s growth this year. ING predicted a jump in exports from China to the US, reverting to forecasting 4.7% growth in theChinese economythis year.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsTariffsGlobal economyInternational tradeTrump tariffsChinaUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Shares in Denmark’s Novo Nordisk which makes the weight loss and anti-diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, dropped by 7.5% in Copenhagen, while the Swiss group Roche Holdings fell by 3.6%.In South Korea, shares in SK Biopharmaceuticals and Samsung Biologics fell by 2.1% and 4.7% respectively. In Hong Kong, the cancer drug maker BeiGene dropped by nearly 9% and Innovent Biologics fell by 5.7%.In Japan, the pharmaceutical sector index fell by more than 4%, while Indian pharma stocks also dropped.Alex Schriver, a senior vice-president at Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said: “Government price-setting in any form is bad for American patients. At a time when we are facing growing competition from China, policymakers should focus on fixing the flaws in the US system, not importing failed policies from abroad.”European drugmakers have beenurging the EUto allow higher medicine prices, warning that without stronger investment incentives, Europe would fall further behind the US.Threats of US tariffs on pharmaceutical products have prompted a number of firms to announce manufacturing investments in the country, including Switzerland’s Novartis and Roche, and the US firms Johnson & Johnson and Gilead Sciences. Trump hashinted at a reprievefor companies, saying they would be given “a lot of time” to shift operations to the US before facing levies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In return, China has cut its own tariffs on US imports to 10%, from the 125% it had imposed in retaliation against the White House.That still marks a big shift in the terms of trade between the two countries since before Trump came to power, but falls far short of what was in effect a trade embargo.The two sides have pledged to keep talking, but there was no reference in the statement put out by the White House to other gripes it has previously raised about China, including the weakness of the yuan.Instead, the statement hailed “the importance of a sustainable, long-term and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship”. The language was rather different to Trump’s Liberation Day speech, about the US being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far”.1:19US and China agree to lower tariffs in trade war de-escalation – videoIn other words, the president has caved. He may have been swayed by market wobbles but it seems more plausible that dire warnings from retailers about empty shelves – backed up by data showingshipments into US ports collapsing– may have strengthened the hands of trade moderates in the administration.Confronted with warnings of a shortage of toys, Trump told reporters that children should be happy with“two dolls instead of 30 dolls”, and they might “cost a couple bucks more” than usual. But it is difficult to imagine even this most bullish of presidents withstanding the attacks that would come his way if he began to be seen as responsible for Covid-style shortages of key goods in the world’s largest economy.Instead, the White House seems to have opted for tactical retreat. The China-US conflict was always the hottest theatre of confrontation in Trump’s trade war, with a longer history and deeper public support than his quixotic attacks on Mexico and Canada.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The age of the barrels is also a question mark. No one working here is old enough to vouch for that; the distillery believes they are anywhere from 100 to 125 years old, which is old in the grand scheme of barrels’ lifespans, but not unusual. But it can say with certainty, using records of its vintages, that these barrels are on their fifth use – at least.In the alcohol industry, when ageing liquor can easily take decades, the vessels that house them can also become more covetable over the years. In an age of disposable materials and dire news of plastics polluting our environment, reused wooden barrels exist in stark contrast. The lives of barrels are long, shockingly sustainable and currently imperiled by trade war.Many circumnavigate the globe and end their days in distilleries in remote corners of the world, originating in the forests of Hungary and moving from mountain towns in Canada to distilleries in the Caribbean and Mexico. At Hamilton, new American oak barrels hold fresh distillate, alongside the dinosaurs: French cognac barrels that show their age. They’re gray, stained and a little warped.Laws Whiskey House in Denver, Colorado, considers itself a “terroir-forward distillery”, the distillery’s brand manager, Casey Rizzo, told me over the phone. Terroir, the flavor that emerges from a specific environment, comes from both grain and barrels. “White American oak has a lot of natural wood sugars and natural vanillin. When you’re charring a barrel, you’re caramelizing it like a creme brulee. A barrel pulls whiskey in and then pushes it back out. Whiskey goes into the barrel clear and comes out with all that color, and vanilla and caramel flavors.”View image in fullscreenCognac barrels in Cognac, France, in 1999.Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianRizzo added: “We think of barrels as teabags. It gets used first for bourbon, like the first steep of a teabag. You get a lot of color and flavor from the barrel quickly. If you use the barrel again, it’ll take longer to impart, so maybe it’s used for scotch, which sits and ages longer. You mute the barrel’s flavors along the way.”Modern distilling relies on increasingly sophisticated technologies for monitoring conditions in cellars and fermentation, but distilleries still depend on lo-tech barrels to impart flavor and color to their products. Barrels consist only of wood and steel hardware, held together with no glue or nails. Remove its rings and give it a smack, and a barrel can unfurl like a chocolate orange. At some distilleries, employees still rotate their barrels by hand, a practice called clocking (rolling barrels according to a clock’s face). “This ensures proper exposure to the varying temperatures within the warehouse and adds consistency from barrel to barrel,” said Frank Krockenberger, director of hospitality forLoretto, Kentucky’s Star Hill Farm, home of the Maker’s Mark distillery.It was one stop on my journey to follow how barrels – so important for the beverage industry – are made. As a food and beverage writer, much of my work dredges up stories about monumental food waste, and the struggle to repurpose materials. But when it came to barrels, I found practices that were surprisingly sustainable, of wood being reused for centuries, and forests being protected.How to make a wine barrelJust as Kentucky is the epicenter of bourbon, so too is it the headquarters of bourbon barrel production. An hour away from Maker’s Mark, in Louisville, I witnessed the birth of American oak barrels at the Brown-Forman Cooperage, which produced barrels exclusively for the Cooper’s Craft and Jack Daniel’s brands, at least in terms of their first use(however,the cooperage recently closed, with the Kentucky Distillers’ Association citing changing consumer trends, European Union tariffs and taxes as reasons for the industry’s decline).Machines carved staves (the vertical planks of a barrel), and master coopers (the craftsmen who make barrels) hammered hoops around them before charring them on a rotating belt with enormous bursts of flame. The scene blended with modern efficiency and ancient technology (the Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote about coopers near the Alps who stored their wine in hooped wooden vessels, and there is archaeological evidence of barrels from ancient Egypt). The business had churned out barrels since 1945 and produced more than 60,000 barrels annually. But starting this year, Brown-Forman will now source barrels externally.Oak is commonly used for barrels, due to the ease of carving it, its durability in holding liquid (it is unlikely to warp or crack) and its ability to impart desirable flavors to spirits. But not all barrels are made of oak. I encountered barrels made from chestnut, hickory and maple, as well as more exotic woods used in the ageing of specialty products (Hawaiian koa used to age sugarcane rum, andBrazilian amendoim bravo used to age cachaça, for example). I also found hybrid barrels in Patron’s distillery, their bodies composed of Brown-Forman American oak staves, and their heads (the ends of the barrels) made of French limousin oak.View image in fullscreenBarrels being made at the Jack Daniel’s distillery.Photograph: David HandschuThe barrel-making process is zero-waste and astonishingly fast. It takes a cooper about 45 seconds to raise a single barrel. Sawdust is collected and used for horse and cow bedding. These barrels are frequently shipped flat, so “we don’t ship air”, one cooper told me, and are reassembled at their destinations.I found Brown-Forman’s trademark “B” stamp on dozens of rusted hoop rivets, 1,900 miles away in the cellars and storage rooms of Don Fulano in Jalisco, Mexico. In the ageing rooms of adifferent tequila distillery, Volcán, I found barrels containing decade-old tequila held together by rivets stamped with Bs. The trained eye can spot other signs of where a barrel came from, said Greg Roshkowski, the vice-president of wood planning, procurement and processing at Brown-Forman, Jack Daniel’s and Cooper’s Craft’s parent company, wrote via email. He said some experts “will be able to spot Brown-Forman barrels by other various characteristics, such as the head placement, chime (the beveled edge of a barrel, where the staves meet), locations of hoops, etc. It’s certainly fun to walk through other countries and their warehouses and see 50- to 60-year-old Brown-Forman barrels ageing all sorts of spirits from rum to scotch and Irish whiskey.”Meet the seed collector restoring California’s landscapes - one tiny plant at a timeRead moreThe international use of barrels is part and parcel of the global liquor industry. Large conglomerates like LVMH, Brown-Forman and Suntory have multiple spirits brands in their portfolios, and barrels make their rounds internally. A Kentucky-made barrel might end up in Scotland to age scotch because Brown-Forman owns both the Jack Daniel’s and Glendronach brands.Given the barrels’ long lives and travels, makers are investing in regenerative cultivation of their raw materials. Though mature white oak trees are plentiful, the species could be on the decline, primarily due to a “lack of active management that creates the conditions needed for oak seedlings to thrive”, according to the US Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service. Maker’s Mark, part of Suntory, partnered with the University of Kentucky in a genome-mapping project of the American white oak to preserve the species. The partnership has also led to the establishment of the world’s largest repository of American white oak trees. It’s 24 acres with nearly 10,000 trees representing more than 400 varieties of white oak, amongother sustainability initiatives.The barrel-flavor equationSustainability isn’t the only concern. Manipulating flavors with barrels is a science and art. Roshkowski said: “[The barrels] are part of their recipes. You’ll see callouts for once-used Jack Daniel’s barrels from Scotland to Guyana, Russia to Malaysia and beyond. These barrels will live on for another 30 to 50 years ageing fine spirits, coffee beans, honey, soy sauce or Tabasco.”Lucas Assis, an agave and sugarcane spirit educator, said: “Fortaleza usedcharanda[a rare Mexican sugarcane rum] barrels for their winter blend [last year],” he said. “Barrels tell a story. It doesn’t matter how many times you use it. French oak is still going to bring back chocolate or spiciness. Brazilian amburana wood gives a cinnamon finish.”Distilleries that aren’t owned by large conglomerates enlist the help of a barrel broker who can source unique barrels. Mara Smith sources old pinot noir barrels from France through a broker, as they give her Inspiro tequila a rosy hue and flavors like “berries, some nuttiness, a floral [aroma] on the nose”.Barrels foster circular economies. I see Whiskey Del Bac barrels at Tucson’s Monsoon Chocolate. “We get mesquite-smoked whiskey barrels a couple days after they’ve been drained, then we take refined chocolate, put it into nut milk bags, cut the top of the barrel off, and age the chocolate for four to six months. Cocoa butter is the carrier of aroma in chocolate, so it’s sitting there, absorbing the barrel’s aroma,” said Adam Krantz, the company’s founder.I bite into the barrel-aged chocolate, tasting whiskey and smoke. A barrel is near the end of its life when it gets to Monsoon. Slicing it open for chocolate renders the barrel useless for anything other thanfurniture,plantersand a rather stunning variety of items such as golf ball holders,ax targets, lazy susans and more, all under the Wine Enthusiast product umbrella.View image in fullscreenA winery cellar worker pumps fermented pinot noir juice into new French oak barrels for ageing near Healdsburg, California, in 2012.Photograph: George Rose/Getty ImagesIn remote, mountainous Banff, Canada, Park Distillery sources barrels from wineries and other distilleries. “We are looking for sweet and rich flavors from the barrel. Lignin, vanillin, tannins and lactones are some of the important compounds in the wood,” said master distiller Scott Coburn. Like Tucson’s Hamilton Distillers, the operation is relatively small, and it receives assembled barrels. After about three uses for whisky (which must be aged for a minimum of three years in Canada), it uses them for barrel-aged gin and cocktails. Then the barrels are passed on to breweries for barrel-aged beer. Once spent, the barrels meet their end in Banff’s restaurants as decoration.Rizzo outlines a Laws Whiskey barrel’s typical lifespan. “We age our Four Grain Bourbon and send those used bourbon barrels [after four to 10 years] to a local apiary, Bee Squared, in Berthoud, Colorado. They age their honey in those used barrels for 90 days to produce a glorious local barrel-aged honey. We then get those barrels back and put more bourbon into them to make a natural honey-aged bourbon [which takes a year and a half of ageing]. One went to our friends at Lady Justice Brewing, who aged a honey bock beer in the honey barrel. Once that was finished in six months to two years, they put malted barley grain inside the barrel for another six months to two years to flavor the grain to produce another beer. And then the barrel is made into furniture.” These barrels had seven lives.But barrels’ travels are in dangerRecent tariffs are making the very aspect of manufacturing barrels, distilling alcohol and selling its finished product more expensive. In American winemaking, particularly in California, French oak barrels will be affected by the EU’s retaliatory tariffs. Since barrels are essentially an ingredient in any given type of alcohol’s recipe, a winemaker would not be able to easily switch out a type of wood they have used previously for something available domestically.Since tariffs are duties placed on imported goods, used barrels costs are spiking, whether they are entering the US or departing it (due to retaliatory tariffs).American spirits companies saw the effect that potential tariffs had on Canada immediately, as their products werepulled off Canadian shelves in February, in response to the 25% tariffs on Canadian goods that the Trump administration had put in place then. This has been a particular blow to American bourbon and cooperages, conjoined industries already imperiled by changing consumer tastes.“Even when barrels aren’t directly targeted by tariffs, they’re deeply tied to the global trade of the products they help create – bourbon, wine, tequila, rum.Tariffson those goods ripple down to the barrel market. Producers are scaling back how much they’re ageing and how far ahead they’re willing to invest, and that’s hit the barrel world hard. Used bourbon barrel prices have dropped nearly 50% in the past six to eight months. “Some days, it feels like they’re falling by the hour,” said Matt Albrecht, owner of River Drive Cooperage in Buxton, Maine, who also sells and sources used barrels.“It’s a perfect storm,” said Albrecht. American producers are now rushing to empty barrels and bottle their spirits ahead of expected tariffs and are flooding the market. “Meanwhile, international buyers, many of whom were paying top dollar for barrels just last year, are holding off, betting that prices will drop even further if the US economy stumbles. That’s led to a standoff: supply is high, demand is frozen and prices are volatile.”The consequences of this current disruption in the barrel economy might not be seen for years. “What’s on the market today started as trees harvested years ago. It takes at least two to four years to go from log to freshly emptied bourbon barrel, often longer,” said Albrecht.After the 2008 recession, there was a barrel shortage in 2012, which meant there was four-year lag in the barrel supply chain. One can only hope that these emblems of sustainable, circular economies may continue to age gracefully, their journeys unhindered by tariffs.Explore more on these topicsWineOur unequal earthFood & drink industryTrump tariffsTariffsAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the government removes the Kidron amendment, it will set the scene for another confrontation in the Lords next week.Lady Kidron said: “I want to reject the notion that those of us who are against government plans are against technology. Creators do not deny the creative and economic value of AI, but we do deny the assertion that we should have to build AI for free with our work, and then rent it back from those who stole it.“My lords, it is an assault on the British economy and it is happening at scale to a sector worth £120bn to the UK, an industry that is central to the industrial strategy and of enormous cultural import.”The government’s copyright proposals are the subject of a consultation due to report back this year, but opponents of the plans have used the data bill as a vehicle for registering their disapproval.The main government proposal is to let AI firms use copyright-protected work to build their models without permission, unless the copyright holders signal they do not want their work to be used in that process – a solution that critics say is impractical and unworkable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The nondescript, windowless TV interview room below the Allianz Arena could not be more of a contrast to the giddy, beer-soaked, firework-lit riot of celebration going on outside as Bayern Munich savoura 34th league title. There’s also something different about Kane,and it’s not just the gold medal.The Kane visage that usually accompanies him at the end of a cup final, that little-boy-lost look of overwhelming disappointment, is gone. You cannot help but notice the broad grin, the relaxed body language and the tactile ease in the greeting, a man intoxicated by euphoria. “It’s been a long night,” he says, beaming. “And it’s just the beginning.”Xabi Alonso basks in hero’s sendoff but Dortmund ruin Leverkusen party | Andy BrassellRead moreThomas Müller, who has been playinghis last home game after 25 years at Bayern, is hosting a late-night soiree in one of Munich’s more fashionable bars to which Kane is invited. First, though, he will be rejoining his wife, Katie, and three of his four children, who have just been celebrating with him on the pitch following Bayern’s 2-0 win against Borussia Mönchengladbach, alongside Tim Sherwood, the coach who gave him his chance at Tottenham, and John McDermott, now the Football Association technical director but previously Tottenham’s head of academy. Both have flown in for the evening. It is typical Kane wants to share this moment with fellow travellers on what has been a very long journey.There is no player in the modern age who has been as good as Kane and won nothing. Of course there have been extraordinary individual goalscoring awards, World Cup and Premier League golden boots, and the BundesligaTorjägerkanone, the German equivalent. Yet never a club trophy. “So many jokes, so many sneers” is a lyric that could have been written for Kane, as well as the England team, given the Euro, Champions League and League Cup finals where he has had to stand manfully applauding the victors while staring glumly at another losers’ medal.Kane’s 71 goals and counting for England won’t be beaten any time soon; he took Jimmy Greaves’s record at Tottenham; yet the role of gallant loser seemed to be the one life’s casting director had assigned to him. His Jonah status can’t have improved when he turned up at pretty much the most successful club in Europe last season and Bayern had their first campaign in 12 years without a trophy. “It’s nice to be on the other side to be honest, to have that celebration I’ve not had before,” he says. “I’ve seen my fair share of other teams lifting trophies.”In the hour preceding this interview, Kane has been making good on his celebration deficit, gallivanting up and down the Allianz Arena like an excited schoolboy, chasing his teammate Eric Dier in an attempt to douse him with a huge three-litre glass of beer. His compatriot showed an impressive turn of pace to escape, though Kane himself was cornered by Leon Goretzka and showered in Bavarian brew, a traditional celebration in these parts. This was what he came to Germany for.View image in fullscreenKane gets a beer shower at the Allianz Arena.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/AP“It doesn’t change me as a player,” Kane reflects. “I’m no different to what I was before I had won. It was something that was missing from my résumé. Maybe once you’ve won your first one there’s a little less to talk about and throw my way, but again it comes with it.”He’s reminded of Rory McIlroy’s quip that journalists would have nothing to talk about after he ended his 11-year major droughtat the Masters last month. “In a way, [it’s] a little bit [like that],” Kane acknowledges. “That was one of the best tournaments I ever watched and my emotions were through the roof because I’m good friends with Justin Rose. But part of me wanted Rory to win and you saw the emotions that he went through. I can’t imagine what they were going through.”Except, of course, he absolutely can. “It is a weight on the shoulders. I’m very aware of the fact that I hadn’t won it. I put myself under more pressure than anyone else. As the years go by you start to think: ‘Is it going to happen?’ You keep going, you keep pushing yourself and good things come and this is definitely one of those. And we’ll see what people talk about now. I’m sure they’ll find something and I’ll take it in my stride.”Kane, Dier and their teammates had watched on TV the previous weekend as their rivals Bayer Leverkusen drew a match thatconfirmed Bayern as champions. It wasn’t long before the watchalong descended into tuneless renditions of We Are the Champions and more Bavarian beer-swilling. “Once it was official, a switch just went off and me and Eric especially started getting the champagne going, the songs going and everyone else just turned up,” Kane says. “That was a special night when everyone completely let free.”On Saturday in Munich they could celebrate in front of their own fans and receive the trophy. It seemed fitting that once the team captains, Manuel Neuer and Müller, had lifted theMeisterschale, the player to whom they presented it first was Kane. He had waited long enough. This is why two years ago he had wrenched himself away from Spurs, who themselves have become a byword for underachievement.“It was a big decision,” Kane says. “I could have easily stayed at Spurs, played in the Premier League and carried on scoring goals, but I wanted to push myself. I wanted to see how good I could be and play in the biggest games, the biggest title run-ins and Champions League games. I’ve done that. Though we’ve not been successful in the other competitions we’ve played in big games and big nights. And I think that tonight is just the start of something special.”View image in fullscreenKane celebrates with Vincent Kompany, the Bayern manager.Photograph: Marco Steinbrenner/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockThat he could share this night with his family and children (other than the youngest, Henry, 21 months old and safely home asleep) made it extraordinary. Louis, aged four, had joined him in front of Munich’s most passionate fans on theSüdkurveand, encouraged by dad, shot a penalty into an empty net. Only a curmudgeon, or an Arsenal fan, could fail to be moved, though the ensuing roar of celebration was an unforeseen problem. “He was scared of the celebrations. He’s going to have to work on that,” Kane says with a laugh. “Those are the memories that last a lifetime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThat he has been the honest trooper of English football and never, until now, the decorated hero, perhaps makes Kane more relatable. His is not the gilded path of the teen prodigy. At 19 he was loaned to Norwich for five months, played five times, scored zero goals, had one assist and is principally remembered for a terrible miss on his debut. He was relegated to the under-21 team where they wouldn’t let him take a penalty they had been awarded.An equally unsuccessful loan at Leicester followed, where he famously sat on the bench with Jamie Vardy. He would stay out after training with a bag of balls, honing his finishing while some teammates scoffed at his assiduousness. The experience still animates him. “I think back to Norwich and Leicester. I wasn’t playing but doing extra training and finishing and had some players laughing and saying: ‘I don’t know why you’re doing that!’ All those little moments made me who I am. It’s the stuff you do behind the scenes, that no one sees, that really makes a difference.”At that time he came across The Brady Six documentary about the legendary quarterback Tom Brady. The six referred to the sixth round of the NFL draft to which Brady was assigned, the rank of an ­also-ran foot soldier. “It definitely helped me because I saw a lot of similarities between me and him,” Kane says. “No one expected him to do what he went on to do. I think mine is a story that people can relate to, of hard work and never giving up.”Bayern Munich v Leverkusen has been a great rivalry. But is it over? | Andy BrassellRead moreThat is why Kane wants to promote Mental Health Awareness Week, which is also the goal of theHarry KaneFoundation. “There’s a lot of causes that need help and a lot of situations that I could have used my platform for but I just think that mental health is something I had a little bit of understanding with,” Kane explains. “There wasn’t just a straight line to the top [for me]. I had to really go through some tough times. Of course, not tough in terms of life threatening, but I felt like I had a connection especially for the younger generation. I’ve been on this journey. I’m learning more and more [about mental health] and for sure it’s something that I’ll really try to take on and help as much as I can when my career has finished.”He is sympathetic towards gen Z, raised amid Covid and the rise of smartphones. “It is tough,” he says. “Sometimes you can be carried away or get taken away from yourself, especially nowadays with social media.” Kane’s principal advice, though, is fairly obvious given his life story: “Never give up. Take the ups with downs. In sport, in life, [it] isn’t perfect. You’re going to have moments where things don’t go your way and you have to find it within yourself to get through that.“I’ve been lucky enough to have great family, a great wife, great friends around me. I’m learning more and more that mental health is about talking to people, whether family members, friends, people in a coffee shop. It’s good to talk. When you go through life you have to expect some great moments and some tough moments but always carry on. That’s the message I would say to anyone. Always carry on. Don’t give up.” It is a personal pep talk as well as sound advice.Now Kane has won a trophy, it is not as though social-media sceptics will melt away. “In football, it’s always going to be: ‘OK, you’ve won this, but you haven’t won that,’” Kane says. “Until you’ve won it all – and there’s not many people who have won it all – you have to keep going.” Whatever happens now, he will always have a beer-soaked night in Munich to remember.Explore more on these topicsHarry KaneBayern MunichinterviewsShareReuse this content"

No criminal charges or tickets have been issued over the crash, although the investigation is ongoing.“We are deeply saddened to learn the crash resulted in three fatalities, as confirmed by Largo Police, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those lost,” Miami said in a statement. The school has launched its own investigation into the collision.The 20-year-old Hayes was one of the nation’s top-rated linebackers coming out of high school and chose Miami after receiving offers from schools such as Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, Notre Dame and Ohio State. He played in 12 games in his freshman season in 2024, mostly on special teams, and recorded an interception against Florida A&M.Other Miami playersoffered prayers for Hayeson social media on Saturday night.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

This was reinforced on a windy Monday afternoon as ­Raducanu was outclassed by a supreme display from the fourth seed Coco Gauff. Fresh off her run to theMadrid Open final, Gauff played another brilliant match in a contest between two former US Open champions to reach the quarter-finals in Rome with an emphatic 6-1, 6-2 win.Jannik Sinner returns with a win to leave rocking Rome celebrating againRead more“I found it really hard today,” ­Raducanu said. “I think the conditions were so different. It was really windy and so high bouncing, and I just found like every ball was out of my strike zone, so I couldn’t really get a good hit. And then it just kept getting higher and higher. And it was really hard. And Coco played a great match too, and found great shape, great width, great depth. I felt outplayed today, but it was good to kind of see where I’m at in these conditions.”After starting the season with some of thebest tennis of her career at the United Cupin ­January, Gauff’s first few months of the year were disappointing, with early defeats by ­players ranked outside the top 50. But the 21‑year‑old’s fortunes have ­rapidly turned on clay, which ­generally gives her more time to set up her forehand and impose its heavy topspin while ampli­fying her defensive skills.So far in her career, Gauff’s biggest titles have come on hard courts, but she is equally ­dangerous on clay. As she carefully pushed ­Raducanu back and moved her around the court, Gauff used her forehand to overwhelm her opponent, spinning the ball high out of the Briton’s strike zone. Alongside her superior weight of shot and immaculate depth, Gauff’s defence made it so difficult to hit through her.View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff’s relentless depth and weight of shot pinned her opponent back.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP“You feel like there’s no space on the court,” Raducanu said. “You don’t really know where to hit, especially when she’s playing like that. I think both sides held up really well. I think her serve held up really well. So, yeah, it was a good testament to her. She’s two [No 2 in the live rankings] in the world for a reason, and I definitely felt that. And so that’s it.”This is not the first time ­Raducanu’s game has looked underpowered against the elite. Although the 22-year-old times the ball sweetly and is a solid athlete, she was outmatched in both departments by Gauff, as was the case duringher defeat against Iga Swiatek in Australia. The challenge for Raducanu is to continue adding layers to her game to more effectively disrupt a player of Gauff’s calibre. She also has to learn how to perform better in windy conditions, which has been a consistent issue.Raducanu took an optimistic view on the defeat, stressing the importance of learning from it. “For me to see the ball today that I was receiving was really valuable. I haven’t really played these top opponents very often, because I haven’t been in the tournament for long enough, so for me to be kind of playing them now is good exposure.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She played quality tennis, blending her ­attacking instincts with greater variety and she now sits at No 42 in the live rankings, two places behind the British No 1 Katie Boulter. Raducanu should head into the French Open full of confidence.“I take good confidence [from this].

There is no division or dissent on that score.Arsenal’s visit to Anfield should also have been one long celebration, as well as an opportunity to demonstrate the gulf between the Premier League’s first and second-placed teams this season. The first half played out exactly that way. Arsenal may have produced a reaction that increased Mikel Arteta’s anger before Alexander‑Arnold’s introduction – “I hate reaction, I like action” – but the party was over as soon as the Real Madrid‑bound defender replaced Conor Bradley in the 67th minute.Football Daily | Trent Alexander-Arnold and the Anfield jeers of fans who feel jiltedRead moreThe boos that greeted the announcement of Alexander‑Arnold’s name before kick‑off and his entry on to the pitch were a bigger surprise for their intensity and mass than the fact they were voiced at all. Anfield cannot be praised for its passion and noise on a European night then castigated for adopting an entrenched and emotive position when one of its own decides toleave the club on a free. Equally, the boos that subsequently accompanied almost every touch of the ball from the feetthat brought youthatcorner, those record Premier League assists by a defender and countless moments of breathtaking ingenuity, were grim and self-defeating. Arsenal equalised seconds after the right‑back was jeered playing a pass, his teammates appearing momentarily stunned by the sound. At least the title wasn’t on the line.In some respects the timing of Alexander-Arnold’sannouncement that he was leaving Liverpoolwith three games of a triumphant season remaining did everyone a favour apart from himself. It has given those infuriated by his desire for a fresh challenge, with Real Madrid almost certainly his next destination, plus the manner of his departure, a chance to vent their spleen before Crystal Palace arrive at Anfield on the final day. Better to condemn in the penultimate home game than overshadow a trophy presentation in which Alexander‑Arnold will deservedly play a part. Van Dijk said: “We want to win two more games and after the final whistle, including him, lift the trophy up and celebrate like we have never done before.”It will give Arne Slot food for thought the next time Bradley’s energy levels drop and he looks to the bench for a replacement. The head coach justified the substitution on Sunday on the basis thathe was hired to win gamesand that the world-class full-back almost helped him to achieve another. However, Slot has exceeded what he was hired to do in his first season at Liverpool. He can afford to take the easy way out against Brighton next Monday and Palace. Overlooking Alexander‑Arnold in the final two games would generate fresh headlines, of course, but they would be more palatable than what unfolded on Sunday.That, in turn, will allow the rest of theLiverpoolsquad to enjoy the finale their efforts this season merit. There was dismay among Liverpool’s players at the treatment meted out to their colleague against Arsenal. Curtis Jones and Cody Gakpo made a point of standing up in the dugout and applauding his free-kick following Mikel Merino’s dismissal.Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, both of whom could have been in Alexander-Arnold’s position on Sunday had they notsigned fresh deals a few weeks ago, showed their appreciation of the defender when he entered the fray. A disbelieving Dominik Szoboszlai gestured towards the Kop when Alexander‑Arnold’s applause for the fans was met with more boos after the final whistle. It is ridiculous that a season of unexpected glory should contain an element of rancour as it nears the conclusion.View image in fullscreenEvery touch Trent Alexander-Arnold made after coming on as a substitute was met with loud boos on Sunday.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“Everyone has different opinions or different phases of their career so you can’t compare our situation – me and Mo in this case – with Trent,” Van Dijk said. “I was very happy to eventually come to an agreement with the club. Obviously it’s not really a Liverpool thing to go about it the way we did with me and Mo but, like I said when it was announced, I’m happy and proud to extend because for me there is no other place to be at this point.“Everyone shares different opinions and he feels like he has done it all – and he did it – and he wants to try something different. You are speaking about one of the biggest clubs of all in Real Madrid, who he might go to as I read in the media.

When the final whistle is there we will miss him after that but we still have two more games, the trophy lift and a parade so there are plenty of moments we can share together.”Almost every player on the pitch on Sunday has, at some point, disappointed a fanbase by moving on. The professionalism that has shaped Alexander-Arnold’s decision was evident in Van Dijk’s response when asked whether he had tried to convince the homegrown talent to stay. “What do you think I was doing?” he replied.“I was sorting my own stuff out, I had to secure my future as well and I was quite busy doing that. As club captain I was trying to secure my future. I’m not the youngest any more and I have a family to provide for and I don’t want to be left in the dark. There were loads of other options but Liverpool is the place for me.”Liverpool is no longer the place that a unique talent from West Derby wants to be after 20 years at his boyhood club, having won every trophy available to him and with designs on experiencing a new life. Good luck to him, although Alexander‑Arnold must have known there would be torment as well as another trophy on his way out.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

But if there was one crumb of comfort for manager Chris Wilder and his side in missing out on automatic promotion with a couple of games to spare, it was the fact that they had time to regather themselves and prepare for the playoffs.Sheffield United 3-0 Bristol City (6-0 agg: Championship playoff semi-final, second leg – live reactionRead moreHistory has often shown that teams who miss out on the final day of the season struggle to pick themselves up and go again in such a short time. Sheffield United ultimately made light work of the challenge here though, with back-to-back 3-0 wins to end Bristol City’s impressive season and move to within one win of an instant return to the Premier League with Wilder at the helm.There has never been a greater points gap between the teams finishing third and sixth inChampionshiphistory than the 22 that separated these two teams. In truth, that gulf was evidenced even further here – with the biggest winning margin in playoff history a fair reflection of how good Sheffield United have been this season.Goals from Kieffer Moore, Gus Hamer and substitute Callum O’Hare ensured a six-goal winning margin over the two legs, meant the nerves were ultimately minimal on the night and that only Sunderland or Coventry stand between the Blades and the promised land once again. For a side who were embroiled in financial chaos in the summer, Wilder deserves credit for the job he has done.“You’ve got to enjoy nights like these,” he said. “It’s been a challenging season and to have a night like this in front of our fans will give them a boost that they deserve. To get through that first 25 minutes was key and then we found a bit of rhythm. We can sit back and watch tomorrow night and enjoy it.”View image in fullscreenGustavo Hamer (centre right) celebrates after making it 2-0 to Sheffield United on the night.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesThis city was host to the greatest comeback in playoff history two years ago when Sheffield Wednesdayoverturned a four-goal deficitto defeat Peterborough on the way to promotion back to the Championship. In truth, despite a game effort from the Robins, there was not really a chance of anything like a repeat here under the lights at Bramall Lane.“I’m really proud of the players,” Liam Manning, the Bristol City manager, said. “You can come here and sit off but we tried to play like us. We had a go.”He deserves immense praise for taking Bristol City to the playoffs, and his side did not go down without a fight here. They had the better of the early chances and had they claimed an early goal, the nerves may have ramped up a shade or two.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

United grew in authority and when a smart corner led to Moore heading home, the nerves evaporated inside Bramall Lane. There was no complacency from the Blades, and they finished the job emphatically after half-time with not only two more goals, but a controlled and measured display that reflected how well they have performed this season.Another set-piece led to Hamer doubling the lead on the night with a well-worked finish and a big ­deflection, a moment which allowed Wilder the opportunity to rest some of his big guns, Moore and Hamer included, with Wembley in mind. Those substitutes also made an impact, with one of them, O’Hare, adding a third in the 83rd minute to nudge Wilder about his chances of a start in the final.Incredibly, the Blades have not won at Wembley for 100 years: the 1925 FA Cup final. Few know more than Wilder what it would mean for that wait to come to an end next Saturday. These two semi-final performances hint that moment could finally be about to arrive.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedBristol Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

At the end of another wild, joyous and exhausting afternoon, anotherclásicowon their way, the captain called them all into the middle of Montjuïc. And whereRaphael Dias Bellolicalls, his teammates follow, all the way to the title. Which was why, an arm raised, a wrist wrapped in a blue bandage lifted above the crowd like a symbol of strength, the Brazilian who has been better than anyone anywhere, now gathered them round and led them into a lap of honour together. It was time to give thanks; time to get thanks, too.They had earned it. Real Madrid, who were supposed to be invincible, had been beaten again. Sunday was the fourth time time this season, a record unmatched in 125 years: four victories in as many cities, Barcelona scoring four goals to go with thethree,fiveandfourin the previous clásicos, a circle closed. The first was the statement that started it all, adeclaration of intentat the Bernabéu; the second won the Super Cup in Saudi Arabia; the third brought the Copa del Rey back from Seville; now they had virtually secured the league,a 4-3 wintaking them seven points clear with nine left, double almost done.Carlo Ancelotti confirmed as first foreign manager of Brazil men’s team in a centuryRead moreOff they went, clapping and waving and bouncing about because whoever didn’t was aMadridista, the words say. In the directors’ box, Travis Scott was stargazing. Below him, where a fan had offered Vinícius Júniora beach ball to play with, they were flying flags and singing. Almost all the 50,319 people in the Olympic Stadium were in no hurry to head home, happy to take it all in, and the hundred or so behind the glass cage high in the away end were given no choice but to stay for a while and wonder what might have been. No one had expected to be herewhen it all beganin August, not like this.Some didn’t imagine being here at all. Back then, the goalkeeper who had just won the double wasn’t even a goalkeeper any more. Wojciech Szczesny was beginning retirement in Marbella, sitting on the beach with a cigarette. When they called, he was playing golf with his son; now, they were playing again, only this was football on the Montjuïc pitch, the families who had been through it too invited to join in. Raphinha didn’t think he would be here either, let alone leading them to the league. And yet here he was, scorer of two more on the day they had done it, holding another player-of-the-match award – even if he insisted Barça still needed a win and he would have given it to someone else.View image in fullscreenFermin Lopez of Barcelona celebrates with Alejandro Balde during the win over Real Madrid.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesActually,and yet? Maybe that should readbecause? Maybe it isbecauseRaphinha thought he might not be here at all,becausesome people really didn’t want him to be and others really,reallydid, that he did so much to ensure that they were. “Not even in my wildest dreams did I imagine living these moments,” he said, but maybe it is the possibility of leaving that turned him into such a leader. In part, perhaps, it was the combination of rejection and affection that fuelled him; maybe that is what made him Spain’s best player this season.Nowbestis another word you might want to put a question mark next to. No one has played like Pedri, and probably no onecanplay like Pedri. Robert Lewandowski is their top scorer, a goal a game at 36. Lamine Yamal is ludicrous,you know that. You may want to talk about Iñigo Martínez and Jules Koundé, and you would be right to. And Szczesny is the story of this or any season. Besides, this is a collective success,at the hand of Hansi Flick. Yet Flick says Raphinha is “a clear example of how this team works”, racing into every battle, relentlessly taking them all with him, and there is no one who has done what he has: a double winner with 34 goals and 25 assists, when it’s not even about the stats. “I have never had a player like him,” the coach says.Raphinha had never been a player like this, either. Flick believed in him when others had not, when even he wasn’t entirely sure any more. The day Flick was announced as coach, he called the Brazilian and told him he was counting on him. Barcelona werevery publicly pursuing Nico Williams, trying torecreate the partnership and friendshipwith Lamine Yamal that hadbeen so good for Spain, and doing so meant Raphinha not only vacating his place on the wing but also accepting a transfer that would generate the money they needed to force Athletic to sell.View image in fullscreenFerran Torres celebrates after Raphinha’s third goal for Barcelona.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersA picture soon circulated of Williams in aBarcelonashirt with a No 11 on the back, Raphinha’s No 11. And if that was only a photoshop, posted by an influencer, if it shouldn’t have mattered, it did – Raphinha admitted it hurt and called it a “lack of respect.” He knew that dream was not just coming from outside, some in the boardroom looking at him and seeing dollar signs. He knew too that his previous coach didn’t have faith in him either, or at least that is how it felt. It wasn’t just his imagination, either. In 60 games under Xavi, Raphinha played 90 minutes only seven times: twice in the first season, five times in the second.“The call from Flick was very important in my decision to stay,” Raphinha said, an invitation to resist the pressure, to not allow anyone to push him towards the door. There was something striking about the fact that his retelling of that story included the observation that Flick had put his mind at rest “without even knowing me or seeing me in person”. And then when he did, the promise was fulfilled. This season, he has played the full 90 in 22 of his 29 league starts and has been on the pitch every minute of the last eight Champions League games, playing 11 in full across the competition.That’s a product of performance of course but it can be self-creating and self-perpetuating. “Now, I have no fear, I’m not under pressure, needing to do something well [to stay on],” he admitted, and there was also a tactical variation: the change of wing, Lamine Yamal playing right, Raphinha playing left with Alex Balde flying up behind him, suited him more than he could have imagined. A more direct approach, the space into which to run, worked too.The results have been extraordinary, a relentlessness to him all over the pitch. He scored 13 goals and provided nine assists in the Champions League, directly involved in more goals than anyone else, ever. In the league, only Alex Baena has created more chances and only Lamine has more assists. There have been 18 goals and 11 assists inLa Liga, including the two assists and a goal at 3-1 down to beat Celta 4-3 and the goal that levelled against Valladolid, allowing them to come into the clásico knowing that a win would end it. He it was who scored the late goal thatshouldhave taken them into a European Cup final four days earlier. And then this Sunday, he scored the third and fourth, completing the comeback against Madrid that virtually clinched the title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet it is not just the numbers and not just the manager. In the summer, Barcelona’s players voted on the new club captains. “I never imagined they would choose me,” he admitted, but they saw something special in him and the unexpectedness of that vote, the way it came as a very tangible expression of trust, served to increase his commitment, to deepen the collective responsibility he already felt. There was warmth, even gratitude. There were also now people to prove wrong and people – more important people – to prove right.View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti will become Raphinha’s head coach when he takes the Brazil job later this month.Photograph: Nacho Doce/Reuters“After reading that you’re going, that the club doesn’t have faith in you, after hearing the press speak ill of you, I never imagined being one of the captains,” he said. “A captain has to fight for the club, the badge, his teammates. I’ve always tried to make sure everyone felt part of the group. It’s not just about wearing the armband. I started this season with a different mentality. It’s a tactical and mental issue. The faith the coach and the players have in me is very important.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowReal Betis 1-1 Osasuna, Athletic Bilbao 1-0 Alavés, Barcelona 4-3 Real Madrid, Leganés 3-2 Espanyol, Atlético 4-0 Real Sociedad, Girona 0-1 Villarreal, Mallorca 2-1 Valladolid, Celta Vigo 3-2 Sevilla, Valencia 3-0 Getafe, Las Palmas 0-1 Ray Vallecano.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The faith he has in them too, the willingness to lead, do anything for them: to embody this team, its identity and its people. When Raphinha admitted that he felt for Dani Olmo when his registration wason hold because of the club’s financial difficulties, that he could understand players thinking twice about coming, it might have seemed like the kind of thing a captain shouldn’t say but it was in fact exactly the kind of thing a captainshouldsay, not just some naive, anodyne public platitude. Instead, there was empathy, awareness, support. And redemption: for all the doubts he had stayed, and now look. He knows football can be shit inside; he also knows that, despite that, it can still be brilliant out there and appreciate it all the more for the dark times. That in the end, there’s nothing better than being here for something like this, calling his teammates over to celebrate something extraordinary earned together.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona3559822Real Madrid3535753Atletico Madrid3533704Athletic Bilbao3525645Villarreal3514616Real Betis3510587Celta Vigo351498Rayo Vallecano35-5479Mallorca35-74710Osasuna35-84511Valencia35-84512Real Sociedad35-94313Getafe35-33914Espanyol35-93915Girona35-123816Sevilla35-103817Alaves35-123518Leganes35-183419Las Palmas35-173220Valladolid35-5916Explore more on these topicsLa LigaBarcelonaReal MadridEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ­Brazilian ­Football Confederation (CBF) revealed the news in a statement on Monday, welcoming ­Ancelotti, a man they described as a “legend” of the game, and expressing excitement about “a new era of success” under his leadership.“This landmark moment sees the coming together of two icons – the only five-time Fifa World Cup champions and a coach with an unmatched record across Europe’s elite competitions,” the federation said in a statement. “The CBF extends its sincere gratitude to Real Madrid and [the club president] Mr [Florentino] Pérez for the cordiality and sportsmanship shown in facilitating the coach’s release during his contract term, allowing this new chapter to begin with mutual respect and cooperation between the teams.”Ancelotti will start in his new post on 26 May, the day after Madrid play their final league fixture of the ­season, against Real Sociedad.Los Blancosare second in La Liga, seven points behind Barcelona after losing4-3 against their great rivals on Sunday.View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti celebrates with his Real Madrid players after winning the 2024 Champions League.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAIt is widely expected that Xabi Alonso will replace Ancelotti at the Bernabéu. The Spaniard, who played for Madrid between 2009 and 2014, announced on Friday that he willleave Bayer Leverkusenat the end of this campaign having led the club to the Bundesliga title and a German Cup double last season. Alonso, it is anticipated, will take charge of Madrid in time for their participation at the newly expanded Fifa Club World Cup that takes place in the US this summer.Ancelotti will depart for South America with an unmatched CV in the European club game. He has won the Champions League a record five times as a mana­ger – three times across two spells with Madrid and twice with Milan. He has also won domestic titles with both of those clubs as well as with Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich.Ramón Platero took charge of theSeleçãofor four games in 1925 while two other men – Joreca of Portugal and the Argentinian Filpo Núñez – coached them briefly in non-competitive matches. But there has been longstanding opposition to a non-Brazilian taking the role, with 2002 World Cup winner Rivaldo once insisting: “TheSeleçãois ours and has to be managed by someone who has Brazilian blood running through his veins.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilCarlo AncelottiReal MadridEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

In other circumstances, Arsenal’s 2-2draw at Liverpoolon Sunday would have been an intriguing minor classic; but then, in other circumstances, it might not have gone like that. As it was, with the title won and Arsenal secure in the Champions League qualification slots, a clash between the top two became the stage for discussion of thebooing of Trent Alexander-Arnoldand a weird confected online fury about whether Myles Lewis-Skelly had applauded Liverpool with sufficient gusto in the guard of honour.At least, from Arsenal’s point of view, the game followed the opposite pattern to the one with which we’ve become familiar.Arsenalhave dropped 21 points from winning positions this season (Liverpool just 13), while Liverpool have gained 22 (Arsenal just 13). If they’d matched each other in those respects, Arsenal would be two points clear at the top of the league; that essentially is the difference between them.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreMikel Arteta will almost certainly be aware of that. As has become apparent this season, he is a manager who takes statistics very seriously. He takes a scientific view of the game, in which everything is about maximising the likelihood of winning. “Over the season there are many things you need to go your way,” he said in the build-up to Sunday’s fixture, although he has been saying similar things all season, usually in the aftermath of games Arsenal have drawn when they should probably have won. “In the clinical moments, does the ball hit the post and come out, or go in? That’s the fine margins. What we have to try to do is to amplify the margins. The bigger the margins are, even if those things happen, then it will be very difficult for the opposition.”With that in mind, it’s worth asking why Arsenal have failed to win 10 games this season in which they’ve taken the lead. Squad depth is probably an issue; they lack high-level options on the bench to transform the dynamic of games, while leading players are probably playing more than they ought to.“We knew from the beginning of the season that our squad was super short,” Arteta admitted. “Being super short we had some players that had a high probability of getting injured.”It’s an admission that raises a lot of questions, but it is at least an acknowledgement of responsibility, which is not something often heard from either Arteta or Arsenal. Arteta’s post-match press conference on Sunday was a bizarre mix of anger at his players and veiled raging at the fates. He condemned “the defending standards and the errors after we gave the ball away, which is totally prohibited against this team” in the first half, continuing, “We were very far off it. I was really upset. Yeah, we had a reaction but I hate reaction, I like action.”But he also spoke of “having to play for the sixth time this season with 10 men”. Written down, that could be seen as further criticism of his squad, but the tone suggested this was a bizarre misfortune that had befallen Arsenal when in truth the wild lunge that brought Mikel Merino a second yellow card was as clear a booking as there could ever be. Arsenal have lacked discipline, their record of six red cards not only the worst in the league, but at least twice as bad as all but two other sides.David Beckham tells Minnesota to ‘show a little respect’ after Pink Phony Club jibeRead moreAlongside that, though, has been something else, something harder to define. Successful teams have a capacity to weather adversity, to get the job done. Arsenal do not. They are not ruthless in front of goal – which may in part be down to the lack of a high-class centre-forward. They have the best defence in the Premier League, yet have a capacity for giving up cheap goals.Wednesday’s Champions League defeatoffered a classic example, as Arsenal failed to take three good early opportunities against Paris Saint-Germain, then immediately offered up four chances, the third of which was taken.“I don’t think there’s been a better team in the competition from what I’ve seen,” Arteta said after that defeat, before clarifying what he meant. “Watching it back, watching the stats. It’s very clear but it’s not about the winning probability, it’s about making it count.”It may even be that he is right, depending what statistical indicators he is employing. But football is not just about stats; it is also about getting it done. All other statistics fade away next to the scoreline. Perhaps he tries to control too much, struggles to accept the chaos that lies at football’s heart. The sense, unfortunately, was of delusion, of Arteta morphing into one of Arsenal’s legions of online propagandists.Winning the metrics should only ever be the means to an end; winning the game is what matters and, at the moment, Arsenal don’t have the necessary edge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By half-time, Arsenal, who had finished the league in seventh, led Manchester United, who had come in ninth, 2-0 thanks to goals from Brain Talbot and Frank Stapleton. As Terry Neill, the Arsenal manager said, at that point it seemed “just another Cup final”. But, with four minutes remaining, Gordon McQueen hooked in as Arsenal struggled to clear a free-kick. Two minutes later, Sammy McIlroy ran on to a Steve Coppell pass, slithered though two challenges and tucked in a low finish to level the score.The momentum seemed to be with United.“I thought, ‘We’re going to win this match,’” said United’s Lou Macari. “But you never count your chickens at Wembley.”A minute later, Liam Brady surged forward and pushed the ball out to his left. Graham Rix’s cross evaded everybody in the United box – apart from Alan Sunderland coming in with a calm sidefoot finish at the back post. Brady admitted his run had largely been designed simply to get the ball into the United half, but Arsenal had won it 3-2 at the last and what Neill called the “most remarkable four minutes ever played at Wembley” were complete.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The captain will have the chance to do so on Wednesday 21 May in theEuropa League final against ­Manchester United, and he described himself as being driven by “desperate passion”.Son, who is fighting to regain peak fitness after a foot injury, joined Spurs from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015. He has scored 173 goals for the club, putting him fifth on their all-time list behind Harry Kane, Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Smith and Martin Chivers. But he has been on the losing team in each of the finals he has contested with them – againstLiverpool in the 2019 Champions LeagueandManchester City in the 2021 League Cup. Tottenham’s last trophy was the 2008 League Cup. Son is under contract until 2026, the club having triggered a one-year option on him in January.Ange Postecoglou leaving on a high could be Spurs’ best-case scenarioRead more“We’ve been talking about this for years,” Son said. “The biggest reason I stayed at Tottenham was because I wanted to do something others couldn’t achieve. That’s probably why I’m where I am now.“You need all the pieces to complete a puzzle. I think I’ve gathered all the other pieces to make that puzzle complete. I’ve been missing that one most important, final piece and I’ve been trying to find it for the past 10 years. I really hope I can finally complete the puzzle this time.“Every game is special and meaningful. But this game [against United] feels like an opportunity that may not come back. It feels different this time. I really want to win – more than anyone else. So many people are supporting us with the same desperate passion I feel. If we prepare well, I believe we can achieve it.”Son has just seen his former Spurs teammate Harry Kane winthe Bundesliga title with Bayern Munich. It is the first team trophy of Kane’s career. “I texted Harry and he called me back on a video call,” Son said. “I was really happy to see him happy. He is one of my best friends and to see a once teammate achieve so much, I was delighted for him like he’s my family. With that positive energy I hope he can support Spurs in the game as well, so we can achieve a good result like his.”Son returned on Sunday from a month-long layoff with the foot problem in the2-0 home defeat against Crystal Palacein the Premier League, appearing as a 58th-minute substitute. He said he had worked with his personal therapist, Ahn Deok-su, and Tottenham’s medical staff to come back “much earlier than expected”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three sources have told the Guardian that Gupta is favourite to succeed the Australian, moving across from the broadcast company that holds the ICC’s $3bn (£2.2bn) rights deal for global events.India’s Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket: ‘I’ve given everything I had’Read moreIf so, Gupta would become the first major appointment at the ICC since Jay Shah, the former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket inIndia, was made chair of the global ­governing body last December. Both men have worked closely together in the past, with Jiostar also the domestic broadcaster of the Indian Premier League.The next chief executive of the ICC faces significant challenges, not least ongoing negotiations over the fee that Jiostar (formerly Disney Star) agreed to pay for global events. Should India and Pakistan stop playing each other at these, something that was floated in response to recent cross-border hostilities, the deal’s value would be affected further.Then there is an overhaul of the World Test Championship. The ­existing structure is to remain in place for the 2025-27 cycle but there is a growing push to recalibrate the competition in time for the start of the next future tours programme.More broadly, on top of ­expanding international women’s cricket and overseeing the sport’s Olympic return in 2028, there is the task of navigating the international men’s game through a calendar increasingly swamped by franchise leagues. The IPL, for example, is looking to move from 74 games per year to 94 per year from 2028.Notably, Gupta was among those spoken to by the World Cricketers’ Association (the global umbrella group of player unions) when producing a recent report that called for dedicated windows for international cricket. Tom Harrison, the former chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, was another to be spoken to and has been linked to the ICC vacancy previously. The ICC has declined to comment.The IPL, meanwhile, is to resume on Saturday, with the 17 ­remaining games to be held across six ­venues. The T20 tournament – comfortably the richest event in cricket – was ­suspended last week amid the military ­hostilities between India and Pakistan.It remains to be seen how many overseas players, including the 10 English players contracted to franchises, will be tempted back having left the region as tensions between the nuclear powers escalated.The matches are scheduled for Bengaluru, Jaipur, Lucknow, Mumbai and Ahmedabad – with Dharamsala notable by its absence after the last game before the hiatus was abandoned in dramatic fashion.The ­destination of the ­knockout games and final have yet to be determined, but the final has been rescheduled for 3 June.Explore more on these topicsCricketSport politicsIndianewsShareReuse this content"

Vilahamn is under contract until 2027, having signed a new deal last summer after what had been an impressive debut season in the English game. The 42-year-old guided Spurs to theirfirst Women’s FA Cup finalin May 2024 and a sixth-placed finish, but they have been unable to repeat that this campaign.WSL 2024-25 season review: our writers’ best and worstRead moreThis season Tottenham finished with 20 points after five wins from 22 games, their 11th place the lowest of the surviving sides. They were winless in their last 11 matches in all competitions, a run that stretched back to late January.In March Vilahamn said: “I always feel the trust from the board and the leadership around me, they always give me that support. I also know that coaches in the other clubs have felt that and then they have been dropped quite quickly.“I’m fine with that, I get it. I have a plan if I get fired, what I should do and what I should not do. If the club decides to fire in the future, you can stand and say I was professional and did everything I could for the club.”Meanwhile, the Wolves chair, Jeff Shi, has promised the club will apply for promotion at the end of next season after criticism of the decisionnot to submit an application to go up to the Women’s Championship this season. That came despite them finishing second in the Women’s National League Northern Premier Division.Commenting on the matter for the first time on Monday, Shi said: “Wolves Women remains a vital part of our football family, and we are committed to building a sustainable, competitive future for the team.

Parling is currently employed as the Australia assistant coach but will return to Welford Road after this summer’s British & Irish Lions tour.The former second-row Parling, 41, spent six years at Leicester and will be a popular appointment among the Tigers faithful. Paul Gustard, Graham Rowntree, Leon MacDonald and Stuart Lancaster were heavily linked with the role but Leicester finally landed on Parling, who has agreed a long-term contract.He joined Australia’s coaching staff in 2020 under Davie Rennie – after ­cutting his teeth with Melbourne Rebels – and though he was cast aside by Eddie Jones, he returned to the fold in 2024 afterJoe Schmidt took over, developing into one of the New Zealander’s key lieutenants. Parling played for the British & Irish Lions on the victorious 2013 tour of Australia, appearing in all three Tests, but will be plotting their downfall this summer before returning to the East Midlands to take up his first head coach position.Though Leicester are well set for the Premiership playoffs, currently sitting in second place in the table, Cheika will leave at the end of the season after the club announced in January he would not be extending his one-year deal. The search for a successor has been protracted with Gustard initially emerging as the preferred candidate before his anticipated appointment fell through, while MacDonald also held talks with the Tigers hierarchy.Cheika is Leicester’s seventh head coach since Richard Cockerill’s long-term tenure came to an end in 2017. Steve Borthwick delivered ­success with a Premiership title in 2022 before he and his coaching staff were recruited by the Rugby ­Football Union. The Tigers will be hoping in Parling they have a young coach with a growing reputation who can bring stability to the club.“I was lucky enough to have some incredible moments in the Leicester Tigers jersey, made through hard work by good people, and so I am extremely proud to be coming back to lead the club,” said Parling.“There are not many opportunities that would make myself and my family think about leaving Australia, the place we’ve called home for the past seven years, but coming back to Leicester Tigers is one that we are really looking forward to. I know the club is looking for stability, and I will be focused on building an environment with strong foundations, where people can see both what is needed and what it means to be a Tiger.”Leinster, meanwhile, have ­confirmed Caelan Doris will be ­sidelined for four to six months after undergoing shoulder surgery. The Leinster and Ireland captain sustained the injury during his side’sChampions Cup semi-final defeat by Northamptonand was ruled out of contention for the British & Irish Lions squad as a result.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under HISA regulations, jockeys are allowed to strike their horse six times during a race; Alvarado used the whip on Sovereignty eight times. It was his second such offense in the last 180 days, meaning his fine was doubled to $62,000 – 20% of his winnings from theKentucky Derby. Alvarado was also banned for two Kentucky racing days, on 29 and 30 May.Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty won’t run in Preakness StakesRead moreThe jockey has 10 days to lodge an appeal and he denies that he overused his whip.“I didn’t abuse the horse,” he told the Daily Racing Form. “Nobody can tell me, even if they can prove that I hit the horse two extra times, it was in an abusing way, it’s just ridiculous. The punishment doesn’t fit the crime and I don’t think there was any crime.”Alvarado said he will weigh up whether an appeal is worth his time, or whether to put the incident behind him.“I would like to just get it over with and put it behind me, I don’t want to carry this one extra day, but at the same time I don’t want to give up that easily like they were right,” Alvarado said. “I would like to move forward and fix something. As everybody can see, it’s unfair the penalties we’re facing. Maybe [by appealing] we can get something good out of this.”The 38-year-old rode Sovereignty to a thrilling victory in last weekend’s race, pulling away from the heavy favorite Journalism down the final stretch. Sovereignty will not compete in this month’s Preakness Stakes, the second leg of US horse racing’s Triple Crown.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingKentucky DerbyUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Bucks have the best winning percentage in the NBA since the 2018-19 season, largely due to Antetokounmpo’s excellence, but he has spoken about his frustration at not adding to the championship he won in 2021.“Me not having a second championship – I look back at my career and everybody can say, ‘Oh, incredible career, active Hall of Famer, first ballot, whatever.’ But me, my personal goal, if I am not able to help my team win a second ring, I’m letting down myself,” Antetokounmpo said last month on his brother Thanasis’s podcast.He is under contract with the Bucks through the 2026-27 season and has a $62.8m player option for 2027-28.

With Donovan Mitchell missing the second half because of an injured left ankle, the Cavs had no chance to recover.Replays showed Mathurin extending his fist into Hunter, who responded by wagging his finger at Mathurin and following him toward midcourt, where he shoved Mathurin to the ground with two hands. Pacers center Myles Turner then ran across the court and ran into Hunter.After a replay review, the referees called Mathurin for a flagrant 2, an automatic ejection, drawing a chorus of boos from Pacers fans. Technical fouls were given to Turner and Hunter.Gregg Popovich: the NBA truth teller who held Trump, and the US, to accountRead more“I had a lot of questions about it,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “I saw one still shot where it looked he had his hand flat, you know? But they a lot of different views. Whatever happened, happened. He’ll accept the ejection and whatever else happens from it. We’ve just got to move forward.”The Pacers can close out the series and earn their second straight appearance in the conference finals Tuesday in Cleveland, where they won the first two games.Mathurin did not score in his 80 seconds on the court. Hunter, who missed Game 2 with an injured wrist, had five points and four rebounds while Turner made all four of his three-point attempts and finished with 20 points, seven rebounds and three assists.Mathurin was also involved in a scufflewith Giannis Antetokounmpo when the Pacers eliminated the Bucks in the first-round of the playoffs.In Sunday’s other game, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 25 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder finally outplayed Denver in crunch time, beating the Nuggets 92-87 to tie their second-round series at two games apiece.The Thunder trailed 69-63 after three quarters and fell behind by eight when Peyton Watson started the fourth quarter by swishing a hook shot. But Oklahoma City used an 11-0 run fueled by reserves Cason Wallace, who had a pair of three-pointers, and Aaron Wiggins, who added another, to take control. Wallace’s second three-pointer put Oklahoma City ahead for good at 75-73.The Nuggets had outlasted the youngest team in the NBA with wins in Games 1 and 3, crediting their playoff experience and championship pedigree. And they looked poised to put the top-seeded team in the West one game from elimination when Aaron Gordon’s turnaround jumper made it 73-66. This time, however, it was the Thunder who came up big down the stretch.Nikola Jokić led Denver with 27 points and 13 rebounds. Christian Braun and Jamal Murray each had 17 points and Gordon scored 15. Michael Porter Jr scored just three points after scoring 15 Friday night. Wiggins and Wallace each added 11 points and Alex Caruso and Jalen Williams each scored 10. Williams was 2 for 13 from the floor after scoring 32 in Game 3.Game 5 is Tuesday night back in Oklahoma City, where the Thunder had a 43-point blowout of the Nuggets in Game 2.Explore more on these topicsNBAIndiana PacersCleveland CavaliersBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Refusing to accept defeat, he is now an author and speaker, still in love with his sportMartin PengellyMon 12 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 06.01 EDTShareIn another world, Robert Paylor might have been playing in Major League Rugby, in his prime at 28, preparing for a US Eagles summer including England in Washington andWorld Cup qualification.“When I was an athlete, that was my purpose in life,” he says. “I wanted to be the best rugby player I could be. And in a lot of ways, those dreams were really happening: I was a sophomore competing for Cal’s team, which is not a common thing to do, and I had all those hopes: being an All-American, maybe play professionally, maybe represent the United States. That was my goal. And then in one moment, because of something I couldn’t control, it was gone.”On 6 May 2017, Paylor started in the second row of the scrum for Cal Berkeley against Arkansas State in theVarsity Cup final. In the first minutes, Cal formed a maul, driving the ball towards the Arkansas line. In his new book, which was published eight years later to the day, Paylor describes what happened next.TV “images clearly showed a player from Arkansas State wrapping his arm around my neck, putting me in a headlock, and driving my skull into the ground” – a clearly illegal move.Paylor’s neck was broken. His book is calledParalyzed to Powerful: Lessons from a Quadriplegic’s Journey.“It was cathartic,” he says, to revisit that terrible moment. “It wasn’t easy. I cried many times, going through it. That’s such a hard moment. I had to really create that mental image again so I could describe it for a reader and put them in that moment with me.“In terms of the injury itself, it was very fast. I think this maul formed and collapsed in around five seconds. Laying on that turf, I was completely paralyzed from the neck down, numb and motionless, but I never lost consciousness for a second. I was completely aware. I was terrified because the referee didn’t stop play. Oh my gosh, I don’t know why. Thank goodness nothing happened, but there were multiple phases of play and if someone were to have fallen on me, I certainly would have had a more severe injury. I might not even be here today.”View image in fullscreenRobert Paylor is taken off the field after his accident.Photograph: Robert PaylorFor Paylor, the anniversary of his injury “always brings back those moments. I look at the clock in the morning, and I think of myself getting dressed for the last time so easily. And I look at noon, which was when we kicked off, and I think of standing for the national anthem. I think of sprinting down that field, how that’s the last time I ever sprinted, after that kick-off. And I really wanted to share those moments in great detail and really try to share that emotion that was behind it. Really, that was important.”Paylor was in a place few could ever imagine. Stricken in a hospital bed. Told by doctors he would not walk again, might not regain use of his hands. Electing to undergo surgery he might not survive. And yet rugby humor, dark by definition, runs through his book like a vein. He describes what it is like to have a feeding tube rammed up a nose broken too many times by his sport. In short: it’s not pleasant. Less funny: how he contracted pneumonia, how medics and loved ones helped him fight off a threat that might have drowned him there in his bed.He survived. Then he set out to fight back. Hewouldwalk again.“I’ve always been an optimistic guy, but I knew from moment one I was never going to play rugby again,” he says, smiling broadly, wearing a Cal polo, sitting in front of a framed Cal jersey. “So I needed something to replace that.”With notable help fromTom Billups, the Harlequins and Eagles hooker turned Cal assistant coach, Paylor fought it out. Inch by inch, using a frame, he got back on his feet. In August 2021,he walkedto receive his diploma. Cheers rang on and on.“I continue to progress,” he says. “I walked 500 yards on Monday. That’s a new PB, up from 400. But I go back to Cal and I tell the story of my teammates helping me get around campus. I wouldn’t have graduated if it weren’t for them.”Early on, Paylor noticed something.“As you can imagine, breaking your neck is not a good financial decision. We needed a lot of help. So I started out witha GoFundMethrough Jennifer Douglas, the mom of Tyler Douglas, my best friend on the team. That was huge … but also I started seeing that sharing my story was impacting others. People would confide what they were going through, some of it extremely significant. Stage-four cancer, suicidal ideations, loss of a son or daughter. Incredibly difficult things, and how, through my perseverance and my positivity, I was helping them.“I started to see this gift kind of matriculating out of this injury, where it took a lot away but it gave me one thing, and that’s a story and tools I can share, that can help people. So I started getting into speaking. At first, it was just, ‘Robert, you’ve got this amazing story. You tell it really well. Will you think of sharing your story with my class, with my team?’ I started doing that, fell in love with it, and then decided I want to do this for the rest of my life. I want to be a speaker.”True to that aim, each chapter of Paylor’s book offers lessons to be learned from events discussed. He started writing under Covid, wanting to “really dive deeper”. His co-author, sportswriterJason Cole, helped him over the line.By far the most successful program in college rugby, Cal recently won a 29th national XVs title,beating Life, from Georgia. “Go Bears,” Paylor repeats, with a laugh. He cannot speak highly enough of Billups, head coach Jack Clark and the culture they’ve built.In his book, he declares his love for Karsen Welle, his wife, describing in detail their courtship, which began in 2019. He cites a higher authority still: his Catholic faith. It took him to Lourdes, seeking a cure, and it has fueled everything since his injury: rehab in Colorado, weights work at Cal, becoming a public speaker,TED talk included. Faith provided solace too, not least through a difficult official investigation of his injury.View image in fullscreenTom Billups, assistant coach at Cal, supports Paylor as he graduates from Cal Berkeley, in August 2021.Photograph: Provided by Robert PaylorOf the Arkansas player who caused his injury, who he does not name, he says: “I absolutely forgive this person. I totally wish him well.“Nothing about this [book] was like a passive aggressive attempt at revenge. I tried to state that early on. But trust me, I was filled with so much anger back then, over everything I was going through: can’t breathe, can’t eat, can’t itch my nose, all because of the actions of another person who has not reached out to me. That was probably the most difficult mental challenge I’ve had to overcome.“But it’s so important, because I think everybody has someone they need to forgive, and we have to forgive ourselves. Sometimes that’s not easy, and there’s times when we just feel the universe is against us. It’s so important to realize forgiveness is not just a feeling of peace that comes with letting go of a situation. It’s a decision to make over and over again, especially when we don’t feel like it.“As it comes to USA Rugby, I thought that was equally important to write about. For whatever reason, national governing bodies don’t always do the right thing. USA Rugby is not alone in that. Go look at women’s gymnastics,with sexual abuse scandals. Go look at the NFL, with brain trauma cover-ups.“When I was going through all the drama of the investigation, I was also just trying to get my life back. I was trying to be able to pick up a water bottle. I’m putting marbles into jars. So it frustrated me at the time that there was kind of this sweeping under the rug with what clearly was a red card on the field [though no card was shown for the incident in which Paylor was injured]. What really hurt me was that this could happen to someone else. Never in rugby should it be permissible to wrench someone down by their head and render them a quadriplegic. That just frustrated me, because I love this sport.”Eventually, Paylor and Cal “got what we hoped for”: the investigation was widely condemned, USA Rugbyapologized, “and they have learned from the situation, and rugby is better off.”Paylor’s optimism is striking. Sometimes startling. On the page, he describes his first steps as a speaker, at Cal’s business school: “I paused for a moment … it was so quiet that if a pin had dropped, it would have sounded like a cymbal. Sitting in front of my peers at that moment, power coursed through my body. It filled me with something more profound than the ability to walk, run, or win a big game. That’s when I first realized that through all of this pain and suffering, I had been given a gift. In the process of losing so much of my previous identity, I gained a new ability that I could share with others.“And I wouldn’t trade that by wishing my injury had never happened.”People who hear that line “probably think I’m either a liar or a lunatic”, Paylor writes. Close friends have “advised me that I shouldn’t say that. It’s hard to imagine anyone would truly not wish away an injury like mine …“[But] nobody has experienced every second of my life as I have … Yes, I want to regain my ability to walk and have my full independence back. I work at that in my rehab every day. What I don’t want is to wish this injury had never happened in the first place. Changing what happened to me would mean wishing away … an ability to help others through adversity at a level I don’t think I would’ve gained without this injury. I love my life, and I’m proud of where I am today. If my past is the road I had to take to inspire people in this way, then I’m grateful for it.”In conversation, Paylor shows the same cheerful refusal to be cowed by fate.“People ask me all the time, ‘Do you regret playing rugby?’ My answer is, ‘Absolutely not.’ If I woke up tomorrow and I was able-bodied, I’d be looking for someone to hit. I just love the game.View image in fullscreenRobert Paylor during his playing days with Cal.Photograph: Dave Donovan Photography“My best friendships were made in rugby, and I haven’t found a way to replace it. Just that focus on the moment, where nothing else matters, that bond you have with your teammates, really in a sacrificial way. It’s difficult. It requires pain, and you take that on not just for yourself but for your team and for the alumni, your coaches. Gosh, it’s just such a great game.“It’s the game they play in heaven. I’m confident of it. I still have dreams about playing.”Paralyzed to Powerful isout nowExplore more on these topicsRugby unionCollege sportsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s about replacing all of themEd Newton-RexAI will do the thinking, robots will do the doing. What place do humans have in this arrangement – and do tech CEOs care?Mon 12 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 13.44 EDTShareIrecently found myself at a dinner in an upstairs room at a restaurant in San Francisco hosted by a venture capital firm. The after-dinner speaker was a tech veteran who, having sold his AI company for hundreds of millions of dollars, has now turned his hand to investing. He had a simple message for the assembled startup founders: the money you can make in AI isn’t limited to the paltry market sizes of previous technology waves. You can replace the world’s workers – which means you can capture their salaries. All of them.Replacing all human labour with AI sounds like the stuff of science fiction. But it is the explicit aim of a growing number of the tech elite – and these are people who lack neither drive nor resources, who have deep pockets and even deeper determination. If they say they want to automate all labour, we should take them at their word.This is generally an aim that’s only admitted to behind closed doors, for obvious reasons. There’s little that will summon the pitchforks quicker than telling people you’re trying to take away their jobs. But a company called Mechanize last month bucked the trend and said the quiet part out loud. Their vision is “the full automation of the economy”, a vision they’ve convinced some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley to fund, including Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, and popular podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.Is automating all jobs really feasible? Elon Musk certainly thinks so. The rise of AI and robotics will mean “probablynone of us will have a job”, he said last year. Bill Gates thinks humans soonwon’t be needed for “most things”. Massive labour replacement has also been predicted by godfather of AIGeoffrey Hintonand billionaire investorVinod Khosla. These are hardly fringe voices that have no idea what they’re talking about.Some careers are obviously safe from robot takeover. Taylor Swift is not in danger. Nor is Harry Kane. Nor, for that matter, is Keir Starmer, or the as-yet-unnamed next archbishop of Canterbury. Famous artist, sportsperson, politician, priest – perhaps the four jobs that are the most resistant to automation. Unfortunately they’re not open to all of us.Today’s technology cannot replace all human labour. AI makes mistakes. Robots lack coordination, dexterity, versatility. So that’s something. But there is lots that cutting-edge technologycanalready do. And there are good reasons to think it will continue to improve – fast.GPT-4, one of OpenAI’s large language models, was alreadyscoring in the top 10%on the bar exam back in 2023. Their more recent models arebetter at codingthan their own chief scientist.Freelance writing jobs plummetedwhen ChatGPT was released; the same happened to graphic design jobs with the arrival of AI image generators. Driverless cars are everywhere in San Francisco. As Sam Altman himself said: “Jobs aredefinitely going to go away, full stop.”While AI grabs most of the headlines, robots are advancing rapidly too. And where AI threatens white-collar jobs, robots target physical labour. One type of humanoid robot is alreadybeing testedin BMW factories; another managed tomaster more than 100 tasksthat would usually be done by human store workers. Companies plan to start testing robots in the homethis year. The Silicon Valley vision for the labour market is remarkably simple: AI does the thinking, robots do the doing. What place do humans have in this arrangement?Up until very recently, AI researchers thought that artificial general intelligence (AGI) – that is, AI that can perform essentially all cognitive tasks at human level – was a long way off. Not any more. Demis Hassabis, the head of Google DeepMind, now thinks “it’s coming very soon” – less than five to 10 years wouldn’t surprise him.Of course these predictions may be wrong. Perhaps we’re headed for another AI winter; perhaps the chatbots will stop improving, the robots will keep falling over, the funding will move on to the next big thing in tech. I don’t think so, but it’s possible. But that’s not the point. The question here isn’t whether the legions of tech CEOs and billions of dollars of funding being poured into near-total labour automation will achieve what they’re trying to achieve. The question is why they’re trying to achieve it at all, and how the rest of us feel about it.Better at everything: how AI could make human beings irrelevantRead moreThe generous answer is that they genuinely believe a post-labour economy will mean huge economic growth and vastly improved global living standards. The obvious question is what, historically speaking, suggests that the benefits of this growth would be distributed evenly.The less generous answer is that it’s about what it’s always about: money. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen once famously said: “Software is eating the world.” Up until now there’s only been so much it could eat. Whatever software you built, you still needed people to do most of the world’s work, with the labour market itself tantalisingly out of reach for ambitious tech execs. But nowSilicon Valleysees an opening. A chance to own the entire means of production. And it wouldn’t be Silicon Valley if it didn’t try to seize that chance.Ed Newton-Rex is the founder of Fairly Trained, a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies that respect creators’ rights, and a visiting scholar at Stanford UniversityExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionWork & careersSilicon ValleyTechnology startupsComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

Over the past 30 years, he has become almost as famous as the game itself. The escapades surrounding his deal to buy its distribution rights from Russian agency Elektronorgtechnica (Elorg) were dramatised inan Apple TV+ filmstarring Taron Egerton. “I suggested that Johnny Depp or Keanu Reeves should play me, but apparently they were way too old,” Rogers says.Tetris review – rise of 80s game makes for mostly entertaining dramaRead moreThe casting wasn’t his only concern when he read the screenplay. “It was terrifying. I didn’t know anything about how a script becomes a movie. I thought: ‘This is a crap movie … a car chase?! There is so much bullshit in there!’”View image in fullscreenTrance-inducing … Tetris on the Nintendo Game Boy.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianStill, it can’t have been more terrifying than the KGB interrogation awaiting Rogers when he made that fateful trip to Russia in 1988. Tetris may now be one of the most successful video games in history, with more than 520m sales, yet it was conceived by Alexey Pajitnov while he was working on artificial intelligence and automatic speech recognition at the state-owned computing centre of the Academy of Sciences in the Soviet Union – and he certainly wasn’t supposed to be coding puzzle games. Those trance-inducing tetrominos were almost sealed away behind the iron curtain, the exclusive property of the Soviet regime.Alexey had never met a game designer before … there were no game designers in the Soviet UnionThankfully, however, a complex series of shaky international rights deals involving several companies, including Robert Maxwell’s Mirrorsoft, finally culminated in the Japan-dwelling Dutchman Rogers snapping up the Japanese computer rights, and then hopping on a plane to Russia hoping to secure a similar deal for handhelds. After he arrived in Moscow on a tourist visa, the KGB watched Rogers’ every move. Sneakily – and very much illegally – he managed to gain entry into Elorg, the state-owned company with a monopoly on all Soviet-made computer software. As he came face to face with the reclusive coder behind this mesmerising game, Rogers swiftly discovered he’d been duped. The Tetris rights Rogers “owned” had been sold without Russian knowledge – and the Soviets weren’t too pleased.“I was in a room with seven people, some of them KGB types, being given the third degree for a couple of hours, like: ‘Who the hell are you coming into the Soviet Union?!’” says Rogers. It was there that he first met Pajitnov. “Alexey was suspicious of me at first, because he’d met other people who had come sniffing for Tetris’s rights. He always felt that they were just slimy capitalists looking to make a dollar.” The film’s retelling of this encounter feels surprisingly faithful, with the tense interrogation scene and resulting paranoia of KGB surveillance matching Rogers’ own descriptions.“When he figured out I was a game designer, Alexey’s demeanour changed completely,” recalls Rogers. “Alexey had never met a game designer before … Therewereno game designers in the Soviet Union, because there was no game business in the Soviet Union. You had your job, and games would be something that you did on the side.”View image in fullscreenPajitnov in 1989.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex FeaturesIntrigued to meet a fellow nerd, Alexey quietly asked Rogers to find him after the meeting. With the KGB watching their every move, and millions of dollars on the line, Rogers was aware of the danger that they both faced. “As a foreigner, I had to be careful. So I waited downstairs by the door and escorted him to my room in the middle of the night, quietly showing him my version of Tetris.”Rogers and Pajitnov have been friends ever since, and once the Soviet Union was dissolved and Elorg’s stake sold, they formed the Tetris Company together in 1996. Up to that point, Pajitnov had made no money from the game at all.Despite the 2023 film taking some factual liberties (“I cried about things in the movie that never happened, I cried about my daughter singing after I missed her recital – they made that shit up!”), Rogers says that he got a kick out of seeing his story on the big screen. “It premiered at South by Southwest and the audience can be very critical. But they were cheering when I first saw the Game Boy. They were cheering for a device! At the end, we all got to come on stage: Alexey, myself, and Taron. We got the biggest standing ovation from the audience. It felt like I won an Oscar.”However, compelled to share a more grounded retelling of his story, Rogers has just released a book:The Perfect Game: Tetris, from Russia With Love. It’s a fun, if slightly arrogant look at the events that brought the puzzle sensation to the world, littered with endearing, memory-correcting interjections from Pajitnov.View image in fullscreenPajitnov, Rogers and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi at Nintendo HQ in Kyoto, Japan.Photograph: Nintendo Company LimitedWhile the film highlights Rogers’ undeniable charm and business acumen, it buries his contributions as a game developer. While living in Japan in 1983 he founded Bullet-Proof Software and created the influential role-playing game The Black Onyx, which gave the genre the iconic health bar and also introduced RPGs to a Japanese audience. The game’s manual was written by Hisashi Suzuki who would go on to become president of Squaresoft, creator of the Final Fantasy series. The Black Onyx was apparently also a huge influence on legendaryNintendodesigner Shigeru Miyamoto: “Miyamoto credited Black Onyx – thereby crediting me – for teaching him about role playing games,” says Rogers. “He said it was what led to him creating Zelda.”Is it strange though, that Rogers’ story has overshadowed that of Tetris’s creator, Pajitnov? “Alexey and I play very different roles,” replies Rogers. “The role that I’m playing right now, telling the story, he would never play that role. He’s more of an introvert. If you give him a chance, he’ll sit in a room and do mathematical proofs. In terms of connecting Tetris to the world, the world would have to search him out and he would come kicking and screaming.”View image in fullscreen‘We blue-skyed it in the desert’ … Tetris Effect (2019).Photograph: Enhance GamesNew versions of Tetris are released every few years, a recent highlight being 2019’s psychedelic Tetris Effect, which saw the creator of the Dreamcast classic Rez, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, reimagine the game as a transcendental audiovisual experience complete with VR version – a concept dreamed up during a hedonistic weekend at Burning Man. “Gucci – we call him Gucci – is a good friend,” says Rogers. “We went toBurning Mantogether, where we blue-skyed in the desert about what Tetris Effect would be – a Tetris in VR – and he built that product.”While Rogers still enjoys games (“Minecraft really did something outside the box.”), his priorities changed after a near fatal heart attack in 2005. “I’m done with game publishing,” he says. “I know how much work it is and how much money it takes and my heart has to be in it. And now, my heart is in fighting climate change.”Rogers now lives in Hawaii, and over the last 20 years his Blue Planet Foundation has successfully lobbied the island nation to commit to clean energy by 2030. He is slowly convincing neighbouring islands to stop purchasing foreign oil and to invest in sustainable alternatives. If anyone can save the planet, it’s the man who outsmarted the Maxwells, escaped the KGB, and got us all dreaming of little blocks endlessly falling into place.The Perfect Game by Henk Rogers is published by Di AngeloExplore more on these topicsTetrisGamesRetro gamesNintendoPuzzle gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What does that say about us?Tayo BeroSocial media has been fun for the first time in years. But the joy of this moment is about more than just jokesMon 12 May 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 12.33 EDTShareWhile most good Catholics spent the early days of this week in solemn contemplation, praying that the church’s new leader would be a person of character and someone who could unite us in these tense, ungodly times, the rest of us were on X cackling at our screens and repostingchimney memes.Social media has been having afield daysince Pope Francis passed and the race was on for a new pope. And now that Pope Leo XIV from Chicago has been selected, the jokes have been top-tier – references to the TV show The Bear, videos of the new popewalking outto music by the Chicago legend Chief Keef,Spike Leesomehow making this a win for the New York Knicks – I don’t remember the last time I had this much fun in the hellish digital town square formerly known as Twitter.An American has become pope. Will he be the moral leader we desperately need? | Arwa MahdawiRead morePope Crave, a parody Vatican stan account that started as a fan page for the 2024 film Conclave, has led the charge in keeping everyone updated with a mix of actual reporting and pitch-perfect humor. Now, at almost 100,000 followers, it has become a de facto source for all Vatican news. Pope Crave was the first to report that a new pope had been chosen (sharing the newsbeforethe actual Vatican), and even had a reporter on the ground in Rome to cover the whole thing.The meme-ification of the new pope is enjoyable on multiple levels, not least of which is the fact that it’s revived one of the last remaining good parts of internet culture: laughing together. Much of my time online these days is spent avoiding trolls, blocking bad-faith actors and trying to reset my algorithm so my feed isn’t just full of rightwing ads (or in Canada’s very specific case, weird fakehit piecesabout Howie Mandel?). Butthis. This is what social media was made for.The pope memes have picked up on all the best (and most ridiculous) things about this moment: the ritualistic selection process, Leo being the first American to hold the title, the fact that weliterallysaw this movie last year and the new pontiff’s Chicago roots. There’s also just the ridiculousness ofhavinga pope to begin with, and continuing to engage with this kind of decadent ritual while the world burns down around us. This week felt like the kind of nonsectarian, cross-cultural punching up that offers mild respite from our collective and constant disgust at the state of the world. At the same time, it’s an opportunity for real action – Pope Crave’sConclave Charity Zine, for instance, has raised more than $15,000 for charities such as the Intersex Human Rights Fund.The other great thing about this moment is the ways in which it signals our irreverence and disdain toward institutions like the church. The Catholic church remains one of the most powerful institutions in the world and papal supremacy is an ideal that almost transcends denominations at this point. But it’s also the same institution that has covered up systemic abuse within its ranks for decades, and still holds deeply problematic views on women and queer people.The arrival of a new pope has come at a time when people are interrogating the distribution of power in the world, when the formerly devout are questioning their faith (no matter what the American religious right would have you believe), and when there’s an urgent sentiment that the global establishment and its supporters (like the church) need to be transformed.Pope Leo XIV’s ascent is taking place at the cultural intersection of social media obsession, power and religion. But the way we’ve responded to it – the return to our collective ideals that moments like this inspire – gives some meaning to all the pomp and circumstance.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVOpinionSocial mediaThe papacyCatholicismReligionInternetChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

One problem: it’s bogusMoira DoneganThe FDA chief suggested he wouldn’t crack down on mifepristone without new data. Conveniently, misleading research emerged within daysMon 12 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 10.12 EDTShareAlmosttwo-thirdsof USabortionsare induced with pills. The drug mifepristone blocks the pregnancy hormone progesterone, ending the growth of the fetus. Mifepristone was designed for abortions: its primary purpose, from its development through its regulatory approval and now on the market, has always been to allow women to control their own bodies and lives by ending their pregnancies. Because it exists as a tool of women’s independence, mifepristone has been the object of controversy, misinformation and intense scrutiny for the entirety of its existence. Originally synthesized by French pharmaceutical researchers in 1980, the drug went through a rigorous, prolonged and heavily politicized approval process in the US, and wasn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the US market until 2000.The anti-abortion movement – including several prominent Republican lawmakers – is looking to undo that. Since the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that eliminated the nationwide right to abortion, women living in anti-choice states have relied increasingly on mifepristone, particularly pillsshipped by mail from providers in pro-choice stateswho prescribe the drug via telehealth. It is estimated that as many as 20% of abortions in the US are now accessed via telehealth appointments, a technological marvel that has allowed many people living in anti-choice states to avert the worst consequences to their lives, health and dignity that were threatened by the Dobbs decision by circumventing the unjust abortion bans that their states have attempted to impose on them. Dobbs has already been devastating for American women, causing needless deaths, driving up maternal mortality, derailing women’s lives, constraining their prospects, and injuring their standing as equal citizens. The post-2022 explosion of telehealth abortion using mifepristone is the reason why the consequences have not been even worse.This Mother’s Day, lets talk about why birth rates are really declining | Katrina vanden HeuvelRead moreNow, Trump’s new FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, is under pressure to restrict access to the drug. Pressed by reporters at the Semafor World Economy Summit late last month, Makaray said that he had“no plans”to review the status of mifepristone. But he added a crucial caveat: that he would reconsider the drug’s accessibility if new information emerged about the drug’s safety. “If the data suggests something or tells us that there’s a real signal, we can’t promise that we’re not going to act on that data,” he said.As if on cue, a conservative thinktank published a new study just days later that purported to find that mifepristone caused serious adverse effects in more than 10% of patients. The study – which contradicts all previous tests of the drug and the resounding consensus of the medical field – was published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a rightwing advocacy groupthat aims to“apply the richness of the Jewish and Christian traditions to contemporary questions of law” and “push back against the extreme progressive agenda while building a consensus for conservatives”.The study was rapidly amplified on conservative social media, and was pushed by several Republican senators who had previously called on Makaray to ban mifepristone at his March confirmation hearing. Missouri’s Josh Hawley, the author of a book on “manhood” who onceraised a fistin solidarity with the January 6 insurrectionists, declared in astatementdirected at Makaray: “Well, the new data is here. And it’s a signal that can’t be missed: Mifepristone is not safe.” Hawley went on to urge the FDA to restrict access to the drug and revert to pre-pandemic regulations, in which mifepristone could only be dispensed by a doctor after multiple in-person visits: a regulatory regime that would cut off abortion access to millions of women in anti-choice states.But the study that is being proposed as a pretext for restricting abortion access has come under scrutiny from doctors and statisticians for itsquestionable methodology. Drawing from insurance claim data from 2017 to 2023, the EPPC study claims that 10% of women who take mifepristone experience “sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, an emergency room visit, or another serious adverse event within 45 days”. This would be alarming if it were true, but it isn’t.JD Vance may disagree, but this anti-abortion activist isn’t a brutally censored dissident | Catherine BennettRead moreInstead, the study seems to have been designed to dramatically overstate the side-effects of mifepristone, in part by counting the normal and intended functioning of the drug – such as vaginal bleeding as the pregnancy terminates and post-medication doctor visits to confirm the completion of the miscarriage – as serious adverse effects. The study also claimed that a vast range of health experiences in the 45 days following the medication – such as mental health symptoms – were caused by the drug, a claim that the data does not support. The EPPC study alsoseems to includethose who were prescribed mifepristone for non-abortion uses, such as miscarriage management, as well as those who took it alone, without the standard misoprostol dose that accompanies it. The study is not peer-reviewed and has not been published in a medical journal, because its authors could not meet the standards that such publication requires: their work is not up to snuff. Dr Stella Dantas, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, called the paper “seriously flawed” and said that it “manipulates data to drive a myth that medication abortion isn’t safe”.The truth is that abortion pills have a lower rate of serious complicationsthan Tylenol, and that the anti-abortion movement is in fact a great danger to American women’s health. It is because of abortion bans – not abortion access – that women in America are facing dramatically rising rates of “sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging” and death in pregnancy. In Texas alone, the rate of sepsis in pregnant women experiencing second-trimester miscarriages increased bymore than 50%in the years since the state’s near-total abortion ban went into effect, and experts say that the laws prohibiting abortion are the cause. The adverse effects that the anti-abortion movement sees in mifepristone’s availability is not a matter of women’s health, which they are indifferent to. It is women’s freedom.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsAbortionOpinionWomenHealthUS healthcareRepublicansTrump administrationRoe v WadecommentShareReuse this content"

As the government’s lawyers take the floor to deliver their opening remarks – in a case that was brought by the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq and is supported by Human Rights Watch – thousands of children in Gaza will be starving. This is the result of an Israeli blockade on food, aid and medical supplies that defies the binding orders of the international court of justice.Thousands of mothers will be mourning the children they have lost in an assault on Gaza that is estimated to have cost the lives ofmore than 50,000 people, according to the Gaza ministry of health. Thousands of people will be homeless,forcibly displacedand living among the rubble of the towns and cities they no longer recognise.Israel is committing widespread and systematic violations of international law. This is plain to see. Organisations like my own have documented how the Israeli government iscommittingan array of atrocity crimes against Palestinians in Gaza,includingacts of genocide and the crime against humanity of extermination. An independentUN inquiryhas found the same.Under British and international law, arms licensing should be suspended if there is a “clear risk” that arms might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law. That threshold hasn’t just been crossed, it has been bulldozed.Last September, the governmentadmittedthe threshold has been crossed and halted about 30 export licences for military equipment that is used by the Israeli army in Gaza. But it left one critical loophole: F-35 fighter jet components that go into a globalF-35 supply programme,which isoverseenby the US, that Israel sources parts from.Fifteen per centof the F35 fighter jet – arguably the most lethal UK export used by Israeli forces in Gaza – is manufactured in the UK. It is reported that an F-35 was used in astrike on al-Mawasi, a designated safe zone, where Israeli forces dropped at least three 2,000lb bombs, apparently killing 90 people, including women and children.So if Keir Starmer, the prime minister, accepts that this critical legal threshold has been met, how can the government stand up in court and justify this breach of international law? Well, the government argues that the obligation to avoid selling arms that will be used in potential war crimes does not apply in this context because the F-35 programme iscrucial to ensuringglobal “peace and security”. What this means in practice is still unclear, but one component of delivering global peace and security, exposed during the last court hearing, appears to be that the UK doesn’t want a foreign policy at odds with the United States. According to documents submitted in evidence, upholding its obligations “would undermine US confidence in the UK and Nato at a critical juncture in our collective history and set back relations”.UK’s F-35 exports more important than stopping genocide, lawyers to argueRead moreThis argument is highly dangerous. It would allow states to flout their international obligations simply in order to appease an ally; and it risks running a coach and horses through the international arms control framework, including the UN arms trade treaty (ATT), which the UK ratified in 2014. It will have far-reaching consequences for the lives of people in Gaza and risks the conflict there becoming a blueprint for other armed conflicts, where international law is treated as optional and relationships with a powerful ally considered paramount. This is dangerous in any context but withDonald Trumpat the helm in the White House, it borders on the grotesquely absurd.Trump has aggressively attacked vital organs of justice and order such as the international criminal court (ICC) and the UN, often in defence of Israel, including byauthorising a sanctions programmethat targets the critical work of the ICC,withdrawing the USfrom the UN’s human rights council, and proposing to slash funding to the numerous UN programmes and institutions. His administration hassanctionedthe mass deportation and imprisonment of immigrants without respect for their due process rights.In the context of current hostilities in Gaza, Trump has further entrenched and hardenedJoe Biden’s approach, deepeningUS complicityin Israeli atrocities. Trump hassupportedthe ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, supported the campaign to liquidate the UN relief works agency for Palestine refugees in the near east (Unrwa), the main UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees. He hasencouragedIsrael to break the ceasefire,reverseda halt on the supply to Israel of the devastating 2,000lb bombs,lifted sanctionson violent actors in the West Bank, andthreatensforeign nationals who criticise Israel in the US with deportation. It is unsurprising that repression of Palestinians, settler violence and land seizures in the occupied West Bank have spiked since he took office.It is time for the UK to re-evaluate the so-called “special relationship” with the US and take a stand. Abandoning its legal defence of licensing F-35 fighter jet components to the global programme is the legal and moral thing to do, it is the humane thing to do, and it is also the popular thing to do, with polling showing that amajority of Britonssupport a suspension of arms exports to Israel. At a time of incredible uncertainty and geopolitical upheaval, Britain needs to stand up for and be committed to international law – even if it upsets Donald Trump.Yasmine Ahmed is UK director of Human Rights WatchDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the president appears ready to cut its budget and let it failMon 12 May 2025 08.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 08.24 EDTShareTheodore Roosevelt, to whomDonald Trump has likened himself, used his executive power to double the size of the national park system and expand protection of American natural landscapes and historic landmarks. He strongly supported a merit-based civil service that now includes the 100-year-old National Park Service (NPS).This small agency (its 2020 budget wasone-fifteenth of one percentof the overall federal budget) has as itsmissionpreserving “unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations”. Public surveys repeatedly show that Americans rank the National Park Service the highest among all federal agencies. Last year there were over 330 million visits to the parks, more than professional baseball, football, basketball and the Disney amusement parkscombined.Roosevelt, visiting Grand Canyon national park in 1903, proclaimed:Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it. What you can do is to keep it for your children, your children’s children, and for all who come after you, as one of the great sights which every American if he can travel at all should see.Yet today theTrump administrationhas turned its back on his role model’s wisdom. Bolstered by “free market acolytes” that have long pursued the parks as unrealized business opportunities, antipathy to public service, and the absence of congressional oversight, privatizing our national parks is now in their sights. Every American, Republicans and Democrats alike, should be outraged and determined in voicing their objections.The administration’s plan is as clear and stunning as the sun rising over the Grand Canyon. First, severely slash the budget of the NPS, force retirements of dedicated and experienced NPS leaders, terminatethe employment of those who refuse, cut the staffs of parks and historic sites, and replace park superintendents with political appointees ready to do the private sector’s bidding. Then, with failure as the goal, ignore the concerns of the public, the outdoor recreation industry, conservationists, and the communities near parks (many with Republican town governments) that are dependent upon visitor tourism for jobs and services.Next, the administration will claim the private sector can better run (read “exploit”) the parks that the administration purposely set up to fail. Trump officials will begin to find ways around the law, Congress and the public to eliminate the NPS and centralize control among theDoge staff embeddedat the Department of the Interior as a step toward putting the parks in the hands of private developers. The first to be privatized will be what they see as “cash cows” – parks with high visitation and profit potential, such as Yosemite, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. The Trump administration will suggest this is just a “pilot program” but the real intent is to test if the public, the courts and Congress can be safely ignored. If successful, the privatizing will expand to the sale, transfer or abandonment of the smaller park sites, such as Teddy Roosevelt’s home at Sagamore Hill national historic site. As clear evidence of this direction, on 2 May, the Trump administration released its fiscal year 2026 discretionary budget request proposing a $900m cut to the NPS budget andstated: “There is an urgent need to streamline staffing and transfer certain properties to State-level management.”What is at risk? This is not a concession operating a park lodge or a contractor keeping a campground clean. This is taking the people’s parks and giving them over to corporations with profit motives that will push for resort developments for the extremely wealthy and ticketed bison petting zoos for the general public. Turning national parks into entertainment venues – a zipline down the Grand Canyon from where Roosevelt once stood, or an exclusive golf course in Yosemite valley.What can be done to prevent this great harm to what has been called “America’s best idea”? A bipartisan effort within Congress is necessary to exert proper oversight and demand fidelity to the law regarding the national park system as a public resource. The mayors and city councils of the small towns in red and blue states that serve as gateway communities to the parks can make clear that weakening the National Park Service and privatizing the parks will affect their seasonal economy. The $800bn outdoor recreation industry can declare its existence is dependent upon keeping the public’s land public and the parks managed by the National Park Service and its dedicated employees. Citizens – regardless of political party – must defend the extraordinary privilege of passing the national parks on unimpaired to their children and grandchildren.And President Trump should perhaps reread the words of President Roosevelt:What you can do is keep it … for all that come after you.Jonathan B Jarvis served as the 18th director of the National Park Service.

But damage has already been doneMon 12 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 12.27 EDTShareSoon after Elon Musk slapped the air with a double Nazi salute, his brother Kimbal went on Xto say: “This is what success feels like.” And three months ago, he seemed to have a point.TheTrump administration, which appeared to have been co-led for a time by big brother Musk, is now in a period of retrenchment. Initiatives focused on Gaza, tariffs, spending, deporting millions of migrantand “government efficiency” have all deflated somewhat.We are admittedly only a small fraction of the way through this second Trump term, but a pattern appears to be emerging: the president proclaims a big policy goal, Maga appointees scramble to interpret his objectives, and then the whole thing is abandoned in paroxysm. Which isn’t to say that real harm isn’t being caused – just less than might otherwise be.First, the Gaza riviera. Trump’s response to the genocide in Palestine was to envision a grand ethnic cleansing embellished by Carrara marble and rickrack. Questions the president didn’t seem to have asked in advance: where would the Palestinians go? Why would Egypt or Jordan risk regime-ending instability? Who would pay for it all? Faced with the difficulty of implementing a complex plan,which only3% ofIsraeli Jews regard as immoral, Trump retreated.But not before facilitating harm. His explicit endorsement of themajorityview in Israel that Palestinian residents of Gaza should relocate has only permitted the leadership in that country to accelerate their Biden-era policy. Now, Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister,openly speaksof using starvation as a tool in Gaza, something the Israelis were shy aboutadmittingonly seven months ago. And since Benjamin Netanyahu’s government broke the ceasefire with Hamas in March, Israeli troops have murdered more than2,100Palestinians – the majority of them children. Again, an extension of the Biden policy, but without the chintzy gilt.The tariff debacle, meanwhile, showcased the administration’s inability to shoot straight. A Forbesanalysiscounts nine flip-flops on tariff policy. Bad policy is bad – whiplash makes it worse.One of the arguments explaining the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency – the tender most countries use for trade and global finance – is that the US is a big and stable country that pays its bills and honors its commitments. That trust in America’s ability to manage an economy confers lots of benefits to Americans, such as lower borrowing and transaction expenses. Demand for the US dollar allows the US to finance deficits, seemingly indefinitely.But there are signs that the erratic tariff policy has caused other countries – who buy US debt – toquestion old assumptionsabout stability and growth. It turns out that, like addressing Palestine, trade policy is hard.But it didn’t have to be like this – a measured tariff policy could have helped enhance American industry. Coupled with prohibitions on stockbuybacks– a Reagan-era concession to corruption that allows CEOs to inflate their stock prices and “performance” bonuses – a sensible tariff policy could have helped facilitate the investment of corporate profits domestically, reinvigorating the labor movement to produce better jobs. But policy requires a clear statement of goals and an understanding of how to get there – neither of which the Trump administration was able to articulate. Economic growth has almost certainly been dented by the bizarre trade war and myriad reversals – so we’ll probably see more deficit spending at higher borrowing rates.And then there’s Yemen, where the Houthi government has harassed Israeli-affiliated boats in response to the genocide. The catastrophic effort to bomb the Yemenis into submission, again, an extension of Joe Biden’s Israel policy, was preceded with bluster. In March, Trumpissueda message on his website that read, “To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!”But nearly two months into America’s bombing campaign, which has killedhundredsin Yemen atvast expense, the effort to open trade routes in the Red Sea has resulted in a negotiated detente which falls far short of achieving Trump’s goals. The deal commits the Yemenis to leaving American ships alone, but says nothing about Israeli-affiliated vessels. The Wall Street Journalreportsthat the deal took the Israelis by surprise.Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) dramaticallyoverestimated its potentialand overstated its accomplishments: at a meeting last month, Musk said he expected Doge cuts would save $150bn, or 85% less than the promised $1tn. Now Muskis returning to Tesla– whose weak quarterly results have caused thestock priceto crash back to earth.All of it a bad joke, played on the American people.Trump’s inability to follow through on his big initiatives is probably attributable to lots of things, but the quality of the man, and the people around him, stick out. Pete Hesgeth, the secretary of defense,appearsunfocused and unbalanced in interviews. Kristi Noem, head of the US Department of Homeland Security, seemsobsessedwith pageantry and appearances, while the attorney general,Pam Bondi, exhibits sycophantic tendencies. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and JD Vance spent a lot of time explaining how dangerous Trump was – VancecomparedTrump to Hitler – before joining his administration. All seem to have been hired for their ability to flatter and prostrate themselves, which is not the same as competence or executive experience.So now, a bigger picture is emerging. The operating moral principle directing the Trump presidency seems to be that people are generally worse than they proclaim to be. And the president has gone out of his way to hire people with limited talent and ability, whose main qualification is Maga, people who can’t follow through on big pronouncements and goals. It is indeedgovernment by the worst.Ahmed Moor is a writer and fellow at the Foundation for Middle East PeaceExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGazaElon MuskUS politicsYemenTrump administrationUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

But will Starmer test Labour to destruction?Polly ToynbeeThere’s more to this policy than merely chasing Nigel Farage. But it risks driving voters towards the Lib Dems and GreensMon 12 May 2025 12.49 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareImmigration is a tinderbox. No one listening to voters on doorsteps in recent local elections could deny this. Nothing Labour does will satisfy those few who rate immigration as their top concern, but its new immigration plan is a serious endeavour to stop cheap labour undercutting pay. How will it go down? If Labour HQ celebrates a splash of rightwing front pages whooping up its toughest measures, those same headlines may propel more Labour people into the arms of the Liberal Democrats and Greens. But there is more depth to Labour’s policy than merely chasingNigel Farage.An old theory – that immigration squeezes out British people by taking available jobs – is being turned into a real-life social experiment. We shall now see if what sounds plausible works in practice. Is cheap labour really the cause of Britain’s high rate of economic inactivity and businesses’ rotten record in training new employees?There will be no more visas for low-skilled workers, especially foreign care workers. That creates a problem for all of the care homes that have come to depend on immigrants. Will the country’s1.5 million out-of-work people, or its 9 million economically inactive people, take on the estimated150,000 vacanciesthat exist in the care sector? Another group the government is targeting are the10,000 peoplewho paid a fortune to fraudulent recruiters for visas to do jobs that didn’t exist. The government is due to match them with care jobs, while people already here on visas who want to stay longer will be able to get extensions if they, too, take on these roles.But will it work? Nearly a fifth of care workers come from overseas, and care providers protest vigorously that their jobs attract no applicants. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, has said the plans deal “acrushing blowto an already fragile sector”. But only higher pay will entice people who can earn more in Aldi. The government has delayed its promised fair pay agreement for care workers to 2028. Decadesof failure to reform care will stretch into the blue yonder. Now we’ll see if people in Britain will take the place of barred migrants.Yvette Cooper says there will be 50,000 fewer low-skilled visas issued this year. It’s a modest target. It’s good to make employers wanting to bring in staff from overseas prove they are training British employees first. For those employers that are cutting home apprenticeships, Starmer has warned that the cost of engineering visas will rocket.But blocking visas is itself a risky experiment that may limit Labour’s other big ambition: growth. If care homes or other businesses fold (chefs, florists and more are on the list of occupationsbarred from having low-skilled visas issued), Keir Starmer may beat a retreat. Politically, it may not be wise to take another swing at the rising number of elderly voters by assaulting their threadbare care sector. Since old people are the mostopposed to migration, maybe the dilemma should be put to them: immigration or care?Universities have largely escapeda raid on the already diminished numbers of foreign students. Many universities are already teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. But a proposed new levy on foreign students risks undermining them, weakening their soft power. This seems madness:more than a quarter of the world’s countrieshave leaders who were educated here in Britain. Meanwhile, highly skilled workers will still get visas. That’s sensible: a rich supply of scientists will be fleeing stricken US universities, and the EU Horizon programme has granted Britain £500m in research funding.Eye-catching announcements that pleased the rightwing press included the requirement for a higher standard of English to get a visa. So did the plans to make it easier to deport foreign criminals. A law that toughens interpretation of article 8 of the European convention on human rights to make judgments on the “right to a family life” more consistent is sensible, though the suggestion that immigration lawyers were using this to make deportation more difficult was bogus. When Theresa May told the Conservative party conference in 2011 about “the illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat”, the judiciary quickly pointed out that she was the onemaking things up.UK risks becoming ‘island of strangers’ without more immigration curbs, Starmer saysRead moreThough this month’s figures will show total migration falling fast since last summer, the politically explosive details are rising numbers of people arriving by boat and the 38,000 asylum seekers currently housed in hotels. Runcorn’s425-bed hotelfull of asylum seekers waiting without work has caused deep local resentment. Starmer’s message of “compassion and control” talks across a divide within his own party: some MPs have many large migrant constituencies, while others fear anti-migrant voters. Hismessage of integration, based on rewarding those who contribute most, will strike the right chord for some, but not others.This immigration reform should be an opening for new honesty about trade-offs and choices. Treat voters seriously. Don’t take fright at Reform, and confront these cynical manipulators and untruth tellers head-on. Just over half of voters want fewer migrants (I would have expected more), but it’s the priority issue for only 27% of those polled. Reform’s policies are impossible: on Monday, its deputy leader, Richard Tice, repeated manifesto pledges of “net zero migration” and promised to “freeze migration” (except doctors and nurses). Really?Labour should be looking its enemy in the eye and defying this utter nonsense. The old rightwing trick of casting anyone who challenges their impossibilism as the “metropolitan elite” has often paralysed politicians who fear being seen as out of touch. Debate over this policy should expose the Faragists for the snake-oil charlatans they are.Many people, particularly on the left, will accuse Labour of shoddy vote-chasing, and Starmer of resorting to nativist language, focusing on his warning about an “island of strangers”. Labour MP Nadia Whittome talked of “anti-migrant rhetoric” as being both “shameful and dangerous”. Zarah Sultana, elected in 2019 as Labour MP in Coventry South but since suspended, also weighed in quickly. “Did Nigel Farage write this speech?”she asked on Bluesky. Managing turbulence and blowback, keeping the Labour coalition on board while being seen to address wider concerns, will be the challenge now.Still, there is more depth to this policy than chasing populists. Yvette Cooper has long believed there’s nothing social democratic about loose borders letting in cheap labour to undercut stagnating British pay. If cheap labour was so good for growth, how come the economy has been flatlining while immigration rose? And exactly whose growth was is it good for in this most unequal country? These old arguments are now being subjected to a real-time experiment. Soon we will know, either way.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Both of these attributes will be at a premium if the minister is to succeed where others have not.Throughout the election campaign, expectations were raised that the failed attempts in the last parliament to overhaul and reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999would be a priority for the prime minister in this term.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThree major attempts to reform environment laws have failed over the past 15 years, including in the first term of the Rudd government, during the Morrison government and again last term. All ended in more division and confusion.Anthony Albanese reveals new cabinet with Tanya Plibersek named as minister for social servicesRead moreFor environmentalists, the need for the Australian governmentto play a stronger and clearer leadership rolein stemming the protracted decline in the health of the natural world is an article of faith, backed by a depressing array of scientific reports thathighlight the inextricable loss of wildlife and biodiversity, compounded by the real time impacts of climate change.Extinction is not a moment in time but rather a consequence of thousands of small and piecemeal decisions over many years. A bitter harvest of large-scale extinction has been hard baked into our nation’s future. Without urgent change, including large scale restoration and reforestation of previously cleared country, we are leaving the future a landscape devoid of birdsong and wonder.From the perspective of the natural world, the existing laws have so many loopholes that you could drive a truck through them. Thelogging of native forests and large-scale land clearingof carbon-rich and biologically important regrowth forests and woodlands continues to get the green light.For business, the laws are perceived as placing a complex and environmentally ineffectual brake on economic development, including the rollout of renewables, new housing developments on the outskirts of our major cities and new mines.The curse of our federated system of government and a constitution drafted to meet the needs of Australia in the late 19th century means that when it comes to protecting the environment and supporting new development, decision-making between all layers of government is conflicted, complex and confusing. We get the worst of all worlds, where process trumps environmental and development outcomes on every level.Despite this, a blueprint for durable reform was put forward by Graeme Samuel, who conducted an independent review of the effectiveness of the laws in 2020. These recommendations became the heart of the Nature Positive Plan which was developed by then minister Tanya Plibersek in late 2022.We have now wasted 15 years since the first reforms to the national environment laws were mootedThe Nature Positive Plan was centred on three key concepts. The first was an unambiguously pro-environment commitment by the Australian government to create and enforce clear national environmental standards.These new and powerful standards were intended to make sure the government fulfilled its obligation to protect “matters of national environmental significance” in all its decision-making and to support long-term conservation planning, including support for recovery plans, regional plans and embedding genuine partnerships with First Nations communities.The second element of the reform aimed to simplify decision-making in respect to major development projects, including through reform and possible accreditation of state government assessment and project approval systems, consistent with the requirements of the national environmental standards.The third reform was the creation of an independent environment protection agency to build trust and accountability in decision-making, to ensure standards were applied, projects were compliant and to remove politics from the day-to-day of environmental policy.These three pillars of policy reform remain critically important to build a durable pathway forward. To deliver them needs leadership from the highest levels of government at state and federal level. Attempts to drive these complex reforms through the environment ministry alone have failed every time over the past 15 years.Australia has backed a rapid shift to renewable energy - and given Labor a chance on climate. How will it act? | Clear AirRead moreFurthermore, unless the states are brought in at the outset, many of the on-ground reforms required to stem the loss and to promote the restoration of nature will fail, as ultimately the states retain most powers to protect the environment.The role and influence of the Western Australian government in helping toscuttle reforms in the past termare a case in point. It is easy to throw rocks from outside the tent – it is time for the state premiers to become part of the solution rather than blockers.Long-term reform is not going to be easy, but we have now wasted 15 years since the first reforms to the national environment laws were mooted, and everyone has lost, especially the natural world. Watt has a massive responsibility, as does the prime minister and his cabinet, to get it right this time and to bring the parliament with them. Without support in the Senate, reforms will again languish and whither on the vine.Lyndon Schneiders is executive director of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity FoundationExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionWildlifeClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

Moves to decriminalise abortion, in response to thecontinued prosecution of women for having one, could unintentionally enable the restriction of access under a future regressive government. To prevent this and protect services, it is time to write into our statute that safe and legal access to abortion is a human right across our nation.It still shocks many people to realise that in 2025 abortion is not actually legal for most of the UK. Only in Northern Ireland do women have a right to an abortion. Everywhere else they are exempted from prosecution if it is determined they have met certain access conditions. This is not a quaint jurisprudence debate – it is driving the explosion in recent years of investigations and prosecutions of women and girls for having abortions in England. A vulnerable 15-year-old girl who didn’t know she was pregnant and had alate-term miscarriagefound a police constable at her hospital bed. Others have spent years under suspicion and investigation, andin some cases in jail.These cases, and the chilling effect they have on services, come at a time when the anti-abortion movement is turning its attention to our shores. Millions of pounds isflowing into campaigning and networking, pushing not for an explicit end to services but “safeguards” – all ruses to make getting a termination harder. Incendiary language abounds, as decriminalisation is claimed to mean “abortion at birth”. The US vice-president, JD Vance, hasopenly criticisedour buffer zones that protect women going to clinics from harassment as “anti free speech”. Ever the opportunist, Nigel Farage has argued parliament should debate a reduction in the time limit under which women can secure a termination. At the heart of this is a simple premise – women cannot be trusted to make decisions about their own bodies and should be policed accordingly.I recognise the appeal of simple solutions to stop the prosecutions – including using the upcoming policing bill to insert a clause removing women from the application of the 18th-century act that puts having an abortion on a par with assaulting a clergyman, bigamy and manslaughter. But in our toxic political environment this is to play Russian roulette with abortion access. It is a standard feature of any legislation that it gives the right to make secondary regulations to government about the topics in the bill – the Henry VIII powers that are the mainstay of executive overreach. Inserting the issue of abortion into any act of parliament without directing what happens next is like handing a future government a loaded gun to point at women’s rights – if passed, this would give powers to restrict or even end access to abortion with minimal democratic opportunity to intervene.The case of Nicola Packer tells us this: Britain is shamed by its abortion laws – and must change them | Jonathan LordRead moreThis risk doesn’t mean we shouldn’t act. The battle to provide abortion at all in Northern Ireland began in earnest once we passed a law requiring the secretary of state to deliver treatment as a human right. Resistance came not just from the Democratic Unionist party, but also from those charged with delivery, including the civil service and healthcare departments. The secretary of state had to intervene or face direct censure. That meant when those in positions of power used their role to prevent services from being set up, ministers knocked heads together and got things moving again. We can learn from this now in protecting existing services such as buffer zones and shape future provision too. It is time that women in Birmingham, Bristol and Barry had the same constitutionally protected right as women in Belfast to a safe medical treatment if they choose not to continue a pregnancy.This week we will lay an alternative amendment to the policing bill that doesn’t just repeal the antiquated criminal law and free women from the threat of prosecution. It also puts in place a plan for what happens next – an explicit human rights framework to ensure safe access and prevent the rolling back of abortion rights, whoever is in power.It would not alter the settled time limit for a termination, nor would it prevent prosecution of anyone who forces a woman to have an abortion. It would mean, for the first time in history, women here could point to their right to choose – and demand it is protected, as it is in France, Mexico, Colombia and Ireland. Any subsequent regulation affecting how abortions are provided, or equally importantly the work of those who offer them, would also have to uphold this human right too.Crucially in our febrile political climate, this amendment comes with a democratic lock to prevent the use of secondary legislative powers to change these rights. If a future government wanted to destroy abortion provision it would have to get the consent of the whole parliament – giving all citizens the ability to lobby their MP accordingly. Pandora’s box contained both chaos and hope – getting these proposals right could not only prevent further attacks on women’s rights, but also finally put abortion access here on the health and human rights footing it deserves.Stella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for WalthamstowExplore more on these topicsAbortionOpinionWomenHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The only thing the government has to offer is that it’s the least worst optionMon 12 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 10.33 EDTShareIt is less than a year into thisLabourgovernment and we are already in another cycle of scare tactics. During the general election, any concerns expressed over Labour’s policies (or lack thereof) were quickly shut down by the pressing need to get a disastrous Tory government out.Now in power, concerns have been once again pushed aside. There is no time for the luxury of scrutiny of accountability, because nowReform is risingand the party must be stopped. Once again, the voter is asked to park their issues with Labour and save the nation from a worse alternative. “A vote for anyone but Labour risks more chaos under a Farage-Tory coalition,”posted the Labour partyon its X account in early May. “Vote Labour. Stop Reform.”This is hostage politics.When voters are asked constantly to make decisions not on the kind of government they want, but the one they don’t want, something is broken. The voter is held captive and presented with a series of escalating threats that only a vote for Labour can prevent. Reform’sbig gainsin the local elections, like a severed finger in a bloody envelope, are proof that no one is bluffing. Vote Labour, stop Reform.In the meantime, there can be no discussion of Labour’s record in office so far, its cutting ofdisability benefits, winter fuel allowance, preservation of the two-child limit, or its leadership’s excruciating failure to inspire or carve out a clear identity. You could argue that Reform has, in fact, been a gift to Labour, and you wouldn’t be wrong. According to reports, Labour insiders “see asilver lining in the rise of Reform”, because it means the government can terrorise Green voters on the doorstep and say “it’s fine if you want to vote Green, but you’ll have Nigel Farage in Downing Street”.With extortion as an organising principle of politics, what you definitely have whether Farage makes it into Downing Street or not is a system that cannot be defined as democracy. And it is not a phenomenon limited to Britain’s own particular microclimate. Centrist parties as a whole across the developed world are posting poor results. This is because they have few answers to the historic diminishment in prospects we are seeing across the world. Many people are unable to secure a life in which basic rights – housing, stable employment, a decent income – are guaranteed. Cost of living crises, weak economic growth,wage stagnation, decreasing upward mobility, and an inability to live the generally dignified lives their parents had, is hitting younger generations the hardest. An entire cohort of people is entering participatory democracy and realising that their future is cancelled.Fixing England’s water isn’t just the right thing to do – it can be the start of Labour’s fightback | Clive LewisRead moreThe result is a growing and logical loss of faith in the system.Polling showsthat among young adults in the west, satisfaction with democracy is “plummeting further and faster … than any other group”. The 2008 financial crash produced a system in whichwealth became so concentratedthat in the US, the result was the “largest spike in wealth inequality in postwar American history”.Elsewhere in Europe, austeritydeepened inequalityand shrank public services. Political and economic policies, from quantitative easing that favours the wealthy, to cuts to the public sector that by their nature affect the middle and working classes, were all decisions that chose to privilege one set of people and institutions over another. And today, parties like Labour are hellbent on maintaining the system those bequeathed those decisions, while demanding that voters stabilise it by stifling their frustrations and aspirations for a better life.There is contempt here. Labour’s escalatinganti-immigration rhetoricand its promotion of fiscal prudence, which is just austerity by another name, are the policies not of a party doing its best in difficult circumstances, but one making active ideological decisions. Instead of changes, say, to the tax system, and a commitment to thinking differently about an economic paradigm that has reached an undeniable dead end, Labour looks at the rising wave of populist politics, scratches its head, and decides to tell voters that the populism is the problem, not the world that created it. “Serious pragmatism defeats performative politics,” Keir Starmer drones. OK. But there comes a point at which you have to ask why “performative” politics, something which Starmer believes is the hallmark of the right and the left, is snapping at your heels less than a year into your tenure.The galling thing is that yes, of course, Reform and far-right parties are worse. But Labour is not only complicit, it is instrumental in ensuring that those forces are in play at all. It is all resonant of the pre-Arab spring warning to would-be revolutionaries – there will be chaos once the dictators are gone. The dictators went and the chaos did follow. But the reason for that wasn’t that wanting freedom and dignity is wrong. For too long economic mismanagement and political oppression were allowed to build up in the system, only held together by brute force of fear and inability to imagine or generate what could come after. The self-defined custodians of stability in fact make instability inevitable by not creating the conditions for the emergence of another viable alternative, and in fact, destroying it when it does threaten to emerge.But fear can only go so far. And constantly using fear only for things to stay the same, rather than for them to get better, is a dangerous strategy. It only proves that the government does indeed have nothing to offer. The bare-minimum management of an economic model that has long ceased to work for too many people, and in which voters feel they have no power, can only go in one direction – towards an unhinged right. Labour can threaten all it likes, but in doing so it may push voters in that direction.Sometimes – and you only need to look across the Atlantic for a chilling example of this – the potential possibilities in a chaos voters feel they have chosen are better than the stalemate they feel they have not. A hostage thatbegins to lose hope of ever being released sometimes takes a calculated risk and tackles its captor.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government and plans for the next three yearsExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

This time, will it last?Paul TaylorThe public finances look strong and new construction signals rebirth – or the hubris that heralds yet another collapseMon 12 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 13.17 EDTShareCranes are finally whirling over a long-blighted stretch of wasteland on the Athens Riviera, just 6 miles from the Acropolis, which has been a symbol of Greece’s rise, fall and rise again over the past two decades. Yet it remains to be seen whether the country’s latest economic spring will prove more durable than past spikes in its historical cycle of boom and bust.TheEllinikon construction site, soon to feature luxury residences, the tallest apartment building andlargest shopping mallin the country, two hotels, a marina, a resort complex and sports, recreational and cultural facilities, is an ambivalent symbol of peak Greece.To the government ofKyriakos Mitsotakis, darling of the European centre-right, the development is emblematic of the new dynamism of the Greek economy and the country’s attractiveness as an investment location. To its critics, Ellinikon is just another luxury real-estate project built by oligarchs for the super-rich and foreigners, on public land bought for a steal, while ordinary Greeks continue to see their living standards stagnate and public services decline.The 6.2 sq km Ellinikon site was home to the capital’s airport from the 1930s until 2001, when the gleaming, EU-subsidised Eleftherios Venizelos international airport opened to the east of the city in time for the spectacular 2004 Athens Olympic Games.That was the last time Greece was on top of the world. The country had just joined the euro single currency – byfiddling the books, it later transpired – and a modernising socialist prime minister, Costas Simitis, was hailed as the Tony Blair of the southern Balkans. Greek was chic (remember the hit film My Big Fat Greek Wedding?). Tourism was booming. Even the national football team had becomeimprobable European champions.In Greece, our general strike was a flop. Here’s why not enough people joined it | Yanis VaroufakisRead moreFast forward a decade and Greece was at rock bottom after defaulting on its debt and enduring three EU-IMFbailout programmesthat shrank the economy by 26% and imposed draconian austerity. The debt crisis erupted when it was revealed in 2009 that the country hadmassively understatedits budget deficit. Bond markets panicked and stopped lending to Athens, forcing it to appeal to the EU for loans that came with harsh conditions.The ensuing descent caused mass unemployment, widespread impoverishment and abrain drainof some 10% of the population. It also blew up the country’s politics, long dominated by the rival patronage systems of the conservative New Democracy and the socialist Pasok parties.An anti-austerity government, led by the radical-left Syriza party, was elected in 2015 andwon a referendumto reject the bailout terms, only to bow to the creditors’ conditions weeks later when faced with the alternative of ejection from the eurozone.The so-called troika of the IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank forced Athens to raise money by selling off state assets, including theport of Piraeusto the Chinese national shipping company Cosco and the disused Ellinikonairport-to-nowhereto the only bidder at the time, a consortium led by the billionaire Spiros Latsis, who has sprawling banking, shipping, real-estate and oil interests.Public protests, squatters and court challenges long prevented any development of the site, which had been due to be turnedinto a parkbefore the debt crisis. The old terminal buildings had been used to house mostly Afghan refugeesin squalid conditionsduring the 2015-16 migration crisis, as hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers poured into Greece across the Aegean Sea from Turkey. The makeshift refugee camp waseventually closed in 2017.In 2023, builders finally broke ground on theRiviera Tower, a 50-floor beachfront apartment complex designed by the star British architect Norman Foster’s firm, and the 200-metre skyscraper will open next year. There will eventually also be a (smaller) public park, Latsis’s company, Lamda Development, has pledged.View image in fullscreenA protest against austerity in Athens, 4 May 2010.Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty ImagesWhether Ellinikon is really a sign of an enduring Greek renaissance is hotly disputed. For many Greeks, not much has improved since the dark days of the debt crisis. Unemploymenthas fallenbut wages and pensions havebarely increased, inflation –especially in rents– has eroded living standards, and schools, hospitals and public transport have not recovered. The country is still seething over the lack of accountability for a head-ontrain collisiontwo years ago that killed 57 people and exposed chronic safety failures, raising accusations of a political cover-up to evade responsibility.This year’s 10th Delphi Economic Forum, a sort of annual Hellenic Davos in the home town of the ancient Greek oracle, was disrupted by a nationwidegeneral strikeover wages and public services that prevented many foreign delegates from arriving. Mitsotakis, whoseapproval rating has slumped, used the occasion to trumpet Greece’s healthy growth rate and take a dig at Germany, the most Scrooge-like of its creditors during the crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our economy is outperforming most European countries. When I look at, for example, the reforms that the German government is currently announcing, lots of those reforms we have already implemented in Greece,” hetold an interviewerin Delphi. Greeks remember only too well when they were caricatured as profligate, lazy crooks by German media, a depiction epitomised by a Germanmagazine coverthat featured the goddess Aphrodite giving the finger to Europe, with the caption: “Cheats in the euro family: is Greece robbing us?”On the surface, Greece is generating a healthy primary budget surplus, and the credit-rating agency S&P has just upgraded its rating to BBB. After the strike, Mitsotakis found enough spare cash to announce a€1bn (£850m) support packagefor low-income pensioners, tenants and other vulnerable groups. Public support for the EU in Greece has also recovered from record lows during the debt crisis.Two-thirdsof Greeks now say EU membership is good for their country.But Greece’s boom is fuelled by real estate, tourism and shipping rather than a revival in manufacturing or innovation. “Once you scratch beneath the headline macroeconomic and fiscal data, there is darkness,” says Nick Malkoutzis, the editor and co-founder of the Greek economic website MacroPolis. “Mitsotakis runs a tight fiscal ship, but we can’t rely on tourism and real estate for ever.”Underinvestment in forestry and emergency services means that Greece is particularly ill-prepared for climate-induced disasters such as the wildfires and floods that have become increasingly frequent, Malkoutzis says.A handful of powerful, politically connected oligarchic families continues to dominate the economy, with highly concentrated media ownership.Corruptionremains corrosive, while the country is near bottom of the table in the EU forpress freedom and the rule of law.So on closer inspection, the new Greece looks uncannily like the old Greece, with stronger public finances but enduring social and economic imbalances.

Sussan Ley, deputy for the past three years, carries the flag for the moderates (although she is aligned to the old Scott Morrison faction, which is led by Alex Hawke, one-time Morrison numbers man).Her opponent, Angus Taylor, who’s been shadow treasurer, leads the conservatives.Neither Ley nor Taylor has impressed during the last term, but that’s become beside the point.Taylor has embraced the ambitious Price, who has defected (amid great bitterness) from the Nationals, to boost his support as part of a joint ticket.Jacinta Nampijinpa Price pushes for return to Liberal party ‘roots’ in bid for deputy leadershipRead moreWhether the combination will work for or against Taylor’s chances remains to be seen. There are fears in the Ley camp it may attract some undecideds, but it possibly could frighten off others.Price was elevated spectacularly to national prominence as the most effective “no” campaigner against the voice. She is forceful and articulate, and the conservative base of theCoalitionloves her.But leaving aside the complication that she’s a senator, her performance in the voice campaign doesn’t automatically translate into qualifications for deputy, which, if done properly, is a demanding, multi-faceted job.The Liberal deputy needs deep roots in the party, not having just arrived in controversial circumstances. They have to do a lot of work with the party organisation, not just the parliamentary party.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn the latter, the deputy is there in part to protect the leader’s back and to keep track of the mood of colleagues, which requires having longstanding relationships of familiarity and trust with them.Some would argue the ideal deputy is a person who does not have their eyes on the leadership, which Price clearly has.The deputy needs a broad grasp of policy areas, because they will be a high-profile public spokesperson for the party, and will be hit with questions on every issue that’s running.The deputy also has to be comfortable with media across the spectrum, because that’s part of the job. Price’s natural home has been on Sky News. On Sunday, she appeared on Sky’s highly opinionated program Outsiders.If the Liberals are to get themselves back into shape, they must seek to regain their appeal in the urban areas that went teal in 2022, and to women. Indeed, they have to tap into professional women in those places. It is unlikely Price, unless she undergoes a major political makeover, would be attractive to that constituency.In their bid for the support of women, the Liberals need a root-and-branch debate about how to get more female candidates, but Price is already totally against quotas.If Price becomes deputy it will be a wild ride for the party – and for its leader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Either would be less fraught for the party than Price. O’Brien would have the problem of being welded on to the nuclear policy, which will be at least overhauled and perhaps ditched by the Liberals.Ley is set to have a running mate, but the name has not yet been disclosed.Another option would be for the loser out of Ley and Taylor to become deputy. Awkward, but perhaps the cleanest way forward. Ley is used to the role; Taylor would be entitled to stay shadow treasurer and would be at the centre of things (what things are left).Nationals’ identity battleIn the Nationals, the leadership contest – to be decided Monday – is also a battle over identity.The Nationals under David Littleproud held almost all their seats at the election but one-time resources minister Matt Canavan – a Barnaby Joyce supporter back in the day – says they need a new direction.Critical to his pitch are energy and climate issues. The Nationals signed up reluctantly to net zero emissions by 2050 in the Morrison prime ministership, when Joyce was leader (although he indicated he personally didn’t favour doing so). They were dragged to the deal with great reluctance.Canavan, who is a senator, said in his leadership pitch, “We should scrap the futile and unachievable goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Net zero makes everything more expensive and it is not helping the environment given that the US, China and India are no longer even paying lip service to it.”Littleproud, describing the challenge as “healthy for our democracy”, is favoured to see off the Canavan bid. Regardless, it is a reminder the Nationals remain a divided party, as they have been for years.Michelle Grattan is a professorial fellow at the University of CanberraThis article was originally published inThe ConversationExplore more on these topicsJacinta Nampijinpa PriceOpinionLiberal partyAustralian politicsCoalitionNational partycommentShareReuse this content"

The writer explains why this story is so personal to himMon 12 May 2025 11.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareKazuo Ishiguro still remembers where he was when he wrote A Pale View of Hills: hunched over the dining room table in a bedsit in Cardiff. He was in his mid-20s then; he is 70 now. “I had no idea that the book would be published, let alone that I had a career ahead of me as a writer,” he says. “[But] the story remains an important part of me, not only because it was the start of my novel-writing life, but because it helped settle my relationship with Japan.”First published in 1982, A Pale View of Hills is a charged family story that connects England withJapanand the present with the past. Now along comes a film version to provide a new frame for the mystery, a fresh view of the hills. Scripted and directed by Kei Ishikawa, it is a splendidly elegant and deliberate affair; a trail of carefully laid breadcrumbs that link a mothballed home in early 80s suburbia with wounded, resilient postwar Nagasaki. Middle-aged Etsuko is long settled in the UK and haunted by the fate of her displaced eldest child. Her younger daughter, Niki, is a budding writer, borderline skint and keen to make a name for herself. Niki has a chunky tape-recorder and plenty of time on her hands. She says, “Mum, will you tell me about your lives before, in Japan?”In awarding Ishigurothe Nobel prize for literaturein 2017, the Swedish Academy paid tribute to the emotional force of his prose and his focus on “memory, time and self-delusion”. These are the themes that colour all his fiction, whether he is writing about the below-stairs staff at a stately home (The Remains of the Day), sacrificial children at an elite boarding school (Never Let Me Go) or aged wanderers in Arthurian Britain (The Buried Giant), although they seem closest to home in A Pale View of Hills.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t be too reverential’…Kazuo Ishiguro.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APThe story lightly excavates the author’s family history and his own hybrid identity as a child of Nagasaki, transplanted to the UK at the age of five. Fittingly, the movie version premieres at theCannes film festival, where it risks getting lost amid the palm trees, yachts and bling. Cultural dislocation, in large part, is what the tale is about.My mother saw the book as an evolution of her stories about Nagasaki. What a pity she isn’t here to see the filmI’m tempted to view Niki – the bumptious young writer from whom no family secret is safe – as Ishiguro’s alter ego. Actually, he says, she was conceived as “more a ‘reader proxy’ than a writer one”. She’s our entry point to the story; possibly our red thread through the maze. It’s hard to believe today, he adds, but most contemporary British readers were resistant to Japanese stories and characters and needed a reassuring western presence to help ease them in.Niki is played in the film by Camilla Aiko, a recent graduate of the Bristol Old Vic theatre school. She sees the character as the story’s truth-seeker, the eyes of the audience, and the picture itself as the tale of two women who struggle to connect. “It didn’t cross my mind – maybe it should have – that I was playing Ishiguro,” she says.What she shares with the author is the same blended cultural heritage. Aiko is British mixed-race – her mother is Japanese. “And the thing about being mixed-race is that I find it difficult speaking for Japanese people or British people because I’m not sure which side I’m on. In Japan I’m a foreigner; here I’m Asian. As an actor I’m someone who tries to slip through the cracks.”View image in fullscreen‘I try to slip through the cracks’ … Camilla Aiko as Niki.Photograph: ©2025 A Pale View of Hills Film PartnersNiki isn’t Ishiguro. Nonetheless, the author admits that there are parallels. He says, “Where I see myself in Niki – and I was reminded of this watching Camilla Aiko’s fine performance – is in her sometimes uncomfortable, sometimes coy and cunning curiosity when coaxing memories from her mother of another, more troubled time.”It is the mother, after all, who looms largest in the tale. Etsuko in a sense has led two lives and been two different people. In 80s England she is a respectable widowed music teacher. In Nagasaki seven years after the atomic bomb dropped, she’s a harried young bride, contaminated with radiation and a potential hazard to her unborn child. She needs a friend or an escape route, whichever comes first. But she is never an entirely reliable narrator – and the family story she tells Niki finally doesn’t add up.What did Ishiguro’s own mother make of A Pale View of Hills? “I believe it remained special to her among my books,” he says. “A little before I started the book, with cold war tensions intensifying in the Reagan-Brezhnev era, she said to me she felt it was important she should relate to me some of her experiences in Nagasaki. Partly because I was of the next generation, but also because I was wanting to be a writer and had a chance to pass things on … A Pale View of Hills didn’t use any of her stories directly, but I think she thought the book was some sort of evolution of them, and closer to her than the books I wrote later.” Ishiguro’s mother died in 2019, aged 92. After watching Ishikawa’s adaptation, he thought: “What a pity she wasn’t here to see this film.”View image in fullscreenNear perfect … Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REXCinema is an enduring passion for Ishiguro and influences his writing as much as literature does. His favourite recent films include the Oscar-winning animation Flow, about a small soot-grey cat who survives a great flood, plus the French legal dramas Anatomy of a Fall andSaint Omer(“Is French justice really conducted like this? Or are these hallucinatory versions of French courts?”).A few years back, between novels, he wrote the screenplay forLiving– a quietly wrenching adaptation of Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 classic Ikiru, relocated to London and starring Bill Nighy and Aimee Lou Wood. The poster for Ikiru, incidentally, can be glimpsed on the street in A Pale View of Hills.Loving film can be a double-edged sword. Is it a help or a hindrance when it comes to having his own work adapted? Hopefully the former, Ishiguro says, so long as he maintains a safe distance. “I have a strict rule not to attempt to adapt any of my novels myself,” adds the writer, who is speaking to me by email. “As long as I keep well in the background, I don’t think I’m necessarily a hindrance. I always emphasise to film-makers that they have toownthe film – that it shouldn’t be approached reverentially.”Merchant-Ivory managed a near perfect adaptation ofThe Remains of the Day. Mark Romanek and Alex Garland crafted an appropriately haunting, chilly version ofNever Let Me Go. Both films preserve Ishiguro’s distinctive style and flavour.

I know many novelists who’d be annoyed to hear me say this … The thing is, I watch many, many films and when an adaptation of a well-known book doesn’t work, 95% of the time it’s because the film-makers have been too reverential to the source.” Books and films are very different, he thinks. “They’re sometimes almost antithetical.”My favourite Ishiguro: by Margaret Atwood, Ian Rankin and moreRead moreIn A Pale View of Hills, Etsuko hands her story on to Niki. Niki, in turn, will write it up how she likes. So this is a family story about family stories, aware of how they warp and change in the telling. Every tale is subject to the same cultural static. They are adapted and extrapolated, lost and found in translation. One might even say that’s what keeps a story alive.“The other thing,” Ishiguro says. “It might sound like modesty when I encourage film adaptations to ‘move on’ the story. But actually it’s a form of egomania. I have aspirations for my stories to be like those of, say, Homer. Or to become like certain fairytales and myths, moving through the centuries and varying cultures, adapting and growing to speak to different audiences. My novels are themselves made up of materials I’ve inherited, imbibed and remoulded.

I once got sent footage of a few hundred people on either side of a tube track singing it at each other’Interviews by Lee CampbellMon 12 May 2025 09.34 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 12.47 EDTShareGuy Garvey, songwriter, vocalsBy 2007, we’d had a nerve-racking couple of years. We were on the V2 label for our first three albums but they were slowly folding. We signed with Fiction without them having heard a note of our fourth album, Seldom Seen Kid. As the money was running out, it was looking like “proper job” time. I would have been behind a nightclub till. Mark Potter would have been a chef and his brother Craig would have been an auxiliary nurse. But thankfully we got an advance and we were over the bloody moon.It had been an eventful time. Our friend Bryan Glancy, the real Seldom Seen Kid, had died, and I’d just got together withEmma Jane Unsworth, who I was then with for almost a decade.I got a call from David Joseph, who was head of Universal Music. He said: “Congratulations on the album but have you got anything else, to help us out on radio?” I said: “Given that it’s taken us two and a half years to write the 10 tracks that you have, I doubt it. But by all means, I’ll give it a go.”We had just over two weeks to come up with something before the final mastering for the album had to be complete. Over the next couple of days, I started kicking ideas around, recording some simple voice notes at home. The first idea I had was in the bath. I’m literally saying the words: “Blinking in the morning sun.” It had like a weird da-da-da thing about it. I went down to the studio with Craig and we said: “Let’s just take a run at this.”I’d had that lyric – “Throw those curtains wide” – for years. I’d tried the idea once before on anElbowsong called Ribcage, where I sing: “Pull my ribs apart and let the sun inside.” I left home at 17 and was absolutely skint for years but, no matter how dark or miserable I got, if I saw the dawn, it was all right.At Blueprint Studios in Salford, Craig fleshed out the chords. I had the idea of every line being echoed by a string section. You throw strings at a track and the listener feels ennobled, catered for and looked after. I recall analysing Bitter Sweet Symphony by the Verve and Unfinished Sympathy by Massive Attack, as well as Up With People by Lambchop, Loaded by Primal Scream and Spiritualized’s Ladies and Gentlemen. The song exploded into what can only be described as Lion King-esque euphoria.I knew the track was going to be a singalong of some proportions. I was freshly in love and Manchester was looking fantastic. The future was rosy. It was a feeling of, this is too joyous to keep to ourselves.View image in fullscreenGarvey performing with the band at Glastonbury 2008.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA Archive/PA PhotosThe loveliest legacy of the song is that at least twice a week, somebody approaches me in the street and tells me that they walked down the aisle to it. And somebody once sent me footage of a few hundred people on either side of a tube track singing it to each other. That is kind of magic.Craig Potter, keyboard player and producerSeldom Seen Kid was the first album I produced and mixed for Elbow. There were a lot of the influences that we always came back to – bands such as Beastie Boys, but particularly around that time Rufus Wainwright’s album Want One, specifically a track calledBeautiful Child. It is probably the shortest song we’ve written. We often spend months on them, and sometimes revisit them years later, but we turned around One Day Like This in a couple of weeks.Guy had the very basic, rising notes which I formed the chords from. Once the chords at the end were written, we realised that it had that this Hey Jude feel to it. There was no head-scratching to try and mould something that wasn’t quite right. It was pretty immediate from the beginning.People assume we had a big string section or even an orchestra. In fact, as we were short on time, it was actually just our three touring musicians from that period – Stella Page, Jote Osahn and Ian Burdge. We got them into the big room at Blueprint. I sat them up on three chairs with stereo mics and then for each different take moved the players around the room, either one over or one back, as if they were in different positions within an orchestra. With that, you get different resonances coming off the walls depending where they are sat. It’s a great way to blend strings when you’ve only got a few. It gives a much more classic sound.I also got them to bring in spare or older instruments of theirs to swap them around giving varying textures and asked them to play it perhaps not exactly as they normally would, imagining they are a different player for one take.At the end of the song, and this usually happens once on every album where there are some claps needed, we all just stood around one mic and started clapping. It’s then that we realise what we do for a job, and feel very lucky because it’s fun.Elbow’s new EP, Audio Vertigo Echo, is out on 6 June.Their UK tourbegins in Cardiff on 13 June.Explore more on these topicsElbowHow we madePop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We go behind the scenes at Bottoms, a thrilling new show about the cancanLyndsey WinshipMon 12 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 12 May 2025 06.19 EDTShare‘Our chorus line was never going to look like the Moulin Rouge’s,” says Katherina Radeva. And everyone knows whatthatone looks like, don’t they? The high-kicking cancan chorus line with long legs flying up in a blur as women show off their bloomers to the sound of Offenbach’s irresistibly infectious music – a riot of frills, thrills, whoops and garters. Well, that’s certainly one version. But Radeva is talking about Bottoms, a show she has put together with co-director Alister Lownie and their company Two Destination Language. Bottoms takes the cancan as its muse, its creators having discovered that the real story of the dance phenomenon is much more interesting than the tourist-friendly cliche.It turns out that the identikit all-female spectacle that we know so well is the opposite of how the cancan first began in the working-class dancehalls of Paris, where it was a social dance full of spontaneous improvisation – and performed primarily by men. It was only much later that it became a theatrical spectacle for the well-to-do. “What we really latched on to, which we relate to deeply, is this,” says Radeva. “Working-class makeup shit-hot dance. People go, ‘Oh, I really love that. I’ll have it.’ Then they commercialise it and almost take it all away.’”Cancan dancers were the influencers of their day – like the KardashiansBottoms, which opens this week at Tramway in Glasgow, is a theatre show with dancing, courtesy of Radeva and a cast of four fellow performers drawn from dance, theatre and cabaret. What Radeva and Lownie wanted to address was “value, labour and art”: how artists and creativity are valued, and exploited, in a capitalist system. The fascinating history of the cancan provided a rich backdrop for such an exploration, as well as the opportunity to conjure up the wild spirit of the dance’s early performers.View image in fullscreenWild spirit … BottomsThe cancan came from the quadrille, a social dance with set steps performed by four couples, but there would beun galopat the end, with people galloping down the room and starting to improvise, showing off and getting more and more boisterous. The cancan’s predecessor waslechahut, meaning commotion or uproar, a very working-class dance with untramelled energy and a melting pot of influences from French and Spanish colonies: fandango, chica, cachucha. As for the name, there are competing theories: one, that it’s fromcanard, meaning duck, perhaps because practitioners did a waddling movement; another, that it’s fromles cancans, meaning gossip or tittle-tattle.The dance was a form of “expressive resistance” says Clare Parfitt, who is working on a book about the cancan and popular dance across the Atlantic world. This was Paris in the 1820s, when it was under the Bourbon monarchy, “a repressive environment for working-class people, who so often held the flame of revolution, so they had to do a lot of things in secret”.There were policemen around every corner, she says, ready to make arrests for indecency – although there was no definition of what indecency meant. It wasn’t necessarily sexual, just anything that strayed from the norm. As Parfitt puts it: “The white male bourgeois model of the self.” Consequently, the reason we know that the early cancan dancers were men is because of their arrest records. Women start turning up there in the 1840s, says Parfitt.View image in fullscreenRevolutionary … an 1867 illustration showing a Parisian ball.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesWe do have some idea of what the early cancan looked like, though, from bohemian writers and cartoons of the day. There were kicks, yes, but nothing like the ankle-to-ear feats that show up later. The aim was to be the opposite of “upright” and proper, with couples holding their bodies scandalously close to each other, leaning on a diagonal, slouching, or dragging their feet along the floor. Elsewhere, there are reports of “windmilling arms” and the influence of acrobatic dancer Charles-François Mazurier, who could leap up into the air and land in the splits.The cancan, says Parfitt, walked a tightrope between outlandish improvisation and what was legally acceptable. Soon it became well established in the dancing gardens of mid-19th century Paris, from the Grande Chaumière in Montparnasse to the Bal Mabille near the Champs-Élysées. This was still not as a stage show, though. It was still social dancing, with certain featured participants taking to the floor. Women started to become the face of the dance, often working-class women trying to find a way out of poverty. “They use the whole ball culture to hustle,” says Parfitt. “They’re always trying to get lunch bought for them, or dinner, or a few pennies here and there. A sort of courtesan culture emerges and the cancan is involved because those dance forms become their way of marketing, of putting their bodies on display.”Writer David Price details many of these formidable women in 1998’s Cancan! Céleste Mogador (real name Élisabeth-Céleste Vénard) was an early star for whom dance was a way out of sex work. Élise Sergent (AKA La Reine Pomaré – stage names and personas were common) was a woman with a graceful body and a potty mouth, who died of consumption at 22.View image in fullscreen‘The Glutton’ … Louise Weber would down spectators’ drink while dancing.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesThen there was Rigolboche, who danced at Casino Cadet and was described by one writer as “a whirling mass of limbs and lingerie”. Rigolboche claimed to be attacked by a form of madness when she danced. “She was just completely taken over by the vibes,” laughs Radeva. “Intoxicated! And that’s great, that’s what I think dance should do.” Finally, there was Finette (AKA La Bordelaise, AKA Josephine Durwend), a former ballet dancer whose party piece was a kick so high she could knock off a gentleman’s hat. She was one of the first to dance the cancan on a London stage in the 1860s.“They were the influencers of their day, like the Kardashians,” says Lownie. “They were very charismatic,” adds Radeva. “People became infatuated with them, like Toulouse-Lautrec.” One of Toulouse-Lautrec’s favourite people to paint was the dancer Louise Weber, nicknamed La Goulue or The Glutton, since she liked to down spectators’ drinks when she was dancing.La Goulue danced at the Moulin Rouge, marking cancan’s move towards the establishment in the later 19th century. Parfitt talks of an increasing nationalism at that time. “Countries are attempting to differentiate themselves” she says, “and show what modern nations they are. One way is through dance. There was a push inFranceto have a national dance form – and the cancan moves from being this really peripheral form that’s repressed into the absolute centre of French national identity.”When the cancan was performed on stage at the beginning of the 20th century, it started to shift in style and feature a line of dancers addressing the audience. Critics in the 1920s talked about such mass movement echoing mass production, the individual subsumed into the machine. “The complete opposite of what it was before,” says Parfitt. “In the 19th century, it was all about the individual – they all had their signature moves and special nicknames. Now it was all about unison.”The cancan is full of contradictions. It was a dance of freedom, even anarchy. Then it came to fuel both the empowerment of women and the fetishisation of them, before becoming an exacting, athletic feat performed by professionals. It continues to be an instantly recognisable symbol of Paris, but has also spread to some unlikely corners of the world. “There is this amazing community of cancan dancers in the Yukon in Canada,” says Parfitt.View image in fullscreenScandalous … the Bal Tabarin in Montmartre c1900.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveA2023 BBC documentary revealed life backstage at the still-kicking Moulin Rouge, a place of hard graft and megawatt smiles, where donning the showgirl’s jewels and feathers is the pinnacle of many young dancers’ careers. The real star of the show, though, was Janet Pharoah, artistic director and a no-nonsense Yorkshirewoman who sadly died earlier this year.Lownie feels conflicted about how the cancan has ended up. “There is something joyous in seeing skilled people doing something to the highest quality,” he says. “It’s enthralling in its way. But it’s also a highly sexualised setup that’s made for the champagne dinner that goes with it.”Radeva adds: “We’re not criticising that – but we are pulling at the edges.” Radeva – whosesolo piece 40/40brimmed with the joy of the amateur performer lost in the music – is not so interested in mechanical steps or matching angles. She’s more in tune with those early dancers ofle chahut. “The workers left work and went to the pub to throw some shapes,” she says. And the politics was baked into how they danced. “Hopefully some of the joy of Bottoms will be in reclaiming a bit of that, with our different bodies, our different abilities.”How does she feel about the show’s chorus line? “We’re really happy with it!” she says. “We make a motley crew. And I think that’s glorious to watch.”Bottoms is at Tramway, Glasgow, 14-15 May, part of Dance International GlasgowExplore more on these topicsDanceFranceEuropeHistoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not his films’ conflicted politics, their interludes of witless brawling, or those sequences of drunk comedy we can tactfully classify as “broad”.Because the passages of pure poetry that litter his movies, lit by his staggering instinct for visual composition, and underpinned by a choking emotion, leave his rivals trailing in the desert dust. Simply put: if you can’t take him at his interminable Victor McLaglen punch-ups, you don’t deserve him at his heartrending graveside soliloquies.‘Pure sugar-rush mayhem’: why I Wanna Hold Your Hand is my feelgood movieRead moreThis is, I can’t help but notice, the first mention of heartrending graveside soliloquies in the“My feelgood movie”slot, and it’s true that Ford’s films – while allowing us to scale the peaks of emotion – don’t always fit snugly into that upbeat bracket.Wagon Master does.And that’s the way it was supposed to be: for the audience, the writers and the man himself.“I am a director of westerns,” Ford liked to say, and though it was a pose of sorts, it contained an essential truth. During difficult times, he would retreat to his cherished genre. In November 1949, after an especially stressful period, he took a no-name cast to Moab, Utah, to make a cheap movie about a Mormon wagon train. Throughout the 31 days of filming, the notoriously cranky director remained alarmingly amiable. “I thought maybe he was ill or something,” said one of its stars, Harry Carey Jr.But no: merely contented. “How he loved making it,” recalled Ford’s son, Patrick, who co-wrote the script. “Wagon Master was pure of heart and simple and good, and Frank Nugent and I were pure of heart and simple and good when we wrote it.”Their story focuses on two young horse traders, Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Carey), who guide a group of God-fearing folk and some dissolute show people – the two sides of the director’s personality – to the “promised land”.Wagon Master’s great appeal lies in thefeelof the thing. “Be gentle,” Travis encourages a restless horse, and that spirit pervades the film. It is Ford’s gentlest picture and arguably his most beautiful, both on the surface and beneath it. The film is a plea for tolerance – most of its characters having just been run out of town – that is augmented by a thousand perfect details in word and image: the dialogue spare and true, Ford’s camera going to a square dance and focusing first on the wooden planks shifting in the dirt.He referred to the small moments in his work that capture character or evoke emotion as “grace notes”, but this is the only time he assembled almost an entire picture from them. It’s the way Travis braids and burns a rope as he talks. It’s Alan Mowbray’s soused snake-oil salesman putting on his top hat to receive visitors. It’s characters expressing mutual fondness through the medium of name-calling. “Thatrube,” says hoochie coochie dancer Denver (Joanne Dru), staring after Travis, her eyes sparkling. It is, too, the smoke of the campfires, the babble of children, shafts of light passing through the slats of wagon wheels, and a colt trotting up a riverbank in a world where water means life.‘Like sinking into a warm bath’: why Jaws is my feelgood movieRead more“Just play it relaxed,” Ford said to his stars before their opening scene, and the laidback atmosphere is perfectly mirrored in Johnson’s performance as the laconic, ineffably cool title character. In the film’s finest sequence, which sees him go “a-courtin’”, Wagon Master’s virtues hang in perfect balance, while spotlighting the most beguiling sight in all of cinema: Johnson on a horse. He canters towards two distant, inky figures silhouetted against the desert haze and dwarfed by the filigreed fingers of the rock formations. Travis wants Denver to come live on his ranch; she thought her past had shut her off from that forever. It’ll never work, she decides; “Goodbye, fella,” she says, before sprawling dreamily in her departing wagon, her circumstances the same but her life forever changed.While Ford conjures a world I love to visit, in its rhythms and its rituals, the film’s brand of escapism consists of more than that. It doesn’t just transport us somewhere special, it arms us to deal with what we are fleeing. Rupturing and then repairing an idyll, it argues that right is might but knows a better world must be fought for. It casts a unique spell, yet reminds us that community – and not escape – is the antidote to loneliness.The film meant just as much to its maker. “Uncle Jack always said Wagon Master was his favourite picture,” wrote Carey Jr in his memoir. “I think The Searchers was his best film, but Wagon Master was the most joyful … One month of total unity and happiness – that was Wagon Master.”It shows.Wagon Master is on Tubi in the US and on BBC iPlayer in the UKExplore more on these topicsJohn FordMy feelgood movieWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She describes “a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking” after being lured into an “ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle” allegedly designed to keep her compliant – including engaging in sex acts with others against her will. The lawsuit also alleges that Combs destroyed the car of another successful US rapper, Kid Cudi – real name Scott Mescudi – to deter him from seeing Ventura. Combs denies the allegations.The severity of Ventura’s allegations are the most serious Combs faces. He was charged with assault in 1998 and sentenced to an anger management class; in 1999, he was acquitted of gun charges following a nightclub shooting. In 2019, an ex-girlfriend, Gina Huynh, spoke to a blogger alleging emotional and physical abuse during her relationship with Combs, but no legal case was filed.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeHip-hopRape and sexual assaultWomentimelinesShareReuse this content"

Over the past 30 years, he has become almost as famous as the game itself. The escapades surrounding his deal to buy its distribution rights from Russian agency Elektronorgtechnica (Elorg) were dramatised inan Apple TV+ filmstarring Taron Egerton. “I suggested that Johnny Depp or Keanu Reeves should play me, but apparently they were way too old,” Rogers says.Tetris review – rise of 80s game makes for mostly entertaining dramaRead moreThe casting wasn’t his only concern when he read the screenplay. “It was terrifying. I didn’t know anything about how a script becomes a movie. I thought: ‘This is a crap movie … a car chase?! There is so much bullshit in there!’”View image in fullscreenTrance-inducing … Tetris on the Nintendo Game Boy.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianStill, it can’t have been more terrifying than the KGB interrogation awaiting Rogers when he made that fateful trip to Russia in 1988. Tetris may now be one of the most successful video games in history, with more than 520m sales, yet it was conceived by Alexey Pajitnov while he was working on artificial intelligence and automatic speech recognition at the state-owned computing centre of the Academy of Sciences in the Soviet Union – and he certainly wasn’t supposed to be coding puzzle games. Those trance-inducing tetrominos were almost sealed away behind the iron curtain, the exclusive property of the Soviet regime.Alexey had never met a game designer before … there were no game designers in the Soviet UnionThankfully, however, a complex series of shaky international rights deals involving several companies, including Robert Maxwell’s Mirrorsoft, finally culminated in the Japan-dwelling Dutchman Rogers snapping up the Japanese computer rights, and then hopping on a plane to Russia hoping to secure a similar deal for handhelds. After he arrived in Moscow on a tourist visa, the KGB watched Rogers’ every move. Sneakily – and very much illegally – he managed to gain entry into Elorg, the state-owned company with a monopoly on all Soviet-made computer software. As he came face to face with the reclusive coder behind this mesmerising game, Rogers swiftly discovered he’d been duped. The Tetris rights Rogers “owned” had been sold without Russian knowledge – and the Soviets weren’t too pleased.“I was in a room with seven people, some of them KGB types, being given the third degree for a couple of hours, like: ‘Who the hell are you coming into the Soviet Union?!’” says Rogers. It was there that he first met Pajitnov. “Alexey was suspicious of me at first, because he’d met other people who had come sniffing for Tetris’s rights. He always felt that they were just slimy capitalists looking to make a dollar.” The film’s retelling of this encounter feels surprisingly faithful, with the tense interrogation scene and resulting paranoia of KGB surveillance matching Rogers’ own descriptions.“When he figured out I was a game designer, Alexey’s demeanour changed completely,” recalls Rogers. “Alexey had never met a game designer before … Therewereno game designers in the Soviet Union, because there was no game business in the Soviet Union. You had your job, and games would be something that you did on the side.”View image in fullscreenPajitnov in 1989.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex FeaturesIntrigued to meet a fellow nerd, Alexey quietly asked Rogers to find him after the meeting. With the KGB watching their every move, and millions of dollars on the line, Rogers was aware of the danger that they both faced. “As a foreigner, I had to be careful. So I waited downstairs by the door and escorted him to my room in the middle of the night, quietly showing him my version of Tetris.”Rogers and Pajitnov have been friends ever since, and once the Soviet Union was dissolved and Elorg’s stake sold, they formed the Tetris Company together in 1996. Up to that point, Pajitnov had made no money from the game at all.Despite the 2023 film taking some factual liberties (“I cried about things in the movie that never happened, I cried about my daughter singing after I missed her recital – they made that shit up!”), Rogers says that he got a kick out of seeing his story on the big screen. “It premiered at South by Southwest and the audience can be very critical. But they were cheering when I first saw the Game Boy. They were cheering for a device! At the end, we all got to come on stage: Alexey, myself, and Taron. We got the biggest standing ovation from the audience. It felt like I won an Oscar.”However, compelled to share a more grounded retelling of his story, Rogers has just released a book:The Perfect Game: Tetris, from Russia With Love. It’s a fun, if slightly arrogant look at the events that brought the puzzle sensation to the world, littered with endearing, memory-correcting interjections from Pajitnov.View image in fullscreenPajitnov, Rogers and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi at Nintendo HQ in Kyoto, Japan.Photograph: Nintendo Company LimitedWhile the film highlights Rogers’ undeniable charm and business acumen, it buries his contributions as a game developer. While living in Japan in 1983 he founded Bullet-Proof Software and created the influential role-playing game The Black Onyx, which gave the genre the iconic health bar and also introduced RPGs to a Japanese audience. The game’s manual was written by Hisashi Suzuki who would go on to become president of Squaresoft, creator of the Final Fantasy series. The Black Onyx was apparently also a huge influence on legendaryNintendodesigner Shigeru Miyamoto: “Miyamoto credited Black Onyx – thereby crediting me – for teaching him about role playing games,” says Rogers. “He said it was what led to him creating Zelda.”Is it strange though, that Rogers’ story has overshadowed that of Tetris’s creator, Pajitnov? “Alexey and I play very different roles,” replies Rogers. “The role that I’m playing right now, telling the story, he would never play that role. He’s more of an introvert. If you give him a chance, he’ll sit in a room and do mathematical proofs. In terms of connecting Tetris to the world, the world would have to search him out and he would come kicking and screaming.”View image in fullscreen‘We blue-skyed it in the desert’ … Tetris Effect (2019).Photograph: Enhance GamesNew versions of Tetris are released every few years, a recent highlight being 2019’s psychedelic Tetris Effect, which saw the creator of the Dreamcast classic Rez, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, reimagine the game as a transcendental audiovisual experience complete with VR version – a concept dreamed up during a hedonistic weekend at Burning Man. “Gucci – we call him Gucci – is a good friend,” says Rogers. “We went toBurning Mantogether, where we blue-skyed in the desert about what Tetris Effect would be – a Tetris in VR – and he built that product.”While Rogers still enjoys games (“Minecraft really did something outside the box.”), his priorities changed after a near fatal heart attack in 2005. “I’m done with game publishing,” he says. “I know how much work it is and how much money it takes and my heart has to be in it. And now, my heart is in fighting climate change.”Rogers now lives in Hawaii, and over the last 20 years his Blue Planet Foundation has successfully lobbied the island nation to commit to clean energy by 2030. He is slowly convincing neighbouring islands to stop purchasing foreign oil and to invest in sustainable alternatives. If anyone can save the planet, it’s the man who outsmarted the Maxwells, escaped the KGB, and got us all dreaming of little blocks endlessly falling into place.The Perfect Game by Henk Rogers is published by Di AngeloExplore more on these topicsTetrisGamesRetro gamesNintendoPuzzle gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It holds the continent’s largest collection of contemporary art.She was previously the founding artistic director of Raw Material Company, an art centre in Dakar, Senegal, which had a big impact on her. “It’s the place I came of age professionally, where I really became a curator and an exhibition-maker,” she recentlytold the Financial Times. “Dakar made me who I am today.”As curator of the Biennale she was due to present the exhibition’s title and theme in Venice in a week’s time, on 20 May.In a statement, the management of the Venice Biennale said they were “deeply saddened and dismayed to learn of the sudden and untimely passing of Koyo Kouoh”.They said Kouoh had “worked with passion, intellectual rigour and vision on the conception and development of the Biennale Arte 2026”.The statement added: “Her passing leaves an immense void in the world of contemporary art and in the international community of artists, curators and scholars who had the privilege of knowing and admiring her extraordinary human and intellectual commitment.”The Biennale confirmed it was “likely to hold the press conference on 20 May”, which would also be livestreamed from its headquarters.Zeitz MOCAA said it had closed its doors and suspended all programming until further notice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among those in line were journalists, content creators,New Yorkresidents and fans of the music mogul.Before opening statements began, the jury of 12 New York residents was selected and seated. In the courtroom, members of Combs’s family, including his mother, Janice Combs, and children, sat in the front row.Prosecutor Emily A Johnson accused Combs in her opening statement of threatening, drugging and violently coercing women into sex. She said that Combs had an inner coterie who helped him cover up the alleged crimes, and that company resources were used to fulfill his sexual desires.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead more“He sometimes called himself the king, and he expected to be treated like one,” she said.Combs, the prosecution alleged, along with his inner circle, “committed crime after crime” over 20 years.The prosecution’s case, per Johnson’s opening statement, will include accounts by three women, Combs’s former girlfriend Casandra Ventura (known as Cassie), and two Jane Does. One of the unnamed women is a former employee who is slated to testify that Combs forced himself on her sexually on multiple occasions.At the center of the prosecution’s case is an assault that took place with Combs and Ventura in aLos Angeleshotel in 2016. Surveillance footage of that incident rocked headlines when it broke last year, despite – as Johnson noted – an attempt by Combs and his chief of staff to “broker a deal” with the hotel.Combs’s lawyer, Teny Geragos, began her opening statement by saying that Combs “is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case”. Geragos said that prosecutors were attempting to dub consensual sexual relationships as sex trafficking, and said that Combs and his girlfriends engaged in a “swingers lifestyle”.“It will not work,” she said, later adding: “This case is about Sean Combs’s private, personal sex life, which has nothing to do with his lawful businesses.”Geragos said the women in Diddy’s life “were strong, capable, and they were were in love with him” and that “the evidence is going to show you a very flawed individual, but it will not show you a racketeer, a sex trafficker or somebody transporting for prostitution”.Geragos added that the women had “freedom to make the choices they made” adding that they made “free choices every single day for years”.View image in fullscreenMembers of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’s family arrive at federal court in New York City on Monday.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesOf the aforementioned video with Ventura, Geragos conceded that while it was “overwhelming evidence of domestic violence”, “it’s overwhelming evidence that this domestic violence is over a phone, and not over sex trafficking.”The first witness called after opening statements was Israel Florez, a Los Angeles police officer who was a security guard at the InterContinental hotel in March 2016 when Combs was seen on video physically assaulting Ventura.Florez testified that he was called about a “woman in distress on the sixth floor” and later found Ventura wearing a hoodie in a corner while Combs was seated with “a devilish stare”.Florez then said he escorted Combs and Ventura back to their room, and testified that he witnessed Combs allegedly telling Ventura that she couldn’t leave the hotel, but then shortly after, telling her to leave.After Ventura left the room,Combs allegedly offered Florez money. “He was telling me: ‘Don’t tell nobody,’” Florez said, adding that he “100%” thought Combs was bribing him.The jury was shown the hotel surveillance footage that was published by CNN last year of Combs wearing a towel, hitting, kicking and dragging Ventura down a hallway. They were then shown images of the aftermath of assault, which included broken items and dirt on the walls. Additional video footage of the assault was also shown, which was surveillance footage recorded on Florez’s personal phone.Florez testified that he did not call the police because Ventura had not answered his questions when he spoke with her and kept saying she wanted to leave, before leaving the hotel with a driver.During cross-examination, Brian Steel, one of Combs’s lawyers, questioned Florez on why his initial incident report did not mention that he had heard Combs tell Ventura she couldn’t leave. Florez told the court that he didn’t believe it was a “significant fact” worth including at the time.Following Florez, the prosecution’s second witness called on Monday was Daniel Phillip, a former manager of a “male revue show”, which he has called a strip show for women.Phillip testified that in 2012, he was paid by Ventura to have sex with her in front of Combs, which he says was “something special” for her then partner. After that event, Phillip said he would return to have sex with Ventura several more times over the next year or two in various hotels in New York, as well as in Combs’s and Ventura’s homes in the city.Of the first encounter, Phillip testified that Ventura paid him a few thousand dollars before having sex with her in front of Combs, who wore a white robe, a baseball cap, and a bandana over his face, while he masturbated. Combs, in an attempt to conceal his identity, told Phillip he was in the importing and exporting business, though Phillip testified that he recognized the voice as Combs’s.Phillip testified that Combs asked for his driver’s license and took a picture of it, telling him at the time that it was “just for insurance”.“I understood it to be that he was threatening me,” Phillip told the court.Phillip said that during the sexual encounters, Combs would “direct” him and Ventura, telling them to act out certain scenarios and what sex acts to perform.Phillip recalled a few incidents when he said he witnessedCombs either throw something at or hit Ventura. He said he was “shocked” and “terrified” and said that he did not intervene out of fear, as this was “someone with unlimited power and chances are even if I did go to the police, that I might still end up losing my life”.On another incident when Ventura was struck by Combs, Phillip testified that he “tried to explain to her that she was in real danger if she stayed with him”.As testimony got increasingly explicit, Combs’s three daughters in attendance left the courtroom. His sons stayed seated and were seen passing notes periodically.The trial began in earnest after attorneys on both sides removed several jurors on Monday morning, with Combs’s lawyer Marc Agnifilo noting that prosecutors eliminated seven Black potential jurors. The prosecution said it did not demonstrate any bias during jury selection and selected a “very diverse group of jurors”. The judge denied Combs’s lawyer’s challenge and then proceeded with opening statements.Federal prosecutors allege that Combs used his expansive multimedia empire as a “criminal enterprise” with the help of associates and employees, to engage in or attempt to engage in crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution, and obstruction of justice, over several decades.Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges and firmly denies any wrongdoing. Earlier this month, herejected a plea deal during his final pre-trialhearing.If convicted, Combs, who has been in custody since his September arrest, faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life behind bars.The trial is expected to last about eight weeks, with testimony from at least three, possibly four, accusers, according toReuters.On Monday, court adjourned at 5pm ET. The trial is set to resume on Tuesday morning, with Phillip expected to re-take the stand again to continue his cross examination.The proceedings are taking place at the federal district court in lower Manhattan. Due to federal court regulations, the trial will not be televised.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Dublin was the host city in 1994, 1995 and 1997 – a 1990s Irish run that began with the town of Millstreet in County Cork staging it in 1993. Ireland and Sweden have both won and hosted the contest seven times.Anna Wittgren, Malmö city’s head of marketing, said policing costs were not a factor in its decision because that bill was not picked up by the city. Rather, she said, it was too big an event to host every two years.“We did very well last year and now we’re passing the baton on if it becomes necessary,” she said. “The Eurovision song contest is exceptional in that you only have 10 months to organise and put on a global event and we need to have it a little less frequently than every two years.”The city was “enormously proud” of last year’s event, she said, in which “we showed that in the spirit of democracy we could house both protests and a world-class event in safe and secure ways for all participants”.Gothenburg, Sweden’s second-largest city, and Örnsköldsvik have been tipped as potential hosts in the event that KAJ should win.As well as promoting the merits of sauna culture, Sweden’s entry also puts the spotlight on Finland’s 290,000 Swedish-speaking population and the Vörå dialect spoken in the bilingual Finnish municipality where KAJ are from.Use of the Swedish language in Finland dates to at least the 12th century and remains an official language of Finland.Finland was part of the Swedish kingdom between 1323 and 1809, when it was captured by Russia and became part of the Russian empire until Finland declared independence in 1917.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionSwedenEuropeFinlandEurovision 2025newsShareReuse this content"

Graffitied in the shadows of the steelworks, “Season’s Greetings” appeared to festively depict a child with their tongue outstretched, catching snowflakes. Seen from a different perspective it was revealed to be falling ash.Written by Tracy Harris and Paul Jenkins (who also directs) and edited from more than 150 hours of interviews with those whose lives were affected by Banksy’s intervention, Port Talbot Gotta Banksy is a verbatim account of what happened next: the welcome and unwelcome attention, political inertia compounded by austerity, and how working-class communities are always subject to the whims of global market forces, be those of steel or the art world.Designed by Cai Dyfan and with a strikingly effective lighting design by Cara Hood, it is sensitively staged and performed by a superb ensemble of six, with Jalisa Phoenix-Roberts particularly affecting. As the text is delivered while the performers listen to the original interviews through earpieces – put on at the performance’s beginning, touchingly removed towards the end – the technique’s precision speaks to the care with which the production regards its interviewees. Throughout, this feels like an important theatrical corrective, giving voice to those who are so often sidelined.But what the verbatim text gains in authenticity also exposes the constraints of the form. Narrative momentum is mostly driven by prerecorded journalistic reports, and episodic scenes of descriptive direct address often hint at potentially richer dramatic currents; the subtext in a pregnant pause, the wife and mother with a vodka bottle in her dressing gown who has buried a husband and son, the barely suppressed urgency with which an unemployed steelworker offers his phone number.One feels that there are other compelling stories here that deserve to be told, without needing to be refracted through a single artwork. But in its most stirring moments, this is a heartfelt celebration of a community’s resilience and agency, attested to in a triumphant closing montage of the street art that has sprouted in Port Talbot in the intervening years.At The Plaza, Port Talbot 15-17 May; then touring Milford Haven, Swansea and WrexhamExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreBanksyWalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

In this no-frills concert staging, mezzo-sopranosBeth Taylor(Cornelia) andPaula Murrihy(Sesto, a trouser role) faced each other, barely projecting, their vocal lines – locked in sighing parallel thirds – ringing absolutely true.It was one of the powerfully intense moments in a performance that ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous. Also sublime: countertenorChristophe Dumaux’s lucid, liquid ornamentation as Caesar admits he has fallen for “Lydia” (Cleopatra in disguise), entering competitive musical dialogue with a solo violin and shrugging at a flurry of musical leaps he was never going to imitate. Or his extraordinary control of a single unaccompanied sustained note at the start of his heartfelt aria in the final act, shaping an achingly slow crescendo and decrescendo in a way that was little short of bewitching. OrJohn Holiday’s compelling turn as Cleopatra’s brother Ptolemy, his countertenor flexible, his ornamentation nimble. Or theEnglish Concertunder artistic directorHarry Bicket– always energetic, always neat, never flamboyant – whose string tone was warm or frozen as the emotional temperature demanded, the horns burnished, the occasional woodwind solos elegantly shaped.View image in fullscreenChristophe Dumaux with Morgan Pearse (Achilles) plus Waitrose bag and all-important bloodied head.Photograph: Mark AllanAt the opposite end of the spectrum was the appearance of Achilles (baritoneMorgan Pearse) carrying a Waitrose bag, from which he produced the plot’s all-important bloodied head to delighted giggles from the auditorium. Later – now mortally wounded – he arranged himself onstage with a grin at the audience. Meanwhile, after Ptolemy’s death, Holiday picked himself up, dusted himself down and hoiked his trousers before walking off. And in the absence of “staging” beyond that plastic bag, an urn and a plastic knife, there was a lot of dramatic walking: striding and shuffling, a few tentative steps and the occasional full-pelt dash.Some of this seemed mannered and self-conscious alongside an unequivocally world-class musical performance. The constant movement on and off stage also gradually began to pall. But one standout turn negotiated the rapid switches between carry-on comedy and searing tragedy with ease.Louise Alder’s Cleopatra treated the stage like a fashion runway, her first aria a heady cocktail of charisma and confidence, crooning and ferocious coloratura. Yet it was her later sincerity that hit home above all: lines sustained with tenderness and poise, her ornamentation exquisitely graceful – all utterly compelling.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

For British audiences, The Marching Band might call to mind Brassed Off, The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, movies from the heartland which dared to dream that showbusiness or cultural community adventures can somehow survive the wreckage of industrial capitalism.Benjamin Lavernhe plays Thibaut, a distinguished and sensitive orchestra conductor who collapses mid-rehearsal in Paris and is told he has leukaemia and needs a bone marrow transplant donor. Thibaut is adopted and this means tracking down his biological brother out in the boondocks: factory worker Jimmy, played by the formidable Pierre Lottin (recently seen inFrançois Ozon’s When Autumn Falls), whose gift for deadpan comedy really only gets free rein at the very beginning of the film.Thibaut has the tricky task of asking someone who is a total stranger if he wouldn’t mind donating his bone marrow. But this fraught situation reveals – a little programmatically, perhaps – that Jimmy has a real musical talent, like him, plays trombone in the raucous factory band and nurses a passion for jazz on vinyl. Thibault sees in Jimmy a vision of what his own life could have been without his adoptive mother’s comfortable middle-class background, and sees Jimmy and himself through the lens of class, politics and society, and not the supposed destiny of pure talent.But then Jimmy’s band needs a conductor … well, there are no prizes for guessing what happens next. Director and co-writer Courcol has to manage the plot so that the question of Thibaut’s own emotional life and relationships is more or less forgotten, but the bromance chemistry works well enough and the final concert encore is touching.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His attention, though, is on a bank of equipment, from which he’s attempting to pull sounds that match the interstellar scope of the visuals spread across the gargantuan screen that hangs over him. Across the course of almost threehours, he does so with remarkable regularity.View image in fullscreenCosmic … Steven Wilson at the Bristol Beacon.Photograph: Hajo MüllerAppearing initially in profile, all in black and ensconced in a keyboard array that makes it look like he’s fallen to Earth in a pod, Wilson’s opening move during his first solo tour in seven years is to play his recent concept record, The Overview, in full. Its two vast songs (one 23 minutes, the other 18) are musings on our cosmic insignificance greeted with rapt attention by an audience relishing his return to prog after a run of works that tested his mettle in art-rock and bubbling electronica.Part one, Objects Outlive Us, encompasses mundane stills from English life, pristine melodies and Baroness-worthy sludge as Wilson trades snarling leads with guitarist Randy McStine, who also does a neat line in elegiac solos and metallic experiments. The ensuing title track voyages through flickering synthetic beats and Floydian grandeur as the imagery becomes increasingly transportive. “Better than drugs,” Wilson says at its conclusion, amid a standing ovation.The rest of the evening more obviously resembles a rock show, but Wilson neatly uses musical and thematic threads to tie things in with The Overview. The Harmony Codex, its voiceover describing thousands of cities and trillions of stars, is like ambient cartilage between sets, while King Ghost’s delightful falsetto hook calls back to the early moments of Objects Outlive Us. Opening the encore, Pariah dissolves into time-bending post-rock bliss.If there’s one issue it’s that the all-seater room naturally prevents there being much of a physical exchange of energy between band and crowd. It’s something Wilson notes, not unkindly, at one point and in reality it does render Harmony Korine’s squalling octaves and Vermillioncore’s thunderous riffs somewhat inert. Fittingly, in the cosmic scheme of things tonight, it barely registers as a complaint.Touring until 25 NovemberExplore more on these topicsMusiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

(This film comes after another odd docudrama about Gray, Mary McGuckian’sThe Price of Desire, from 2015.)In the late 1920s, Gray designed and built amodernist villa on the Côte d’Azurfor herself and her lover, the Romanian architectural journalist Jean Badovici (played here by Axel Moustache): she called it E.1027 (the “E” standing for Eileen, 10 meaning the 10th letter, J, for Jean, the second, B, for Badovici and the seventh, G, for Gray.) But she quarrelled with him and impulsively moved out, leaving him in sole possession of this marvellous property – and then Badovici’s friend Le Corbusier, nettled by this brilliant work which was inspired by but possibly surpassed his own, painted frescoes all over the white walls. He then allowed the architectural world to assume E.1027 was his own work and the feebly submissive Badovici simply allowed him to do it.So this is a story of explosive emotion, creativity and betrayal, but you wouldn’t think so from this film’s somnambulist tread; it declines fully to inhabit any of its scenes, almost as if it is showing the actors in rehearsal, sauntering self-consciously through the action. Eileen and Jean get into a car, for example, by sitting down on two chairs side-by-side on a soundstage. The drama side of things is seemingly muted by the documentary side.View image in fullscreenCharles Morillon as Le Corbusier in E.1027 – Eileen Gray and the House by the Sea.Photograph: Rise And Shine World SalesThe film, moreover, doesn’t show the blood, sweat and tears that must have surely been involved in the colossal task of building E.1027 in such a remote spot.

Juliette has three layers of tinfoil wrapped around her limbs and a tinfoil cone hat plonked on her head before she clocks that she’s fallen for a prank. It’s a pleasing bit of sibling slapstick in Slags, the new novel from Emma Jane Unsworth about desire, dissatisfaction and the ferocious loyalty of sisters. And sisterhood, as Unsworth writes it here, is an unbreakable connection for which no prank antenna is needed.When Sarah takes Juliette on a Highland road trip for her birthday they find themselves revealing secrets and reckoning with their younger selves. Candid and comic, Slags is Thelma & Louise with a campervan and without a clifftop. There are shades of Fleabag, too, in the fractious sisters, the sexual escapades of one countered by the suburban righteousness of the other.The novel focuses on Sarah, with chapters alternating between her teenage self, obsessing over a teacher in a desperately pining first-person confessional, and the adult woman, who puzzles over the percolations of midlife desire (narrated by an older, omniscient authorial voice). The present-day Sarah is single, sardonic, bored with sobriety. She lives in London, where no one seems to party any more and “everyone was thinking about their gut health, or their crochet, or the state of the economy”.It's an undeniably fun read, the levity often lifted by an underlying sense of sympathy, affection and tendernessJuliette, by contrast, is married with children, and lives in Manchester. Her husband, Johnnie, is into ice plunges andAndrew Hubermanpodcasts. Unsworth is especially merciless in her portrait of a particular kind of modern masculinity, captured here in all its absurdity. “Longevity seemed pointless,” Sarah reflects, “when you were as tedious as Johnnie.” Johnnie doesn’t have much of a role in the novel, but it’s often through the minor characters, those merely glanced at in the rear-view mirror, that Unsworth demonstrates the sharpness of her perceptions.Deanna, Sarah and Juliette’s mother, for instance, only periodically swings into view. She is a fleeting memory of neglect – abandoning her young daughters on a broken-down train, stumbling into a party humiliatingly drunk – but Unsworth allows her to cast a long shadow. Later, Sarah reflects more forgivingly on her mother’s abortive efforts to escape suburban life and “the stocks of domesticity”. Suburbia, in general, is efficiently demolished here, reduced to “bin wars, magnolia tree one-upmanship, brick drives, chest freezers, double garages, weedkiller, Chicken Tonight in Le Creuset, Laura Ashley in perpetuity.”Sarah wants none of it, but her job and her life in the city also leave her empty. Unsworth describes how “late at night, after video calls with the East Coast of America, she often stayed on as a host, alone, in those abandoned Zoom rooms, her own face staring back at her, the glow of the ring-light ashyggeas any wood-burning stove, sipping a glass of something moderately alcoholic, feeling a dystopian peace …” It’s not quite loneliness, more a beautiful desolation. “I don’t want to sort my life out,” she tells Juliette during a heated drunken argument. When Juliette protests “But you feel bad”, she replies: “Only sometimes …”One of Sarah’s distinguishing qualities is this lack of clarity about what it is that she desires. She belongs, as she explains, to gen X, that “lost generation”, too young to be old, too old to be millennial, sexually liberated and yet still searching for something. WhereUnsworth captured the erratic hedonism of twentysomethings in her 2014 novelAnimalsand the online dysfunctions of thirtysomethings in 2020’sAdults, here she plumbs the muddles of midlife. Sarah is a rare female character: she’s not a mother, but neither is she full of fraught questions about fertility or menopause. She is, instead, frank about “getting her rocks off” and the difficulty of how to do that without the aid of drink or drugs.How to contend with sexual desire is a question for the 15-year-old Sarah, too. She shrugs off unhappy sexual encounters, including an experience of indecent exposure, with a swaggering bravado. How that shapes the adult Sarah’s attitude to sex is not straightforward, and there’s an intelligence in Unsworth’s refusal to present clear cause and effect. Comedy, rather than tragedy, is the response she most often prefers. Perhaps this is symptomatic of the Fleabagification of women’s stories – where farce somehow feels more truthful than straight-up trauma. Is comedy a deflection or a pragmatic approach to getting on with things in a world of misunderstanding and confusion? Certainly, Slags culminates in a confrontation that is more chaotic than climactic. But this is an undeniably fun read, the levity often lifted by an underlying sense of sympathy, affection and tenderness. Unsworth is riotous, rewarding company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But that’s just the style of this carrot-topped trouper: resolutely cheerful and un-self-pitying, despite facing the end of his football career before it began, and aftershocks of the accident such as a lingering speech impediment.Director Martyn Robertson intercuts Walker’s progress throughScotland, England, the Netherlands and Germany with flashbacks to his recovery. His boon companion on both legs is orthopaedic surgeon Gordon Mackay, himself a former Rangers footballer, who rebuilt the youngster’s knee using pioneering ligament repair techniques.The film is possibly a little too low-incident for its own good – the Rhine bursting its banks over their route is the worst of it – but is testament to the stout spirit with which Walker leads the enterprise. Robertson, who previously directed the similarsporting-adversity story Ride the Wave (2022), borrows the quiet wisdom of his subject and lets it colour the story.Amid the punctures and pitstops there are discreet road-movie epiphanies: Walker accepting, when his surgeon levels with him, that he must now focus on coaching, not playing, and his wry smile as he finally acknowledges that his resilience is, after all, exceptional. With the boy’s parents checking in by phone as he rediscovers his autonomy, the quasi-paternal bond between Walker and Mackay is touching.The internal journey is as significant as the trans-European one, a feeling Robertson buffs with quick lyrical bursts, such as a drone shot over a poppy field, or a spaced-out Walker singing the Spider-Man theme tune to a spider dangling from a car-park ceiling. Even Scotland getting hammered 5-1 at the end can’t dampen the spirit of this unassuming and heartening pilgrimage.Make It to Munich is in UK cinemas from 15 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsScotland (UK news)Scotland (Football)reviewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s still a lot of familiarity in his ancient Roman sequel – from returning characters to elaborate fight scenes and animal antics. Paul Mescal stars as Lucius, the son of Russell Crowe’s Maximus, who is living a quiet life in north Africa until an invading Roman army takes him into slavery. From there, it’s a short hop to becoming a gladiator and reviving his father’s rebel stance, while his owner, Macrinus (a lip-smacking Denzel Washington), plots to overthrow the unstable twin emperors. Mescal is more of a brooder than Crowe, which lends the film an elegaic, end-of-an-era feel.Simon WardellLive sportChampionship Football: Sheffield United v Bristol City, 7.30pm, Sky Sports Main EventPlay-off semi-final second leg; Sunderland v Coventry is on Tuesday at 7.30pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When conditions are right, snorkelling in British waters brings a connection with a variety of species and stunning terrain: sea lochs, sheltered bays, shipwrecks, tidal pools, kelp forests, sandy seabeds and rocky reefs. You might see sharks, seals, scorpionfish, octopus and cuttlefish. These are our 10 favourite spots.Treyarnon tidal pool, CornwallView image in fullscreenThe pool is particularly good for kids to wade in and discover submerged wonders.Treyarnon, near Padstow, is a great place to combine a family day at the beach with a spot of rockpooling or snorkelling. The tidal pool here is large enough to snorkel around, but shallow enough that even the most wary can wade in confidently, don a mask or goggles, and peek at the wonders below the water’s surface. Particularly good for introducing kids to the underwater world, the pool is mostly natural, with a small concrete barrage complementing its otherwise watertight rocky walls. The beach can get very busy in the summer, but that popularity has its benefits – an ice-cream van is often parked at the top of the beach for post-snorkelling refreshments.Chesil Cove, DorsetView image in fullscreenWonderfully prehistoric-looking john dory may be found at the far south of the cove.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyAn 18-mile (29km) shingle tombolo formed by the accumulation of pebbles over 7,000 years, Chesil Beach is significantly exposed to stormy weather from the south and west. At its southernmost end is Chesil Cove. As with the rest of the coastline here, the cove’s exposed aspect results in variable visibility, oscillating between nil and fabulous depending on the weather. Pick the right day, however, and it’s a perfect place to snorkel. The best area to explore is at the far south of the cove, where uniform small pebbles give way to larger rocks and boulders covered in kelp and other seaweeds. Here, you’ll find sand eels, wrasse, bass and, on occasion, wonderfully prehistoric-looking john dory. Cephalopods such as cuttlefish and their less commonly seen cousins, squid and octopus, are also occasional visitors to the area; keep your eyes peeled for these masters of disguise.Eastbourne pier, East SussexView image in fullscreenEastbourne pier’s pilings make the ideal home for molluscs, which, in turn, attract starfish and crabs.Photograph: Fadi Al-barghouthy/AlamyOriginally built in the late 19th century, and restored after afire in 2014, Eastbourne pier makes a pleasant focal point for a snorkel in calm weather. Shingle beaches along this stretch of the southeast coastline are relatively inhospitable: the churning action of the waves gives marine life little chance to establish itself on the pebbles. However, the pier pilings provide a more stable footing and are covered with barnacle-encrusted common mussels and patches of sea lettuce. In turn, the mussels attract predators such as starfish, crabs and dog whelks. The regular presence of fishers on the pier suggests this site also attracts its fair share of fish – so watch out for those lines! You may catch a fleeting glimpse of sand eels which, in turn, draw in larger fish such as bass. Swimming around the pier at sunset is an atmospheric way to end the day.Boggle Hole, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenThe shoreline’s exposed rock ledges provide a fantastic habitat for crabs.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyGeology and strong currents (particularly at high tide) mean snorkelling opportunities are few and far between on this stretch of coastline but, in calm conditions, after a spell of settled weather, Boggle Hole is an excellent spot. There is so much life to see, even in the shallows. The shoreline is laced with ledges of exposed rock that provide a fantastic habitat for smaller marine life such as blennies, gobies and smaller crabs. Larger boulders, meanwhile, are covered with a patchwork of molluscs, clinging on against the ebb and flow of the tides, plus vivid patches of purple algae, and shoals of small fry dart among the seaweed. When we visited this site in August, hundreds of hermit crabs were also present, some snoozing, some tussling over shells, and some just taking a walk along the seafloor.Charlie’s Garden, NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenCollywell Bay’s distinctive sandstone sea stack is excellent for spotting bottom-dwellers.Photograph: Wirestock/AlamyCharlie’s Garden is a distinctive sandstone sea stack sitting on the tidal foreshore of Collywell Bay. Local lore has it that the rock is named after one Charles Dockwray, who cultivated a garden on the rock in the mid-19th century, when it was still part of the mainland. A fabulous place for rockpooling at lower tides, the rock now forms a permanent feature of the bay, which is broad and shallow, with a rock and sand seabed that’s home to seaweeds of all types as well as barnacles, limpets, gobies, blennies and other bottom-dwelling species. Seals are also known to visit the bay – a wonderful sight if they choose to swim nearby. As with much of this coastline, water visibility can take some time to clear after storms, but in sunny, settled conditions it’s a wonderful place to experience east-coast marine life.Scottish Seabird Centre, East LothianView image in fullscreenThe tidal pool is home to hermit crabs, limpets, barnacles, snails, seaweeds and the odd anemone.Photograph: Emma and Gordon TaylorThiscentre, in North Berwick, is a great place to get your fill of nature, both above and below the waves. Looking out towards Bass Rock, home to the 100,000 birds that make up the largest northern gannet colony in the world, the centre is a conservation and education charity that also operates as a visitor attraction, and organises nature-based sightseeing trips. It’s also a brilliant spot for snorkellers. For beginners and younger marine explorers, the neighbouring tidal pool – home to hermit crabs, limpets, barnacles, snails, seaweeds and the odd anemone – is a great place to start. More experienced snorkellers can head to the rocky gullies of the headland. Here, barnacled rocks decorated with kelp gently descend to a sandy seabed, providing habitat for crabs and small fish species.High Shore Beach, AberdeenshireView image in fullscreenThe rocky fingers projecting into the sea at Macduff harbour form reefs where starfish lurk.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyA great day out for marine life enthusiasts, the town of Macduff is home to both a recently refurbished aquarium and High Shore Beach. Like some of the other locations in this list (the Scottish Seabird Centre and Gruinard Bay), High Shore features in one of theScottish Wildlife Trust’s snorkel trails. Visit theMacduff Marine Aquariumto gen up on the underwater habitats of the Moray Firth and learn what to look out for, then hit the water to explore for yourself. Directly in front of the aquarium is a line of rocky fingers projecting into the sea. These form a series of parallel reefs and a maze of kelp-filled gullies packed with life. As you peer into cracks in the rocks, watch for the red eyes of a velvet swimming crab, or a starfish slowly walking over the reef or seabed – orangey-pink common starfish, knobbly white spiny starfish and common sunstar have all been spotted here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the lowest of tides, the beaches at Gruinard are joined, but the incoming waterline soon makes it impossible to move between them without getting wet. The best snorkelling is at the northernmost end of the beach, around a small islet just off the shore. Here, rocky reefs and seagrass meadows exist side by side and provide excellent shelter for various fish and shellfish. Look out for sea slugs and hermit crabs making their way slowly along blades of seagrass, and for flatfish burrowing their way into patches of sand to protect themselves from predators. Watch also for spiky, vivid purple maerl, a hard seaweed that deposits lime in its cell walls as it grows, creating a brittle skeleton. Maerl is very fragile and slow-growing, so take care not to knock into it.Porth Castell, Ynys Môn(Anglesey)View image in fullscreenA magnificent narrow gully makes this bay a great place to look for lobsters.Porth Castell is a small bay that’s sheltered from the open sea by a large offshore island. This fortuitous natural layout provides a wealth of snorkelling opportunities around the rocky reefs that surround the island and run up the bay edges. Arrive at high-ish tide and you can swim through a magnificent narrow gully on the left-hand side of the bay, between the shore and the island. Look into the recesses in the rocks as you go to spot vibrant orange and blue spiny squat lobsters, and more common residents such as crabs and blennies. If you’re very lucky, you might encounter a small-spotted catshark; these are relatively common in British waters but not often glimpsed by snorkellers because they spend relatively little time in the shallows.Rockham Bay, DevonView image in fullscreenComplex rock formations at the bay form tidal pools teeming with marine life.A quiet place to be at one with nature and to get away from the well-worn tourist spots of Devon, Rockham Bay is an excellent example of the stratified rock formations that typify this stretch of the north Devon coastline. The unforgiving nature of the sea is apparent here, with the remains of the steamer ship SS Collier strewn over the intertidal rock; wrecked in 1914, there’s not much left to see but the remains of rusted chainworks, a well-weathered winch assembly and other miscellaneous metalworks. Low tide is a good time to explore by land, with the wreckage exposed and the complex rock formations forming tidal pools packed with marine life. Snorkelling around the rocky extremities reveals kelpy reefs: watch out for small spotted catsharks dozing on the sandy seabed as you move from one rocky spur to the next. The nearest car park is at Mortehoe.How to snorkel safely …Like open water swimming, snorkelling comes with risks that should be considered when planning your adventure. While experienced swimmers will already be aware of many of the considerations, here are 10 safety tips:1Assess your fitness to snorkel before getting in the water2Consider undertaking formal snorkelling qualifications3Always snorkel with a “buddy”4Know how to use your kit and ensure it’s in good condition5Assess the site and conditions before entry6Regularly monitor your position in the water7Use a swim buoy so that boats can easily see you8Never swim into underwater structures or caves while snorkelling9Get out of the water before you feel cold, and especially before shivering10Immediately leave the water if you feel excessively fatigued or short of breath… and responsiblyJust as important as your own safety is that you don’t cause harm to the eco-systems you’re exploring. Here’s how to snorkel without doing any damage:1Follow the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’smarine and coastal wildlife code2Avoid damaging habitats: refrain from stepping on, touching, or holding on to coastal habitats or species3Dispose of litter responsibly4Use eco-friendly products such as sun cream that’s compatible with the marine environment and, ideally, invest in swimwear that’s been produced by sustainable means5Respect marine life, particularly when snorkelling among seals and seahorses, which should not be disturbedSnorkelling Britain: 100 Marine AdventuresbyEmma & Gordon Tayloris published byWild Things Publishing(£18.99).Readers can receive a 20% discountand freepostage and packaging withdiscount code ‘TheGuardian’atwildthingspublishing.comExplore more on these topicsWater sports holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysDiving holidaysBeach holidaysTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m concentrating on ideas, rather than recipes as such, because using up the odds and ends from the fridge needs to be part of the flow of your cooking to avoid waste. Everything is quick, easy, involves minimal prep and, crucially, is endlessly open to adaptation.Leftover naan with egg, chilli crisp, chutney and spring onion (pictured top)Prep5 minCook15 minServes11 mediumeggLeftover naanor roti, or frozen paratha cooked from frozen in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes1spring onion and/orfresh herbs– coriander is perfectChutney,such as mango, raita, mint, lime pickleChilli crisp– I like LaoganmaBring a small pan of water to a boil, then add the egg and set a timer for six and a half minutes. (To save time, boil and peel a few eggs, then keep them in a sealed container in the fridge, where they’ll be fine for three days.)Meanwhile, sprinkle a little water over the leftover naan and stick it under the grill for a minute on each side, to wake it up a bit. (If you are using frozen paratha, remove from the packaging and put directly into a large, hot frying pan and cook as per the packet instructions.)Finely slice the spring onion and roughly chop the herbs, if using. Spread some chutney over the naan, then peel and quarter the boiled egg and arrange it on top. Add the spring onion, herbs, if using, and chilli crisp, then roll or fold up and eat over a plate.Leftover greens on toast with cottage cheese, melted chilli jam and toasted seedsView image in fullscreenElly Curshen’s leftover greens on toast with cottage cheese, chilli jam and toasted seeds.Prep5 minCook10 minServes12 tsp olive oil1 small handfulleftover greens(cooked or raw), such as cabbage, green beans, kale, cauliflower leaves, peas and/or broccoli, all roughly chopped2 slicesbread2-4 tbsp cottage cheese, or cream cheese or creme fraiche1 tbsp chilli jelly or jam, or sweet chilli sauceFlaky sea salt2 tsp toasted mixed seeds– toast a whole bag, then store in a jar to have to handHeat the oil in a large frying pan and add the leftover greens. If they are already cooked, just let them heat through and char a bit (avoid the temptation to jiggle them around too much); if they’re raw, stir-fry with a splash of water until tender, then leave to char.
