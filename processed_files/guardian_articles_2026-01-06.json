May the best country win!Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.29 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 15.54 ESTShareThese weren’t exactly the words Kemi Badenoch had been hoping to hear. Halfway through her interview on the Today programme on Tuesday morning, the BBC presenter Nick Robinson observed that,in regard to the US coup in Venezuela, the Conservative leader’s position wasn’t that far off from Keir Starmer’s. You could sense the air go out of the room. In KemiWorld there is no greater dishonour than a likeness to the prime minister. Time for the fightback to begin. To create some distance.OK, Kemi said.Yes, she too drew the line at Greenland. That would be a step too far. There was no need for Donald Trump to claim the country for America. That was an action that could threaten Nato. And besides, as far as she knew, Greenland wasn’t a rogue narco state. She, too believed in a world of moral relativism. One where it was fine to invade countries whose regimes we disliked. There was one rule for the west and another for the rest.But as for Venezuela, she was all for the kidnap and imprisonment of Nicolás Maduro. Her only regret was that the UK hadn’t thought of doing it long ago. No one was mourning the demise of the dictator. Here was the thing. International law and the old rules-based order were just so last century. Margaret Thatcher might have voiced her disapproval of theAmerican invasion of Grenada in 1983, but were she alive today she would be all for the latest action in Venezuela.And just think of all the trouble Tony Blair had got himself in by inventing weapons of mass destruction. Just so that he could have a legal pretext for invading Iraq. These days, he would just have said: “C’mon guys. Let’s just get rid of Saddam Hussein and get our mitts on the oil.” And the rest of the world would have been grateful. Because that war worked out so well.More than anything, the American operation inVenezuelahad been the morally right thing to do. Kemi wasn’t too sure of the legal pretext, but there again she wasn’t much bothered. We now lived in a world where the strong and the powerful got to call all the shots. So why bother getting bogged down in all the legal niceties? Let’s just get stuck in. Instead of all this liberal hand-wringing about process, we should be lining up the next regimes we don’t like to depose them. Cut the time-wasting.That was the real difference between her and Starmer, Kemi said. Deep down, Keir was still a lawyer. Though he understood the rules-based order was all but dead and buried and that the US could get away with almost anything, he still mourned their loss. He thought the world had become a more dangerous, more anarchic place. One where the weak got crushed. But not Kemi. She was thrilled to see the back of international law. May the best country win. Or failing that, the strongest. Just leave Greenland alone. Greenland was different.“I don’t agree with a foreign policy of meetings and saying nice things to one another,” said Kemi. At which point,Nick Robinsonalmost fell off his chair before he remembered she had no chance of becoming the next prime minister. Just as well. Because it seems that Badenoch’s approach in international diplomacy is to go to war first and to ask questions afterwards. She doesn’t seem to realise that maintaining peace often also involves sitting around a table and trying to find common ground. I guess if she can’t help picking a fight with her friends, why should we expect her to be any different with her enemies?By now, Kemi was warming to her favourite subject. Why Starmer was so rubbish. If she had been prime minister, she would have been invited into The Donald’s war room, she suggested. Trump wouldn’t have dared make a move on Maduro without her say so. At some level, she genuinely believes this stuff. There again, she does have a problem with reality.This was too much for Robinson. He pointed out that no world leaders had been given the heads up by Trump and that in any case Starmer had not been wholly ineffectual. Like Kemi, he had decided to give The Donald a free pass on Venezuela because thecoalition of the willing needed US support on any peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine. So a degree of sycophancy was canny realpolitik. And in any case, Starmer had also negotiated tariff reductions. So not entirely useless.Kemi wouldn’t hear a word of this. She would have done much better than this. She couldn’t say quite how but we were expected to take her word on this. Right, said Robinson. So how many meetings have you had with Trump? “Er, none,” came the reply. Though she had spoken to him for 30 seconds at the state banquet and in that time he had apparently made it clear he thought she had a bright future. But hey, she had met Giorgia Meloni. Would that do? Nick tried to explain that it hadn’t been the Italian prime minister who had attacked Venezuela.The interview then switched to Brexit. How did Kemi think it was going? Apart from the fact that it was all going terribly and the UK was getting it all wrong, she would give it 10 out of 10. Because we had made it happen. That was all that really counted. People shouldn’t get too hung up about being much worse off than 10 years ago because that was a category error. The important thing was that it had been an exercise in sovereignty.Er, hello. She had spent the first 10 minutes of the interview saying that might was right and that other countries sovereignty was now up for grabs. And now she was claiming UK sovereignty as an inalienable right. It’s almost as if there is a missing connection in her synapse. That each sentence is subject to a memory wipe the moment she has moved on to the next one.We ended with Kemi insisting she had been a net zero sceptic for longer than Nigel Farage. Which was an out-and-out lie. Maybe Badenoch just wanted to start the year as she intended to go on. Constantly reshaping the truth to what she would like it to be. Which reminded her. Perhaps today would be the day that The Donald phoned her. She had given him her number at Windsor. And it was odd the president found the time to talk to any reporter in Washington and not her. After all, they had a possible invasion of Greenland to discuss.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchDonald TrumpNick RobinsonKeir StarmerVenezuelacommentShareReuse this content"

Look no further than UkrainePatrick WintourDiplomatic editorThe foreign secretary faces a tight balancing act between keeping the US involved in peace talks, and trying to maintain international orderTue 6 Jan 2026 12.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 15.54 ESTShareAnyone trying to understand why Yvette Cooper studiously avoided saying whether the UK viewedthe kidnapping of Nicolás Maduroas a breach of international law only needs to look to what was planned in Paris a day later.After the foreign secretary’s 90-minute humiliation in the House of Commonson Monday night, a joint statement was expected in the French capital by the coalition of the willing – and a draft included the US promising binding security guarantees to protect Ukraine in the event of a further Russian attack.From the Foreign Office’s perspective, there was no good reason to be critical ofDonald Trumpif it risked provoking him to withdraw the painstakingly negotiated and fragile US agreement to participate in the Ukraine security guarantees. Those guarantees, the subject of military level talks for months, required US sign-up if they were to be seen as a credible, viable alternative to Ukraine’s Nato membership – an aspiration Ukraine is being forced to abandon. The guarantees are also the precondition for a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine that Europe and Kyiv can swallow.Trump lambasts ‘weak’ and ‘decaying’ Europe and hints at walking away from UkraineRead moreFor British officials, the US agreement to be a guarantor, symbolised by the presence of Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff in Paris, was one of the great diplomatic rescue jobs, given Europe had been left flat footed and horrified whenWitkoff’s 28-point abandonment of Ukraine leaked on 19 November.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff (left) and Jared Kushner arrive in Paris.Photograph: Szwarc Henri/ABACA/ShutterstockThe US administration official that probably did most to coax Trump back to offering future protection to Ukraine, and therefore Europe, was the US secretary of state and national security adviser,Marco Rubio.Europe as a result is deeply in Rubio’s debt, but since the US capture of Maduro was very much a Rubio-masterminded operation – JD Vance, the vice president has been conspicuous by his absence – British diplomats regarded it as vital not to query the legal basis of what Rubio regards as a great personal, political, military and economic coup.One British official said it was “a no-brainer’ in weighing the value of public criticism of Rubio over the removal of a head of state that the UK had not recognised anyway, and whose toppling was a fait accompli by the time the UK had been informed. The UK had long stopped supplying intelligence to the US over the attacks on Venezuelan drug boats.Cooper sent as many coded hints to MPs on Monday night as she could that, in discussing Venezuela with Rubio over the weekend, she did not just tell him international law in abstract should be a guiding principle, but should have applied in the case of Venezuela.Moreover, Cooper is obviously trying to insert the UK into Washington’s sketchy planning about Venezuela’s future.The UK’s commitment to Venezuela goes back a long way – to the birth of the republic in the early 19th century, when the UK provided more material and diplomatic support than any other foreign power to the Great Liberator, Simón Bolívar. Now, the Foreign Office is arguing that Venezuela must move to a democratic transition, and it is unrealistic to expect a government stuffed with the acolytes of Hugo Chávez to act as US puppets.“Stability will not be maintained unless there is a transition that has the will of the people,” Cooper told MPs. She has been touting the UK chargé d’affaires in Caracas, Colin Dick, as a man that understands the Venezuelan opposition, including the apparently shunned María Corina Machado.María Corina Machado vows to return to Venezuela and rejects rule of Maduro’s deputyRead moreBut Rubio, a Latin American specialist in his own right, has clearly made the brutal decision that the Venezuelan opposition are not up to the task of running the country and will, if installed, only provoke a civil war of the kind seen in Libya and Iraq – where the destruction of the military left a vacuum. From the US perspective, this is less about regime change than enforced changes to how the regime operates.The worry for the Foreign Office is that there is little sign so far that Trump or Rubio are much interested in the UK’s Latin American expertise.Indeed it seems any journalist in Washington can grab two minutes on the phone with Donald Trump, yet Keir Starmer was not consulted about the capture of Maduro at all.That raises deep questions about whether the Foreign Office can operate on the old assumption that this asymmetric relationship built on defence intelligence and security is still based on shared values, or is still that important to the US.Many MPs of different politics believe the Foreign Office needs to reassess Trump in the second term and how he is best influenced. Trump of course remains hard to read. He is not isolationist, nor a liberal internationalist. He harbours little ambition for wars, preferring to strike and quickly retreat. He enjoys the propaganda of force, and the power of threats. Boards of peace are announced for him to chair and then they never meet. He shuns alliances, prefers the company of autocratic great powers, and has just set out a national security strategy with which Cooper admits the UK does not agree.The US seizure of Greenland by forceis, after Caracas, a serious prospect. “We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CNN on Monday night. “But we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.”In this Hobbesian world, the UK can cherish its often temporary wins on Ukraine, and nurse its capital in Washington for ever more selective use. But if America First requires the destruction of the niceties of a rules-based order, the UK at some point is going to have swallow hard, stop being risk-averse, and seek influence in a way that is entirely different to the past 80 years.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaYvette CooperAmericasDonald TrumpMarco RubioForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Soldiers with bayoneted rifles were dragging people out into the streets, staggering, naked and bleeding. Nobody knew if Fela was still inside the burning building.”Lemi Ghariokwu pauses. For much of our video-call, the 70-year-old artist has joyfully revisited his years as friend and confidant of Fela Aníkúlápó Kuti, the Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer whose legacy has been celebrated recently by both a high-profile podcast produced by the Obamas and a career-spanning box-set, The Best of the Black President, designed by Ghariokwu.I will electrify my fence. The next time they come, they will get a shock and think: 'This man is crazy!'His mood darkens, however, as he recalls the authorities’ assault onKuti’s Lagos HQ, the Kalakuta Republic, on 18 February 1977. For years, tensions had simmered between Kuti and Nigeria’s military junta, as the singer/bandleader chronicled injustice and corruption on records including Zombie, Expensive Shit and No Agreement. But the razing of Kalakuta marked a tragic inflection point in Kuti’s struggle against the government. It also initiated the unravelling of his friendship with Ghariokwu.View image in fullscreen‘Ideas were just flooding my brain’ … Ghariokwu.Ghariokwu had first crossed Kalakuta’s threshold three years earlier as an 18-year-old engineering student, accompanied by Kuti’s journalist friend Babatunde Harrison, who’d spotted Ghariokwu’s portrait of Bruce Lee hanging in a Lagos bar and deemed him skilled enough to illustrate the musician’s album sleeves. As he awaited his audience with the Black President, then mid-siesta, Ghariokwu absorbed his surroundings. Kuti had been gifted Kalakuta by his mother, revered pan-African activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, restyling it as a fiefdom-cum-commune for his followers, complete with recording studio and swimming pool. “Kalakuta was already notorious, because of Fela’s lifestyle; young people from all over the neighbourhood had eloped to live there. There were skimpily dressed women everywhere.”When Kuti finally awoke, Ghariokwu handed over the portrait of him that Harrison had requested. “Fela was groggy, his eyes were bloodshot, he was dressed only in his briefs, which hung down so his whole pubic hair was exposed. I was intimidated. He looked at the portrait and said, ‘Wow.Goddammit.’ He wrote me a cheque for 120 naira, four times what I’d charge for a portrait. But my spirit told me, ‘Don’t take the money.’ I told him it was a gift from the bottom of my heart, and he smiled, writing me a gate pass to visit Kalakuta whenever I wanted. It was the ticket to my destiny.”View image in fullscreen‘I cashed the cheque this time’ … Alagbon Close.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuThey met again a fortnight later, after Kalakuta had been raided by police for the first time and Kuti was hospitalised with a head-wound. “The room was crowded,” remembers Ghariokwu. If their previous meeting had acquainted him with the star, he now saw the steel beneath the playboy glamour. “With a police guard at the door, Fela spoke loudly about how the authorities had found it too easy to gain entry to Kalakuta. ‘I will electrify the fence, so next time they’ll get a shock and think, “This man is crazy!” And I’m going to write a song to lampoon the police.’ Then he saw me and called for me. ‘The artist!’”Kuti commissioned Ghariokwu to paint the sleeve for his next release, Alagbon Close, which railed against the regime’s dehumanisation of Nigeria’s people. “Alagbon Close was where Fela became a revolutionary against the system,” says Ghariokwu. “I didn’t simply illustrate the lyrics – my painting was more metaphysical. I depicted Fela breaking out of jail, in a celebratory stance, chains broken, the victory sign painted on the wall of Kalakuta because he’d triumphed over the evil police. When Fela saw it, again he said: ‘Wow.Goddammit.’ But I cashed the cheque this time.”Some of the 80 people living in Kalakuta were employed simply to roll spliffsKuti took the artist under his wing. “I was already a pan-Africanist,” Ghariokwu says. “But Fela taught me so much. He gave me books about African history, George GM James’s Stolen Legacy, Yosef ben-Jochannon’s Africa: Mother of Western Civilisation, the Autobiography of Malcolm X. His other graphic designers didn’t care about what he was preaching. I did, and that put me in a very advantageous position.”Kuti also wanted to open Ghariokwu’s mind to the powers of marijuana, but the teetotal artist was reluctant. “Some of the 80 or so people living in Kalakuta were employed simply to roll spliffs,” he remembers. “But I always refused. I took Fanta instead.” However, when Ghariokwu was assigned his second album cover, 1975’s No Bread, Kuti said: “How can my artist be drinking Fanta? You have to smokeigbó, to make your head correct.” Ghariokwu adds: “He was such a hero to me, a demi-god, I said, ‘OK’.”View image in fullscreen‘His marijuana was very potent’ … 1975’s No Bread.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuKuti would get his chefs to heat marijuana until it yielded its oil, bottling and storing it in his bedroom. “It wasverypotent. He put a drop on the end of a spoon, for me to lick. Within 30 minutes, I felt very hungry and I had this floating feeling. I went to the bathroom, and I could see my alimentary canal like the plumbing of a house, my urine travelling through pipes inside my body. I told Fela and his friends, and they all laughed at me.”Later that day, Kuti realised that Ghariokwu needed to go home. “He drove us in his Range Rover, and when we got to my parents’ place, kids in the street were shouting, ‘Fela! Fela!’ As I got out of the car, he hissed, ‘When you get inside,don’ttalk to your parents,don’tanswer any questions – just say “goodnight” and go to sleep. But when you sleep, meditate about the artwork.’ I awoke at noon the next day. Ideas were just flooding my brain. I forced in as many as possible.”The sleeve for No Bread presented a dizzying overload of images and metaphors: men fighting over food and money, women presenting their breasts, rats in sunglasses, empty petrol pumps, a balloon reading “Mr Inflation is in town”.“When Fela saw it, he jumped for joy, shouting, ‘You see?’ like I should always have been smoking marijuana. But I can’t handle intoxicants. So I analysed the inspiration I got from that high and used it as my style of composition from then on.”View image in fullscreenAcid satire … Ikoyi Blindness.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuGhariokwu remained teetotal, but his work continued to evolve over the next several years. On acidly satirical sleeves such as Ikoyi Blindness (lampooning a lawyer from the affluent Ikoyi neighbourhood), Yellow Fever (naked African women apply skin bleacher), Upside Down (colonial developers invade as children starve), Ghariokwu created a visual identity as unique asPedro Bell’s work for Funkadelic. “Fela treated me like one of his children, always receiving my work with ‘Wow.Goddammit.’ And, if he was particularly impressed, ‘MOTHERFUCKER.’ I was his youngest adviser, his comrade-in-arms. With two other friends, I formed the political youth wing of Kalakuta, Young African Pioneers. Fela could no longer use public transport, so we told him what was happening in the city, and that inspired his songs.”Ghariokwu was at home when a neighbour told him Kalakuta was on fire. He raced to the compound. “The raid was already in full swing. The police had grabbed Fela’s mum. I didn’t see her fall from the window.” Suspecting Kuti was hiding in a nearby warehouse, soldiers apprehended the owner. “They chopped his finger off with a machete, and he confessed immediately. Soon, they dragged Fela out into the street, naked and bleeding. They slashed his bodyguard’s stomach open with bayonets, so his intestines came out. Fela saw me and whispered, ‘Get my lawyer.’”Kuti went on tosue the government for $1.6m, and rebuilt Kalakuta and his nightclub the Shrine, which the soldiers had also razed, a block away. But Funmilayo never recovered from being thrown from the second-floor window. “Losing his mother was very traumatic for Fela,” says Ghariokwu. “On Coffin for Head of State, he sings, ‘They kill my mama, they kill my mama.’ He was crying from his soul. He felt so guilty: ‘If not for my troubles, she’d still be alive.’ He was never the same after that.”View image in fullscreenNixed … Johnny Just Drop’s back cover.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuGhariokwu and Kuti disagreed over how to proceed in the aftermath of the raid. “We had to be diplomatic, we needed to sit down and negotiate,” says Ghariokwu. “Fela was having none of that, and my loyalty was questioned.” When he painted a young African in denim and platform shoes falling from an aeroplane for the sleeve of Johnny Just Drop, which satirised diaspora Africans believing they’re superior to their countrymen, Kuti nixed the cover (“I don’t want it to seem like I’m attacking the youth”) and told Ghariokwu to draw a bourgeois older man in a parachute instead. It was the first time Kuti had told him what to paint. Against his boss’s wishes, Ghariokwu had the label manufacture an expensive gatefold sleeve with Kuti’s preferred image on the front, and the rejected image on the back. “He was so angry,” he laughs. “‘You’ve hit me below the belt!’ I ran. The next day he cooled down.”But then Kuti rejected Ghariokwu’s next sleeve, for Sorrow, Tears and Blood. “Fela broke my heart,” says the artist, who had always enjoyed “100% freedom” in his work for Kuti. Ghariokwu walked away from Kalakuta, going on to complete more than 2,000 album sleeves for other musicians, and pursue a career in fine art. A decade after their falling out, he reconciled with Kuti, working on several more sleeves before the Black President succumbed to Aids in 1997.“Ours was a divine collaboration,” he says now, taking pride in how Kuti’s music – and his album artwork – helped spread African culture across the rest of the world. “A journalist once asked me if I was bored of always being tied to Fela, of living in his shadow,” he smiles. “But Fela is in the lineage of WEB Du Bois, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr, a fighter for the mental liberation of the African people. Fela cast a long shadow, and as a pan-Africanist, that’s a good place to live.”The Best of the Black Presidentby Fela Kuti is out nowExplore more on these topicsArt and designFela KutifeaturesShareReuse this content"

What causes them and are they normal?Though most nosebleeds are mild and benign, they shouldn’t happen. Experts weigh in on when to see a doctorAdrienne MateiTue 6 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 17.14 ESTShareIf you frequently experience nosebleeds, you might come to regard them as nothing more than a messy inconvenience.Yet, even though most nosebleeds are mild and benign, they shouldn’t happen “if everything inside the nose is healthy”, says Dr Patricia Loftus, an otolaryngologist at the University of California, San Francisco.Here’s what experts say about nosebleeds.What is a nosebleed?A nosebleed, known medically as epistaxis, comes in two forms: anterior and posterior.About 90% of nosebleeds are anterior, and start in the area between your two nostrils, called Kiesselbach’s plexus, says Loftus. This area contains a lot of blood vessels – little capillaries that keep the nostrils well supplied with blood, to warm the air you inhale. These can break open, creating a bleed that mostly pours from the nostril, though some blood may trickle into the mouth or throat, especially if you lean your head back.‘Let them’, creatine and fibermaxxing: the biggest wellness trends of 2025Read morePosterior nosebleeds are rarer and bigger. These are triggered when larger blood vessels deeper in the nasal passage burst. If there is significantly more blood flowing down the back of your throat, potentially causing you to choke, that’s a posterior nosebleed, explains Dr Amin Javer, an ear , nose and throat (ENT) surgeon and research director at the University of British Columbia.Posterior nosebleeds are more serious than anterior ones, and require prompt medical attention. They’re most often seen in older adults, especially those taking anticoagulants, which increase the risk of hemorrhage.What should you do when your nose is bleeding?When a nosebleed starts, many people instinctively tip their head back.“That’s the worst thing you could do,” says Javer. “You’re going to just start drinking the blood.” Blood in the stomach causes nausea, so it’s best to avoid this.Instead, you should put your head forward and very gently pinch your nose, he says. A cold compress on the neck or nose can help constrict blood vessels and slow the bleed, as can a spritz of a nasal decongestant like oxymetazoline.If you see thick clots come out of your nose, it can be unsettling. But it’s not necessarily a bad sign, nor is it uncommon. “It’s actually just showing that your blood is clotting effectively,” says Dr Peter Manes, an ENT surgeon and residency director at Yale School of Medicine.If your nosebleeds are occurring multiple times a week, interfering with your daily life or lasting longer than30 minutes, they warrant seeing a doctor for a clinical evaluation.What causes nosebleeds?“One of the most common reasons for [anterior] nosebleeds is when the area dries out,” explains Loftus.Dry air is especially to blame in winter. “It doesn’t matter how much rain there is outside – our heaters turn on, the humidity in our bedrooms goes down,” says Javer. He recommends cracking a window while you sleep or getting a humidifier to keep humidity levels between 40% and 50%. You can also moisturize your nasal lining with saline spray or a very thin layer of Vaseline just inside the nostrils.Another common reason for nosebleeds is “digital manipulation, which is a nice way of saying nose picking or scratching your nose”, says Loftus. The nose is delicate, and even a light bump or scratch can pop a capillary and cause bleeding.Ginseng, garlic, ginkgo – some of those herbal medications can thin your bloodDr Peter ManesInflammation fromallergiesor viral infections can make the lining more fragile and prone to cracking. Physical exertion sometimes plays a role too. Exercises, especially those that combine effort with positions where your head dips below your heart, like downward dog pose, can increase pressure in the face and prompt a bleed.Medications and supplements add another layer of risk. Prescription blood thinners and aspirin make bleeding more likely, and some herbal supplements have similar effects. “Ginseng, garlic, ginkgo – some of those herbal medications can thin your blood,” says Manes.Why am I having frequent nosebleeds?“If you’re having a nosebleed every day and you don’t know what’s causing it, you need evaluation,” says Loftus. “Even if it’s not bothering you that much, that’s alarming enough to come see a doctor.”Manes agrees that nosebleeds can become “normalized”, and easy to dismiss as minor, but they do occasionally signal more serious issues.Abundant nosebleeds can indicate that your blood is not clotting correctly, Loftus says. A doctor may ask about alcohol use or other factors to discern if a liver issue is involved.Hormonal changes in pregnancy can play a role. Loftus says pregnancy-induced surges in hormones such as estrogen and progesterone are linked to a higher likelihood of lobular capillary hemangioma, a “usually pretty small lesion in the nose” that can cause nosebleeds. These growths are not inherently dangerous, but should be evaluated by a doctor.If you’re in your 20s and suddenly having frequent, heavy nosebleeds, you could be among the roughly one in 5,000 people with hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia (HHT), a genetic vascular abnormality that often presents in young adulthood and requires treatment. Without medical attention, patients with HHT may “succumb to death from nosebleed”, says Javer.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Frequent unilateral nosebleeds – bleeding from only one nostril – are a significant red flag for doctors. That pattern can signal a tumor or polyp, especially if accompanied by symptoms on the same side of the face, like not being able to breathe through the nose; facial pain or pressure; or unilateral ear pain, numbness or vision changes, says Loftus. “That should get checked out,” she says.How do doctors treat a nosebleed?Many nosebleeds can be taken care of at home. But if you have persistent, frequent or high-volume nosebleeds that disrupt your daily life, or if you think you’re having a posterior bleed, seek medical attention.If you arrive in the emergency room or a doctor’s office with an active nosebleed, there are a few things you can expect.First is “a thorough examination of your nasal cavity, trying to identify a source of the bleed”, says Manes. Most bleeds can be controlled with packing – the insertion of a nasal tampon (which is different to the menstrual product).A doctor may cauterize the area that is bleeding, says Manes. The procedure stings, but a numbing cream can ease the pain.You may have your vitals checked and blood drawn to look for issues such as anemia or clotting abnormalities. If symptoms suggest a mass in the sinuses, a CT scan or MRI may be recommended. And if you’ve lost a significant amount of blood, you could require a transfusion.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Think of the likes of Game of Thrones or Succession, which needed time to warm up, and some jaw-dropper episodes (namely the Red Wedding and Kendall bumping off a waiter, respectively) to really get going. Industry is one such show – the slow-burn HBO/BBC series that firmly hit its stride in season three. Good news: season four is even better, truly top-tier television that’s surely destined for end-of-year lists, a serious feat when we’re barely a week into January.Industry is, of course, the one about young investment bankers, the drama that initially drew comparisons with This Life, and the show where our fresh-faced grads were as likely to be hooking up with one another as they were to be stabbing each other in the back. Fast forward to season four and it’s feeling decidedly more dark and debauched, while still held together with pitch-perfect dialogue. Kiernan Shipka – here, vastly closer to Don Draper than to his daughter, Sally, whom she played in Mad Men – Max Minghella, Kal Penn and Charlie Heaton are among the big names who have joined the cast this time around. They meld seamlessly with our existing leads – the mononymous Myha’la, Marisa Abela,Kit Harington– to make something more twisted and sophisticated than viewers may be expecting. Props, too, for Toheeb Jimoh of Ted Lasso for integrating flawlessly; his jaunt over the Atlantic with Miriam Petche as Sweetpea is a treat in particular.View image in fullscreenProps to you … Toheeb Jimoh as Kwabena.Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf Productions/HBO/Simon RidgwayAs per, Industry smartly and gamely rips from the headlines: much of season four revolves around a payment provider, Tender, on the verge of becoming a bank. It is, naturally, keen to cut ties with an OnlyFans-esque platform, Siren, as a new online safety bill is mooted in the UK. Cue financial journalist James (Heaton), partying in a club with Tender employee Hayley (Shipka), in a strobe-y scene that hurt my eyes, but which was key to kickstarting the devious game of cat and mouse that followed. Harper (Myha’la) continues to convey so much with just the harried twitch of her jaw as she chews her gum. Having wormed her way out of innumerable seemingly career-ending situations, she’s now running a fund specialising in short-selling, on behalf of financier Otto Mostyn, who – like many of the characters this season – proves himself to be a power-hungry piece of work, with a timely hatred of “woke” culture.Harper is fuming about being hamstrung at work by Mostyn as she tries to make a buck on Tender, leading to the first great line of the series, after she bemoans being seen as an angry Black woman (her on-off mentor, Eric (Ken Leung), replies: “you ARE an angry Black woman!”) Ex-bankers Mickey Down and Konrad Kay – the double act who write Industry and, this time around, direct many of the episodes – are often credited for their financial expertise. They should also be commended for how well they observe and critique race, class, desire and sexuality, being unafraid to say the unsayable in the pursuit not only of dark humour (and potential sextortion plots) but also of reality. (They remain undefeated at funny background gags and Easter eggs, too, among them the different Enya songs that play at pivotal moments this series.)View image in fullscreenA career best … Kit Harington as Henry.Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf Productions/HBO/Simon RidgwayThere is a stark realness to much of season four. Heaton’s character does potentially perilous investigative work, lest “Paddy Radden Keefe” – that’s the New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe, to the rest of us – get there first. Henry (a career-best Kit Harington) and Yasmin (Marisa Abela) wrangle with the hardships of married life, as Henry tries to rebuild his career after the collapse of his green energy company, Lumi. As for Yasmin, it doesn’t feel like an exaggeration to say that her arc seems to have been inspired by Ghislaine Maxwell this time around. Death, too, hangs in the air at every turn, blatantly foreshadowed and meticulously hinted at, not least around a troubled, post-Priory Rishi (Sagar Radia). All this, and Industry also retains its stylish core – not least when Yasmin is allowed to go wild in the dressing-up box as Marie Antoinette for Henry’s 40th.View image in fullscreenShe’s gone wild in the dressing-up box! … Marisa Abela as Yasmin.Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf Productions/HBO/Simon RidgwayMuch of Industry remains centred on “rich people problems”, and things that may – in the grand scheme of things – feel trivial. But in digging deeper than it has previously dared into the tortured psyches of its leads, it manages to be more disquieting and more relatable than ever. You might notice that the soundtrack leans 80s this time around, and it doesn’t seem to be an accident: at its core, this series finds a societal rot that has been there for a long time, and draws out all of its horrors anew.Industry airs on BBC One on 12 January and will be on iPlayer. In the US it airs on HBO on 11 January. In Australia it will air on Binge.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewKit HaringtonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Macron made it clear that the goal of the force would be “to provide reassurance after the ceasefire” and noted it would be stationed “a long way behind the contact line”. There was no further clarity given immediately on the size or scope of the potential force.Macron said the coalition had also drawn up a plan to take on “ceasefire monitoring commitments under American leadership” as well as “long-term support to Ukrainian armed forces who are and will remain in the frontline of defence”.Answering a question about whether the US would come to the aid of European forces if they were attacked in Ukraine, Witkoff said the security guarantees were “as strong as anyone has ever seen” and were meant to “deter any further attacks […] if there are any attacks they’re meant to defend. And they will do both.”He added: “The president does not back down from his commitments, he is strong for the country of Ukraine and for a peace deal. We will be there for the Ukrainians in helping them to get to that final peace,” said Witkoff.Witkoff and Kushner were in Paris representing the US after the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who had been due to attend the talks, pulled out after Trump’s Venezuela attack.The talks in Paris came as Trump’s attention shifts from Ukraine to Venezuela, and as his repeated threats to annex Greenland arecausing friction in the US-Europe relationship. Several questions at a joint press conference following the signing revolved around whether Europe could trust US security guarantees at a time when Trump was threatening another Nato member with military action.Separately, US and Ukrainian delegations have been trying to sign a bilateral peace agreement for weeks, which the White House would then take to Russia. Zelenskyy and others from the Ukrainian delegation were due to meet separately with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday evening.However, Zelenskyy said the issue of Ukraine giving up territory remained a sticking point in the talks. “We have a number of ideas that could be helpful,” he said, adding that if the negotiating teams could not come to an agreement, he was ready to discuss directly with Trump.Witkoff agreed that territory “will be the most critical issue” in discussions. “Hopefully we’ll be able to come up with certain compromises,” he said.AlthoughTrump has repeatedly claimed that peace is just around the corner, there has been little sign that Moscow is ready for a deal, and Russian officials have repeatedly ruled out a temporary ceasefire or quick deal, saying they want a comprehensive settlement that addresses what they claim are the “root causes” of the conflict.The Kremlin has also said it will categorically oppose any Nato soldiers being based on Ukrainian soil as part of any deal, and as Moscow appears to be content with continuing fighting for now, the prospect of a negotiated deal followed by a subsequent force deployment seems unlikely at least in the short term.Starmer ackowledged that reality in his comments on Tuesday. “We are closer to [peace] than ever but of course the hardest yards are still ahead,” he said. “We can only get to a peace deal if Putin is ready to make compromises. Putin is not showing he is ready for peace,” he added.The Paris meeting gathered an impressive roster of world leaders, with 27 heads of state or government coming to Paris for the talks. There were also a series of meetings on the sidelines of the summit, including of French, British, Ukrainian and Nato military chiefs.Italy’s Georgia Meloni and Poland’s Donald Tusk said after the talks that their nations would not contribute troops to any mission to Ukraine. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said German troops could contribute to a force, but would be based in neighbouring countries, not inside Ukraine.Over the weekend, Zelenskyy said he feared that “not everyone is ready” to commit forces to Ukraine, and conceded that intelligence sharing and weapons transfers were also crucial modes of support. However, he said British and French commitments to deploy forces would be essential for any security guarantees to have meaning.“Speaking frankly as president, even the very existence of the coalition depends on whether certain countries are ready to step up their presence,” he said. “If they are not ready at all, then it is not really a ‘coalition of the willing.’”Explore more on these topicsUkraineFranceForeign policyRussiaEmmanuel MacronKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

It would, she said, be the end of “everything”.That was followed by an intense diplomatic effort, which led to the joint European leaders’ statement in support of Copenhagen, released before the international summit in Paris discussing security guarantees for Ukraine.The European leaders emphasised that security in the Arctic had to be achieved collectively with Nato allies, rather than by the US seizing control of another Nato member’s territory.“Nato has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European allies are stepping up,” the statement said. “We and many other allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.”Denmark and Greenland asked to meet the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, urgently to “discuss the significant statement made by the United States about Greenland”, Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, wrote on social media.Lord Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, warned that if the US were to annex Greenland it would be disastrous for Nato, amounting to, “for all practical purposes, the end of an alliance which is based essentially on trust”.Security relationships such as the coalition of the willing in support of Ukraine, led by the UK and France and supported by Germany, would “take on a much greater significance alongside bilateral defence links with the US”.On Tuesday night, the White House said Trump and his team were discussing options for acquiring Greenland and thatusing the US military for this was “always an option”.“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region.“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” the White House said in a statement in response to queries from Reuters.Earlier, Miller had suggested that Denmark does not have a right to the Arctic territory, which is a former Danish colony. Copenhagen continues to control Greenland’s foreign and security policy.US attack on Greenland would mean end of Nato, says Danish PMRead moreAsked whether military action against Greenland was off the table, he incorrectly stated that its population was 30,000 when in fact it is 57,000, saying: “What do you mean, military action against Greenland? Greenland has a population of 30,000 people.“The real question is what right does Denmark have to assert control over Greenland? What is the basis of their territorial claim? What is their basis of having Greenland as a colony of Denmark?”Map centred on the north pole, with Greenland, the US, Russia and China highlightedThere was, he said, “no need to even think or talk about” a military operation in Greenland, adding: “Nobody is going to fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland. That doesn’t make any sense.”Miller’s interview was conducted after his wife, the rightwing podcaster Katie Miller, posted a map on X of Greenland draped in a US flag with the caption “SOON”.But late on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported US secretary of state Marco Rubio as downplaying the possibility of military action, saying Trump still intended to buy Greenland.3:55Denmark, Greenland push back on Trump remarks, say Greenland not for conquest - videoNaaja H Nathanielsen, the Greenlandic minister for business, mineral resources, energy, justice and gender equality, told the Guardian: “The people of Greenland take this potential threat very hard and are anxious and afraid.”Greenland long been a “good American ally”, Nathanielsen said, but this “does not transfer into an acceptance of – or interest in – becoming Americans”.She added: “We are very few, but we are a people in our own right and insist that we are the ones to decide the future of Greenland.”Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, also made a strong statement in which he urged Trump to give up his “fantasies about annexation” and accused the US of “completely and utterly unacceptable” rhetoric. “Enough is enough,” he said.View image in fullscreenJens-Frederik Nielsen, the prime minister of Greenland.Photograph: Oscar Scott Carl/ReutersInuit people are understood to have lived in Greenland since as early as 2500 BCE. Modern colonisation began in 1721, when Hans Egede arrived, acting with the support of what was then Denmark-Norway. It remained a colony until 1953, when it became part of the kingdom of Denmark.During the second world war, when Denmark was occupied by Germany, Greenland was occupied by the US and returned to Denmark in 1945. The US has had a military base in Greenland, which is important for its ballistic missile early warning system, at Pituffik (previously Thule) since the cold war.In recent years there has been growing support for Greenlandic independence, particularly after revelations about Denmark’s treatment of Greenlandic people – includingthe IUD scandal– during and since colonial rule.But amid the spectre of Trump’s threat, Greenland in March formed a new four-party coalition government in a show of national unity, with the first page of the coalition agreement stating: “Greenland belongs to us.”Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The number of deaths has declined since the 1970s but that improvement slowed around 2010, with 22 European countries making better progress than the UK since then, according to the Department for Transport.The government will consult on lowering the drink-drive limit in England and Wales, which has remained unchanged since 1967 and is the highest in Europe, at 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. It could be cut to 22 micrograms, in line with the limit in Scotland since 2014.Tory transport culture wars risked making roads less safe, says ministerRead moreConvicted drink-drive offenders could be forced to use an “alcolock” to be allowed to drive again – a device that only allows a vehicle to start when the driver passes a breath test. Suspected drink- or drug-driving offenders could have their licenses suspended pending confirmation of roadside tests to prevent further accidents before they are convicted or cleared.Fines will be doubled for uninsured drivers, while penalty points will be incurred for not wearing a seatbelt, on top of the current fines.Young and new drivers could be required to undertake a three-to-six-month minimum learning period to allow them to develop skills in varied conditions such as night driving, adverse weather and heavy traffic.Meanwhile, as the number of older drivers increases in line withthe ageing population, the government will propose mandatory eyesight exams for the over-70s every three years, as well as looking at options for cognitive testing.New vehicles will also need to have autonomous emergency braking (AEB), among 18 safety technologies that are now widely available in cars and mandatory in Europe, but not yet in Britain. AEB automatically slows a vehicle when sensors detect an impending collision.The change will be known as Dev’s law, in memory of the eight-year-old son of Meera Naran MBE,who has campaigned to make such safety technology mandatorysince Dev’s death in a motorway collision in 2018.Ministers will also seek to amend international regulations to ensure crash testing takes account of the effects on different types of passengers, rather than using a crash test dummybased on a 75kg man.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “Every life lost on our roads is a tragedy that devastates families and communities. For too long, progress on road safety has stalled. This strategy marks a turning point.“We are taking decisive action to make our roads safer for everyone, from new drivers taking their first lessons to older motorists wanting to maintain their independence.UK steps up review of headlight glare as drivers complain of being dazzledRead more“The measures we are announcing today will save thousands of lives over the coming decade.”Motoring organisations welcomed the moves. Edmund King, president of the AA, said it was “a positively radical reframing of road safety which is long overdue”.Nicholas Lyes, a director at the road safety charity IAM RoadSmart, said the strategy came after “a lost decade in terms of reducing the number of killed and seriously injured on the roads”.He added: “We’re also pleased to see action being taken on drug-driving, which is a growing menace, and by giving police additional powers to take action against those caught at the roadside, it will serve notice that such dangerous behaviours will not be tolerated.”RAC road safety spokesperson Rod Dennis said: “Britain might have some of the safest roads by international standards, but on average four people are still killed and 76 seriously injured every single day.”He said the reintroduction of targets for reducing deaths was positive, and the strategy addressed many areas of concern, adding: “What we need now is for it to quickly evolve into a set of concrete actions that make the roads safer for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsRoad safetyRoad transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.xAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and hascontinually drawn criticismfor generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.Grok AI still being used to digitally undress women and children despite suspension pledgeRead moreOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users onXrequesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.Some of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, butcontinued to generate sexualized images of childrenin the ensuing days.xAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build outenormous data centersin Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.French ministers reportedGrok’s output to prosecutorson Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, alsocondemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesdayas “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.The company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyElon MuskXAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

Starmer said a relentless focus on the cost of living would meanLabourcould win the next election, though the prime minister’s new year plan has already been derailed by the need to respond to Donald Trump’s raid on Venezuela and threats towards Greenland.Starmer, who spent the final months of last year dogged by leadership speculation, said he had strong faith in his cabinet and he would “relish” the fight against Reform.The latest YouGov poll put the Conservatives ahead of Labour for the first time since the general election, both of them behind Reform, with Labour on just 17%.Ministers saw a presentation that urged them not to panic about Labour’s dismal poll ratings, likening them to the plummeting popularity of previous governments after taking office.But the presentation did not include direct comparisons of previous governments with the current government, according to sources. Starmer’s ratings are unprecedentedly low for a new administration, partly because of the effect of a new party dominating the polls.Starmer said No 10 strategists were looking closely at the re-elections of centre-left governments in Norway, Canada and Australia and how they revived their fortunes by focusing on the cost of living, though Trump’s election was a key factor in the latter two.The prime minister’s visit to Reading on Monday, which was aimed at highlighting frozen bus and rail fares, was dominated by questions over the future of Greenland and the abduction of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, who has been indicted in New York since his capture by US troops.Starmer – who travelled to Paris on Tuesday to attend a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” on Ukraine – told his cabinet that the government had to keep a tight domestic focus.“A Labour government renewing the country or a Reform movement that feeds on grievance, decline and division,” he said. “They want a weaker state, they want to inject bile into our communities, they want to appease Putin. This is the fight of our political lives and one that we must relish.“I do not underestimate the scale of the task. But I have no doubt about this team. Governments do not lose because polls go down. They lose when they lose belief or nerve. We will do neither.”Starmer will try to bring focus back to the government’s actions on the cost of living with another UK visit on Thursday after legislation is introduced to end the two-child benefit cap, a key ask of Labour MPs and a measure that will bring almost half a million children out of poverty.The new Labour deputy leader,Lucy Powell, attended cabinet, saying she was looking forward to “helping to tell the story of whose side we are on”.Powell told MPs on Monday night that the party would switch to an“incumbency first”model to protect MPs at the next election rather than targeting seats and would support MPs to become “leaders in their communities” and learn how to benefit politically from changes made by the government, for which MPs have so far gained little credit.She also told MPs in the first parliamentary Labour party meeting of the year that they needed to stop infighting amid continued discontent with Starmer’s leadership.MPs will be offered workshops by organisers in Labour HQ on how to take credit for improvements in the local area or for policies directly helping constituents that have been implemented by the Labour government, including frozen rail fares, local community and high street funding and the warm home discount extension.“It’s a big switch organisationally and politically,” a Labour source said. “There’s tools and training the party is providing but Lucy and Anna Turley [the Labour party chair] are leading some political work about what else is needed and how MPs can support and share best practice.”Powell told the PLP meeting that the government needed to speak more directly about its achievements and said “dark forces” did not want a Labour administration to succeed.“We’ve got a big argument to make and win. That Labour is on the side of ordinary people addressing the cost of living crisis, rewiring the country in the interests of the many not the few, taking on the vested interests, holding the powerful to account,” she said.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerMorgan McSweeneyLucy PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

The local authority warned there was a “good chance” some rural communities would be cut off and there could be power cuts.View image in fullscreenA snowplough clears a road in Alford, Aberdeenshire.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesThe Met Office has extended a yellow warning for ice across most of England,Walesand southern Scotland until 10am on Wednesday, with a similar yellow warning for Northern Ireland until 11am.A yellow warning means some disruption is possible, such as travel delays, but many people can continue with their daily routine, according to the Met Office.There is a yellow warning for snow and ice in place until midnight on Wednesday for the rest of northern Scotland, where up to 20cm of fresh snow is expected in some areas, with strong winds causing drifting.Cold snap grips UK and Europe – in picturesRead moreStorm Goretti is expected to bring disruption in south-west England, with a yellow warning for strong winds in place for Cornwall, Devon and the Isles of Scilly from 3pm on Thursday until just before midnight.View image in fullscreenA snow-covered golf course and residential properties on the outskirts of Glossop, Derbyshire.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Met Office has issued snow warnings for large parts of England and Wales from 6pm on Thursday until midday on Friday when a deep area of low pressure will move across the south of the UK bringing rain, snow and strong winds.The severe wintry weather will be brought by the strong winds over northern France, named Storm Goretti by the country’s official forecaster, Météo France.On Tuesday, seven midweek football matches were cancelled in Scotland because of the freezing conditions.Police Scotland said the impact of the snow was likely to be felt over the next few days in the north and north-east of Scotland, and urged people to follow travel advice.Aberdeenshire council said it anticipated a “prolonged period of significant impacts” with many remote villages already cut off. The council has brought in additional equipment, including snow blowers, to clear routes, while 4,000 tonnes of salt reserves to help grit roads are arriving by boat.Hundreds of thousands of households around the country are receiving a £25 cold weather payment to help heating costs during the drop in temperature. Those living in Cumbria and Northumberland could receive a £50 payout. Those who are deemed vulnerable, including pensioners, are eligible to receive the payments when the temperature drops below freezing.The UK Health Security Agency has further extended an amber cold health alert for all regions of England until Sunday.View image in fullscreenPeople walking in Little Venice near Paddington, London.Photograph: James Manning/PAHarriet Cross, the Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan in the north-east of Scotland, praised more than 100 “heroic” farmers and contractors for rescuing drivers, clearing roads and helping to transport supplies in blizzard conditions.Cross, whose constituency is one of the worst affected by the treacherous weather, said: “Our heroic farmers have gone above and beyond to help stranded travellers to navigate through the treacherous conditions.”“Not only have they been out rescuing drivers and clearing roads, but our farmers have also been working round the clock caring for their own livestock as they battle against some of the worst snowfall in recent memory.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandEnglandWalesSnowWinternewsShareReuse this content"

Naran’s father was driving Dev to visit his older brother, Neel, who was being treated in hospital.Returning on the M6, the car halted on what would been a hard shoulder, had it not been converted for use as part ofa smart motorway; a lorry ploughed into them, killing Dev. His grandfather died a few years later, suffering from serious injuries sustained in the crash. Neel did not speak or walk for some time after receiving the news, and died in 2024.Having first campaigned for changes to smart motorways, Naran pushed for action to make all vehicles safer, using technology such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB), where alerts sound and then the brakes are applied automatically if the driver does not slow in time to avert a crash.She said: “Had the lorry involved had autonomous braking, that collision could potentially have been avoided completely and Dev could have walked out and come home to me that night.“So Dev’s Law and AEB really has come from that – my whole campaign has been looking at every element, every factor that’s been involved in Dev’s death. That was a major factor involved and I truly think it’s a life-saving-based technology.”Different types of driver-assistance technology, including AEB, lane-keeping and other alerts, are features of most new cars but are not mandatory in Britain,Naran, 42, a senior lecturer in clinical pharmacy at Leicester’s De Montfort University, has brought her professional skills to the campaign and stressed the importance of consultation and “separating the emotion from the evidence”.View image in fullscreenMeera said Dev (left) had been ‘best friend and cheerleader’ to his older brother, Neel.Photograph: Meera NaranLocal transport minister Lilian Greenwood said the strategy was “built on evidence, but it is driven by the voices of those who have experienced the devastating consequences of road collisions first-hand”.She paid tribute to Naran for working “tirelessly in memory of her son Dev to champion life-saving technologies”.Naran said Dev had been “best friend and cheerleader” to his older brother Neel, who had complex health needs including epilepsy. “When he found Dev was gone, he slowly gave up.”She said her focus had become “waking up every day and using that grief to make something far more important than us and see that change happen”.She added: “For this government to look at this and not only give their word that they’re going to make that change but to actually see that they have included it in the strategy is really important.“Campaigning through both their losses has been unbelievably difficult but it was bigger than my grief, it was bigger than me, it was bigger than their story.“For me it’s going to be a lifelong campaign to reduce road deaths. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.”Explore more on these topicsTransport policyTransportMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

Brace yourself for handwriting analysis, Jekyll and Hyde vibes and crucial slips of the tongueMichael HoganTue 6 Jan 2026 08.13 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 08.15 ESTShareIt’s the question on everyone’s lips. No, not “Why am I half a stone heavier and in dire need of an afternoon nap?” but “Who is the Secret Traitor?” And thankfully, we’re about to find out.The curveball new role has proved a gamechanging twist in BBC mega hitThe Traitors. Swishing around Ardross Castle in a red cloak, as opposed to the Traitors’ familiar green, the Secret Traitor’s identity is unknown to contestants and viewers alike. It hasn’t just stoked paranoia in the Traitors’ turret but enabled the audience to play along at home, turning us all into armchair sleuths as we try to crack the case.Now, thanks to the early banishment of Hugo the treacherous teddy bear, they’re to be unmasked – probably sooner than producers planned. Saturday’s episode ended on an agonising cliffhanger, with the Traitors about to meet their mysterious puppet master for the first time. On Wednesday evening’s edition, we’ll see who lurks beneath that scarlet hood.Here are the 10 top theories about who could be knock-knock-knocking on the conclave door …The Jekyll and Hyde theory: AmandaView image in fullscreen‘She has the skill set’ … Amanda alongside Jade in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PABookies’ early favourite for the Secret Traitor role was retired police detective Amanda. It’s easy to see why. She says she learned about being deceptive from the criminals she encountered during her career and was keen to be a Traitor: “I’ve tracked down baddies all my life. Now it’s time to be one.” Who better to go undercover? Amanda has mentioned her training in covert techniques and intelligence policing, so she has the skill set.She has even confessed: “My Jekyll and Hyde personality is my secret weapon.” Traitor Rachel fears her, describing Amanda as “dangerously smart”. Remember her uncharacteristic indecision during the throne-carrying mission? This could have been Amanda second-guessing herself and letting the mask slip. When Hugo was outmanoeuvred, his parting shot was to admit that Amanda was “better at this game than me”. This sowed seeds of doubt that it was Traitor-on-Traitor betrayal. Had he rumbled her at the last moment?The handwriting theory: Jade, Roxy, Fiona or JessieOne of the few tangible clues isthose scrolls left in the turret, listing options for the next murder. Maybe we shouldn’t read too much into them – they could disguise their handwriting or the names could be rewritten by a member of the production team – but compare them to the round table slates and your spidey senses might start tingling.The small, neat cursive looks fluid and feminine, probably right-handed, perhaps even slightly old-fashioned. The closest matches on the chalkboards appear to be those belonging to Roxy, Fiona and Jessie. However, the distinctive “J” on James’s name on the scroll resembled Jade’s banishment vote for Judy, also bringing her into the equation.The slip-of-the-tongue theory: EllieView image in fullscreen‘Very bright’ … Ellie in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherrySocial media lit up on Saturday with fans convinced that Ellie had accidentally given herself away. During herpost-round table interview, the 33-year-old said of her low-key approach: “Being more reserved can benefit you at the beginning but as the game goes on, people will question if you’re just sitting and watching as a kind of secret traitor.” Sound the klaxon! Alert the authorities!Was her wording just a coincidence? The Traitors had already floated Ellie’s name because she’s “very bright” but they don’t know the half of it. As the first psychologist to take part in the UK series – although she’s wisely hidden this info – who better to master the mind games of being a double agent?The library theory: JessieView image in fullscreen‘Slipped under most radars’ … Jessie in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAThe night before Royal Navy veteran Ben was murdered, he voiced his doubts about Ross and warned: “I’ll be up for murder if any of youse are a Traitor.” His name duly appeared on the hitlist and he was slain. In a rare occurrence, the Faithful actually followed the evidence and worked out who’d been within earshot in the library: namely Ellie, Jessie, James, Fiona and Stephen.The latter is a Traitor. James has been shortlisted himself. This leaves the three women in the frame – including Hull hairdresser Jessie, who has slipped under most radars. Hugo briefly wondered if Jessie was the Secret Traitor because she was so relaxed before bedtime. She admits people tend to underestimate her but insists: “I have it in me to be brutal and backstab.”Because of her stammer,Jessie might have felt more comfortable working alone. Nobody would see this one coming.The wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing theory: FionaView image in fullscreen‘Like Jane Tennison in a Miss Marple mask’… Fiona alongside Adam in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAA Welsh woman dialling up her ditzy side as the ultimate disguise? It’s a description that applied to Traitor Amanda in series one and might now fit Fiona. The Swansea diva has admitted “playing up to being dotty and clueless” before ominously warning: “Never underestimate a woman of a certain age.” Witness the way she teamed up with Amanda and Harriet to take down Hugo at the last round table. It was like Jane Tennison in a Miss Marple mask.There are scraps of circumstantial evidence.Not only is Fiona’s handwriting in the right ballpark but she was among the library trio present when Ben put a target on his own back. She “wasn’t interested” in getting an immunity shield during the portrait gallery mission. Rachel is starting to suspect Fiona as the Secret Traitor. So are some viewers. She jokingly mentioned owning a red bathing suit but does she have a cloak to match?The female theory: JadeSince hostClaudia Winklemanrightly took series two’s Traitors to task for exclusively recruiting males, producers have been scrupulously gender-aware. Because the three Traitors already selected – Stephen, Rachel and the now departed Hugo – were male-skewed, chances are the fourth choice would be female to restore equality. Indeed, when the Secret Traitor provided an all-male murder shortlist last week, the turret trio immediately agreed it must be a woman.This adds PhD student Jade to the list of potentials. She’s smart and strategic enough. She plays “a lot of social deception video games which are similar to The Traitors” and fancied being “a shark among the sheep”. Could she be the new Cat Burns?The family tree theory: RoxyView image in fullscreenIs Fiona as ditsy as she makes out, and will Roxy wreak revenge on her mum’s banishment?Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAThe nerve-jangling covert mission given to the surviving Traitors last time was to leave bloodied fingerprints on the framed family tree in the castle lobby, nominating their fellow players for murder. Complete it successfully and they’d get to meet the Secret Traitor at last. But was the family tree’s starring role a clue?Roxy and Judy came into the castle as secret mother-and-daughter. We’ve had covert parent-and-child relationships before (see Diane and Ross in series two) but one of the women being the Secret Traitor would add another level of intrigue. Roxy looked daggers at gardener James when he mentioned Judy as a potential Traitor, then was quick to put a coffin in his grave during the opening mission. His name duly appeared on the first shortlist. Having watched her adoptive mum fall victim to this year’s first banishment, there would be a certain satisfaction in seeing Roxy wreak revenge.The crime queen theory: HarrietView image in fullscreen‘She could play both sides’ … Harriet alongside Jack in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAA former criminal barristerturned author of psychological thrillers, the role of Secret Traitor might have been built for bestselling writer Harriet. She “spends her life making up horrible ways to dispatch people on the page”, so was excited to “either commit murder or track down killers in the game”. As the Secret Traitor, she could play both sides. On the latest episode of companion show Uncloaked, eagle-eyed viewers spotted four framed photos on the wall: Hugo, Rachel, Stephen and Harriet. Why was she up there with three known Traitors?The logic theory: everyone elseOf those not yet mentioned, we can discount anyone who’s appeared on the hitlists, which rules out Maz, James and Reece. This leaves half a dozen of the younger males. Cocksure Sam has hogged camera time and flung accusations around. Rachel surmised that his boldness was a sign that Sam could be the Secret Traitor.The remaining possibilities are builder Adam, young pup Faraaz, personal trainer Jack, creative director Matt or thebeleaguered Ross.Although let’s face it, any of those would be disappointing reveals with shades of bungling Buckells from Line of Duty.The wild card theory: Claudia or AlanIt’s highly unlikely the Secret Traitor would come from outside the parameters of the game but hey, rules are there to be broken. Presenter Winkleman is already the game’s string-puller. Could she have extended her remit to include underhand treachery? The new-look cloak would coordinate nicely with her trademark red fingerless gloves.Another left-field candidate would be chaotic comic Alan Carr, winner of the inaugural celebrity series. The reigning champion starred in the first teaser trailer for this civilian series, handing over his cloak and telling successors: “You’ll never guess what Claudia’s got planned this time. It’s big. Good luck. You’re definitely going to need it.” A clue? Probably not but it would be enjoyably bananas if it was.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before Alan Ayckbourn’s disconsolate housewife here, there was her superlative Shirley Valentine, navigating middle-age wobbles by setting sail for the island of her dreams, and John Cassavetes’ Myrtle, in Opening Night, more brittle and inebriated in her mid-life malaise.Susan is, like Shirley and Myrtle, in a mentally fragile state. That is partly because she has taken a knock to the head with a garden rake,which has triggered an alternate, hallucinatory world. This, at first, seems like a refuge from the emotionally deadened real life she shares with vicar-husband, Gerald (Tim McMullan), dour sister-in-law, Muriel (Louise Brealey), and rebel son, Rick (Taylor Uttley) who has refused to speak to his parents since joining a sect in Hemel Hempstead.Although this play premiered in 1985, Susan is in many ways the straitjacketed 1950s housewife, albeit drawn in a darkly comic vein. Smith plays the part with whimsical daintiness and subtlety, throwing out mischievous or slighted looks. You feel her vulnerability, especially in the first act, but the emotional connection lessens as the drama becomes more high-pitched and surreal. Smith remains understated, which is perhaps judicious as the tone edges into melodrama and supernatural farce.Susan’s imaginary world features a picture perfect family, from a sexually hungry husband, Andy (Sule Rimi), to adoring daughter, Lucy (Safia Oakley-Green) and brother, Tony (Chris Jenks). Or so it seems at the outset. Under the direction of Michael Longhurst, they have something of Oz about them, with a too garish colour scheme to their clothes (glaring pinks, purples and yellows) and a distantly anxious soundtrack (designed by Paul Arditti). Meanwhile, Romesh Ranganathan, as nervy doctor Bill is unusual casting but brings the comedy of this nerdy sidekick to life.The tone varies from that of a retro comedy – Bill is dressed in 1970s browns and mustards while Muriel wears a housecoat reminiscent of the same era – to surreal nightmare. The vacillations create a kind of inconsistency that might be deliberate. The herb garden, in which Susan originally faints, opens up to a hyper-real buccolia, designed by Soutra Gilmour, and colours bleed against a wavering backdrop (video design by Andrzej Goulding) as reality and fantasy converges.Susan is not the only one stuck in a world of make-believe: Muriel thinks her dead husband visits her, Rick’s sect has evidently taken control of his reality while Gerald is living his own writerly fantasy as he works on a 60-page pamphlet about the history of his parish.Revived in its 40thanniversary year, the play stands the test of time for its originality and boldness: this is a critique of the emptiness of married life and the desperation that a woman feels inside it that takes us from the domestic drudge to high-wire supernaturalism. When it works, it is unnerving. The imaginary family is creepy for its wooden perfection and performative warmth. You feel the chill building as they turn into nightmarish tormentors.It is a play worth reviving too at a time when the real world looks so bleak. What is the alternative to facing up to it? Seeking recourse in fantasy, only to find that this is not a panacea but another version of the same nightmare of real life?Woman in Mindplays in the West End until 28 February after which the production will play the Sunderland Empire from 4-7 March and Theatre Royal, Glasgow, from 10-14 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSheridan SmithreviewsShareReuse this content"

Getting up in the dark decouples our life from our circadian rhythm (our body clock), with bodily processes such as cognition and metabolism put to work before they’re fully prepped.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Thank heavens, then, for sunrise alarm clocks. These “dawn simulation” devices glow with gradually intensifying brightness as your wake-up time approaches, kickstarting your circadian rhythm before you get out of bed. For many users, this results in a happier, healthier start to the day.Not all sunrise alarm clocks are made equal – for instance, only some are bright enough to be medically certified as light-therapy devices forSad(seasonal affective disorder) and other disorders. We’ve indicated the two alarms that have this certification in their specs below.I awoke with 10 of the best-rated wake-up lights from Lumie, Beurer, Philips, Dreamegg, Momcozy, Blueair and Lexon to find out which would make the most difference to my mornings. As a lifelong reluctant riser, I’ve found the experience of testing these devices a gamechanger – in fact, I’m now using one daily.

I’ve often felt lousy first thing, after waking up to a minutes-long medley of smartphone alarms.When, at last, I drag myself out of bed, I frequently spend the day reviewing all kinds of gadgets, from Sad lamps to electric heaters. It’s a freelance job I’ve been privileged to do since 2017 – and as we tumbled dimly into 2025, the Filter gave me one of my most quietly life-improving assignments yet: reviewing sunrise alarm clocks. I tested three additional models in winter 2025/26, and one of these has emerged as my favourite of all.The extent to which these gadgets have improved my mornings has surprised me – although it was greater in some cases than others. Frankly, I’d like other groggy wakers to feel the same benefit, and my reviews are written and ranked with this in mind.Some brands did not want the sunrise alarm clocks I sourced for testing back, so those will be donated for fundraising toCat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach sunrise alarm clock, including the Beurer Wake-up Light WL50 (pictured), was tested over at least two nights.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianThe only proper way to test a sunrise alarm clock is by using it to wake up each morning – so that’s exactly what I did.I used each model for at least two nights, testing out multiple light and alarm sound settings, and assessing the quality of wake-up for each device. I considered the brightness of each alarm, how close the glow felt to real sunlight, and the audio quality. Above all, I reflected on how lively and refreshed I felt after waking up with each one.Many sunrise alarm clocks also have a sundown function, so I used this where available too. I also tried using each sunrise alarm clock as a reading light, to help me finish the day – as well as start it – smartphone-free.Some sunrise alarm clocks go even further, with additional features such as app operability, multiple alarm profiles and mood lighting. To ensure a thorough review of each sunrise alarm clock, I played around with every possible customisation option and functionality.The best sunrise alarm clocks in 2026View image in fullscreenThe Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150, the Blueair Mini Restful sunrise clock air purifier and the Lexon Mina Sunrise.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianBest sunrise alarm clock overall:Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150LumieBodyclock Glow 150from£86.99£91.63 at Lumie£86.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperior sunrise simulation and pleasant alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveIt’s relatively expensive£91.63 at Lumie£86.99 at AmazonLumie is the brand that pioneered consumer-grade sunrise alarm clocks in the early 1990s, and that pedigree still shines through.Equipped with a comprehensive set of wake-up sounds and medical-grade sunrise simulation, the Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best sunrise alarm clock of the many I’ve tested. It comes at a premium price, but could pay dividends for your sleep cycle.Why we love itThe sunrise effect is among the most convincing I’ve experienced, rivalling the less fully featured (but slightly cheaper) Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which is reviewed below. It feels like waking to daylight, or emerging into a clearing after walking through dense woodland.I found this model easy to control and configure via the five buttons surrounding the digital display. All of the personalisations that really matter are available, including sunrise light intensity and duration.Crucially, there’s a great selection of alarm tones to choose between – not always the case with Lumie models – ranging from the wonderfully gentle to the brusquely rousing. I preferred “tropical birds” and “waves” to “beep” or “steam train”, although I enjoyed imagining a train enthusiast waking contentedly to the latter.It’s a shame that …there’s only one colour available: black (with a white lamp). This will suit some bedroom design schemes better than others.Certification:UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745 medical classificationModes:sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D12cmFeatures:light-sensitive auto-dimming displayBrightness settings:fiveSunrise duration:20, 30 or 45 minutesLumieBodyclock Glow 150from£86.99£91.63 at Lumie£86.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperior sunrise simulation and pleasant alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveIt’s relatively expensiveBest budget sunrise alarm:Momcozy Sunrise EchoMomcozySunrise Echo£47.99£47.99 at EbebekWhat we loveBroad selection of lilting alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveThe controls are a little fiddly£47.99 at EbebekThe clue’s in the name: the Momcozy Sunrise Echo comes primed with a selection of wake-up sounds intended specifically for mums, dads and their little ones. It’s also tough to topple, soft around the edges and weighs just 0.55kg.Why we love itI’m neither a parent nor a baby, but I can certainly hear the soothing quality in the Sunrise Echo’s 30-strong repertoire of wake-up sounds, which includes lullabies alongside the usual nature sounds and meditative drones. The sound quality is impressive, with plenty of mid-range frequencies and a touch of bass. It’s nicely balanced and not at all jarring.The Sunrise Echo creates a lilting light effect, rather than intensively light-therapising the sleeper as some higher-powered models do. It was easy to set up and customise the alarm using the well-labelled control buttons around the shoulder of the alarm clock. It was a little harder though, through a fug of sleepiness, to adjust the screen and light brightness via their respective dials on the rear of the device. Nonetheless, the Momcozy Sunrise Echo is an excellent, accessible option for users who don’t want a very bright wake-up.It’s a shame that …a few nice-to-have features are absent, including FM radio and multiple alarms.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D8.5cmFeatures:night light (seven colours), sleep aid sounds, digital clock display, adjustable sunrise durationBrightness settings:30Sunrise duration:30 minutesMomcozySunrise Echo£47.99£47.99 at EbebekWhat we loveBroad selection of lilting alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveThe controls are a little fiddlyBest sunrise alarm clock for heavy sleepers:Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100LumieBodyclock Spark 100from£88.20£88.49 at Healf£88.20 at AmazonWhat we loveOutstanding sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveLack of gentler alarm sounds£88.49 at Healf£88.20 at AmazonI woke up feeling great when I used the medical-grade Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which bathes the room in gradually intensifying, sun-like light for a set period before the alarm goes off.Why we love itThe device is supposed to realistically imitate the lightening shades of a sunrise – and it does so more convincingly than any other brand’s sunrise alarm clock. Depending on your chosen light intensity setting, it can get very bright.The Spark 100 also has a sunset feature that graduates through the same red, orange and white light colours used with the sunrise function, but in reverse order. After the sunset cycle, the light can either switch off entirely or remain in a gentle night-light mode, whichever you choose.Besides performing brilliantly as a wake-up light and sunset simulator, the Spark 100 is simply a nicely designed, well-made thing. I appreciated its soft-edged yet robust construction and handy features such as the cable organisation in the base. It’s a pleasure to have on the bedside table.It’s a shame that …the alarm tone sounds piercing at the higher three of its five volume levels. I found myself settling for a 2/5 – though very heavy sleepers may prefer (or even relish) the louder options.Certification:UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745 medical classificationModes:sunrise, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D12cmFeatures:tap to snooze, auto-dimming display, adjustable sunrise/sunset duration, adjustable digital display brightnessBrightness settings:fiveSunrise duration:30 minutesLumieBodyclock Spark 100from£88.20£88.49 at Healf£88.20 at AmazonWhat we loveOutstanding sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveLack of gentler alarm soundsBest sunrise alarm for late-night reading:Philips SmartSleepPhilipsSmartSleepfrom£160.37£188.99 at Philips£160.37 at AmazonWhat we loveBeautiful design and very good sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveOne of the most expensive options£188.99 at Philips£160.37 at AmazonThis lamp soon felt like part of the furniture on my bedside table. In typical Philips fashion, it’s a good-quality, dependable product, with a middle-of-the-road design that won’t look out of place in many bedrooms.Why we love itSetup is incredibly slick – I was able to set my alarm time, sound and brightness by following the simple prompts on the device’s display, without having to consult the manual. Subsequently tweaking your alarm(s) takes a bit of practice, but you’ll master all the controls you need after a few days.The SmartSleep’s wake-up capabilities are impressive, combining brilliant light with a diverse choice of alarm sounds. It also has FM radio and 3.5mm auxiliary audio input options for the user who has tired of Alpine and gong bath soundscapes. There’s a 5V USB charging outlet at the rear of the lamp, too, which could free up a valuable bedside power socket.I loved using this model as a reading light, as well as a sunrise alarm. Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful, which helped me get to sleep after reading pulpy detective novels late at night. The light can be deactivated with a press.It’s a shame that …it costs such a lot. The SmartSleep has a hefty price to match its impressive performance.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sleep mode with sunset simulation, bedside lightFootprint:W22 x D12cmFeatures:FM radio, Aux audio input, “RelaxBreathe” breathing exercises, adjustable sunrise duration, snooze, up to two wake-up profiles (with separate alarms)Brightness settings:25Sunrise duration:20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 minutesPhilipsSmartSleepfrom£160.37£188.99 at Philips£160.37 at AmazonWhat we loveBeautiful design and very good sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveOne of the most expensive optionsBest mini sunrise alarm clock:Lexon Mina SunriseLexonMina Sunrisefrom£72.74£72.74 at FormAdore£80.16 at AmazonWhat we loveCute, chic designWhat we don’t loveAwkward controls£72.74 at FormAdore£80.16 at AmazonMy only general gripe with sunrise alarm clocks is that many of them are an aesthetic downgrade on a conventional bedside lamp – but this charming mini model from French brand Lexon is a stylish exception.Why we love itThe obvious draw here is the design, which comprises a cute, mushroom-shaped light and colourful metal base with a wraparound digital display. It fits very neatly on to a small or well-utilised bedside table.The sunrise light function roused me gently before the alarm tone (also gently rousing) sounded, and I got up feeling alert. Even though this isn’t a very bright light, it evidently did the trick, and it was suitable for bedtime reading, too.Depending on the model, you can choose from nine orfive alarm tones, all of which sound pleasantly full and rich. These include birdsong and water sounds, as well as some loud, piercing alarms that will suit particularly heavy sleepers.Beautifully finished and stoutly made, the Mina Sunrise is a cut above the rest in terms of build quality.It’s a shame that …the control buttons are on the base, and can’t be seen in the dark without a secondary light source such as a smartphone torch.

I’m not pulling your leg, you might say, it’s all thanks to the Lumie Sunrise Alarm’s “kittens purring” alarm tone, which sits sweetly alongside four other natural sounds, including goats bleating and birdsong.Why we love itIn all seriousness, this is an excellent sunrise alarm clock, and it comes at a standout price. Its sunrise light subtly brightens during the minutes leading up to your chosen alarm time, producing a lovely awakening that really did remind me of natural light.I found it easy enough to set the Sunrise Alarm’s time and alarm, although pressing some of the buttons can be fiddly. Do keep the instruction manual handy, as there are lots of options and buttons to get your head around.It’s a shame that …it lacks a little bedside table appeal.

That’s a rare feature in any sunrise alarm clock – let alone in such a reasonably priced model.Why we love itThe sunrise mode itself is gentle yet effective, and it’s easy to activate the device as a reading light with a simple, groggy tap. I really liked the alarm sounds you get with the WL50 too – which is just as well, as there are only two options.Perhaps that narrow choice of alarm tones sounds a little stingy, but it seems less so when you explore the WL50’s alternative audio options. It doubles up as an FM radio, with space to save up to 30 station presets, which you can listen to throughout the day or use as a livelier alternative to an alarm tone. Bluetooth connectivity and an AUX input expand your listening options further.Curiously, this sunrise alarm clock can be unplugged (when fully charged) and used on the go for up to three hours. It’s hard to imagine a situation wherein this would be useful, but I appreciate the gesture.It’s a shame that …the sound quality isn’t great (but it’s good enough for the half-awake).Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sunset simulation, bedside light, radio/speakerFootprint:W11 x D11cmFeatures:FM radio, AUX audio input, Bluetooth audio, portable use (up to three hours), LED mood lightBrightness settings:adjustableSunrise duration:10, 20 or 30 minutesBeurerWake-up Light WL50from£48.95£55.99 at John Lewis£48.95 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s packed with featuresWhat we don’t loveNot all the features are usefulThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘A beautifully designed alarm clock’: the Dreamegg Sunrise 1.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianBlueair Mini Restful sunrise clock air purifierBlueairMini Restful sunrise clock air purifier£134£134 at BlueairWhat we loveInnovative sunrise and air purification comboWhat we don’t loveToo bulky for the bedside table£134 at BlueairBest for:an air-purifying sunrise alarm clockMost of us spend around a third of our time in bed, so a sunrise alarm clock that also purifies your bedroom air seems like a good idea. This model, the Blueair Mini Restful, is heralded as the world’s first.By sunrise alarm clock standards, it isn’t really mini. I found myself resting it on the floor, where I could see the digital display on the top, rather than putting it on my bedside table.The sunrise function proved effective, waking me reliably with warm, increasingly bright light before the alarm sounded. As for the purification, the Mini Restful certainly made my air feel fresher after a windowsill-sanding session had kicked up untold volumes of dust. The fan works exceptionally quietly, although I still preferred to run it only during the daytime (this can be automated via the Blueair app’s schedule feature).It didn’t make the final cut because …the sunrise alarm feature is only accessible via the Blueair app, and I feel that users should have the option to activate it manually. With that said, the app is a pleasure to use.Certification:none;modes:night light, sunrise alarm;footprint:W17 x D17cm;features:air purification, app control, alarm schedule;brightness settings:scale of 0-100%;sunrise duration:15-30 minutesBlueairMini Restful sunrise clock air purifier£134£134 at BlueairWhat we loveInnovative sunrise and air purification comboWhat we don’t loveToo bulky for the bedside tableDreamegg Sunrise 1DreameggSunrise 1from£79.99£79.99 at Dreamegg£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNicely pairs a textured front with mellow mood lightingWhat we don’t loveRelatively dim light£79.99 at Dreamegg£79.99 at AmazonBest for:soothing sleep soundsThis compact, great-looking device offers something different, with a selection of 29 ambient sounds that can be used as white noise to help you fall asleep. There are also five options for rousing you in the morning, including birdsong, a campfire crackling and, my favourite, waves breaking on a shore. For me, perhaps the only issue with this approach was that the sounds did a better job of putting me to sleep than they did of waking me up.The Sunrise 1 is a beautifully designed alarm clock, with a softly textured front and foolproof dimmer controls on either side to adjust the light level and digital display brightness. Reluctant risers will be pleased to note there’s a prominent snooze button at the top of the device – though, personally, I’ve rarely felt the need to use this feature while testing sunrise alarm clocks.It didn’t make the final cut because …its light is a little too dim for my taste.Certification:none;modes:sunrise alarm, white noise/sleep sounds, bedside light;footprint:W15 x D7.3cm;features:sleep sound timer, nine light colours, five wake-up sounds;brightness settings:adjustable;sunrise duration:5 to 60 minutesDreameggSunrise 1from£79.99£79.99 at Dreamegg£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNicely pairs a textured front with mellow mood lightingWhat we don’t loveRelatively dim lightHatch Restore 2HatchRestore 2£222.82£222.82 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent sound libraryWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive£222.82 at AmazonBest for:customisation and smartphone connectivityIn some respects, this premium sunrise alarm clock has an edge over its competitors.

Sunrise alarm clocks tend to be far less bright than the average Sad lamp. With that said, the effect of light on our circadian rhythms has been shown to peak around the onset of dawn and early in the morning – so a mellow sunrise alarm may provide disproportionate benefits.If you’ve been diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder and are looking for a light therapy device, it’s best to ask your GP which product to use and how to get the most benefit. Sunrise alarm clocks that are classified as medical devices (indicated below each product above) are more likely to suit users seeking a therapeutic effect than models with no medical certifications.Why does it benefit us to wake with the sun?Getting up in the dark can feel awful, which makes a lot of sense because our bodies require light to wake up properly.Humans are diurnal, which means we’ve evolved to be more wakeful, energetic and capable of chasing mammoths over vast distances during daytime. When the brain recognises increasing light at dawn, it sends signals around other regions of the brain and to other organs to calibrate bodily processes including temperature regulation, hormone secretion and metabolism. And when darkness falls, the brain prepares us for sleep – a helpful effect that many of us compromise by looking at bright smartphone or laptop screens.These effects, which repeat every 24 hours, are our circadian rhythms. That is derived from the Latin wordscirca(approximately) anddiem(day), meaning around a day.So, the sun is the original and best alarm clock – activating our minds and bodies with light, rather than startling us awake with sound. Think of your sunrise alarm as a plucky stand-in to rely upon during the star’s shorter winter shifts.In the market for some new bed linen?

A No 1 New York Times bestseller author, he writes pulpy thrillers of the type you buy at the airport, consume feverishly poolside, and never take home.Coben has written 35 novels, and is 11 adaptations (eight of them English language) into a nine-year, 14-book adaptation deal with Netflix. These series share a tone, style, and even actors – in multiple shows, Spooks heart-throb Richard Armitage pops up like a bad penny.But despite their mass-market appeal, the adaptations are widely regarded as some of the worst telly around. They tend to be set in English suburbia, and usually involve a mysterious crime being ineptly investigated by a corrupt police force. Coben’s daughter is the scriptwriter for many of these adaptations, which suggests a disdain for realism runs in the family.And yet, I have a soft spot for these woeful shows. While the plots are often ludicrous twist-packed affairs, they provide a high camp, silly alternative to the pompous prestige TV we’ve grown accustomed to in recent years. Despite the heinous events going on – murders, domestic violence, people getting sex trafficked – the scariest thing in the world of a Harlan Coben adaptation is the acting.To me, that’s comforting. So if you find yourself at home on one of January’s many interminably cold evenings, longing for a piece of low art – a script that makes no sense, and acting that they would never teach at drama school – then look no further than one of the many Harlan Coben adaptations available on all good streaming services. They’re all bad – but some are worse than others.And I’ve watched them all.Here is my ranking.BadStay Close (2021, Netflix)View image in fullscreen‘Suburbia-gone-wrong’ … James Nesbitt in Stay Close.Photograph: Photo Credt: Vishal Sharma/Vishal SharmaWhat happens when you transplant an actor who played Hamlet in the West End into a Harlan Coben adaptation? Er … that’s Cush Jumbo’s dilemma in Stay Close, one of many set in the suburbia-gone-wrong oeuvre.Jumbo’s Megan left behind a life as an exotic dancer – and her lover, Richard Armitage (of course) – one mysterious night nearly 20 years ago to start a new life with a big house, three kids and a sensible brown bob. But it all comes crashing down when her past starts to rear its ugly head.So far, so conventional – bar two villainous assassins who look like CBeebies presenters and perform a synchronised dance to Creep by Radiohead (really) before murdering their victim with a pneumatic drill.After a slow start this one really heats up. If youcanhang on till episode eight, the twist is pretty good.Fool Me Once (2024, Netflix)View image in fullscreen‘Not to be messed with’ … Michelle Keegan as Maya Stern and Richard Armitage as Joe Burkett in Fool Me Once.Photograph: Matt Squire/NetflixProtagonist Maya Stern is not one to be messed with – and if you weren’t sure about that, why not read her nominatively deterministic name again.Stern by name, stern by nature, Maya (Michelle Keegan) is a former fighter pilot with a troubled past, dealing with the two recent tragic murders of her husband and sister.That is, until her (dead) husband appears on the nanny-cam … and Maya’s world is plunged into turmoil. Luckily for us, that means lots of screen time with dead hubby’s mummy, a deliciously viperous Joanna Lumley. She plays the matriarch of a big pharmaceutical company which – guess what – is really shady.Run Away (2026, Netflix)View image in fullscreen‘The perfect accompaniment to a global, earth-shattering hangover’ … Minnie Driver and James Nesbitt in Run Away.Photograph: Netflix/PACoben’s latest thriller, a collaboration with his frequent co-writer Danny Brocklehurst, dropped on New Year’s Day. It’s almost as if the schedulers knew it would be the perfect accompaniment to a global, earth-shattering hangover.This is classic Coben fare, televisual comfort food of the highest order: think missing daughters, private investigators, and more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at. But a decent cast, including Minnie Driver, James Nesbitt and Ruth Jones, elevates it above some other offerings.Safe (2018, Netflix)View image in fullscreen‘Far from prestige TV’ … Marc Warren in Safe.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixDexteractor Michael C Hall delivers one of the worst accents of modern times in this twisty tale, playing a normal British dad who DEFINITELY ISN’T secretly American.The plot hinges on a house party gone wrong, which sees two teenagers go missing – one of whom is the daughter of Hall’s surgeon Tom. But … how could this have happened in a gated community, that should be so very “safe”? Turns out, bent coppers aren’t just forLine of Duty.Rest assured, though – this is far from prestige TV. The plot is so forgettable, I watched this when it came out, forgot all about it, and only realised I’d seen it all before in episode eight of my second watch.WorseThe Stranger (2020, Netflix)Coben told The Observer in 2022 that he wrote the book The Stranger in three weekswhile travelling in the back of an Uber. Perhaps this explains the gaping plot holes.A young woman wearing a baseball cap exposes life-altering secrets to unsuspecting people, resulting in cast members going missing and getting murdered. It should be scary, but it’s often funny. For example, Jennifer Saunders plays a woman who is violently killed in her cake shop. As silly murders go, we’re about a shaving of parmesan away fromMartine McCutcheon’s death by wheel of cheesein Midsomer Murders.Shelter (2023, Prime Video)View image in fullscreen‘What happens when you leavenothingon the cutting room floor’ … Adrian Greensmith (Arthur ‘Spoon’ Spindell), Jaden Michael (Mickey Bolitar) and Abby Corrigan (Ema Winslow) in Shelter.Photograph: Michael Parmelee/Prime VideoIf you’ve ever wondered what happens when you leavenothingon the cutting room floor, it’s this. Sheltertakes all the Coben classics – dead parents, missing children, mysterious abandoned houses, plotlines involving fire – and adds in high school politics, basketball, two queer storylines, a network of underground tunnels, a sex trafficking ring, and … the Holocaust. Yes, you did read that right.This one is set in the US, and has more American pep in its step – plus what looks like a higher budget – than some of the other adaptations. The plus points: the teens give committed performances, and there are some funny lines as they go about solving the ever-more-nonsensical mystery together.The downside is the plotlines are so various and tangential they gave me whiplash. Just when I thought nothing more could possibly happen, I realised I was only on episode five of eight.Missing You (2025, Netflix)View image in fullscreen‘Finally,a Coben adaptation that passes the Bechdel test!’ … Rosalind Eleazar as Kat, Brigid Zengeni as Odette and Jo Martin as Tessie in Missing You.Photograph: James Stack/NetflixFinally,a Coben adaptation that passes the Bechdel test! We’ve got a female protagonist to root for – Detective Kat Donovan is a ball-busting, fearless DCI who is … oh no … completely and utterly obsessed with men: her ex, who disappeared 11 years ago (or did he?), and solving the cold case murder of her father, who was the perfect police officer (or was he?)These strings come together in one of the duller Cobens until, a few episodes in, we hit full on twisted British horror. On a farm in the deepest countryside, naked people are being tortured in a barnyard – and the spooky cattle-prod wielder is none other than Steve Pemberton, star of the nightmarish Inside No.9. This can’t be good.WorstLazarus (2025, Prime Video)View image in fullscreen‘I wish I could say this was better’ … Bill Nighy and Sam Claflin in Harlan Coben’s Lazarus.Photograph: Ben Blackall/PrimeIf you remove the camp from Harlan Coben, Lazarus is what you get. Our brooding antihero, the hilariously named “Laz”, wanders around a city that looks like AI slop, trying to solve the mystery of his father’s (Bill Nighy) suspicious death – and his sister’s murder. Luckily, he starts seeing ghosts who can help him with that …I wish I could say this was better. But the script, the acting, the pacing, is all absolutely dreadful. The more nonsensical episodes I watched, the more confused and distressed I became. Lazarus is marketed as a “horror-thriller,” but despite the blood and guts – including ghosts axe-murdering each other – the most frightening thing about this show is Laz’s sister’s wig.This is the first Coben not based on one of his books, and it shows. The script has none of the high camp flourishes that make eight hours spent in a stupor worth it. Bring back Stay Close’s musical-theatre-loving murder-nerds – surely the best thing about this entire canon.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Composite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesTwenty-five years after I revealed the practices of the industrial food giants, the profits – and dangers – of mass producing meat and milk have only grownByEric SchlosserTue 6 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 05.36 ESTShareCats have long been kept at American dairy farms to kill rats, mice and other rodents. In March 2024, a number of barn cats at dairies in the Texas panhandle started to behave strangely. It was like the opening scene of a horror movie. The cats began to walk in circles obsessively. They became listless and depressed, lost their balance, staggered, had seizures, suffered paralysis and died within a few days of becoming ill. At one dairy in north Texas, two dozen cats developed these odd symptoms; more than half were soon dead. Their bodies showed no unusual signs of injury or disease.Dr Barb Petersen, a veterinarian in Amarillo, heard stories about the sick cats. “I went to one of my dairies last week, and all their cats were missing,” a colleague told her. “I couldn’t figure it out – the cats usually come to my vet truck.” For about a month, Petersen had been investigating a mysterious illness among dairy cattle in Texas. Cows were developing a fever, producing less milk, losing weight. The milk they did produce was thick and yellow. The illness was rarely fatal but could last for weeks, and the decline in milk production was hurting local dairy farmers. Petersen sent fluid samples from sick cows to a diagnostic lab at Iowa State University, yet all the tests came back negative for diseases known to infect cattle. She wondered if there might be a connection between the unexplained illnesses of the cats and the cows. She sent the bodies of two dead barn cats to the lab at Iowa State, where their brains were dissected.Petersen’s hunch led to a series of important discoveries. The dairy cows in north Texas were suffering from highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) – and the barn cats had been infected with this virulent bird flu after being fed raw milk from the sick cows. H5N1 had emerged years earlier in Asia, travelled to the United States via migrating birds, andbegan to devastateUS poultry farms in 2022. The fatality rate of H5N1 among poultry approaches 100% – and more than 150 millon chickenshave been culledby American farmers since 2022 to halt the spread of this new virus. Researchers have known for years that cats were vulnerable to bird flu. In previous cases, they’d been sickened mainly by eating infected birds. But until Peterson’s discovery, nobody knew that cows could be infected with bird flu, that the virus propagated in their udders, and that it could be spread by their milk.A commonsense response to the discovery of H5N1 among Texas dairy cattle in 2024 would have been mandatory testing of every cow for the virus, a strict quarantine of dairies where bird flu was found, mandatory testing of milk for contamination, monetary compensation to dairy farmers for any losses caused by the disease, and widespread testing of dairy workers to ensure that H5N1 was not spreading from cows to people. None of those things happened.Tiger among 20 cats to die of bird flu at sanctuary in Washington stateRead moreThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is primarily responsible for the health of livestock, not people. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no authority to test livestock for diseases. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lacks the authority to test farm animals or farm workers without the permission of farm owners. State officials can wield those powers. But the Texas agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller, a rightwing conspiracy theorist who’d spoken ata QAnon event in Dallasa few years earlier, thought H5N1 posed “no threat to the public”. The dairy industry opposed the routine testing of its cows or workers – and dairy was responsible for about $50bn of economic activity in Texas every year. Miller made clear how he felt about federal investigators visiting dairies in the panhandle to look for bird flu: “They need to back off.”Twenty-five years ago, my bookFast Food Nationoutlined the dangers of a food system controlled by a handful of multinational corporations. As the book argues, the real price of cheap food doesn’t appear on the menu. The industrialisation of livestock, the transformation of sentient creatures into commodities, and the absence of government oversight have created new vectors for dangerous pathogens. Some American mega-dairies may have as many as 100,000 cows – and the enormous number of cows living in a single barn, the milking of numerous cows with the same equipment, the failure to impose quarantines and the interstate shipment of cows from one mega-dairy to another, enabled H5N1 to spread throughout the US.During the past 30 years, the dairy industry in the UK has become far more dependent on large-scale production and grown remarkably centralised as well. In 1980, there were46,000 dairy farms in the UK. Now there are just over 7,000. Just four companies now process about 75% of the UK’s milk.Changes in the size, scale, and structure of the dairy industry have also led to changes in the workforce. Today’s American dairy workers are likely to be recent immigrants who are paid low wages. They sometimes work 60 to 80 hours a week, and often move around frequently between jobs.The first person to be infected with H5N1 in the US was a dairy worker in Texas. A few weeks after the discovery of bird flu in cows, the worker developed an unexpected symptom of the disease: pink eye. Testing found that the conjunctivitis was caused by H5N1. Otherwise, his illness was mild. He didn’t develop upper respiratory congestion or a fever and recovered fully within a few days. Despite the possibility that H5N1 might be silently spreading among dairy workers – and the risk that it could mutate inside a human host to become lethal to humans and highly contagious – few workers were tested for H5N1. The dairy industry opposed testing them, and immigrant workers were reluctant to have any interaction with state or federal investigators, fearing deportation.View image in fullscreenA feedlot with  capacity for 98,000 cattle, Colorado, 2019.Photograph: Jim West/AlamyThe first known human cluster of H5N1 infections in the USoccurred among poultry workersin Weld County, Colorado, during July 2024. Weld County now has poultry farms, egg farms and mega-dairies – in addition to the vast cattle feedlots and the beef slaughterhouse described at length in Fast Food Nation. Workers often move from job to job at these industrial-scale operations. At one of the largest egg farms in Colorado, not far from Greeley, a group of workers was instructed to cull hens that had tested positive for H5N1. The workers spent hours in hot, poorly ventilated henhouses, killing almost 2 million birds and collecting their bodies for disposal. Five workers later developed fevers, chills, upper respiratory symptoms and pink eye. It was the largest human outbreak of bird flu in American history.None of the workers were hospitalised, and all soon recovered. But their illnesses suggested that mild or even asymptomatic cases of bird flu might be occurring among workers at poultry farms, egg farms and dairies throughout the US. As more workers and more cows became infected, the risk of a dangerous mutation in the virus increased. When the Weld County cluster occurred, roughly four months had passed since the first Texas dairy worker had been sickened by bird flu – and yet only 200 workers had been tested for H5N1 nationwide.Bird flu is a zoonosis – an infectious disease that can be transmitted from vertebrate animals to human beings. Like E coliO157:H7 (which emerged in cattle feedlots) and methicillin-resistantS aureus(also known as MRSA, which emerged at industrial hog farms and kills about 9,000 Americans every year), H5N1 is simply the latest unanticipated cost of factory farming.Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) has not yet caused a deadly epidemic among human beings. Pasteurisation kills H5N1 in milk, and the virus hasn’t mutated to become more contagious or more lethal. But H5N1 has become endemic among wild birds, chickens, turkeys and dairy cattle in the US, allowing a continual mixture of its genes. A bird flu epidemic that kills millions of people may never emerge from factory farms – or it may next week, next month or next year. The threat is global. On 9 December, H5N1was confirmed among poultryat a large factory farm in Lincolnshire in the UK. A two-mile exclusion zone was put in place and all the birds on the premises were to be culled. It was the second confirmed outbreak in a week.When FastFoodNation was published in January 2001, I didn’t expect the industrial food giants to like it. And they did not like it. The book reveals how they operate, looking at the great discrepancy between their slick marketing and the reality of their business practices. It describes the impact of the industrial food system on workers, consumers, farm animals and the environment.“The real McDonald’s bears no resemblance to anything described in [Schlosser’s] book,” a statement from the McDonald’s Corporation said. “He’s wrong about our people, wrong about our jobs, and wrong about our food.” The National Restaurant Association said: “In addition to acting like the ‘food police’ and trying to coerce the American consumer never to eat fast food again, [Schlosser] recklessly disparages an industry that has contributed tremendously to our nation.”A spokesperson for the American Meat Institute claimed that my evidence of safety problems in meatpacking plants was “anecdotal” and that I’d “vilified the industry in a way that is very unfair”.The Heartland Institute, a rightwing thinktank, later said that I was “tricking young people … to lead them away from capitalism into his failed socialist ideology”. According to theWall Street Journal, McDonald’s later hired the DCI Group – a “strategic public affairs consulting firm” withstrong linksto the oil, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries – to post online attacks on me. (McDonald’s denied using third parties to attack me and said they “appreciate feedback”.)Despite the personal attacks, none of the book’s industry critics cited factual errors in it. More surprising were the disruptions that occurred during my public appearances to talk about food issues. At different events in different cities, I’d often get exactly the same hostile questions, as though they’d been scripted in advance. Protesters interrupted my talks, threats were made against me. Armed security guards sometimes stood beside me when I signed books, and during a visit to a university in Indiana, I was accompanied in public by a state police officer from the time I landed at the airport in Indianapolis until the time I left the state a few days later. After a panel discussion in Tucson, I was assaulted in the parking lot by a man who got me in a headlock and shouted at me: “Why do you hate America? Why do you hate America so much?” It was a bizarre, unsettling experience.What happened to me was trivial compared to the pushback other fast food industry critics have experienced. In 2008, Burger King hired a private security firm to infiltrate the Student/Farmworker Alliance – a nonviolent group – that was urging consumers to boycott Burger King because some of its suppliers were linked to slave labour in the tomato fields of Florida. The owner of the security firm, Diplomatic Tactical Services, posed as a college student to collect information for Burger King. She did a poor job of impersonating a young activist and aroused suspicions. She wassoon outedas a corporate spy, creating some bad publicity for Burger King.View image in fullscreenBattery-caged hens.Photograph: Horizon International Images/AlamyThe McDonald’s Corporation was much more successful at spying on its critics. During the 1980s, sometimes half the people attending London Greenpeace meetings were corporate spies hired by McDonald’s to collect information on the group. As the Guardian journalist Rob Evans haschronicled in depth, Scotland Yard had also infiltrated London Greenpeace with undercover agents. The corporate spies and undercover police officers helped McDonald’s to gain an advantagein the McLibel case, a lawsuit directed at two members of London Greenpeace. While pretending to be an anti-McDonald’s activist, one of the undercover police officers had a romantic relationship with a member of London Greenpeace for almost two years, while secretly collecting information on her. And one of McDonald’s corporate spies slept with a different Greenpeace activist for about six months, also as a way to build trust and gain information. Aninquiry into the conductof more than 139 undercover policeofficers who spied on tens of thousands of activists between 1968 and 2010 isnow in progress.“The history of the 20th century was dominated by the struggle against totalitarian systems of state power,” I wrote in Fast Food Nation. “The 21st will no doubt be marked by a struggle to curtail excessive corporate power.” Well, at least I got it half-right. We now have to struggle against both.One of the book’s central aims was to reveal how private interests were being served at the expense of the public interest. The workings of the industrial food system amply illustrated those larger themes. An investigation of the banking, aerospace, chemical, defense, healthcare, entertainment or software industries would have reached similar conclusions.Consumers now possess merely an illusion of choice. The corporate mergers and acquisitions of the past four decades have greatly reduced the number of companies that sell food, a fact hidden by the multiplicity of brand names. For example, Starbucks is the largest chain of coffee shops in the world. But a family-owned German firm, JAB Holding Company, sells more coffee than Starbucks does, under multiple brand names that JAB wholly or partially owns – including Keurig, Krispy Kreme, Peet’s Coffee, Stumptown Coffee, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and Pret a Manger.When large corporations gain too much power, the prices offered to suppliers, the wages paid to workers and the prices charged to consumers are no longer driven by market forces. Government agencies become “captive” to the companies they’re supposed to be regulating. And those corporations earn higher profits by lowering wages, raising prices and manipulating supplies. When four companies gain a combined market share of 40% or higher, competition readily gives way to collusion. What was once a free market becomes an oligopoly.Revealed: the true extent of America’s food monopolies, and who pays the priceRead moreToday, four companies control 56% of the worldwide market for seeds and 61% of the market for pesticides. Five companiescontrol about 70% to 90%of the worldwide trade in grains. Four companies controlmore than 80%of the US supply of beef, 70% of its pork and 60% of its market for chicken. Four companies control about 75% of the US market for yoghurt,79% of its market for beer. Three firmscontrol 93%of its market for carbonated soft drinks. Factory farming has extended monopoly power even to commercial-livestock genetics. Two companies provide the breeding stock for more than 90% of the world’s egg-laying hens and turkeys.Hidden market power can suddenly be revealed when something goes wrong. During the summer of 2024, an outbreak of E coli prompted amassive precautionary recallof sandwiches from stores and supermarkets throughout the UK. Hundreds of people were sickened; two died. A report by the UK Health Security Agencylater saidthat “epidemiological analyses provided robust evidence that pre-packaged sandwiches containing lettuce were the likely vehicle of infection”. The lettuce was the probable source of E coli.Although never conclusively linked to any specific sandwich company or brand, the outbreak was illuminating about how our food is now prepared. Many of the recalled items were made by the same firm: Greencore, perhaps the world’s largestmanufacturer of fresh, pre-made sandwiches.Based in Ireland, Greencore sells about 600m sandwiches a year in cardboard packages bearing the logos of other brands, such as Boots, Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and WH Smith. A video taken at a Greencore factory in Nottinghamshire, England,shows hundreds of workersstanding at assembly lines in a gigantic refrigerated room, wearing white coats and green hairnets, adding ingredients by hand as slices of bread pass them on conveyer belts. The factory runs 24 hours a day and makes hundreds of different kinds of sandwich. The familiar little packages that contain these sandwiches – lined up in refrigerated display cases at grocery stores, petrol stations and airport newsstands – offer no hint that what’s inside them was assembled on an industrial scale.A much more serious form of hidden market power was revealed when an infant in Minnesota became ill withCronobacter sakazakiiduring the fall of 2021. Cronobacter is a pathogenic bacteria that can be dangerous to infants who are younger than two months, born prematurely or immunocompromised. After an infection with Cronobacter, the estimated death rate among these babies ranges from 40% to 80%. Many who survive have lifelong brain damage and seizure disorders. The baby sickened in Minnesota was hospitalised for three weeks but survived. Three more infants were soon diagnosed with Cronobacterin other states. Two of them died. All the illnesses were linked to powdered infant formula manufactured at the same plant: one of the largest infant formula factories in the US, occupying 800,000 sq feet andcovering more landthan a dozen football fields. The plant was located in Sturgis, Michigan, and owned by Abbott Nutrition.View image in fullscreenWorkers disposing of chickens due to avian flu fears, Maryland, 2004Photograph: Mike Theiler/EPAWhen inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration visited Sturgis early in 2022, they found multiple strains of Cronobacter in the Abbott factory. FDA officials later described conditions at the plant as “shocking” and “egregiouslyunsanitary”. Abbott voluntarily shut down the plant and recalled three brands of powdered formula made there. Abbottinsistedthat government investigators couldn’t find any evidence “to link our formulas to these infant illnesses”. But Frank Yiannas, who served as deputy commissioner of the FDA during the recall, thought that Abbott’s denials were misleading. “Abbott’s Sturgis facility lacked adequate controls to prevent the contamination of powdered infant formula,” Yiannis testified before Congress, “And it is likely that other lots of [powdered formula] produced in this plant were contaminated with multipleC sakazakiistrains over time, which evaded end-product testing, were released into commerce, and consumed by infants.”The Abbott factory in Sturgis produced about one-fifth of all the infant formula consumed in the US. When the Sturgis plant shut down and didn’t fully reopen for six months, parents scrambled to find infant formula amid nationwide shortages, hoarding and panic-buying that lasted throughout 2022. Monopoly power had greatly diminished the resilience of the food system, creating the risk that some babies might not be able to eat. At the time of writing, the market for infant formula in the US is still controlled by the same four companies. In the UK, the infant formula market is even more concentrated: one company,Danone, controls about 71%.In many respects, the harms of the food system have only got worse during the 25 years since Fast Food Nation was first published. The consumption of ultra-processed foods – that is, most fast foods – hasbeen linkedto at least 32 health problems, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity and mental health disorders. More thanhalf of the foodsthat Americans now eat are ultra-processed.But there are still grounds for hope, as this mind-blowing tweet from President Donald Trump suggested, a week after his re-election in November 2024: “For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex … [that has] engaged in deception, misinformation and disinformation when it comes to public health.”If a politician who drinks 12 Diet Cokes a day,serves McDonald’s foodat the White House, stages campaign events at McDonald’s restaurants – and routinely orders a meal of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and a chocolate shakejust for himself– now feels the need to criticise industrial food, a seismic shift has occurred in US popular opinion.Some passages ofThe MAHA Report,issued by the Trump administration in May 2025, feel almost hallucinatory. A conservative Republican administration released a report condemning ultra-processed foods, calling for bans on synthetic food additives, lamenting the high obesity rate among American children, attacking federal agencies for their “corporate capture and the revolving door”, and placing some of the blame on “consolidation of the food system”.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump visits a McDonald’s restaurant in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, 20 October 2024.Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesThe real significance of the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) crusade is the overwhelming popular support behind it. An opinion poll conducted by a conservative thinktank in 2025found that96% of probable US voters somewhat or strongly agreed that warning labels should be placed on ultra-processed foods containing additives linked to serious health risks – and the proportion of Republicans who agreed was 97%. In addition, 70% of probable voters opposed serving school meals that contain potentially harmful ultra-processed foods, and 95% supported requiring schools to serve fresh fruit and vegetables at lunch.The idealism and passion of the Maha movement belies an ugly truth: the Trump administration has launched a radical assault on the government agencies devoted to food access, food safety and public health.The mass firings and termination of longstanding programs by Donald Trump’s secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, have been unprecedented. At the time of writing, the CDC has lost aboutone quarterof its employees. Its National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion may loseall of its fundingto address heart disease and stroke, obesity, diabetes and many other disorders.Cuts to the CDC’s Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network mean that outbreaks of food poisoning in the US will soon be much harder to detect – which will only benefit companies that sell contaminated food. And a $590m grant awarded to Moderna for the development of a bird flu vaccinehas been cancelled.But all is not lost. We have agency in this world, for better or worse. In recent years, a new discipline has arisen that looks at economic activity from a system-wide perspective: true-cost accounting. It tries to measure the real costs that prices don’t always reflect. Applied to the food system, it incorporates the health, environmental and other externalised costs that businesses too often succeed at making everyone else pay. True-cost accounting makes clear that cheap, industrial fast food is actually far more expensive than we can afford.According to a true-cost studyby the Rockefeller Foundation, Americans spent $1.1tn on food in 2019. But that spending didn’t include the healthcare costs of food-related illnesses or the obesity epidemic, the food system’s contribution to air and water pollution, the social costs of the food system’s low-wage workforce or the costs of greenhouse gas emissions and reduced biodiversity. When those externalised business costs are added to the $1.1tn in spending, the true cost of what Americans pay every year for their food is closer to $3.3tn. The accuracy of that estimate can be disputed. It’s hard to assign a dollar value to natural capital such as a beautiful rural landscape that’s been bulldozed to make factory farms. How can you put a price on that sort of loss? But the underlying idea behind true-cost accounting is sound. The harms and benefits of our food system are unequally distributed.Changing the economic incentives can lead to a huge change in real-world outcomes. As the environmental movement learned long ago, when polluters have to pay for their pollution, the air and water get cleaner. If a packet of ground beef had to include a list on the label of all the dangerous pathogens in the meat, market forces would reward companies devoted to food safety. The companies willing to sell tainted meat would have to lower their prices significantly or clean up their act.In 2019, the food policy group Eat and the medical journal the Lancet issued a report,Food in the Anthropocene,linking unhealthy diets to the environmental damage caused by the industrial food system. It has become one of the most widely cited, peer-reviewed scientific papers of the past 20 years. The report argues that changing what we eat and how we produce it is essential not only for our own health but for the health of the planet.How the sandwich consumed Britain | The long readRead moreChanging this system won’t be easy, and it may take years. But it’s been done before – child labour was once routine in US factories, until banned by the US supreme court. And the alternative to changing things will be a hell of a lot worse. So it must be done. When the disinformation, misinformation and lies of the Trump administration become undeniable, when the harms of its policies become inescapable, opportunities will arise. The same is true everywhere industrial, ultra-processed food is sold. After spending three decades investigating this fast food nation, I feel grateful for the friends I’ve made, inspired by the workers and farmers and ranchers and activists I’ve met, humbled, disappointed, amazed, outraged, angry beyond words – and yet hopeful.Adapted from the 25th anniversary edition ofFast Food Nation: the Dark Side of the All-American Meal, published by Penguin Modern Classics on 29 January.

US presidents promise isolation – and deliver warSimon JenkinsLast week’s events in Caracas come in a long line of American interventions. The White House has awesome power and is never shy of using itTue 6 Jan 2026 09.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.22 ESTShareIt is starting to trickle out. Last week in Caracas was not an invasion, it was a putsch. It was the militarised kidnap of one ruler to aid his more amenable deputy into power. Since April last year,according to reports, vice-president and now interim president Delcy Rodríguez and her brother Jorge – the president of the Venezuelan national assembly – have beendealing secretly with Washington. This has reportedly been via that hotspot of informal diplomacy, Qatar.We have yet to know the details. But the rumours are plausible that last week’s episode was staged to look outrageous, including Delcy Rodríguez’sinitial condemnationof it as atrocious. President Nicolás Maduro was handed over to the Americans swiftly and peacefully. The only slip was Trumpdescribing Delcyas “quite gracious” before she was hastily sworn into office soon after the raid. A more serious slip washis dismissalof the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, as lacking “the support within or the respect within the country”. She had championedEdmundo González Urrutia, probable winner ofthe rigged2024 Venezuelan election, for which she won the Nobel peace prize Trump so coveted. Why no mention of him from Trump?That the affair was an outrage against international law should of course be acknowledged. But the US has rarely paid that law much attention. The surprise is that there is so much surprise. One president after another has found the “manifest destiny” of the US, to proclaim and promote freedom wherever needed, more appealing. That the Caracas attack was also unconstitutional, in that Congress alone has the right to declare war, is supposedly covered by it being merely “law enforcement”.Keir Starmer is clearly hedging his bets by not jumping to conclusions. He has said next to nothing. When in 1983, Ronald Reagan similarly toppled a leftist regime in Venezuela’s near neighbour Grenada, Margaret Thatcher phoned him to protest furiously against the unprovoked attack on a Commonwealth state. Reagan took the call with his aides and switched her rant to speaker mode. He said with a smile:“Gee, isn’t she marvellous?”After last weekend’s operation, people quite reasonably seek clarity of events and motive, but the truth is that international interventions by powerful states are drenched in hypocrisy. Their true purpose may be commercial gain or domestic glory – or to aid an ally. Or it may be just to sound good. In his 1961 inaugural address, President John F Kennedypledgedthat the US would “pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty”. He then escalated conflict in Vietnam.All US presidents have started by obeying George Washington’s1796 appeal to isolationism, by swearing to stand aloof from distant conflicts, “the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns”. Thus Woodrow Wilson pledged he would not fight in the Great War and Franklin Roosevelt did likewise in the second world war. In 1940, FDRdeclared to America’s mothers: “I shall say it again and again and again, your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.” Just over one year later he did just that, as had Wilson.View image in fullscreenSalvaged busts of former US Presidents Lyndon Johnson (left) and George Washington, Williamsburg, Virginia, 25 August 2019.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe reality is that the global potency of the White House and the Pentagon establishment appears, in time, to become irresistible. It begs to be used. When the Soviet menace evaporated in the late 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev’s aide Georgi Arbatov, the Kremlin’s chief “Amerikanist”,commiserated with his US counterparts: “We are going to do a terrible thing to you,” he said. “We are going to deprive you of an enemy.”The US merely sought a new one, almost obsessively, and rarely with much concern for international law. When in 1990 George HW Bush kidnapped Panama’s president Manuel Noriegaas a drug lord, no one worried too much about the law. Nor did Britain, in 1999, in the clearly illegalbombing of Belgradeand the deployment of peacekeepersto Kosovo. When it joined in defeatingSaddam Hussein in 2003, the justification was that he threatened British national security. This was clearly absurd, yet parliament swallowed it. As for Britain’s helping topple the leaders of Afghanistan and Libya, it argued merely that they were bad people. Rich nations feel an obligation to come to the aid of oppressed ones, which is pretty much Trump’s narrative today.At least until now, Trump has adamantly held aloof from the world-policing rhetoric of his predecessors. He claimed to have learned the lessons of failed nation-building. Last year he announced that the US wasfed up with Natoand with defending Europe. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump was cheered for calling an end to lecturing the world on how to behave. As faras he was concerned, “The so-called ‘nation-builders’ wrecked far more nations than they built.”Last week’s coup reeked of a massive U-turn. Trump said he intended to run Venezuela “with a group” and “transition” it to stability. He appeared to assume that the putsch would work, as it initially did, and require no further US force projection. We can only wait to see.However, Trump’s policy wizard,Stephen Miller, apparently envisages nothing less than a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe doctrine. The original doctrine declared the US responsible for guarding all the Americas from European colonisation. An earlier corollary under Theodore RooseveltpledgedWashington would commit, “however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power”.Trump’s corollary would appear to be to use national security to justify the overwhelming of Greenland, possibly Cuba and even Canada. Miller’s wife has reportedly shared a map of Greenlanddressed in the stars and stripes. This would in effect be a United States empire of the Americas, and clearly madness.The nearest Trump could come to justifying his Venezuelan enterprise would be an early election and the return of democracy to what, for me, is atruly wonderful country. But, so far, Trump has not mentioned democracy. He is a very different president, but in some ways he is just the same as many predecessors who have revelled in the possibilities and deployment of US might. Another Iraq beckons – a quagmire or worse. He’ll probably find George Washington’s isolationist instincts were right.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist and the author ofA Short History of America: From Tea Party to TrumpExplore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaOpinionDonald TrumpVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasUS foreign policyTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

One is to say round numbers are irrelevant. Since share prices are meant to go up over the long term, an index that wascreated in 1984at a starting value of 1,000 was bound to get there eventually.In any case, a pure value-weighted points measure doesn’t capture the dividends paid by component companies, which can add up to a material part of an investor’s return over time if reinvested. Nor is the Footsie guaranteed to stay above 10,000, obviously. Such “bah humbug” points are all reasonable.FTSE 100 breaks 10,000 mark for first time, capping stellar year for UK marketRead moreA second approach is to make bogus claims about what it means. That was the line taken by Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, whotweetedlast Friday: “The FTSE 100 breaking through 10,000 points for the first time is a vote of confidence in Britain’s economy.”If only. In reality, the level of the Footsie says little about the UK economy specifically because the index is stuffed with multinationals who make most of their revenues and earnings abroad – in aggregate, the tally is about 75%. Last year’s best performer (up more than fivefold) was Fresnillo, a silver miner out of Mexico that enjoyed the boom in precious metal prices rather than any warm breezes out of the UK.A third way is to acknowledge the basic insignificance of 10,000, plus the skewed makeup of the membership (overweight banks and miners, and underweight tech), but still take the opportunity to indulge in some marketing razzmatazz. The aim: to make the essential point that shares have historically comfortably outperformed cash over medium- and long-term horizons.This, you would have thought, would be a gimme for Reeves and the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). The chancellor, via her“Leeds Reforms”, is trying to “rewire” the financial system by encouraging more financial risk-taking by companies and consumers. An eye-catching big number for the Footsie –after a year in which it rose 21.5%and outperformed US equivalents for a change – sounds like an open goal if you wish to nudge savers out of safety-first cash ISAs. There was no need to ruin the message with overblown claims about confidence in the UK economy.As for LSEG, it constantly runs into the accusation that it doesn’t bestow enough care and affection on the London exchange because it has a far bigger operation selling financial data (including index compilation). The criticism is slightly unfair, but here was a chance to engage in a bit of that “hustle” that the Octopus Energy boss, Greg Jackson, who islooking to list the group’s £6bn Kracken Technologies software subsidiary, recently called for. But there were no fireworks over Paternoster Square – or even “FTSE 10,000” baseball caps in the style of those that are often distributed on Wall Street when a round number for the Dow Jones industrial average is reached.Maybe the showbiz stuff is too embarrassingly American but if ever there was a time to drop the reserve, it was surely now. A collection of City banks, investment platforms, fund managers and the stock exchange itself is preparing to fund – to the tune of £15m a year, reportedly –a national advertising campaign “to explain the benefits of investing”. They could have saved themselves a few quid by milking the 10,000 moment.Yes, it would be gimmicky. Yes, US indices have performed better over the long run. Yes, you look foolish if there is a rapid reversal.

Can’t he take up a new hobby instead?Arwa MahdawiIt didn’t go very well for him last time, but the tech billionaire seems to have abandoned his plans for a third party and has renewed his bromance with the presidentTue 6 Jan 2026 09.47 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 13.02 ESTShare“You know, I’ve generally found that when I get involved in politics, it ends up badly,” Elon Musk mused on Nikhil Kamath’s podcastin November.Oh, we know, Elon, we most definitely know. The world is still reeling from the tech billionaire’s little experiment in politicking last year. Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) slashed federal jobs, dismantled foreign aid programmes and left atrail of chaosin its wake. It’s not clear whether any taxpayer money was saved, but experts are warning a lot of lives will be lost. By one calculation, there could beabout 14 million excess deathsacross the globe by 2030 if the US fails to restore aid funding. Thanks, Elon!Musk’s stint in politics didn’t just end badly for people reliant on US aid; his own brand took a beating. Last August, aGallup pollfound he was the most unpopular person in a list of global figures. He also had a highly publicisedfallout with Donald Trump last summer. As you may remember, Musk declared that he was going to start his own political party and Trump called his former “first buddy” a “TRAIN WRECK”. Musk also spent a lot of time trolling the president about the Epstein files. “Time to drop the really big bomb,” Muskposted on X in June, “@realdonaldtrump is in the Epstein files. That is why they have not been made public.”But that’s all ancient history. It would seem a lot of forgiving, forgetting anddeletingof inopportune social media posts has been done; now it’s time to brace ourselves for the Trump-Musk Bromance Part Two: Electric Boogaloo. Over the weekend Musk, who seems to have suddenly lost interest in the Epstein files, posted ablurry photoon X of him dining with Donald and Melania at Mar-a-Lago. They’d all had a “lovely dinner”, he gushed in the post, adding: “2026 is going to be amazing!” That dinner, by the way, took place shortly after the US captured the Venezuelan presidentNicolás Maduroand his wife. Was Musk in such high spirits because Trump was promising to invade Greenland next, and turn it into a Tesla factory? Or did the president tell Musk, who is obsessed with the UK, that he’d “liberatethe people of Britain” for him, as a little treat? I guess we’ll find out.Musk isn’t just breaking bread with Trump; he’s also giving the Republican party a lot of dough again. Axiosreportedin December that Musk had quietly been cutting big cheques for the midterms. On New Year’s Day, Musk seemingly made his renewed support public byrespondingto a post by a conservative influencer claiming Musk was “going all-in funding Republicans”. Musk appeared to confirm this with the statement: “America is toast if the radical left wins.” Looks like the billionaire has now abandoned his third party plans and is back on the Trump train.So who do we have to thank for two of the most awful men in the world joining forces again? Well, the ghost of Charlie Kirk for one. Before he was murdered, Kirktalkedabout how he was desperate to get Trump and Musk to reconcile. And his death seems to have achieved that: Kirk’s memorial in September brought the two men together for theirfirst public appearancesince the feud. Both Musk and the White House X accountpostedphotos of the pair sitting and chatting with the caption: “For Charlie.”JD Vance also played a role in getting the pair to kiss and make up. According to a Decemberreportby the Washington Post, Vance has been very busy brokering a truce and getting Musk to rethink his third party plans. The vice-president obviously has his own reasons for wanting to keep things cordial with the richest man in the world. Trump keeps insisting that his “health is perfect” and joking about a third term, but he’s not going to be around for ever. Musk’s unlimited funds played a large part in getting Trump back in the White House and you imagine Vance is keen to keep the money spigot on.Unfortunately, I don’t have billions of dollars I can use to get politicians to do my bidding. But I do have a wealth of unsolicited advice for Musk. Please sir, I’m begging you, can you take up a nice hobby? Or spend some quality time with your army of children, perhaps? Or get in one of your rockets and go for a very long ride in outer space? Just do something that isn’t meddling in the government! Because I have a feeling this new political act is going to end very badly for everyone.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpCharlie Kirk shootingJD VanceUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how we surviveRobyn VinterUniversity undergraduates are forming northern societies, but in other circumstances we find different ways to be ourselvesTue 6 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 08.31 ESTShareOf course they weren’t being mean, but each time my university friends jokingly echoed my Leeds-accented “no” with a noise that is perhaps best approximated as “nerhhh”, I found myself undergoing elocution conditioning. Within a year, the identifying characteristics of my accent had gone, replaced with a sort of unplaceable, vaguely northern voice. It didn’t matter that we were at university inLeeds, my home city, where most of the population had a stronger accent than me; it was novel – and apparently amusing – to those who had come from the south.It’s now a familiar scenario. With an increasingnorth-south dividein university admissions, campuses in the north are teeming with southerners. That may be inevitable under the circumstances, but it can leave students from the surrounding areas feeling out of place only a few miles from where they grew up.It’s a feeling that York University’s northern students know even better than I do, and undergrads there have found a solution inresurrecting the university’s Northern Society, a club where northern students can feel at home. To some people that might seem an overzealous remedy to a problem that doesn’t really exist. But those who have experienced this subtle cultural discohesion will understand the desire to cling on to our identity and our roots. It’s far from easy being a northerner in spaces and places where the default identity is southern. Still, we survive.In ways many and varied. When I moved to London after university, I found myself further eradicating traces of the broad vowels my family and friends at home all had. I felt a need to blend in, to not stand out. A lot of this was subconscious, driven probably by various mean comments I had encountered during my lifetime, whether directed at me or not. Sometimes, the slights were indirect: hearing people put on a northern accent, for example, to do an impression of someone stupid or unsophisticated. Other times they were very direct, like all the comments about how “racist northerners” caused Brexit.View image in fullscreenMembers of the University of York’s Northern Society, 12 December 2025.Photograph: Colin McPherson/The GuardianI learned to smile while tolerating the complete absence of knowledge displayed by many southerners about anything outside the home counties. I learned to be rueful, or perhaps to swallow hard, as the discussion turned to politics and I encountered a grossly unfair and incredibly frustrating narrative about bigotry in the north. The fact is that the north is progressive and votes Labour in huge numbers at every election. For all the talk of the “red wall”, if we had been independent, there would have been no coalition government in 2010, no David Cameron, no Theresa May, no Boris Johnson, no Liz Truss, no Rishi Sunak. Say that again: no Boris Johnson, no Rishi Sunak.My home constituency at the last election was majority Labour, with the Greens in second and the Lib Dems third. Of course, there wereasylum protestsand mindless flag wavers in the north, but they were absolutely everywhere, including London,and notably Epping.‘Oh my gosh, they’re all from London and Cambridge’: York University’s northerners fight backRead moreThere is a danger we all recognise that the very act of proudly holding on to a northern identity is used against you: that you are dubbed a “professional northerner”. Southerners tend to do this. The so-called professional northerner mostly exists in the minds of southerners – and in spaces dominated by them. They are seen as old-fashioned, colloquial creatures, aggrandising of the north and fond of spouting deliberately obscure references that even other northerners don’t always get.Of course, the risk exists. There is a fine line between pride in the environment that made you and a sort of fetishisation of your authentic northern background (which can become more of a caricature the longer someone is out of the north). It can be easy to occasionally slip on to the wrong side of that line, especially in situations where you are feeling anxious about not fitting in, perhaps fearing judgment or outright dismissal. It can feel like the best way of surviving – getting ahead of the jokes and taking control back from the assumptions. But that is survival at a heavy cost.It is hard to pinpoint the northern culture we hold so dear: after all, we’re talking about arguably the most diverse part of the UK, home tomore than 15 million people– including all the southerners who have drifted up – but I think it’s fair to say there are characteristics that are not exclusive to but exemplify the north, such as openness, kindness, bluntness and good humour.When I think of the times I’ve laughed so hard I’ve been bent over double, clutching my sides in agony, a northerner has almost always been responsible. That is something worth holding on to – and I do.Robyn Vinter is north of England correspondent at the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Robert Bresson, Theo Angelopoulos, Joe Weerasethakul, Lav Diaz, Lisandro Alonso; these are all great slow cinema practitioners. But surely no film-maker ever got the speedometer needle further back to the left than the tragicomic master Béla Tarr; his pace was less than zero, a kind of intense and monolithic slowness, an uber-slowness, in films that moved, often almost infinitesimally, like vast gothic aircraft-carrier-sized ships across dark seas.Béla Tarr, Hungarian director of Sátántangó and Werckmeister Harmonies, dies aged 70Read moreAudience reactions were often a kind of delirium or incredulity at just how punishing the anti-pace was, but – given sufficient investment of attention – you found yourself responding with awe, but also laughing along to the macabre dark comedy, the parable and the satire. A Béla Tarr movie gave you drunkenness and hangover at the same time. And people were often to be found getting despairingly drunk in his films.Tarr was like a cinematic Gogol, often working with co-director and editor Ágnes Hranitzky. And yet however bleak the vision, with all its squalor and wretchedness, in person Tarr was witty in an exuberant yet somehow deadpan way, droll and wisecracking, fiercely engaged with the world, unstinting in his criticism of the intellectual mediocrity of the far right in his native Hungary and elsewhere. WhenI interviewed him in 2024on the occasion of a big retrospective of his work at London’s BFI Southbank, we talked about his new vocation of teaching at his Sarajevo film school after he stepped back from film-making in 2011; he said he was most energised by his enthusiasm for young film-makers. He said: “My slogan is very simple: no education, just liberation!”View image in fullscreenWitty … Béla Tarr in 2024.Photograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty ImagesTarr’s death comes shortly after the Nobel prize for literaturewas awarded to novelist László Krasznahorkai, the Hungarian author whose dark, demanding and uncompromising vision most clearly coincided with Tarr’s own, and with whom Tarr at one point occupied a kind of parallel creative path with his near-legendary 1994 adaptation of Krasznahorkai’s novel Sátántangó, or Satan’s Tango. It is a film about a rural village whose inhabitants abandon their lives to follow a charismatic cult leader who has returned from the dead, a super-slow monochrome epic of dreamlike strangeness lasting a staggering seven-and-a-half hours. For years, this mesmeric film was only fitfully available at festivals and those who saw it had a haunted expression, a kind of filmic PTSD.Werckmeister Harmonies from 2000, adapted from Krasznahorkai’s novel The Melancholy of Resistance, was another vividly disquieting black-and-white journey; this was a mere two-and-a-half hours in length, but no less punishing and unforgiving. Again, it is a study of spiritual desolation, but also of the groupthink narcosis and inner stupor of fascism. In ways similar to Sátántangó, an entire community submits to the will of a sinister outsider, a “prince” who like a huckster or extremist leader arrives with a giant circus whose sole attraction is a giant dead whale – and the Melvillean echo is surely deliberate.Before these, his 1988 film fiercely and accurately entitledDamnationwas another Krasznahorkai adaptation, a black-and-white (and mostly grey) vision that bears comparison to Beckett and Tarkovsky. His final film, The Turin Horse from 2011 – co-written with Krasznahorkai – was a variation on Nietzsche, a speculation about what happened to the horse that Nietzsche embraced tearfully in the street in Turin because it was being whipped by a coach driver, the moment that triggered the great philosopher’s nervous collapse. Perhaps inevitably, Tarr and Krasznahorkai envisage the horse not staying in sunny, metropolitan Italy but somehow transplanted to the grim fields of central Europe where it is being worked terribly hard on a farm by the coach driver, and enduring almost as much hardship as caused Nietzsche to sob with pity in the first place.View image in fullscreen‘A super-slow monochrome epic of dreamlike strangeness’ … SátántangóPhotograph: Ronald GrantBut Tarr also loved thrillers and noirs (much of his conversation with me was taken up by his adoration of Hitchcock) and he directed The Man from London in 2007, adapted from a Georges Simenon novel which had in fact already been conventionally adapted as a thriller in 1947; characteristically it located the glacially paced spiritual horror beneath the ostensible excitement. A fugitive discovers a suitcase full of foreign cash but realises he can’t spend it without exchanging it and therefore fatally drawing attention to himself; it is a tantalus of longing, and a vivid symbol of our society, with its desire for money. A regular movie would make this the starting point for tension and jeopardy but for Tarr it was the moment to stare into that Nietzschean abyss that stares right back at you.I felt it bore comparisonto the contemporary artist Douglas Gordon’s ultra slo-mo24 Hour Psycho installation.Perhaps uniquely in the “slow cinema” canon, Tarr’s movies always had an element of sulphurous, acrid, bleak comedy; he himself said it was similar to the comedy to be found in the saddest work of Chekhov. His work is something to be borne alongside Shaw’s dictum: “Life does not cease to be funny when people die, any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh.” For Tarr, it was laughter in the dark, but the darkness itself had endless texture and complexity.Explore more on these topicsFilmBéla TarrHungaryEuropeLászló KrasznahorkaiFictioncommentShareReuse this content"

Jude Law’s Vladimir film seems to have swallowed Kremlin mythsNatasha KiselevaIn The Wizard of the Kremlin, Jude Law plays Russia’s president as a cool, reluctant leader, a strategist who got the job because he was young, athletic and a spy. This is a creation far removed from the man himselfTue 6 Jan 2026 10.26 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.43 ESTShareLast year, speaking at the Venice film festival premiere of The Wizard of the Kremlin, based on a book about the rise ofVladimir Putin, actor Jude Law said he “didn’t fear any repercussions” over his portrayal of the Russian president. Law may be right, but not for the reason he thinks he is. The film aligns so closely with the mythologised version promoted by the Russian media that, domestically, it reads as a compliment rather than an affront.The Kremlin and Russia’s pop-culture machine have long collaborated to craft a made-to-measure version of Putin that is far removed from the man himself: a political superhero without age or mistakes, a perfectly calculated strategist, a former spy reframed as a Russian James Bond who always knows more than he reveals.One recent example is the TV series Chronicles of the Russian Revolution, released in October and directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, a Silver Lion winner and longstanding Kremlin supporter. Its main character is a fictional blue-eyed lieutenant colonel in the secret services, inexplicably chosen by the emperor’s inner circle and presented as the man who “saves” Russia from chaos, a role played by Yura Borisov, an Oscar nominee this year. Although the character is named Mikhail rather than Vladimir, the implication is clear: in this narrative, the saviour of Russia must be the familiar security officer.In Russia, the manufactured Putin has long eclipsed the real one. And yet western portrayals often end up reinforcing the same narrative rather than undercutting it. French director Olivier Assayas’s The Wizard of the Kremlin, based on Giuliano da Empoli’sbestselling satirical noveland adapted for screen by Emmanuel Carrère, in some ways sets out to subvert the Putin cult. In the film, which is released in French and Spanish cinemas this month, the Russian president is framed not as a cause but as a symptom, and the narrative shifts its centre of gravity towards spindoctor Vadim Baranov and the political machinery around him.View image in fullscreenThe implication is clear … Yura Borisov as Mikhail Prokhorov in Chronicles of the Russian Revolution.Photograph: Anastasia LyashenkoThe film does not present itself as a documentary or biopic. “What makes this film unique, and ultimately what fascinated me, was precisely that it showed the consequences of political evil, but also tried to portray its nature. How it works, its inner workings,” Assayas told Variety last year. Some characters appear under their real names, including Putin himself and the oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky. Others are fictional but clearly modelled on real figures. Baranov (Paul Dano) appears to be based on the political operative Vladislav Surkov. Dmitri Sidorov seems to represent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the businessman who spent 10 years in prison after clashing with Putin.The portrayal of Putin, however, resembles a Kremlin manual entitled A Short Guide to Romanticising the Leader. Putin is presented as having been chosen by Berezovsky and Baranov to stabilise the country, because he is “young, athletic and a spy”. Berezovsky and Baranov visit him in his office and all but beg him to become president. He replies that he would prefer to rule Russia from the shadows, since governments come and go and he seeks permanent power. This is the Kremlin’s export myth: the cool, reluctant strategist shaped by destiny. In reality, none of this ever happened.In fact, no one ever begged Putin to take the job. In cinematic terms, the presidency was effectively a casting call, and there was no shortage of candidates. At the centre of this process stood Berezovsky, one of the most influential oligarchs of the late Boris Yeltsin era, who expected to run the country de facto once a successor was installed. The shortlist he considered included Boris Nemtsov (murdered near the Kremlin in 2015), Sergei Kiriyenko (now first deputy chief of staff), former security service director Sergei Stepashin and several others.The journalist Roman Badanin, who has spent his career studying Putin’s biography and recently published The Tsar Himself, argues that Putin simply fitted the parameters Berezovsky was looking for. “Berezovsky was a political animal and wanted someone the public would understand, preferably from the security services,” Badanin told me. “The key was that the candidate could not be a communist, since they were at war with them at the time, and could not be a liberal either – the kind of guy with glasses and a good suit, who irritated voters and looked too pro-western. That ruled out half the contenders, but Putin was perfect: a loyal state servant.”Property developer Shalva Chigirinsky, a close friend of Berezovsky and a witness to the choice of Putin as successor, also believes that Putin was not selected for his leadership qualities.“In the summer of 1999, Borya [Berezovsky] told me they had settled on Putin,” Chigirinsky says. “I said, ‘Are you out of your mind? Who is going to vote for him? He can’t even pick a shirt in his size or tie a tie.’ Putin made no impression as a leader; he had no political charisma and ambitions. Borya explained that they didn’t need a strong candidate, they needed someone controllable, someone who would follow instructions. The key criterion was that the future president had to be manageable and loyal, so he wouldn’t turn on ‘The Family’.”The Family had emerged in 1995 and included Berezovsky, Yeltsin’s wife Naina, his daughter Tatyana and her husband Valentin Yumasheva, politician Aleksandr Voloshin and others. Their priority was self-preservation. Russian political history is full of predecessors being sidelined or destroyed, and Chigirinsky said Putin personally assured them he would protect their interests.View image in fullscreenThe shift to framing Putin as a ‘spy’ may have been triggered by Daniel Craig’s arrival as James Bond.Photograph: United Artists/Columbia Pictures/AllstarBoth Badanin and Chigirinsky agree that the image of Putin as a powerful KGB spy was constructed retrospectively and has little to do with reality. Even the claims about his “recruitment work” during his KGB years in Dresden from 1985 to 1990 do not stand up to scrutiny; most of these stories were added later as part of the wider mythology around him. As Badanin puts it: “He handled paperwork and technical tasks, not operations. In essence, he was a low-level clerk who spent 10 years in the internal intelligence system, not someone engaged in actual agent work.”In a strange intermingling of fact and fiction, the shift to framing Putin as a “spy” may in part have been triggered by Daniel Craig’s arrival as James Bond. His harder, more minimalist interpretation of 007 prompted Russian media and online audiences to draw visual parallels with Putin. By 2011, mashup posters replacing Craig’s face with Putin’s on Casino Royale artwork appeared on central streets in Moscow. Their origin was never officially established, and they were removed relatively quickly by municipal services, but the images were widely photographed and picked up by international tabloids, feeding the growing tendency to frame Putin as a Russian 007.The Wizard of the Kremlin review – Jude Law is Putin in adaptation of Kremlin spin doctor bestsellerRead moreBut if the parallels between Putin and Craig were always somewhat manufactured, the situation is different with Law, an actor who has been popular with Russian audiences across generations. The Kremlin will not miss the chance to frame his casting as a minor diplomatic triumph, much as it once framed the proposed invitation for Putin to meet Donald Trump in Alaska. The fact that the film shows none of the mass protests, the opposition or Alexei Navalny, despite covering events up to 2019, is a pleasant bonus for the propaganda.In Russian cinema and television, Putin is portrayed as an omnipotent figure who never appears on screen. His presence is instead signalled through portraits in the offices of governors and ministers or calls “from above”. Now, in Assayas’s film, he finally acquires a face.Natasha Kiseleva is an exiled Russian journalist based in GermanyExplore more on these topicsFilmVladimir PutinRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We must believe himTue 6 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 07.17 ESTShareAs Venezuela’s skyline lit up underUS bombs, we were watching the morbid symptoms of a declining empire. That may sound counterintuitive. After all, the US has kidnapped a foreign leader, and Donald Trump has announced that he will “run” Venezuela. Surely this looks less like decay than intoxication: a superpower high on its own force.But Trump’s great virtue, if it can be called that, is candour. Previous US presidents draped naked self-interest in the language of “democracy” and “human rights”. Trump dispenses with the costume.In 2023, he boasted: “When I left, Venezuela was ready to collapse. We would have taken it over, we would have gotten all that oil, it would have been right next door.” And this was no off-the-cuff remark. The logic of an oil grab, and much more besides, is laid out plainly in Trump’s recently publishedNational Security Strategy.The document accepts something long denied in Washington: that US global hegemony is over. “After the end of the Cold War, American foreign policy elites convinced themselves that permanent American domination of the entire world was in the best interests of our country,” it declares with barely concealed contempt. “The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.” These are the strategy’s unceremonious funeral rites for US superpower status.Venezuela attack could embolden China and Russia, says Emily ThornberryRead moreWhat replaces it is a world of rival empires, each enforcing its own sphere of influence. And for the US, that sphere is theAmericas. “After years of neglect,” the strategy pronounces, “the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.” The Monroe doctrine, formulated in the early 19th century, purported to block European colonialism. In practice, it laid the foundations for US domination over its Latin American back yard.Violence in Latin America facilitated by Washington is hardly new. My parents took in refugees who had fled Chile’s rightwing dictatorship, installed after the socialist president Salvador Allende was overthrown in aCIA-backed coup. “I don’t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people,”declaredthe then US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Similar logic underpinned US support for murderous regimes in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia, as well as across Central America and the Caribbean.But in the last three decades, that domination has been challenged. The so-called “pink tide” of progressive governments, spearheaded by Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, sought to assert greater regional independence. And, crucially, China – the main US rival – has grown in power across the continent. The two-way goods trade between China and Latin America was 259 times larger in2023than it was in 1990. China is now the continent’ssecond largesttrading partner, behind only the US. At the end of the cold war, it did not even make the top 10. Trump’s assault on Venezuela is just the opening move in an attempt to reverse all of this.The experience of Trump’s first term has led too many to conclude that the strongman in the White House was all bluster. Then, he reached an accommodation with the traditional Republican elite. The unwritten bargain was simple: deliver tax cuts and deregulation, and he could vent endlessly on social media. Second-term Trump is a full-fat far-right regime.When he menaces the democratically elected presidents ofColombia and Mexico– believe him. When he declares,with barely concealed relish, that “Cuba is ready to fall,” believe him. And when he states, “We do need Greenland, absolutely”, believe him. He really does intend to annex more than 2m sq km of European territory.If – when – Greenland is swallowed by a Trumpian empire, what then? Trump will have noted the pitifully weak European response to his brazenly illegal assault onVenezuela. But a US seizure of Danish sovereign territory would surely spell the end of Nato, founded on the principle of collective defence. Denmark’s land would be stolen no less blatantly than Russia’s devouring of Ukraine. Whatever muted noises have emerged from London, Paris or Berlin, the western alliance would be finished.When the Soviet Union collapsed, US elites convinced themselves they were militarily invincible and that their economic model marked the endpoint of human development. That hubris led directly to catastrophe in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and the financial crash of 2008. US elites promised their people utopian dreams, and then dragged them from one disaster to another. Trumpism itself emerged from the resulting mass disillusionment. But the “America First” response to US decline is to abandon global dominance in favour of a hemispheric empire.What does that leave the US itself? When the US defeated Spain at the end of the 19th century and seized the Philippines, leading dignitaries founded the American Anti-Imperialist League. “We hold that the policy known as imperialism is hostile to liberty and tends toward militarism,”they declared, “an evil from which it has been our glory to be free.”“We assert that no nation can long endure half republic and half empire,” the Democratic party asserted in the1900 presidential election, “and we warn the American people that imperialism abroad will lead quickly and inevitably to despotism at home.” In the end, informal empire replaced direct colonialism, and American democracy – always deeply flawed – endured.Is Starmer’s silence on Venezuela worth it? – podcastRead moreWho would dismiss such warnings as exaggeration now? What happens abroad cannot be divorced from what happens at home.This is the imperial “boomerang”, as Martinican author Aimé Césaire defined it three quarters of a century ago, analysing how European colonialism returned to the continent in the form of fascism. We have already watched the “war on terror” boomerang in this way: its language and logic repurposed for domestic repression. “The Democrat party is not a political party,” Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, declared last summer. “It is a domestic extremist organisation.” National guard troops are dispatched into Democratic-run cities like occupying forces, echoing the “surges” once unleashed on Afghanistan or Iraq.Seen this way, Trump’s indulgence of Russian ambitions in Ukraine is hardly mysterious.Back in 2019, Russia reportedly proposed offering increased US influence in Venezuela in exchange for the US retreating from Ukraine. Who knows if such a deal has been made. What is certainly true is that a new world order is being born. It is one where increasingly authoritarian powers use brute force to subjugate their neighbours and steal their resources. What once might have sounded like dystopian fantasy is being assembled in plain sight. The question is whether we have the means, willingness and ability to fight back.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist.

That was thereasonNicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leaderillegally abductedby US forces at the weekend, had given for Donald Trump’s fixation with his country. A better way to think about Venezuela is that oil was necessary but not sufficient. The presence ofvast reservesmade Mr Trump’s interest understandable – if Venezuela’s main export was bananas this would not have happened. But oil alone cannot explain the timing or scale of the move.Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy as well as expensive and slow to bring online; it will not immediately transform US energy systems, norrescuerefineries that have already adapted to years without it. Instead, oil is the “prize” around which otheragendas cohere. These include future profits for US firms; modest downward pressure on oil prices; depriving China of a meaningful ally in America’s backyard; putting pressure on Cuba; and US domestic political signalling in Florida. Each gain is small. But collectively Mr Trump could justify a high‑profile, theatrical – and unlawful – intervention even if the economic returns are incremental.Oil has been Venezuela’s curse as well as its blessing. Built on oil rentssince the 1920s, Venezuela’s booms overvalued its currency and made it import-dependent. A political pact in the 1960s that divided hydrocarbon spoils according to vote share amplified the damage, leaving Caracas dangerously exposed when oil prices collapsed in the early 1990s. That shockhasteneda failed coup led by a young military officer, Hugo Chávez. Six years later, Chávez was elected president, pledging to deploy oil wealth to reduce poverty and inequality.This year history looks like it is repeating itself. In 2002, theBushadministration covertly backed a business-ledcoupthat briefly toppled Chávez. The interim government dissolved democratic institutions and signalled a reversal ofstate-ledoil sector reforms. But mass protests saw Chávez’s return. The episode proved formative. It hardened the regime and entrenched an ideologicalstate machinery. This treated political opposition as an existential threat and used oil cash to develop patronage networks and secure military support.When oil pricescollapseda year after Chávez’s death in 2013, his Venezuela collapsed with them: dollars vanished; food and medicine became scarce; living standards tumbled.Eight million fled. Mr Maduro printed money to plug the gaps but, lacking productive capacity, the result was hyperinflation. Ad hoc fixes followed – andcorruptionflourished. The gap between Mr Maduro’s “man of the people” image and the rising wealth of insiders finished off the regime’s legitimacy. But removing Mr Maduro does not remove the system. Anyone outside Chavismo would inherit a state they do not control. Power still rests with Chavismo’s networks of fixers and generals. Small wonder, then, that Mr Trump left Mr Maduro’s deputy,Delcy Rodríguez, in charge.US sanctionsworsenedVenezuela’s slump, but lifting them alone will not restore growth: the industrial base has been hollowed out and skilled labour gone. IfUS oil majorstake a larger share of revenues, Caracas will be more cash-strapped than before. It is hard not to recall Iraq – not because Venezuela is Iraq, but because of how the decision was made. No single rationale was decisive about Caracas. Oil, drugs, ideological fixation and presidential ego all featured. Each was not enough on its own; together they saw Mr Trump make a high‑risk move with no clear endgame.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

From 336,000 places accepted in 1997, the total rose by 68% to 563,000 in 2022. In last year’s student experience survey,just 11% of undergraduatessaid that they regretted their decision to take a degree.In an interview with this newspaper at the weekend,Prof Shitij Kapur, the vice-chancellor of King’s College London, stressed that one consequence of this increased access has been that degrees no longer confer a virtually automatic graduate job. His likening of a degree to a visa – or a “chance” rather than a guarantee – was striking, and he is right that the increased difficulties of graduates in finding suitable work must be taken seriously. Along with rising student debt and the less favourable terms now attached to loans, this tighter graduate job market explains why, having reached Tony Blair’s target of 50% in 2017, the proportion of young people now going to university has since fallen.Reduced security for graduates was not the only price paid for expansion.Universitiesthemselves are under huge financial pressure, as public funding has contracted and other sources of income have been stretched thinner and thinner. Academic careers have become increasingly precarious as permanent jobs have disappeared.If the sector looked forward to better treatment under a Labour government, its hopes have been dashed. No sooner had Bridget Phillipson announced plans to change the law so thattuition fees will in future risewith inflation, than another decision wiped out the modest gains from this one. From 2028, universities must pay anew flat tax or “levy”of £925 for every international student that they recruit. Coming on top of tighter visa restrictions, which have already made such recruitment harder, some universities will find it increasingly difficult to balance their books. As students and academics return to campuses this month, 24 institutions are regarded by their regulator, the Office for Students, as beingat risk of collapsewithin 12 months. More could exit the market in the next few years.Further strikes, cuts and closures are likely. But judging by the plans published so far, ministers are ill-prepared for what is coming. The white paper published in the autumn said that universities should work more closely with further education providers. It also promised reform of the research excellence framework and a new power for theOffice for Studentsto cap numbers. But while such problem-solving measures are fine in themselves, they do not add up to an overall strategy, or explain what the promised “change of approach” is meant to achieve.Despite all their difficulties, universities remain an enormous and irreplaceable national asset. As well as educating millions of people, they generate about £24bn in export earnings, which isabout 1% of GDP– more than aircraft manufacturing and legal services combined, as a recentstudy of public attitudesto higher education pointed out. It was right for ministers to make skills policy a priority. Reform of the options for school leavers and adult learners was long overdue. But ministers cannot continue to ignore the impossible situation that universities have been placed in by successive governments. They need a policy of their own.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromSheila ColeTue 6 Jan 2026 12.27 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 13.27 ESTShareAs a vegan of nearly 40 years, I agree with much of what Dean Weston says about animal welfare (Letters, 30 December). But as a former civil engineer, I cannot overlook the massive category mistakes in his assertion that the government’s animal welfare strategy “treats animal suffering the way Victorian engineers treated cholera. Add a valve here, a filter there, and never question the sewer itself.”Victorian engineers did not “treat” cholera, but were arguably more effective than the medical profession in dealing with the disease. They reduced the prevalence of cholera precisely by constructing adequate sanitation. “The sewer itself” was the solution, not the problem.Weston says: “If animals matter, stop eating them.” This is a cri de coeur (with which I concur), not a policy for meaningful change. Victorian engineers can inspire us to make structural changes in animal welfare that really make a difference.Rev Canon Dr Rob KelseyNorham, NorthumberlandWe were eating roast chicken one Sunday when my son was six and my daughter three. He, even then a vegetarian, looked at her plate and said: “How can you eat animals?” “I’m not eating animals,” she replied. “I’m eating meat.” He then asked: “Where do you think meat comes from?” She answered: “From Marks & Spencer’s – I bought it with Daddy.” My son, now in his 40s, is still a vegetarian, my daughter still a meat-eater. Perhaps if young children were made more acutely aware of how animals end up on their plates, more would choose not to eat them.Jennifer JenkinsLondonCan 2026 be the year that we start catering for cool vegans and vegetarians? However much I wish to give up meat, my digestive system objects very painfully to eating anything containing chilli or mustard. I cannot be the only person who would like to see foods flavoured with other herbs and spices beyond the constant offerings of vegetarian curries and chilli dishes. Please, please cater for cool vegetarians.Sheila ColeEvesham, WorcestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A grand reckoning awaits us, 29 January).I grew up with the capitalism of Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath, in a society where the NHS worked, our industry and transport remained a vibrant reflection of British pride and ingenuity, the population were housed, and rents and mortgages were within the reach of ordinary wage earners.Reich notes that the rot in the US began with Ronald Reagan, while in our case, Margaret Thatcher’s juggernaut of deregulation, the assault on union membership and the replacement of our industrial base with an economy trumpeting shopping, house prices and the stock market has resulted in a brutally unequal society where food banks, shoddy high streets and zero-hours contracts have become the norm.Reich believes that Trump’s acceleration of the US nightmare is being confronted by protest. We also need, as a society, to force the pace of change. The odd nudge towards Whitehall will not cut the mustard.Tony RowlandsBristolRobert Reich has been a consistent and brave critic and possibly the most reliable of commentators on how freedoms are being eroded by the Trump government. I read his article without surprise, but I found this paragraph chilling:“But over the last 40 years, starting withRonald Reagan, the US has gone off the rails: deregulation, privatisation, free trade, wild gambling by Wall Street, union-busting, monopolisation, record levels of inequality, stagnant wages for most, staggering wealth for a few, big money taking over politics. Corporate profits became more important than good jobs and good wages for all; stock buy-backs and the wellbeing of investors more important than the common good.”If you substitute Margaret Thatcher for Ronald Reagan and the City of London for Wall Street, it summarises precisely what has happened here. Even worse, many of our key services and resources are now owned and managed by overseas organisations that have no interest in UK wellbeing and stability if it gets in the way of profit. The NHS federated data platform, supplied by the US data analytics company Palantir despitedoctors’andMPs’ concernsandpublic resistance, exemplifies how our current government, far from waking up to the inherent dangers posed by neoliberal economics as Robert Reich advocates, is persisting with them.Kate PurcellCoventryHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters fromJohn RobinsonandEric SkidmoreTue 6 Jan 2026 12.27 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 13.27 ESTShareThe concern expressed by Yoshua Bengio that advanced AI systems might one day resist being shut down deserves careful consideration (AI showing signs of self-preservation and humans should be ready to pull plug, says pioneer, 30 December). But treating such behaviour as evidence of consciousness is dangerous: it encourages anthropomorphism and distracts from the human design and governance choices that actually determine AI behaviour.Many systems can protect their continued operation. A laptop’s low-battery warning is a form of self-preservation in this sense, yet no one takes it as evidence that the laptop wants to live: the behaviour is purely instrumental, without experience or awareness. Linking self-preservation to consciousness reflects a human tendency to ascribe intentions and feelings to artefacts and not any intrinsic consciousness.Crucially, consciousness is neither necessary nor relevant for legal status: corporations have rights without minds. If AI needs regulation, it is because of its impact and power, and to locate human accountability, not because of speculative claims about machine consciousness.The comparison with extraterrestrial intelligence is even more misleading. Extraterrestrials, if they exist, would be autonomous entities beyond human creation or control. AI systems are the opposite: deliberately designed, trained, deployed and constrained by humans, with any influence mediated through human decisions.Underlying all this is a point the article largely overlooks: AI systems are, like all computing systems, Turing machines with inherent limits. Learning and scale do not remove these limits, and claims that consciousness or self-preservation could emerge from them would require an explanation, currently lacking, of how subjective experience or genuine goals arise from symbol manipulation.We should take AI risks seriously. But doing so requires conceptual clarity. Confusing designed self‑maintenance with conscious self-preservation risks misdirecting both public debate and policy. The real challenge is not whether machines will want to live, but how humans choose to design, deploy and govern systems whose power comes entirely from us.ProfVirginia DignumDirector, AI Policy Lab, Umeå University, SwedenThere was I, having a relaxed end-of-the-year read of my favourite newspaper, when I reached your articles on Yoshua Bengio’s concerns about artificial intelligence and on the work of AI safety researchers in California (The office block where AI ‘doomers’ gather to predict the apocalypse, 30 December).I have to admit to feeling terror that some of the science-fiction horrors foretold during my 84-year lifetime are now upon us and that the world is probably about to sit back and watch itself being taken over at best, or destroyed at worst, by the machines.The humans driving this process are interested only in power and unimaginable profit; the naysayers are complacent and the rest of us can only keep our fingers crossed in the hope that enough governments will have the strength, courage and awareness to say: “Stop!” Sadly, given our current crop of world leaders, I’m not holding my breath.John RobinsonLichfieldReading your article on the “need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control [AIs], including the ability to shut them down if needed” reminded me of the letter from Gerry Rees (29 December), referring to the short story Answerby Fredric Brown, dating from 1954.The answer by the computer that there is now a god prompts the questioner to attempt to turn it off, but a bolt from the sky kills the questioner and seals the switch shut. An AI trained on a large language model would, perhaps, have “read” this story as part of its training and would, in consequence, have a ready-made answer to any safeguards suggested above.Eric SkidmoreGipsy Hill, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Survive losing a crucial European final against one of the worst Tottenham teams in living memory. He could survive losing at home against West Ham and Wolves, finishing 15th, the tactical inflexibility, laying waste to some of the club’s best homegrown talent, the 32% win rate, calling his team the worst in Manchester United history. But there was one adversary with whom Ruben Amorim wouldnot be allowed to dance. You come at Jason Wilcox, and you best not miss.Unfortunately, like many a Premiership right-back in Blackburn’s title-winning 1994‑95 season, Amorim came at Jason Wilcox and appears to have missed. Even the most distracted of readers will notice the irony here: a coach who often railed at his players for losing one-on-one duels crumbling in the face of the white heat and animal charisma of one of the Premier League’s most feared sporting directors.Ruben Amorim axed: what now for Manchester United? Football Weekly - podcastRead moreFrankly this whole bruising episode seems to paint Jason Wilcox in a whole new light. Perhaps it might have been easy, based on his nine months of experience in a similar role at Southampton, to regard Jason Wilcox as little more than a drudge in the United exoskeleton: a man who owed his position as much to his friendship with his former boss Omar Berrada as any verifiable talent. How wrong we all were. In brilliantly outmanoeuvring United’s feted head coach, as he outmanoeuvred the hapless Dan Ashworth before him, Jason Wilcox has proved himself as one of the sport’s true generals: a strategic mind of which United’s mid-table rivals will now be rightly wary.For example, it was Jason Wilcox who, having been part of the hierarchy that hired the 3-4-3 fundamentalist Amorim in the first place, was instrumental in trying to persuade Amorim to abandon his beloved 3-4-3. Naturally, these entreaties met a certain resistance. But perhaps these judgments carry more weight when delivered from the mouth of a man of the unimpeachable football pedigree of Jason Wilcox, a veteran of three England caps and a role in a title‑winning side from 31 years ago.Perhaps in time Jason Wilcox may be persuaded to explain his thought processes to the rest of us. Perhaps at some point he might be asked why Amorim is walking away with a full payout, with no compensation reduction clause in place. But Jason Wilcox speaks rarely in public, and with very good reason. The real thinkers of this sport – men like Jason Wilcox – simply operate at a level beyond our own prosaic understanding. If he ever did speak, most likely all we would hear is a series of ultrasonic blips and four-dimensional whirring. Wanting is not quite the same as being ready to receive.View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly proposed playing Bryan Mbeumo at right wing-back.Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty ImagesBut of course, in training our focus on Jason Wilcox we are obscuring the true genius behind the modern United throne. Jason Wilcox is, after all, simply carrying out the commands of his ultimate line manager, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in private has made very clear his preference for a back four. According to reports, Ratcliffe has also proposed playing Bryan Mbeumo as a right wing-back. Ratcliffe is keen for United to embrace data science and analytics. According to ESPN, in an executive meeting early in his minority ownership, he announced that United’s style of play “will be determined in this room”.After all, Sir Jim is an expert in this technical footballing stuff, drawing from his previous experience in petrochemicals and sailing. Above all he is incredibly rich and, as we all know, the rich are the best of us: more insightful, more wise, more tactically astute, simplysuperior. Who else would you trust to oversee an enlightened programme of cost-cutting, the construction of a new stadium that looks a lot like someone’s leftover knitting, the signing of Benjamin Sesko?From academy to Champions League: next manager’s Manchester United in-trayRead moreThis is a trend we are increasingly seeing at the elite levels of the game. For decades clubs foolishly entrusted big footballing decisions to low-level employees like managers, scouts – even footballers. Perhaps it was once possible for a young, visionary coach with ideas and energy to go into a club and see their vision supported to fruition. But how many businesses have these guys set up? How many mass redundancies have they overseen? Better by far to invest the real power where it rightly belongs: the executive class, the open-necked shirt brigade, the guys with the jaw-dropping LinkedIn profiles. Better by far to determine the tactics in the boardroom and hire someone who can tailor their offering accordingly. If coaches were once chefs, they are now more akin to Deliveroo drivers: not really responsible for the food, but still ultimately answerable if it arrives cold or leaks out of the box.In the meantime, their job has become less about defining the vision and more about selling it: the receptionist on the front desk, the public face of an organisation they can do little to influence. Enzo Maresca at Chelsea takes a squad of literal children into the Champions League and wins two medium-sized trophies, and essentially gets sacked for talking. Wilfried Nancy at Celtic seeshis reputation ruinedwhile the people who hired him live to blunder another day.Perhaps on some microcosmic level this is simply neoliberalism in action: the elevation of a gilded overclass who can never be wrong, whose decisions are always sacrosanct, whose mistakes can always be sacked away without explanation. Hire the 3-4-3 coach and then dismiss him for playing too much 3-4-3. Hire the process guy and then bin him for taking too long. And above all be grateful; for your modest season ticket price rises, for your new summer signings, for the fact that the grownups – however well qualified – are in charge.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimcommentShareReuse this content"

The London Stadium was half empty on another dismal night, encapsulating the apathy gripping this miserable club, and it is hard to see a way out for Nuno Espírito Santo’s accident prone side after a combination of ­misfortune and dismal defending left them seven points belowNottingham Forestin 17th place.There was a disallowed goal for Crysencio Summerville when West Ham were leading 1-0 at the start of the second half. Nuno had charged around his technical area, a big grin spread across his face, but he was watching in despair moments later. Forest replied straight away, Nicolás Domínguez heading in an opportunistic equaliser, and they boosted their survival hopes when a clumsy attempt at a clearing punch from Alphonse Areola sparked the video assistant referee review that ended with Morgan Gibbs-White scoring the winning penalty in the 89th minute.West Ham v Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreIt does not matter that West Ham produced one of their livelier displays of the season. They grumbled at Tony Harrington pointing to the spot after a flapping Areola flattened Gibbs-White but this was a missed opportunity. Forest were poor. They were booed off at half-time and for a while it seemed the only thing Sean Dyche’s side were going to get right was show safe hands when West Ham passed them the Premier League’s crisis baton.That, of course, reckoned without West Ham’s self-destructive tendencies. They have not kept a clean sheetsince appointing Nunoand, although they mustered some fight after theshocker at Wolves, they ultimately lacked the belief and organisation to close the gap on Forest to one point.“We have to keep believing,” Nuno said. “It is about how we react. We have to realise we did enough to win. It’s not over. There’s a lot of football still to be played.”Yet there has been no improvement under Nuno. West Ham are winless in 10 games and there was some pointed talk from Tomas Soucek after an eighth defeat at home this season. “We have to be honest with each other and it will show who cares or not,” the midfielder said.“If ­someone is relaxed then they should be out of the squad.”Nuno, whose position will surely be reviewed now, did not detect a lack of effort against his former club. The issue was more that West Ham are short of tactical discipline and quality after years of shoddy recruitment.View image in fullscreenNicolás Domínguez’s header loops into the West Ham net.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe frustration was that a better team would have beaten Forest, who didn’t have to play particularly well to ease the pressure on Dyche by ending a run of four straight defeats.Forest fell behind when the ineffective Omari Hutchinson conceded a needless corner in the 13th minute. Summerville crossed and Soucek’s flick went in off Murillo.Soon, though, there were anti-board chants from the home fans. Nuno is symptom rather than cause. Repeated errors from David Sullivan, West Ham’s largest shareholder and most influential figure, are the real reason why this weekend’s FA Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers will feel like an early taste of life in the Championship next season.Desperation has taken hold. West Ham have backed Nuno, landing his targets. Taty Castellanos, the£26m Argentinian striker, showed willing before tiring on his debut. Pablo Felipe, a Brazilian forward plucked from the Portuguese top flight last week, also came on. It remains to be seen if these players can save West Ham.It is certainly strange that West Ham look ready to let Callum ­Wilson depart five months after joining the club. The experienced striker was withdrawn from the squad on the day of the game and is expected to leave by mutual consent.Perhaps Forest will pick Wilson up. They were blunt for long spells – Igor Jesus struggled – and have toiled since a 3-0 defeat by West Ham in August signalled the end of Nuno’s time at the City Ground. The initial momentum generated by Dyche faded during the festive period and there have been reports that Edu’s job as Forest’s global head of football is under threat.“There was a lot of noise around the game,” Dyche said. “We’ve played better since I’ve been at the club. But today wasn’t about that. It was about the winning mentality. It can’t always be beautiful.” Forest’s threats before half-time were limited to Neco Williams testing Areola and Callum Hudson-Odoi hitting the bar. Dyche saw too much ineffective passing. He told his side to be more direct in the second half and they improved after Summerville’s goal was disallowed for offside against Castellanos.Soon it was 1-1, Elliot Anderson’s corner met by Domínguez, the header drifting over Kyle Walker-Peters on the line. It was West Ham’s 13th concession from a set piece this season. They chased a winner and there were chances for Jarrod Bowen, Pablo and Walker-Peters. But the sinking feeling grew after Areola’s foul on Gibbs-White.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was 2-0 on 32 minutes and this time Diallo was the creator as his trickery on the right wing ended with a low cross that was cleverly left by Franck Kessié and the ball reached Diomande, who side-footed into the net from 18 yards.The Burkinabé were inches away from pulling a goal back when Dango Ouattara’s shot from a tight angle hit a post, but it proved a rare bright moment. The Ivorians kept pushing forward and Touré broke free on the left-hand side of the box as full time loomed. With Koffi perhaps expecting a cross, the teenage winger instead slotted in at the near post for his second of the campaign.TheAlgeriasubstitute Adil Boulbina slammed home a last-gasp winner a minute from the end of extra time as his side overcame theDemocratic Republic of the Congo1-0 to book a place in the quarter-finals.View image in fullscreenAdil Boulbina lets fly for what proved to be Algeria’s winner.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APJust as the game was headed to a penalty shootout, Boulbina cut in off the left wing before unleashing a dipping shot that flew in, clipping the underside of the crossbar on the way.It was as much as the more enterprising Algeria deserved, having created more opportunities throughout the encounter. They will now be up against Nigeria in their quarter-final in Marrakech on Saturday.Algeria dominated the early stages at the Stade Moulay El Hassan as DRC adopted a cautious approach, and flying full-back Rafik Belghali caused panic when he whipped in a 21st-minute cross that the DRC captain, Chancel Mbemba, almost turned into his own net. But by the midway point of the half, DRC had forged a good chance of their own with a breakaway from Cédric Bakambu that forced a save from the Algeria goalkeeper Luca Zidane. The resultant corner was headed narrowly wide by Axel Tuanzebe.Algeria’s captain, Riyad Mahrez, made relatively little contribution but, before being taken off in the 70th minute, he drove a free-kick narrowly over the crossbar. His teammates, however, probed in the closing stages and saw Mohamed Amoura strike an effort from an angle straight at the Congolese goalkeeper Lionel Mpasi, who made another smart stop to deny Anis Hadj Moussa in the 86th minute.Mpasi, a reserve at Ligue 1’s Le Havre, kept his side in the contest in extra time with two sharp saves from Farès Chaïbi in the final 10 minutes but there was nothing he could do to stop Boulbina’s piledriver.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Côte d’Ivoire football teamBurkina FasoAlgeria football teamDemocratic Republic of the Congo football teamAfrica Cup of NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Austrian’s contract expires this summer and the ambitious 51-year-old is understood to be open then to joining United or another big club.Glasner held discussions with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, over a new deal this season but talks were put on ice during a hectic run of fixtures, the FA Cup winners playing two games a week since the end of August owing to European commitments. He revealed more talks are expected after Palace begin their FA Cup defence against Macclesfield on Saturday but offered no guarantees he will stay.Manchester City weigh up move for Guéhi after Gvardiol breaks shinboneRead more“I think in the next weeks we will intensify the talks,” Glasner said. “Everyone gets three days off after Macclesfield and then we have to target four regular weeks and in those weeks we will intensify the talks and I expect to find a final decision.”Asked whether the uncertainty over his future was a distraction, he said: “I don’t really care about it, because I can’t affect it if there are rumours, speculation. That’s why I don’t want to respond to it, because I can sign today, or a player can sign today, a contract extension and leave in summer … The length of a contract in these times doesn’t say anything about your future.”Manchester City are weighing up a bid for Guéhi, with Palace thought to want £40m for their captain despite his contract expiring in the summer. Glasner conceded that the England defender’s future was out of his hands. “Everybody wants that he plays for Crystal Palace, signs a new contract and stays here for ever,” he said.“On the other side, there’s the situation that the contract ends in the summer and if somebody is coming, there will be a moment when the club says: ‘Now the financial issue is more important than the sport issue.’ We have to do it and try to get the best. That’s why I’m always saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Because this is different.“There will be a threshold where the club has to say [sell] … If the player says: ‘I want to leave’ and the money is above the threshold, it will happen. I’m not so naive not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.”Injury-hit Palace will be without Nathaniel Clyne and Jefferson Lerma against Aston Villa on Wednesday, although Chris Richards will be back among the substitutes after a foot injury. Glasner said he was in “constant discussion” with Parish over adding reinforcements in January after signing Brennan Johnson from Tottenham for a club record £35m but denied that his future could depend on how much backing he gets in the transfer market.“Believe me, nothing that happens in the transfer window, nothing, affects my decision, in both directions,” he said. Glasner also said Romain Esse is expected to join Coventry on loan until the end of the season.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

He has longstanding relationships with three of the five sporting directors and will know from his time at Strasbourg, who are part of the same ownership, that the head coach’s best chance of surviving is not to make the mistake of rebelling against the structure.Rosenior will have to show more political savvy than Enzo Maresca, whotalked himself out of the joblast week. Yet given the 41‑year‑old is familiar with the working conditions at BlueCo, the investment vehicle that owns Chelsea and Strasbourg, his biggest challenge is unlikely to be managing upwards. Rosenior will know where to train his focus and not to rock the boat. Crucially, he does not inherit a team in crisis. Chelsea are fifth and earned acreditable draw at Manchester Cityon Sunday; despite the rancour of Maresca’s final days, this is not a situation that calls for a major rebuild.Liam Rosenior confirmed as Chelsea head coach on contract to 2032Read moreIt will be more about minor adjustments for Rosenior. He needs to rouse Cole Palmer, whose season has been disrupted by a groin injury, and work out how to eradicate Chelsea’s habit of throwing away leads, particularly at home. Better discipline will help. Rosenior will surely not like that his young side are bottom of the fair play table after picking up 43 yellow cards and four reds in 20 league games.But these are things the Englishman can control. Less predictable is how he will be received by Chelsea’s supporters. Already there is a sense of dissatisfaction. A lot of fans are unhappy about how the club have been run under the Todd Boehly‑Clearlake Capital ownership and it is a worry that Rosenior finds himself in the unfortunate position of being perceived by some as a yes man who is getting the job only because his bosses know he will do as he is told.Getting an impressionable young squad on board will be less taxing. Although Rosenior has never dealt with stars such as Palmer and Enzo Fernández, this is a milder dressing room compared with the one run by John Terry. The players will respond to good coaching. However, Maresca had the respect of the team and still ran into problems with supporters who disliked his methodical football, called him a Championship manager in difficult times and decried him as a puppet for the board.It will not be easy for Rosenior to combat a similar narrative, even though it is unfair. Some Chelsea fans are so aggrieved by the manner of Maresca’s departure that they plan to stage a protest against the board before the home game against Brentford on 17 January. For Rosenior, the danger is getting caught in the crossfire. Many fans are not at ease with what they regard as their club’s identity changing.Some complain of a creeping Americanisation on matchdays and are not happy about ticketing processes. Others simply say standards have dropped since the Roman Abramovich era; they join Maresca in questioning the Chelsea project and wonder how Rosenior, whose experience of management in England is limited to stints at Derby and Hull, is qualified to take on a job of this size.The counter, of course, is that Rosenior has more on his CV than Maresca did when Chelsea hired the Italian after he led Leicester to the Championship title. But this is about perception. The fact that Rosenior is part of the system makes fans jumpy. It means he has to get the messaging right. He has to look, feel and speak like a Chelsea manager from day one. The mind goes back to when Graham Potter replaced Thomas Tuchel shortly after the takeover in 2022. Potter was a bright, young English manager and proven in the Premier League, but he was not a big name and it immediately felt ominous when he admitted at his unveiling that he had never been to a Champions League game.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer is key to Chelsea’s fortunes but his season has been disrupted by a groin injury.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockFans pay attention to this stuff. They have seen Chelsea win the Champions League twice and pine for the days when the removal of a manager meant Abramovich would be looking for someone of the calibre of Carlo Ancelotti, José Mourinho or Tuchel.But the culture has changed, broadly because of a strategy led by Behdad Eghbali, Clearlake’s co-founder. Chelsea buy and hire young. It is a long-term project but supporters are impatient and frustration bubbles up when results dip, which often leaves the manager in the firing line.Stamford Bridge has not always been a happy place during the past three years. Potter never settled during his seven months and was showered with abuse during a damaging defeat by Southampton in February 2023. Mauricio Pochettino, a Tottenham hero, also struggled to win people over during his single season and, for all that Maresca tried to cuddle up to supporters during his final weeks, the Italian never really had a warm relationship with the crowd.The problem is that the fans regard managers as a symbol of an ownership many remain unconvinced by. It is almost a learned response to hound them after a disappointing performance. Maresca was booed during and afterhis final game in charge. Take a step back, though, and the interesting question is whether the boos were meant for him or the project as a whole.It means Rosenior is not walking into an easy environment. The pressure will be on immediately. Chelsea are in a battle for the top four, face Arsenal in a Carabao Cup semi-final and have two Champions League games before the end of the month. It is a tough start for Rosenior but rising to the challenge would help him win over the doubters.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Neil Harvey was once the youngest of Bradman’s Invincibles; now he’s 97, his old cricketing buddies gone. His body is a little worn around the edges, but mentally he’s astute.Harvey was Australia’s sweetheart, the second youngest of six brothers, a dashing left-hander, who stalked the covers and hunted at slip. During a 15-year Test career, he cut and shimmied to more than 6,000 runs at an average of 48, making his mark with 153 in his second Test. He was a regular at the SCG, attending every Test from 1949 up until four years ago, when, in the words of his son Bruce he “gave up public appearances” and he has very fond memories of the place.Our readers’ favourite Ashes cricketers: from Bradman and Botham to Warne and WaughRead more“I had such a good time here,” he says over the phone. “Probably the most satisfying moment was 92 not out against Frank Tyson in 1954. We would have won that game, but no one else could stay in with me. [Australia needed 223 to win, no one else made more than 16.] Tyson was as quick as you’ll get, he and Wes Hall were the two fastest bowlers I ever played against. They didn’t let up on you.”The Christmas tree has been packed away, but Harvey is surrounded by other sparkling souvenirs from a life well lived: a crystal cabinet containing napkin rings from Sir Donald Bradman and drinking glasses from Lindsay Hassett, his MBE and OAM. On the walls, a handsome young fellow in his black and white prime smiles back, alongside an award celebrating his membership of the Australian Test team of the 20th century.He still loves Test cricket, but, despite the attacking nature of his own batting, isn’t crazy about Bazball. “I’ve been disappointed in England. I think the way they approach the batting side of things, they get too reckless, nobody seems to want to build an innings, like a Cowdrey or a Boycott.“It might work against ordinary teams but when you get a class side like Australia it’s a different ballgame. I used to score runs relatively quickly, and everyone gets a lot of enjoyment out of it, but when you try to play this Bazball thing it takes the odds away from winning an important Test. I’d like to see them pull their hooves in.”View image in fullscreenNeil Harvey in his heyday when playing for Australia.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyHe loves to watch Kane Williamson and Joe Root – “They’ve been the best batsmen for quite some time, I guess it’s time someone else took a bit of responsibility and challenged them for that” – and thinks Mitchell Starc is a marvel. “He’s got everything, pace and bounce and swinging the ball, he can do anything with it, that’s why he’s up there with one of the greats now.”The future of the Test game, though, concerns him. “Ashes cricket is holding the game together out here, there are so many poor cricket teams playing international cricket, I only wish I’d have played against them. I think these bats they use today are unfair, you don’t have to hit it any more, all you have to do is flex your wrist and hold your bat there, the ball flies off and goes for four. If you have two even teams playing against each other, the stronger batting side will win.”It was nearly 78 years ago that Harvey came to England with Bradman’s great side. He was 21 years younger than his captain, who described him as having the brilliance and daring of youth.“I had a great bunch of fellas to go away with, we went by ship and all got to know each other on the way over. It was just a learning curve for me which I never forgot. I learned so much about life in general from those blokes, they were instrumental for putting me on the right track. They allowed me to have a very nice cricket career, I played the game with great fellas and against some great fellas like Alec Bedser and Freddie Trueman, Peter May and Colin Cowdrey.“I’ve got lots of memories but suppose the obvious one was I my very first Test match against England. I was 19, I never thought I’d get into the side, it was so strong, but through an injury I got a game at the Leeds Test and managed to scrape together a century, it was most satisfying.”View image in fullscreenNeil Harvey, the Australian cricket legend, with his family.Photograph: Family handoutArriving in war-damaged London from Australia was a huge culture shock. “England was very damaged, I can still see St Paul’s cathedral, all the buildings around it were flattened – there must be a message there somewhere. I did four tours over your way, and I’ve actually seen the marvellous city of London just about rebuilt. I’ve always said that it’s the best city I’ve ever been to.”No cricket life passes without disappointments, and Harvey’s was the Australian captaincy. “I thought I had it actually, I thought I was next in line to take over, but the selectors decided that Ian Craig was the man for the job, which hurt me a bit, a 21-year-old taking over the captaincy.“I only captained Australia once, at Lord’s in ’61 [he won], but it couldn’t have happened at a nicer or more beautiful place than Lord’s, my favourite in world cricket. I love what it stands for, I’ve always been a strong follower of history and if you go back to ’48 I met Jack Hobbs there.”Zak Crawley and Jacob Bethell have followed Ben Duckett back into the pavilion during our conversation. Shortly afterwards, Harvey will switch over to the horse racing, another passion, alongside the odd glass of Barossa Shiraz. He also, says Bruce, knows exactly what is going on in world affairs. “In other words,” Harvey chuckles, “I’m not quite dead yet.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

On paper, it was a dream. Jack Draper andEmma Raducanu, the top tennis players in the country and figureheads of a new generation, finally united on the same side of the court.However, recent history has shown that things are never straightforward with Britain’s two greatest hopes. Both players have had to navigate injuries and physical problems in their young careers, so to some fans and onlookers the real question was which player would withdraw first.Draper won that race, but on the first day of the 2026 season neither player was physically prepared to take to the court.Raducanu fails to last distance as Britain suffer bitter United Cup loss to GreeceRead moreOn Sunday, Raducanuwithdrew from her scheduled season openeragainst Naomi Osaka after being sidelined for much of her off-season with a foot injury. She eventually took to the court for Great Britain’s second tie against Greece, where she faced the former world No 3 Maria Sakkari. She handled herself well enough and did not appear to have any issues with her foot. But between her struggles to find her timing early on and howshe rapidly faded physically in set three, her lack of preparation caught up with her.Raducanu has a week to ensure that she is better prepared for her first individual tournament at the Hobart WTA 250 event. For now, the situation surrounding Draper is more curious. He withdrew from the entire Australian Open swing due to his recovery from the bone bruise injury to his left arm, meaning this latest injury saga will last at least six months. He played just one match in this period, winning in the first round at the US Open thenwithdrawing from the tournament.During his injury announcement in December, Draper admirably opted to take an optimistic outlook on his situation. He said he was in the final stages of his recovery and close to a return. One of the key factors in his decision to skip Australia altogether, he noted, was the prospect of competing in the gruelling best-of-five-sets format at the Australian Open, which he was not ready for. Monday provided more hopeful news with a potential date for Draper’s return. He was named as part of Great Britain’s full‑strength Davis Cup team for their Qualifier tie against Norway on 5 and 6 February, a week after the Australian Open.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu on her way to defeat against Maria Sakkari at the United Cup.Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesStill, this is a devastating period in the 24-year-old’s career. Draper’s time as a professional has often been defined by injuries and physical issues. In his first ATP match at the Miami Open in 2021, a 19-year-old Draperwas forced to retireafter a tight opening set because of cramps in the difficult Florida heat, an introduction to the tour that in some ways has set the tone for years of battles with his own body.Midway through last year, Draper was understandably hopeful that he was moving past his injury issues. The shoulder injury thatforced him to miss Wimbledonand most of the summer tournaments in 2023 had a transformative effect on his career, pushing him to mature and fully devote himself to his singular goal of fulfilling his potential. His transcendent year between 2024 and 2025 soon followed. Draper reached theUS Open semi-finals, he won his first Masters 1000 titleat Indian Wellsand he rose to No 4 in the ATP rankings, gaining experience and learning lessons.The most concerning part of Draper’s career is how rare the stretches of good health have been. He is still young with many years ahead of him, but he is not a child. Most players around his age have compiled a large number of matches, allowing them to continue their physical and mental evolution.Of those born in the 2000s ranked in the world’s top 10, the 22-year-old Carlos Alcaraz has already played 345 ATP singles main-draw matches, the 24-year-old Jannik Sinner 407, the 25-year-old Félix Auger-Aliassime 436 and the 23-year-old Lorenzo Musetti 310. Draper has contested only 169 in his career. Even the 23-year-old Ben Shelton, who turned professional in August 2022 after spending his earlier years in college, has played 19 more matches than Draper.View image in fullscreenJack Draper has not played since the US Open in August.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APWith that in mind, this is surely a critical year in Draper’s career. His results last year confirmed what has been clear for a long time – Draper is capable of competing for the biggest titles in the world and he is in the conversation as one of the few potential rivals for Alcaraz and Sinner. He has everything he could possibly need, from his destructive, well-rounded left-hand game to his work ethic and mental toughness. Surrounded by a tight, large team of proven professionals, he is clearly doing everything he possibly can to perform at the highest level. He just needs to be healthy.Explore more on these topicsTennisJack DraperEmma RaducanuanalysisShareReuse this content"

So why did a national newspaper devote four and a half pages of its sports section to celebrating him at the weekend? There have been generational British & Irish legends who spawned less coverage than Stephen Jones in recognition of the latter’s42-year stint as rugby correspondentof the Sunday Times.Just think about that for a second. Forty-two years of journalistic thunderbolts and lightning, some of it very, very frightening for those in the firing line. One or two world heavyweight champs have landed fewer career knockout punches than our mate Steve dished out in print every week. If you were to compare his writing to one of the players he most admired, it would probably be Martin Johnson: direct, unflinching to the point of obstinacy, fiercely committed to the sport he adored. When individuals of that calibre step aside, they leave a sizeable hole.Billy Searle pulls the strings as Leicester prove too strong for SaracensRead moreThey may be striking a slightly different tone in New Zealand, of course, where Steve’s Sabbath sermons were never in danger of winning any popularity contests. Who can forget the establishment in Queenstown which, for a while, had a urinal with his face in it. The irony was that he respected the greatest All Blacks as much as anyone. What he disliked was the po-faced notion that Kiwi rugby was somehow exempt from external criticism, particularly from irreverent voices north of the equator.And so he teasingly hammed it up even more, to the point where his targets were so braced for extravagant spin that they started to miss the straight ones. Jonesey’s casually brilliant prose – he still plans to file the occasional column – invariably landed with a compelling thump even when he was wrong. Which, according to rumour, did occasionally happen. Though, as I type, I can already hear the indignant riposte: “Never wrong for long, old son”.Like Jeremy Clarkson he cared diddly squat for his detractors. Less well publicised has been his kindness to many people over the years, including your correspondent. Not that he would wish us to dwell too long here on his softer side. Among the most-asked questions in this line of work – along with “Did you play yourself?” and “What do you do in the summer?” – is that perennial classic: “What is Stephen Jones really like?” The answer, disappointing to relate, is cuddlier than you might think.What a pity he never looked to pursue the really big money and join a proper paper such as the Guardian. Through all those endless winters, however, he did manage to teach us also-rans several invaluable life lessons. And as we hit the first rucks of 2026 two particularly stand out: the timeless importance both of having the courage of your convictions and of preserving the game’s life-enhancing spirit at all costs.Almost everywhere you look there is a pressing need for administrators and the more influential rugby brains to heed both mantras. For much of the past 42 years rugby union’s instinct has been to fudge, delay or obfuscate when it comes to off-field leadership and innovation; when Jones first stood on the pitchside duckboards the Rugby Football Union’s phone number was still ex-directory.View image in fullscreenThe Cardiff Arms Park and Principality Stadium. There is a pressing need for administrators to have the courage of their conviction.Photograph: David Davies/PABut right now, in both hemispheres, there are some urgent nettles to be grasped. If, for example, there is a collective desire to embrace a franchise-based league in England and ban relegation for at least the next five years then for heaven’s sake ensure it is done with vision and for the greater good. And if theChampions Cup formatisn’t working terribly well – which it transparently isn’t – then fix it quickly before the whole concept permanently loses its lustre.Theinaugural Nations Championship, set to kick off this year in a change to the established summer tour rhythm, also needs a vibrant start if it is to be the gamechanger some are hoping it will be. If it merely splutters meekly into life, overshadowed by the football World Cup, Wimbledon et al, and struggles to capture the global imagination, rugby’s grand plans really will be stymied.Then there is the shape of the game. At least a couple of obvious issues have to be resolved asap if the next few years at Test level are not to sink into a quagmire of excessive kicking and ever-larger participants. The “escorting” crackdown that has removed virtually all protection for the ball catcher and massively assisted the kick chasers was brought in with the intention of creating more broken field space. More often than not, instead, it is encouraging teams to hoist the ball skywards, pick athletic giraffes and look to dominate the skies rather than attempt to pass the ball beyond a few phases.Likewise we are all now used to battalions of “impact subs” coming on with half an hour left, reducing both the fatigue factor and opportunities for creative backs to find mismatches against tiring forwards. If no action is taken or a limit is not placed on the permitted number of replacements, the blinkered “might is right” lobby will become as prevalent in rugby as seems increasingly the case in global politics.Above all else, too, the sport must retain its collective sense of humour, without which it just becomes another sport. It should cherish its grassroots and not casually overlook the qualities – the camaraderie, the fellowship, the shared fun – that give it its innate character and still draw in Steve and the rest of us like enthralled moths to a flame. Few, if any, have better articulated that core truth than “Jack” Jones, which is another reason why the whole rugby-reading world should raise a glass to him.This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

We will not let that happen,” the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said at an unofficial hearing his party convened to examine the effects of the attack.The anniversary was the first since Trump returned to office nearly a year ago and immediately pardoned almost everyone convicted or charged over the violence, the crowning achievement of a campaign that Republicans began almost immediately in the attack’s aftermath to blunt public outrage.Noting that some of the roughly 1,500 people whom the president pardoned were convicted of other serious offenses before and after January 6, Jeffries said: “It’s been a Trump-inspired crime spree. Why won’t Republicans in Congress condemn this dangerous behavior and ongoing threat to public safety?”Though the attack sent lawmakers from both parties fleeing when rioters breached the Capitol during the joint session of Congress that certified Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, few Republicans noted the anniversary. Those who did downplayed its severity, or sought to steer blame towards theDemocrats.“On this day in history in 2021, thousands of peaceful grandmothers and others gathered inWashington DCto take a self-guided, albeit unauthorized, tour of the US Capitol building,” Republican congressman Mike Collins wrote on X.He went on to inaccurately claim that the president’s “supporters walked to the Capitol to exercise their First Amendment right about the irregularities of the 2020 election. During this time, some individuals entered the Capitol, took photos, and explored the building before leaving.”Trump made no public comments about the anniversary, and his top officials sought to push his administration’s message that the president deserves no blame for the violence. “Never forget the lies Democrats and the media tried to force upon the American people,” the White House communications director, Steven Cheung, wrote on X.He unveiled a website that offered a distorted timeline of the day’s events. Cheung later described the website as a “trap” that news outlets fell for.View image in fullscreenPardoned January 6 rioters and their supporters gather in front of the White House.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/EPAThe insurrection has been linked to nine deaths as well as dozens of injuries, and it was extensively documented in videos shot by journalists, police and the rioters themselves. A bipartisan congressional committee that investigated the attack determined that Trump should face charges for his involvement,sayinglawmakers “developed significant evidence that President Trump intended to disrupt the peaceful transition of power under our constitution”.In his testimony on Tuesday before the Democratic-convened hearing, former US Capitol police officer Winston Pingeon described being attacked by rioters who said: “President Trump sent us.”“Pardoning criminals who severely beat me and my fellow officers that day is completely unacceptable. We cannot accept violent felons being pardoned and released back into our neighborhoods without consequence. That is not justice,” Pingeon said.Pam Hemphill, a rioter who refused her pardon, said she had appeared at the hearing to “make amends”.“Accepting that pardon would be lying about what happened on January the sixth. I am guilty, and I own that guilt,” she said, adding that she had “fallen for the president’s lies, just like many of his supporters”.The occasion reinvigorated controversy over a plaque that Congress has required by law be installed at the Capitol in honor of the officers who responded to the attack, but which the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has yet to install.“They have a legal requirement to put it up, and I call on Speaker Johnson to put it up today. It’s gathering dust in a closet somewhere,” said Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin.In a speech on the Senate floor, Thom Tillis, a Republican senator who is not seeking re-election after clashing with Trump, simultaneously criticized Democrats for creating “an attitude around here that law enforcement is bad” with their support of the racial justice protests that broke out in 2020 following George Floyd’s death.But he also criticized Trump’s pardons, saying: “We let bad people go, and we sent the message that if you come to this Capitol and you’ve got the right president in office, he’s going to let you get past things … that not any one of us would get away with if we did it back in our home state.”In the afternoon, several dozen protesters, some of whom wore shirts and hats indicating they had received pardons, marched from the White House Ellipse, where Trump delivered his speech five years ago, to the Capitol. They were halted short of its grounds by a line of police officers, but a smaller group was later allowed to go to its west front to place flowers in honor of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was fatally shot by a Capitol police officer as she attempted to breach a barricaded door during the insurrection.Last year, the Trump administration agreed to a nearly $5m payout to her family, and to give Babbitt, an air force and air national guard vet,military honors.Democratic congressman Tom Suozzi briefly confronted the protesters, who hurled insults at him as he asked: “How do you feel about tasing a police officer? How do you feel about committing crimes?”“Oh, we didn’t commit no crimes,” a protester yelled back.In an interview, Enrique Tarrio, the former national leader of the far-right Proud Boys group who was convicted of charges related to the attack on the Capitol and then pardoned by Trump, said he expected such marches would take place every January 6.“I think now people get to see both sides of the coin, and they get to make an informed decision based on that,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS Capitol attackDemocratsRepublicansDonald TrumpUS elections 2020US crimeWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

The construction work would seal a land grab the British government hasdescribed as“a flagrant breach of international law”.Building settlements in this area is a decades-old idea with cross-party backing inIsrael, mooted initially in the 1990s by Yitzhak Rabin, the Labor prime minister and Nobel peace laureate who was assassinated in 1995 by a rightwing nationalist.For years, construction was blocked by the US and the country’s European allies, for the same reason that the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, and key ministers have embraced the plan.Map of Israeli settlements and outposts in the West BankBoth critics and supporters agree that moving tens of thousands of Israeli settlers into a triangle of occupied land between Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah would be critically damaging to efforts to reach a two-state solution.“Construction in E1 is intended to create irreversible facts on the ground leading to a one-state reality, which all indications suggest would take the form of an apartheid regime,” said Mizrachi.Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who is himself a settler, said last year that Donald Trump had abandoned longstanding US opposition to the E1 plan.The state department did not comment on Trump’s position, but in August Israeli authorities gave formal planning approval to the project and Smotrich said it would “bury” the idea of a sovereignPalestine.“Those in the world trying to recognise a Palestinian state will get an answer from us on the ground,” he said at the time. “Not through documents, not through decisions or declarations, but through facts. Facts of homes, neighbourhoods, roads and Jewish families building their lives.”More than 20 countries including Israeli allies France, Canada, Italy and Australia condemned the decision as an unacceptable violation of international law that risked fuelling further violence.Undeterred, Israel pressed ahead with construction planning. In September, the ministry of housing signed an agreement to fund infrastructure construction for E1 and the expansion of neighbouring Ma’ale Adumim, at a ceremony presided over by Netanyahu.“We said there will be no Palestinian state, and indeed there will be no Palestinian state! This place is ours,” Netanyahu said.Sitting beside him was Smotrich, who has been put under sanctions by countries including the UK, Canada and Australia for “repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities”, and the leader of the settler organisation Amana, also sanctioned by the UK for supporting and sponsoring violence against Palestinians.Netanyahu’s enthusiasm has been reflected in the rapid progress towards breaking ground. It would usually take six months to a year to prepare tenders after planning approval for a settlement, rather than just four months for the vast E1 construction, said Hagit Ofran, a settlement expert at Peace Now.If there is similar speed in other stages of approval and securing contracts, builders could be bringing in bulldozers before national elections due to be held by October.“I am afraid we will see construction in coming months,” said Ofran. “They are doing whatever they can now to create as much irreversible [change] as possible throughout the West Bank, as fast as possible.”Winning bids can be selected within days of the tender closing. The next stage is agreeing details of a contract, which usually takes weeks. When the contract is signed, the final step before construction can start is securing building permits from the municipality, which can take months.The infrastructure deal is with the municipality of neighbouring Ma’ale Adumim, as E1 is formally classified as an extension of that settlement towards Jerusalem, rather than a new project.It is only one in a series of settlement expansions pursued by a government with an aggressive construction agenda in occupied Palestine.In December, Israel approved a proposal for19 new settlementsin the occupied West Bank, including two that were previously evacuated under a 2005 plan to withdraw Israeli settlers from Gaza and parts of the West Bank.In 2022, there were 141 settlements across the West Bank. After recently approved settlements are built there will be 210, according to Peace Now.The Israeli military has already been deployed to areas where settlements were evacuated, to set up bases ahead of the arrival of the new settlers.There has also been a surge in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli soldiers and settlers during Israel’s war in Gaza, which a UN commission and Israeli and international rights groups consider genocidal.Since October 2023, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, at least one in five of them children, and tens of thousands have been forcefully displaced from their homes.There is little political opposition to attempts to expand Israeli control of the West Bank from any mainstream Israeli political party, and Israeli soldiers and settlers target Palestinians in a climate of widespreadimpunity.The UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) in 2024ruledthat Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories violated international law. The sweeping advisory opinion ordered Israel to end the occupation “as rapidly as possible” and make full reparations for its “internationally wrongful acts”.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The way my chest hurts when I speak and races, it doesn’t feel too far in the near future.“I know the consequences but I think the onus shouldn’t be on me to answer that question; rather, the onus should be on the government.”The rolling hunger strikebegan on 2 Novemberwith demands including immediate bail, ending theban on Palestine Action, closing down the UK sites of the Israeli arms company Elbit Systems and ending censorship of the prisoners’ communications.Muraisi, Ahmed and Chiaramello will all have spent more than 18 months in jail before they are tried for activities claimed by Palestine Action, well above the standard pre-trial custody limit of six months.Five prisonerspreviously on hunger strikehave paused their action, the latest beingTeuta Hoxha, who stopped refusing food on Saturday after 60 days.The hunger strike is believed to be the biggest such coordinated action in the UK since thoseby IRA prisoners in 1981, when 10 people died. The earliest death was after 46 days and four died between 59 and 61 days.Ahmed said: “I don’t think any of the hunger strikers wish to die, but it’s funny, if I potentially pass away, does it only matter because I have a [UK] passport? Are the Palestinians disposable numbers?”He said watching “random cooking shows”, his Islamic faith and “hearing the protests echo through the Pentonville grounds” had kept him going.Smith dismissed “nonsense” by detractors questioning how the hunger strikers were still alive. “Their bodies are breaking down as we speak,” he said. “And I think the reason that we haven’t necessarily seen something really catastrophic happen yet is that we have, over the course of several decades, seen some advancement in what we know medically, the sort of supplementation they’re getting.”He said heart problems and infections were major risks and hearing and visual problems were particularly concerning because they could relate to neurological functioning.The prisoners minister, James Timpson, said: “Prison healthcare teams provide NHS care and continuously monitor the situation. These prisoners are charged with serious offences including aggravated burglary and criminal damage. Remand decisions are for independent judges, and lawyers can make representations to the court on behalf of their clients.“Ministers will not meet with them – we have a justice system that is based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system. It would be entirely unconstitutional and inappropriate for ministers to intervene in ongoing legal cases.”The Ministry of Justice has said agreeing to the prisoners’request for a meetingwith them or their representatives would create “perverse incentives” for others to put themselves at risk.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Even if it wants to do this, it will be forced to put heavy pressure on the lower deciles of society by printing money. The country’s income is certain and our resources aren’t unlimited,” Pezeshkian said in a speech on Tuesday.The dwindling purchasing power that first triggered the protests has continued to decline, with the Iranian rial dropping to a historic low of 1.46m to the US dollar. The currency has lost about two-thirds of its value in the past three years and its nosedive has accelerated in recent months.Iran’s central bank has meanwhile said as the currency falls that it would curb a programme to businesses that gives a preferential exchange rate on dollars – a move that is likely to lead to further price increases and shortages for consumers.An end to subsidised exchange could further exacerbate shortages in Iranian grocery stores. Iran’s state news agency said the average price of a bottle of cooking oil had recently doubled in price, while other goods are simply unavailable as traders hoard products in anticipation of further inflation.View image in fullscreenA shopkeeper in his store in northern Tehran. The average price of a bottle of cooking oil recently doubled in price.Photograph: Vahid Salemi/APPezeshian said the government may have to tighten its belt, blaming worsening economic conditions on sanctions, saying “oil is under embargo and sources of income are limited”.The president said the government would open an investigation into allegations of security forces’ violence against protesters in Illam province. He also mentioned “an incident in a hospital in the city of Illam”, referencing the footage of officers raiding a hospital there.The videos were directly referenced by the US state department, which said that “beating medical staff and attacking the wounded with teargas and ammunition is a clear crime against humanity”, in a post on X from its Farsi-language account.The Iranian government has been toeing a careful line between an all-out crackdown on protesters and appearing lax, offering dialogue while security forces carried out arrests and at times appeared to use violence against demonstrators.The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday that the demands of protesters were legitimate, but that rioters among the demonstrators should be “put in their place”. The state-aligned Fars news agency said 250 police officers and 45 members of the volunteer paramilitary Basij force were injured in the demonstrations.Donald Trump hasthreatened to intervenein Iran if the government kills protesters, a comment that drew angry warnings from top Iranian officials. The US threat carried extra weight after the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was captured and brought to New York by US forces on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

You cannot simply take a collection of artworks and transplant it into another ecosystem, because such an ecosystem does not exist.”The Antwerp museum’s collection also includes works by international artists such as Kerry James Marshall, Anish Kapoor and Marina Abramović.British artist Kapoor has protested against plans to move his works to Ghent, telling the culture ministry in an email seen by the Guardian: “I cannot accept that they might be removed from M HKA or otherwise put at risk as part of any institutional reorganisation.”Belgium faces a budget deficit of 5.4% of GDP, one of the largest in the eurozone. The arts sector in particular is facing dramatic cuts, with austerity measures also suggesting an uncertain future for Brussels’ new Kanal museum, originally designated to become one of the largest new arts complexes inEuropewhen it is scheduled to open at the end of this year.‘Is this doable?’: why political paralysis threatens an ambitious Brussels arts complexRead moreUnder the proposals of Flanders’ socialist culture minister, Caroline Gennez, the museum sector would be streamlined so that art collections in the region are concentrated at three beacon museums for historical, modern and contemporary art.Flanders has a plethora of contemporary art museums: in addition to M HKA in Antwerp and Smak in Ghent, there is Musea Brugge in Bruges and Museum M in Leuven.View image in fullscreenAnish Kapoor said that he could not accept his works at M HKA being ‘put at risk as part of any institutional reorganisation’Photograph: Action Press/REX/ShutterstockWhether the proposed shake-up would actually lower costs has been questioned by Belgium’s financial inspectorate, however. In a memorandum sent to Gennez in October, it gave an unfavourable opinion on the proposals, suggesting their impact on the budget would be “fragmentary”.While transplanting the museum’s permanent collection could reduce operating costs from around €8m to €5m, it is understood that in future the Antwerp institution would have to spend money to borrow works or buy in exhibitions to attract visitors.Ghent’s Smak, located about an hour’s train ride from the Antwerp museum, is also thought to currently not have enough space to adequately store M HKA’s collection, and would need investment to expand its storage capacity.Explore more on these topicsBelgiumArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Achieving the president’s dream of supercharging the country’s oil production would be financially challenging – and if fulfilled, would be “terrible for the climate”, experts say.Trump has aggressively sought toboost oil and gas productionwithin the US. Now, after the capture and arrest of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, he is seeking to orchestrate a ramp-up of drilling in Venezuela, which has the largest known reserves of oil in the world – equivalent to about 300bn barrels,according toresearch firm the Energy Institute.What role could the US play in Venezuela’s ‘bust’ oil industry?Read more“The oil companies are going to go in, they are going to spend money, we are going to take back the oil, frankly, we should’ve taken back a long time ago,” the US president said after Maduro’s extraction from Caracas. “A lot of money is coming out of the ground, we are going to be reimbursed for everything we spend.”Venezuela’s oil reservesUS oil companies will “spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure … and start making money for the country”, Trump added, with his administration pressing Venezuela’s interim government to delete a law requiring oil projects to be half-owned by the state.Leading US oil businesses such as Exxon and Chevron have so farremained silenton whether they would spend the huge sums required to enact the president’s vision for Venezuela. But should Venezuela ramp up output to near its 1970s peak of 3.7m barrels a day – more than triple current levels – it would further undermine the already faltering global effort to limit dangerous global heating.View image in fullscreenLaw enforcement officials move captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, out of the helicopter in New York on 5 January.Photograph: Adam Gray/ReutersEven raising production to 1.5m barrels of oil a day from current levels of around 1m barrels would produce around 550m tons of carbon dioxide a year when the fuel is burned, according to Paasha Mahdavi, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This is more carbon pollution than what is emitted annually by major economies such as the UK and Brazil.Dense, sticky and heavy: why Venezuelan crude oil appeals to US refineriesRead more“If there are millions of barrels a day of new oil, that will add quite a lot of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and the people of Earth can’t afford that,” said John Sterman, an expert in climate and economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The climate costs would be especially high because Venezuela produces some of the world’smost carbon-intensive oil. Its vast reserves of extra-heavycrudeare particularly dirty, and its other reserves are “also quite carbon- and methane-intensive”, Mahdavi said.The world is close to breaching agreed temperature increase limits – alreadysufferingmoresevereheatwaves,stormsanddroughtsas a result. Increased Venezuelan drilling would further lower global oil prices and slow the needed momentum towards renewable energy and electric cars, Sterman added.“If oil production goes up, climate change will get worse sooner, and everybody loses, including the people of Venezuela,” he said. “The climate damages suffered by Venezuela, along with other countries, will almost certainly outweigh any short-term economic benefit of selling a bit more oil.”During hisfirst year backin the White House, Trump has demanded the world remain running onfossil fuelsrather than “scam” renewables and has threatened the annexation ofCanada, a major oil-producing country, andGreenland, an Arctic island rich with mineral resources.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump returns to the White House on 4 January.Photograph: Andrew Leyden/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockCritics have accused Trump of a fossil fuel-driven “imperialism” that threatens to further destabilize the world’s climate, as well as upend international politics. “The US must stop treating Latin America as a resource colony,” said Elizabeth Bast, the executive director ofOilChange International. “The Venezuelan people, not US oil executives, must shape their country’s future.”Patrick Galey, head of fossil fuel investigations at the climate and justice NGO Global Witness, said Trump’s aggression in Venezuela is “yet another conflict fuelled by fossil fuels, which are overwhelmingly controlled by some of the world’s most despotic regimes”.“So long as governments continue to rely on fossil fuels in energy systems, their constituents will be hostage to the whims of autocrats,” he said.A complex economic pictureThough the president’s stated vision is for US-based oil companies to tap Venezuela’s oil reserves for profit, making good on that promise may be complicated by economic, historical and geological factors, experts say.Oil companies may not be “eager to invest what’s needed because it will take a lot longer than the three years of President Trump’s term”, said Sterman.“That’s a lot of risk – political risk, project risk,” he said. “It seems very tricky.”Trump’s focus on Venezuelan oil reinforces claim action was never about ‘war on drugs’Read moreUpping production is “also just a bad bet generally”, said Galey. “Any meaningful increase in current production would require tens of billions of investment in things like repairs, upgrades and replacing creaking infrastructure,” he said. “That’s not even taking into account the dire security situation.”Venezuela’s oil production has fallen dramatically from its historical highs – a decline experts blame on both mismanagement and US sanctions imposed byBarack Obamaand escalated by Trump. By 2018, the country wasproducingjust 1.3m barrels a day – roughly half of what it produced when Maduro took office in 2013, just over a third of what it produced in the 1990s, and about a third of its peak production in the 1970s.Trump has said US companies will revive production levels and be “reimbursed” for the costs of doing so. But the economics of that expansion may not entice energy majors, and even if they choose to play along, it would take years to meaningful boost extraction, experts say.View image in fullscreenAn abandoned PDVSA facility in the Melones oilfield in El Tigre, Venezuela, on 15 October 2021.Photograph: Manaure Quintero/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBoosting Venezuela’s oil output by 500,000 barrels a day would cost about $10bn and take roughly two years, according toEnergyAspects. Production could reach between 2 and 2.5m barrels a day within a decade by tapping medium crude reserves, Mahdavi said. But returning to peak output would require developing the Orinoco Belt, whose heavy, sulfur-rich crude is far more costly and difficult to extract, transport and refine.Returning to 2m barrels per day by the early 2030s would require about $110bn in investment, according to Rystad Energy, an industry consultancy.“That is going to take much more time and much more money, to be able to get at or close to maybe 3, 4 or 5m barrels a day of production,” said Mahdavi.Despite Trump’s hopes, big oil will be wary of rushing back to Venezuela | Nils PratleyRead moreIncreasing Venezuelan extraction amid booming US production may also be a hard sell. “The heavy Venezuelan crude that could be refined in US Gulf coast installations is likely going to undercut domestic producers, who until Trump kidnapped Maduro had been vocally supportive of sanctions on Venezuelan oil,” said Galey.Some firms may be willing to “eat that uncertainty” because the US plans to provide companies with financial support to drill in Venezuela, said Mahdavi.“If you’re willing to deal with the challenges … you are looking still at relatively cheap crude that will get you a higher profit margin than what you can do in the United States,” he said. “That’s why they’re still interested: it’s way more expensive to drill in, say, the US’s Permian Basin.”Some US oil majors may be more receptive to Trump’s Venezuela strategy. Chevron, the only US company operating in the country, may be poised scale up production faster than its rivals. And ExxonMobil, which has invested heavily in oil production within neighboring Guyana, could benefit from the removal of Maduro, who staunchly opposes that expansion.Overall, however, it remainsunclearhow US oil majors will respond to Trump’s plans of regime change and increased oil extraction in Venezuela. What is much clearer is that any expansion would be “terrible for the climate, terrible for the environment”, said Mahdavi.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOilVenezuelaUS attack on VenezuelaAmericasUS politicsFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

The fleet regularly becomes so big it can be seen from space, looking like a city floating on the sea.View image in fullscreenThe distant-water fishing fleet, seen from space, off the coast of Argentina.Photograph: AlamyThe charity Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) has described it as one of the largestunregulated squid fisheriesin the world, warning that the scale of activities could destabilise an entire ecosystem.“With so many ships constantly fishing without any form of oversight, the squid’s short, one-year life cycle simply is not being respected,” says Lt Magalí Bobinac, a marine biologist with the Argentinian coast guard.Thereare no internationally agreed catch limits in the region covering squid,and distant-water fleets take advantage of this regulatory vacuum.Steve Trent, founder of the EJF, describes the fishery as a “free for all” and says squid could eventually disappear from the area as a result of “this mad fishing effort”.The consequences extend far beyond squid. Whales, dolphins, seals, sea birds and commercially important fish species such as hake and tuna depend on the cephalopod. A collapse in the squid population could trigger a cascade of ecological disruption, with profound social and economic costs for coastal communities and key markets such as Spain, experts warn.“If this species is affected, the whole ecosystem is affected,” Bobinac says. “It is the food for other species. It has a huge impact on the ecosystem and biodiversity.”She says the “vulnerable marine ecosystems” beneath the fleet, such as deep-sea corals, are also at risk of physical damage and pollution.View image in fullscreenAn Argentinian coast guard ship on patrol. ‘Outside our exclusive economic zone, we cannot do anything – we cannot board them, we cannot survey, nor inspect,’ says an officer.Photograph: EJFThree-quarters of squid jigging vessels (which jerk barbless lures up and down to imitate prey) that are operating on the high seas are from China, according to the EJF, with fleets from Taiwan andSouth Koreaalso accounting for a significant share.Activity on Mile 201 has surged over recent years, with total fishing hours increasing by 65% between 2019 and 2024 – a jump driven almost entirely by the Chinese fleet, which increased its activities by 85% in the same period, according to aninvestigation by the charity.The lack of oversight in Mile 201 has enabled something darker too.Interviews conducted by the EJFsuggest widespread cruelty towards marine wildlife in the area. Crew reported the deliberate capture and killing of seals – sometimes in their hundreds – on more than 40% of Chinese squid vessels and a fifth of Taiwanese vessels.Other testimonies detailed the hunting of marine megafauna for body parts, including seal teeth. The EJF shared photos and videos with the Guardian of seals hanging on hooks and penguins trapped on decks.View image in fullscreenOne of the huge squid-jigging ships. They also hunt seals, the EJF found.Photograph: EJFLt Luciana De Santis, a lawyer for the coast guard, says: “Outside our exclusive economic zone [EEZ], we cannot do anything – we cannot board them, we cannot survey, nor inspect.”An EEZ is a maritime area extending up to 200 nautical miles from a nation’s coast, with the rules that govern it set by that nation. The Argentinian coast guard says it has “total control” of this space, unlike the area just beyond this limit: Mile 201.But López says “a significant percentage of ships turn their identification systems off” when fishing in the area beyond this, otherwise known as “going dark” toevade detection.Hundreds of fishing fleets that go ‘dark’ suspected of illegal hunting, study findsRead moreCrews working on the squid fleet are also extremely vulnerable. The EJF’s investigation uncovered serious human rights and labour abuses in Mile 201. Workers on the ships described physical violence, including hitting or strangulation, wage deductions, intimidation and debt bondage – a system that in effect traps them at sea. Many reported working excessive hours with little rest.Much of the squid caught under these conditions still enters major global markets in the European Union, UK and North America, the EJF warns – meaning consumers may be unknowingly buying seafood linked to animal cruelty, environmental destruction and human rights abuse.The charity is calling for a ban on imports linked to illegal or abusive fishing practices and a global transparency regime that makes it possible to see who is fishing where, when and how, by mandating an international charter to govern fishing beyond national waters.View image in fullscreenCdr Mauricio López says many of the industrial fishing ships the Argentinian coastguard monitors turn off their tracking systems when they are in the area.Photograph: Harriet Barber“The Chinese distant-water fleet is the big beast in this,” says Trent. “Beijing must know this is happening, so why are they not acting?

This was all forming part of the heat of the situation, so based on that, the commanders tried to make the right decision.”The fixture was classified high risk by WMP, with the force pointing to alleged violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the 2024 Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam.However, Dutch police have disputed the accuracy of this information.Guildford denied he or the police force were politically motivated to find evidence to justify the ban.“From everything that I’ve read, and the commanders that I spoke to, I do not believe that there was political influence on that decision.“Lots of local politicians and local members of the community I’m sure wanted to try and influence it, but I honestly don’t think it was influenced,” he told the committee.Guildford defended claims by committee chair Karen Bradley that it felt like the force was “scraping” to find a reason to justify the ban.“I’m really sorry if it comes across in that way. That was absolutely not the case,” he said.Appearing before MPs, the Birmingham council leader John Cotton refused to comment on whether he had confidence in Guildford. He said: “I do have concerns about the quality of the material provided to the SAG.”In the second evidence hearing, Bradley concluded by telling Guildford her colleagues would be producing a report. Committee sources expect it will be critical.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said West Midlands police had “presented an inversion of reality and misled a parliamentary committee”.She wrote on X: “We have had enough of this in Britain. The chief constable’s position is untenable. The British police serve the British public, not local sectarian interests.”The home affairs committee’s report is one of several into the incident, with some suggesting the ban was caving in to antisemitism.His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary has been ordered by the home secretary to investigate the intelligence presented by WMP.Keir Starmer denounced the ban, which came shortly after the terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue in which two worshippers died, as have opposition parties.Maccabi Tel Aviv declined their allocation of tickets.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMaccabi Tel AvivWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

South EastWatertold residents the water from their taps was unsuitable for drinking, giving to pets, brushing teeth, washing children or bathing in with an open wound.Water plant that caused Tunbridge Wells supply failure was given risk notice in 2024Read moreMarcus Rink, the chief inspector at the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI), said the problem began on 9 November when there was a “noticeable deterioration” at the plant.He told MPs at a select committee hearing that the company also failed to do proper testing, which had been requested by the regulator, and that it also failed to install a filter that would stop dangerous heavy metals from entering the water supply.“It shouldn’t have been a surprise,” he said at the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee hearing.The problem occurred because a coagulant chemical used to purify drinking water stopped working. Rink said: “The opinion of my inspectors is had they done the appropriate testing and had they had the appropriate data, the original chemical would have worked.”South East Water had last conducted appropriate tests in July, he said, and added that the company was “flying blind” and manually collecting data on how the coagulant was working rather than using an electronic system which could have identified problems in real time.The ageing treatment works, which is the only one which serves Tunbridge Wells, has been under an enforcement notice from the DWI since last year over bacteria and pesticide contamination risks.During a defensive display at the select committee hearing, the chief executive of the water company, David Hinton, suggested the problem came out of the blue.View image in fullscreenDavid Hinton, the chief executive of South East Water, told MPs at the select committee hearing that lifestyle changes were to blame for pressures on the water supply system.Photograph: House of Commons/UK Parliament/PAHe said: “The actual issue that caused this was a change in the raw water chemistry that we hadn’t seen in 20 years.” He referred to this as an “unexpected failure”.He also blamed the “lifestyle changes” of customers “spending more time at home” since 2020 for pressures on the water supply system and suggested the issue was because of the climate crisis, as a recent drought had depleted the reservoir that feeds the treatment centre.“Climate change is changing the environment – we should have had a backup chemical,” he said.Hinton also blamed the regulator’s “infrastructure standards” for the fact that there was only one water supply centre to Tunbridge Wells, adding: “Customers relying on a single asset are always more at risk than those that aren’t so until infrastructure standards are updated that will be the case.”Rink said the inspectorate has little recourse to take further sanctions against the water company as it issued a boil water notice and informed residents of the risk before it could do so.He explained: “We enforced against the notice for the company to put a microfiltration unit to stop any residual aluminium leaching into the clean water tank. The company have not fitted that. We have no further sanction to deal with this, the regulations don’t provide us with the relevant facility to do that. We don’t feel we have a potential pathway under the current legislation which allows us to sanction the company’s under sufficiency.”South East Water has been on the brink of financial collapse, a fate threatening multiple other water companies. Last year it had toask for a £200m cash injectionfrom its investors after being put on a watchlist by the regulator Ofwatover its financial health.South East Water has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsWater industryWaterKentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It’d be an absolute honour”, before adding: “I think, those kinds of things should be done by Brits not Yanks.”The questions came after rumours that Oasis had been courted for the role, with Gallagher’s brother, frontman Liam, responding to a fan on X asking about the rumours in December with: “It’s happening you wait till you hear it it’s the best BOND tune ever.”The singer-songwriter, who alongside his previously estranged brother completed Oasis’s highly anticipated Live 25 tour last year with 41 shows across 13 countries, also said he would be interested in portraying a “Mancunian villain” in the next instalment.The history of Bond theme songs stretches back to the first Bond film, Dr No in 1962, with every film since having its own unique song. The artist chosen to contribute the song tends to change from film to film, although some, such as English composer John Barry and Welsh singer Shirley Bassey, have had the job more than once.Despite the film franchise being a British institution, the official Bond theme is often sung by foreigners, with only 10 British bands, composers or artists having provided songs for the 25 films produced to date: Barry in 1962, 1963 and 1969, Bassey in 1964, 1971 and 1979, Tom Jones in 1965, Paul McCartney and Wings in 1973,Lulu in 1974, Sheena Easton in 1981,Duran Duran in 1985, Adele in 2012 and Sam Smith in 2015. American band Garbage, fronted by Scot Shirley Manson, also provided the music in 1999. Reaction to each song has been mixed, but the three most recent ballads from Adele, Smith and Billie Eilish each took home the Academy Award for Best Original Song.Little is currently known about any prospective future Bond films, with a replacement for long-time lead Daniel Craig, who exited the role after No Time to Die in 2021, still undecided andcreative control now in the hands of Amazon MGM Studios, meaning that the next film in the series will be the first without the creative input of Eon Productions, the long-time stewards of the franchise who had a hand in deciding who created each film’s theme song.Explore more on these topicsNoel GallagherOasisJames BondnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the deal for The Overlap, Neville will remain co-chair of the company.He also co-founded the sports entertainment production company Buzz 16 in 2017.Neville launched The Overlap only in 2021, but it is now one of the UK’s most popular football content channels. The company said it has more than 38m monthly views on YouTube and achieved 2.2bn views across all platforms in 2025.“The Overlap started as an idea that we thought people might like and we went for it,” Neville said. “What has happened since then has been a great journey and it’s a team that I love working with and I’m incredibly proud to be a part of. We never thought of it as a business, we just wanted to create something that people loved and would come back to watch every week.“We see huge growth potential for The Overlap and have spent the last few months in a strategic investment process and are delighted to have found the perfect partner in Global to power us forward and create The Overlap Network with the aim of becoming a world-leading football and sports media platform.”As well as highlighting the importance now placed on video podcasting, the deal demonstrates the rapid challenge YouTube outlets are posing to traditional broadcasters. Many of the biggest names on The Overlap are former sports professionals who made their names as pundits on Sky Sports and other mainstream channels.The Overlap has already attracted attention for the often astringent views of Keane, never one to pull his punches in his assessments, as well as with its interviews with the likes of the former Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli and Wayne Rooney.Wright’s views on the treatment of Jude Bellinghamalso earned headlines.It has even dipped its toe in live broadcasting, recently winning the rights to the German Bundesliga. It shares the rights with the BBC and That’s Football, another YouTube channelrun by the YouTuber Mark Goldbridge.While The Overlap network already includes cricket and rugby channels, as well as one focusing on the US, the plan is to widen it into “a media network spanning multiple brands and channels across sports verticals, led by football”.Simon Pitts, Global’s group chief executive, said: “Gary and Scott [now CEO] have done an extraordinary job building The Overlap and we’re thrilled to welcome them and their fantastic team to Global as we embark on this next phase of growth together.“We want Global Studios to be the home of the best audio and video brands on the planet and The Overlap’s ambition, creativity and unrivalled connection with fans is a perfect fit.”Explore more on these topicsGary NevilleYouTubePodcastingEuropeDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been 14 DAYS since Trump’s DOJ released anything at all – with the DOJ doing everything in its power to delay and obfuscate.”The releases so far, he said, were heavily redacted, and contained “none of the key documents, and no new information on the 10 alleged Epstein co-conspirators”.He said: “The Trump DOJ’s lawlessness must stop. I will do everything in my power to ensure all the files come out.”Blancheinsisted last weekthat the department was committed to “transparency and protecting victims”, and that hundreds of people had sacrificed time over the holidays to work on the case.“It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we’re asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,” he said.“Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released.”The department said before Christmas that federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the FBI had uncovered more than amillion more documentsnot included in its initial review, and that it might need “a few more weeks” to comply with the law.Ro Khanna, a Democratic California congressman, and Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said last month they wereconsidering filing an inherent contempt lawsuitagainst Bondi in an effort to speed up the release.Documents published in the first tranches of releases since 19 December have offeredsome insight into Epstein’s operation, facilitated by his friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking, but no major new revelations.Marina Lacerda, a victim of Epstein who met him when she was 14,spoke to the Guardianlast month after the first batch of papers was released. She said she wanted the British former royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, a close friend of Epstein and Maxwell, to be “brought to justice” in the US.One of the papers detailed alleged efforts by Mountbatten-Windsor, once known as Prince Andrew, to get Maxwell to fix him up with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls for him.

We bitterly regret this,” the mayor of the town, Nicolas Féraud, told a press conference in the town on Tuesday, five days after the disaster at Le Constellation bar.Féraud said the council was not responsible for determining who was responsible for the blaze. “That will be the job of the investigators,” he said. But the municipality wanted to show “full transparency”. “We owe it to the victims and their families,” he added.Authorities believe the firein the crowded bar started in its basement party room after sparklers attached to champagne bottles were held too close to the ceiling, which images on social media suggest was clad with soundproofing foam.All 116 people injured in Swiss resort fire identified, say policeRead moreFéraud said he had “no answer” as to why the bar, which was renovated in 2015, had not been inspected annually, as required by the town’s bylaws, but noted that a team of five safety officers was responsible for checking more than 10,000 buildings.“We’re profoundly sorry, and I know how hard that will be for the families,” Féraud added. He said he and his fellow councillors would not be resigning because they were “elected by the people of Crans-Montana” and would not “jump ship now”.Romain Jordan, a lawyer representing several families of victims who died in the blaze, said they were shocked to learn of the council’s admission.“The staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency,” he said, adding: “We would have liked to hear an apology.”Jordan told Agence France-Presse that the municipality and all relevant authorities “must fully assume their responsibilities”. Sébastien Fanti, a lawyer representing four families of the injured, said it was “essential” the council accepted responsibility.“Normally, when addressing a risk, one always begins by inspecting the places where the risks could materialise,” Fanti said. “Le Constellation is one of the five highest-risk locations” in the municipality, he added.View image in fullscreenNicolas Féraud: ‘Periodic inspections were not conducted between 2020 and 2025. We bitterly regret this.’Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesThe last of the 40 people who died in the fire – who included 21 Swiss nationals, nine French citizens including two with dual nationality, six Italians, and one person each from Belgium, Portugal, Romania and Turkey –were identified on Sunday.Authorities have not yet released the names of the victims, although several have been publicly identified by their families. They were aged between 14 and 39, but were overwhelmingly young: 20 were minors, and the average age was 19.Police said on Monday that all 116 people injured in the blaze, including 68 Swiss citizens, 21 French, 10 Italians, four Serbs and four dual nationals, had also been identified. Eighty-three people are still in hospital being treated for severe burns.Féraud said the soundproof foam used in Le Constellation had been considered acceptable at the time of the last inspection. Sparklers, known as “Bengal fountains”, had now been banned inside the resort’s venues, he added.Authorities are investigating the bar’s owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence. The mayor said the couple had not so far been arrested but a second establishment they owned had been closed.The couple, both French nationals, said in a statement released to Swiss and French media on Tuesday that they were “devastated and overwhelmed with grief” by the disaster, adding that they would “in no way seek to shirk their responsibilities”.“Words cannot adequately describe the tragedy that unfolded that night at Le Constellation,” the couple said in their first public statement since the criminal investigation was opened against them, promising to “cooperate fully”.The municipality said on Monday it had given investigators all documents relevant to the investigation and joined the criminal proceedings as a civil party. “This will allow [the town council] to actively contribute to establishing all the facts,” it said.The bodies of the first foreign victims, five Italians, were repatriated on Monday. Crans-Montana will hold a memorial ceremony on Friday honouring the victims. The French government has said the president, Emmanuel Macron, will attend.Explore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This week, he renewed his threats to wield the power of the province’s liquor control board – one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world – to banish Crown Royal.“You’d better stock up there, buddy,” Ford told reporters, adding he was “100%” committed to removing the spirits from liquor store shelves.In September, Fordceremoniously dumped a bottle of Crown Royalwhen Diageo announced plans to shutter its plant in Ontario and move its operations to the US, with the loss of roughly 200 jobs.Crown Royal dethroned in Canada as whisky company shifts some operations to USRead more“This is what I think of Crown Royal,” he said, telling reporters the company’s owners were “a few fries short of a Happy Meal” and “dumb as a bag of hammers”.Diageo, like other companies, has shifted its global strategy in response to threats and incentives from the White House intended to lure production back to the United States. Meanwhile, consumer boycotts in response to Donald Trump’s provocations have cratered sales of US brands crater inCanada.For political leaders, the loss of a Crown Royal facility reflects an erosion of a product long seen as uniquely Canadian.The whisky, first introduced 86 years ago to mark a visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, has in domestic and international advertising long stressed its Canadian roots. Sold in a distinct purple cloth bag with gold stitching, the drink is made with Canadian grains and water from Manitoba’s Lake Winnipeg. While it was initially only available in Canada, a decision to sell it south of the border in the 1960s has made it the top-selling Canadian whisky in the US.Once part of the Seagram empire, the brand was acquired in 2001 byDiageo, the London-based multinational company, when the Canadian beverage and entertainment conglomerate collapsed.Its Northern Harvest Rye was named the 2016 WorldWhiskyof the Year, the first time a Canadian whisky had ever received the honour.Diageo said that Crown Royal “will be mashed, distilled and aged in Canada, just as it has been since 1939”, and that Crown Royal products both “sold in Canada and destined for the rest of the world (outside the US) will continue to be bottled in Canada”.But Ford told reporters the company has bigger plans to move all its Crown Royal production to a new plant in Alabama.“It’s all a bunch of BS. It’s all going to Alabama. Mark my words, it’s going to Alabama. They said they were going to invest in [Ontario] … They pulled the carpet out from underneath us,” Ford said in a nod to plans the company had for a new C$245m carbon-neutral Crown Royal distillery that would employ up to 100 people.The company then shifted its plans, saying the project would be a warehouse with the possibility of a distillery in the future, before pausing the project.Ford said while the current action will only target Crown Royal, he has his eyes on other brands sold by Diageo, including Guinness and Smirnoff. “The message to everyone else; don’t try to hurt Ontario, especially if we’re your No 1 customer – you’ll be held accountable.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaWhiskyTrump tariffsTariffsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

No longer must you “pshww-pshww” to convince your playmate their enemy space station has been doomed by your lasers. “Smart” bricks, with play-sensitive miniature speakers, are being added to the arsenal of the Lego enthusiast in a move the Danish toy giant believes will combine creative play with technology without the need for a screen.The smart bricks – in the shape of a normal two-by-four Lego brick – are being launched in three Star Wars-themed sets and are powered by a custom-made chip smaller than a single Lego stud. When installed in Luke Skywalker’s X-wing fighter, they make the required “woosh” noises, depending on how the player twists and turns the craft through the air. The hard-to-impersonate bleeps and blips of the droid R2D2 are also replicated.If a second smart brick is installed in Darth Vader’s TIE fighter, then when the Imperial starship engages the Rebel Alliance craft in a dogfight, each will make sounds to signal if they have been hit by the other’s lasers.The smart bricks communicate with each other and will even decide whether enough accurate laser blasts have been delivered to achieve destruction. The smart bricks also emit light and play music. At a demonstration of the new toys, a Lego executive explained that, when playing with Darth Vader’s craft, “once in a while you get The Imperial March, just to get the vibe going”.View image in fullscreenLego executive vice-president Julia Goldin was joined by Chewbacca from the Star Wars saga during the launch of the new ‘Smart Play’ technology at the CES in Las Vegas.Photograph: Abbie Parr/APSuch fun comes at a price. Skywalker’s X-wing – with smart Luke mini-figure – will retail at £79.99, while Vader’s TIE fighter comes in at £59.99. Some play experts have wondered if such technological advances risk undermining the historic strength of Lego, which has always served to harness a child’s own imagination.“I can go ‘swoosh’ and ‘pew-pew’ too,” commented one user on Reddit. “Unimpressed”.Another wrote: “If this is a ‘smart’ brick, does that [mean] all the other bricks are ‘stupid’ bricks”?Another fan was more enthusiastic, however, wondering when a Lego Titanic – complete with a smart brick playing Céline Dion’s My Heart Will Go On – might hit the market.The Danish toy giant, which has been producing the bricks for 70 years, launched the new technology at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. The move comes against a backdrop of rising engagement by children with screen-based games. Roblox, the user-generated gaming platform, has approximately 150 million daily users.Tom Donaldson, senior vice president at the Lego Group, claimed the new smart brick system “brings creativity, technology and storytelling together to make building worlds and stories even more engaging, and all without a screen”.Explore more on these topicsLegoStar WarsScience fiction and fantasy filmsToysnewsShareReuse this content"

Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”Nvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”Huang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.He revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.The Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.Huang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.To get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.While Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaAI (artificial intelligence)Self-driving carsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared toreferenceAI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University,calledthe piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.View image in fullscreen‘Our timelines … are a bit longer still,’ Daniel Kokotajlo wrote.Photograph: Twitter/XTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, withofficialsandexpertspredicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.Kokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”Kokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.However, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.Generation AI: fears of ‘social divide’ unless all children learn computing skillsRead more“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,”wroteKokotajlo in a post on X.Creating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman,saidin October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”Andrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingOpenAISam AltmanJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

However, Venezuela also has significant gold holdings – including bullion worth at least $1.95bn (£1.4bn) frozen in Britain.For years the gold bars have been the subject of atussle in the London courts, entangling the Bank and the UK government in Venezuelan politics and a geopolitical battle that is now taking a fresh twist.Venezuela has about 31 tonnes of gold held in the vaults of Threadneedle Street, equivalent to about 15% of its total foreign currency reserves.UK court documentsput the value in 2020 at about $1.95bn. However, thegold price has more than doubled since, meaning the bars are probably worth considerably more.Held in London since the 1980s, the practice of governments storing bullion in Britain is not unusual: the Bank keeps about400,000 bars on behalf of governments and institutions worldwide, as the second-largest global storage hub after the New York Federal Reserve.View image in fullscreenVenezuela has about 31 tonnes of gold held in the vaults of Threadneedle Street.Photograph: David Levenson/AlamySince 2018, however, Caracas has been blocked from repatriating the gold amid pressure on Maduro, after thedisputed outcome of Venezuela’s presidential electionsthat year – including Donald Trump imposingUS sanctionsduring his first term in the White House.Britain, along with dozens of other countries, did not recognise Maduro as the country’s legitimate leader. Opposition figures at the time urged the Bank not to hand over the money, arguing his administration would either steal the gold or use it to finance his dictatorial government.A memoir by Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton also later revealed that the UK Foreign Office agreed to block the gold transfer at the request of the US.In 2020, Venezuela sued in the London courts to recover the gold, and the Maduro government argued it needed money for its pandemic response. However, the then opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, also claimed control – with an ensuing legal battle complicated after the UK governmentformally recognised Guaidóas interim head of state.Despite multiple twists, and with Guaidó no longer recognised, the legal case remains unresolved.Venezuela’s interim leader after Maduro’s deposition, Delcy Rodríguez, has previously struck a defiant tone – labelling the Bank’s refusal to release the gold bars as “blatant piracy” during her time as Maduro’s vice-president.View image in fullscreenVenezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, has previously described the Bank of England’s refusal to release the gold bars as ‘blatant piracy’.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersIn 2020, she was involved in a scandal in Spain that became known as “Delcygate” involving the alleged sale of $68m of gold bars, after a surreptitious flight to Madrid to meet Spain’s transport minister despite an EU travel ban.While Rodriguez has taken aconciliatory stancesince Maduro’s capture, offering to work with the US, Yvette Cooper, the UK foreign secretary, told MPs in the Commons on Monday that Britain continued not to officially recognise the Venezuelan administration because it was “important that we have the pressure in place to have a transition to a democracy”.“Obviously there are independent decisions for theBank of Englandto take but our principles are about maintaining and pursuing the stability and the transition to a democracy and that is what is guiding our approach to recognition,” Cooper said.The immobilisation of sovereign reserves is not isolated to Venezuela, yet is becoming increasingly contentious amid fractious geopolitical conditions – with more countries seeking to repatriate their overseas holdings. Analysts believe this is one of the driving factors behind gold’srecent rally– amid growing international mistrust of the US under Trump and a breakdown of the rules-based global order.After Vladimir Putin’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, western governments led by the US – including the UK and the EU – froze about $300bn in Russian central bank assets. Most were held atEuroclear in Brussels, leading to pressure on the Belgian government from Moscow last month.The first case of international sanctions on central bank assets is thought to be the 1918 Soviet confiscation of gold shipped to Moscow by Romania during the first world war. Axis powers during the second world war also had their assets targeted by Washington. Others include North Korea and Egypt in the 1950s, and Vietnam, Cambodia and Iran in the 1970s.The Bank of England declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandGoldVenezuelafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Actors slip into their anecdotage. Two of the best programmes in the rather arid TV Christmas schedules featured Judi Dench touchingly reminiscing about her love of Shakespeare. The great dame is also one of the glittering ensemble in TheTwelfth NightReunion, a one-off event conceived and hosted by Gyles Brandreth and recorded at the Orange Tree in Richmond, London, a year ago, where a group of actors share their memories of the play.Now available on YouTube, it is like an upmarket version of The Graham Norton Show with two heart-stopping moments.The format is simple. Each actor is invited to describe his or her first encounter with the play and their experience of being in it. Simon Callow vividly recalls the “melancholy magic” ofJohn Barton’s legendary 1969 RSC production. When cast as the drunken Sir Toby in a later National Theatre production, Callow reveals that he discovered “that the character was basically my father”. Dame Judi, Viola in the Barton version, describes a famous bit of comic business created by the Malvolio, Donald Sinden. In the garden scene, Sinden glanced at a sundial and then at his fob watch and realised the two showed different times. After looking up at the sun, Sinden effortfully heaved the sundial into a new position until it showed the correct Malvolio time.View image in fullscreen‘Like a Liverpool team of the 1970s’ … The Twelfth Night Reunion.Photograph: Danny KaanStephen Fry, Malvolio at Shakespeare’s Globe,in the West Endand on Broadway, rightly pays tribute to the play’s flawless structure and to Mark Rylance’s unearthly skill as Olivia. But Fry also reveals that he and Rylance had fierce arguments about the authorship of the plays and says that, although Rylance claims to keep an open mind, “his mind is so open his brain has left him”. Even Fry, however, concedes that he found the scene where Malvolio is imprisoned impossible to learn and was later told by Ian McKellen that every actor has the same problem and that Donald Wolfit concluded that Shakespeare could not possibly have written it.What emerges is everyone’s passion for the play and joy at being in it. Tam Williams, Viola inan all-male Propeller production, says that it’s like “a Liverpool football team of the 1970s” in that everyone has to be at the top of their game. Penelope Wilton describes how, when playing Maria, she countered a crudely bottom-smacking Sir Toby by adopting an increasingly upper-class accent until she sounded “like an announcer on Radio 3”.But while the film is full of fun, including one of the best Olivier stories I’ve ever heard from Robert Lindsay, it is only at the end that it touches the heart. The first moment comes whenJudi Denchperforms the soliloquy where Viola realises that Olivia has fallen in love with her. You can play that speech for comedy but there is an intensity of sadness to Dame Judi – especially on the line “What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!” – that makes you realise Viola’s sympathy for another victim of passion.The second moving moment comes when Stefan Bednarczyk, who was a piano-playing Feste in theOrange Tree’s Twelfth Night in 2024, gets the cast and audience to join together in singing the last few lines of the play: “A great while ago the world began / With hey-ho, the wind and the rain / But that’s all one, our play is done / And we’ll strive to please you every day.” Maybe it is because they evoke the transience of mortal things but those simple lines make the ideal ending to the greatest comedy ever written.The Twelfth Night Reunion is on YouTubeExplore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreTwelfth NightJudi DenchStephen FrySimon CallowWilliam ShakespearefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Short ofChristopher Nolansigning on to the new Mr Men movie, I didn’t think much would throw the industry a loop as whenGreta Gerwigdecided to follow up bubblegum blockbusterBarbiewith …… a Narnia movie. More specifically, Gerwig – previously a skilled purveyor of achingly hip alt-indie comedy with Lady Bird, Frances Ha and Damsels in Distress – isrestartingthe Narnia series, which had got through three of CS Lewis’s series before Netflix took over the rights. To my mind, though, The Magician’s Nephew, Lewis’s origins/prequel to the Wardrobe/Caspian/Dawn Treader narrative, is the most interesting of the entire Narnia canon, with its Edenic fall, “deplorable word” and mystical apple. We know some of the cast: Emma Mackey is the future White Witch,Carey Mulliganthe terminally ill mother of one of the main kids, andDaniel Craigmightbe Aslan or mad inventor Uncle Andrew – or both, or neither. All eyes will be naturally be on Gerwig, but I have confidence she will pull it off in style.Andrew PulverDune: MessiahView image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet.Photograph: Warner Bros/Everett/ShutterstockFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Dune and the return of Madge: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026Read moreAfter claiming that he was going to focus on other projects and maybe even abandon Dune after two laborious half-book adaptations,Denis Villeneuve, inspired by howPart Twowas “received by cinephiles around the world” (LOL),fast-trackedDune: Messiah. The final chapter in the epic sci-fi trilogy is now due this December (though given that it’s slated to compete against the newest Avengers, that is likely subject to change.) And thank God for that – as the Guardian’sresident Dunehead, I must report that I have been counting down the days to Messiah since Zendaya’s heartbroken Chani fled the scene of her boyfriend’s genocidal freak metamorphosis via sandworm. It does not matter that Frank Herbert’s far weirder sequel may actually be, as some charged of the first book, unadaptable; that the plot devolves into resurrected zombie warriors and worm gods and requiredTimothée Chalametto shave his head. Villeneuve’s vision for the first two films – gloriously strange and wonderfully vast, from the infrared Black Sun to the desert mouse – is so commanding, so thrilling to behold on the big screen, that I simply trust he will land the spaceship and give us one more round of heady yet extremely hype-y interplanetary escapism in 2026.Adrian HortonThe MomentIt seems like an eternity since then, but a mere 18 months agoCharli xcxturned the summer lime green and dared us all to findour inner brat. Now, pop’s smudged-eyeliner princess promises to again dominate in 2026 – shehasan original soundtrack to a reimaginedWuthering Heightsarriving in February and this charming mockumentary popping out at the end of January. Detailing a wonderfully deranged alternate history of the artist’s 2024 rampage of a summer tour,The Momentwas reportedly born out of a confessional text of “word vomit” that the singer made to her music video collaborator Aidan Zamiri (directing his first feature film). The movie will hopefully channel the madcap energy of the delightfully cracked visuals that the pair put together for tracks 360 and Guess (with Billie Eilish), giving us all something that doesn’t lose its shine after an hour sets in. With a starring role fromAlexander Skarsgårdand a score from longtime Charli collaboratorAG Cook, the promise is there – hopefully it meets The Moment.Veronica EspositoA Place in HellView image in fullscreenMichelle Williams.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesBack at Sundance 2023, I was lucky enough to secure a seat for the world premiere of battle of the sexes thrillerFair Play, a question mark of a film that suddenly became popular enough to see crowds turned away at the door. It was the kind of communal experience I crave at festivals: an electric wave of audible anger and excitement, and as has become depressingly commonplace, one that very few people were able to replicate in the real world. It was bought by Netflix and so a juicy, glossily made crowd-provoker was dumped on smartphones, a fate that’s set to be avoided for writer-director Chloe Domont’s follow-up, another corporate thriller called A Place in Hell. The film, which starsMichelle Williams, Daisy Edgar-Jones andAndrew Scott, has been picked up by Neon, and while little is known about the plot (although the title suggests this time, the fight will be between two women), we at least know we’ll all get to see it on the big screen.Benjamin LeeFlowervale StreetView image in fullscreenAnne Hathaway.Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesIn the past 16 years, David Robert Mitchell has made just three feature films. It was probably the third of these, 2019’s hallucinatoryUnder the Silver Lake, that ensured these numbers would not continue to grow. Silver Lake, a dark rabbit-hole comedy of unsettling conspiracy brain, was a barely released bomb for A24, an embarrassment just as the company was finding its footing as the hippest indie studio of the new century. It’s also a terrific movie and only amplified my desire to see what Mitchell would do next. The most exciting thing about Flowervale Street, Mitchell’s fourth film, is that I’m still not sure what exactly that is. Supposedly it’s an uncharacteristically family-friendly project, as well as a bigger-budget movie than he has previously made. (It has held several different high-profile release dates and is now penciled into August 2025.) It definitely co-starsAnne HathawayandEwan McGregor. It may involve dinosaurs. But if it’s even remotely of a tonal piece with the eerie, evocativeIt Follows; lovely the Myth of the American Sleepover; or hilarious, unsparing Under the Silver Lake, it will be one of the most distinctive big-studio fantasies of the year.Jesse HassengerThe Adventures of Cliff BoothView image in fullscreenBrad Pitt.Photograph: Sony Pictures/Andrew Cooper/AllstarWuthering Heights, Michael Jackson and the ‘Trump effect’ – will 2026 see the end of the ‘woke’ blockbuster?Read moreQuentin Tarantino’s movies are playfully pulpy, indulgent and in your face with the writer-director’s verbosity, his personality dripping off every syllable.David Fincher, by contrast, favours cool, stealthy and cerebral; his trademark being what appears to be an invisible hand in complete control. Both are among the US’s most revered auteurs with styles so distinct you wouldn’t think they could exist in the same universe, which is why Fincher serving as the surrogate shepherding a Tarantino project to the screen is as tantalizing as it is confounding.Brad Pittbrought Tarantino’s script for The Adventures of Cliff Booth, a sequel toOnce Upon a Time … in Hollywood, to Fincher, when the former decided he didn’t want his 10th (and, as he insists, final) film to keep him in familiar terrain. (Or maybe he’d rather spend his downtime on podcasts,talking smackabout Paul Dano, while dwelling on what his curtain call will be.) Whatever the reasoning, I can’t wait to see Fincher’s bastardized version and what he makes of Pitt’s Cliff Booth, the Hollywood stunt man who doesn’t quite fit in with the old guard or the counterculture, his penchant for violence and alpha male swagger at delicious odds with his zen-like calm and curious taste for free love and LSD. Cliff Booth is a beautiful contradiction, which is what I’m counting on Fincher’s Tarantino project to be.Radheyan SimonpillaiI Love BoostersKeke Palmer.Photograph: Courtesy of NEONBoots Rileyhas a knack for writing stories that live on in my mind well after I’ve seen them play out on screen. I still wonder what became ofSorry to Bother You’s Equisapiens, and think about I Am a Virgo using a 13ft protagonist to personify the American fascination with Black genetic marvels from hardscrabble backgrounds. All the while, I’ve been holding space for Riley’s next brainteaser: I Love Boosters. Described as a “sci-fi heist comedy”, I Love Boosters follows a crew of professional shoplifters who go from boosting luxury goods to taking down a ruthless fashion designer.Keke Palmer,Demi Mooreand Sorry to Bother You leadLaKeith Stanfieldstar in what figures to be a trenchant, if trippy, commentary on the fashion industry and consumerism writ large – and the timing (read: this precarious economic moment) couldn’t be better.Andrew LawrenceDiggerPretty much nothing is known about the plot of this film, but it’s high on my most-anticipated list because of the people who made it.Alejandro González Iñárritudirected and co-wrote the film, and while I don’t always love his work – not The Revenant’s aggressive brutality, not Birdman’s scratchy solipsism, certainly not whatever Bardo is – they are nonetheless ornate, meticulously crafted objects worth contending with. But it’s the film’s star,Tom Cruise, who is the real draw here. It’s been nine years since Cruise did a non-franchise film, and even longer since he’s worked with a lauded auteur like Iñárritu. Cruise starring in a $125m, studio-backed dark comedy from an Oscar-winning director – alongsideJesse Plemons,Sandra Hüller,Riz Ahmedand more – sounds like something that would have happened 20 years ago, not in 2026. That’s pretty exciting.Richard LawsonUntitled Jesse Eisenberg musical comedyView image in fullscreenJesse Eisenberg.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesA Real Pain was the actual best film of last Oscars season; the best film of the season after this one is likely to be the untitledJesse Eisenbergmusical project.

Paul Giamatti plays her unlikely mentor; Eisenberg has a bit-part, likewise Halle Bailey and Bernadette Peters. A leaked report from a test screening this summer said “what begins as an eccentric character study quickly shifts into a dark comedy – imagine Woody Allen’s version of Black Swan. The audience roared with laughter.” It’s not at Sundance – a bit odd, given how great a launchpad that proved forA Real Pain.

This kind of secrecy and revelation is part of Chloé Zhao’s deeply felt romantic fantasy about the origin of William Shakespeare’s tragedy Hamlet. It locates the play’s beginning in the imagined anguish of Shakespeare and his wife Agnes (or Anne) Hathaway at the death of their son Hamnet at the age of 11 in 1596, a few years before the play’s first performance.The nearness of the names is not supposed to be some monumental Freudian slip; there is linguistic evidence that the two could be used interchangeably. The movie is inspired byMaggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novelof the same name – Zhao co-wrote the screenplay with O’Farrell – as well as the 2004 essay The Death of Hamnet and the Making of Hamlet by literary scholar Stephen Greenblatt. This film succeeds, not because it solves the mystery, but because it deepens it still further. It is contrived and speculative, but ingenious and impassioned at the same time.On one level, the narrative is a fallacious misreading, based on treating Shakespeare like you would a contemporary novelist with contemporary ideas about the speakability of this kind of bereavement; it relies heavily on a name coincidence which could be simply that, a coincidence. Moreover, the Hamnetisation of tragic themes could as easily be applied to any of the plays. (Shakespeare’s horror at the death ofHamnetcould have remained dormant for more years than this, and then surfaced in Macbeth at the murder of Macduff’s wife and young son.) You can remain unconvinced. And yet there is such terrific daring in Zhao and O’Farrell’s stretch: a thrilling act of creative audacity, reaching back through the centuries to embrace Shakespeare and Agnes as human beings.Zhao takes her movie at walking pace at first, following Agnes as she wanders endlessly through a forest, a habit that has earned her a witch-like reputation like her late mother, dreamily registering the sky through the branches and a hawk that has swooped down to her hand. Agnes is in a trance of rapture in the folk-horror woodland outside Stratford-upon-Avon, a premonition of creative inspiration from the depths of despair. It is an unselfconsciously beguiling performance fromJessie Buckley, who gives every look and smile a piercing significance. Her beauty captivates young William Shakespeare, a would-be poet seething at having to follow his abusive father into the gloving business, and played with intelligent force by Paul Mescal.They marry, to the deep unease of William’s mother Mary (Emily Watson), and the film imagines Agnes having her first baby (Susanna) actually in the forest. But when she reaches the end of her second pregnancy, she is forced to give birth indoors, a bad augury; these are the twins Judith and Hamnet. And while William is away in London following his dream of becoming a star of the London playhouse, illness and calamity strike.The death of Hamnet could be compared to that of Thomas Cromwell’s wife and daughters from sickness early in Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall; it is an inciting event, a terrible event which in some sense explains everything that happens next. Cromwell had to cauterise his inner agony by throwing himself into his career, pursuing it ruthlessly and making it of overwhelming importance – but he did not dwell on those that he has lost as Shakespeare is supposed to be doing here. Zhao and O’Farrell suggest that Shakespeare transformed and displaced his grief into every line of his play: the agony, the futility of carrying on, the dazed inability to decide on the point of anything. In a way, he, Shakespeare, is the ghost, the undead phantom condemned to wander miserably through the world while Hamnet is left alive. The boy’s soul has not been murdered as the father’s has.It could all be true – although it comes down to the name, and there is a line in Romeo and Juliet about what there is in a name. The cinematography by Łukasz Żal is beautiful and pellucid and Max Richter’s score swarms all around the action. It is a film that moves because of the performances which are so absorbing.Decades ago, Tom Stoppard’s play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead provided a whole new way intoHamlet. Perhaps Zhao and O’Farrell will do the same thing with this tender and moving new creation myth.Hamnet is out now in the US, on 9 January in the UK, and on 15 January in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmHamnetFilm adaptationsMaggie O'FarrellChloé ZhaoPaul MescalJessie BuckleyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Surprising, perhaps, is Margaret’s animated declaration that the film turned her into an “absolute fanatical revhead”, but even funnier is David’s suggestion that he can’t see theFast and Furiousfranchise continuing for much longer.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Of course, it’s easy to laugh now: “You naive fool, David – they made eight more, not including the spin-off!” But such ironclad inevitability wasn’t always certain. The first four films were essentially a quartet of reboots – franchise jump-starts that rehashed stories of infiltration and assimilation in the world of street racing. Despite the slew of sequels that resist any sane naming convention, including Fast & Furious, The Fate of the Furious, F9 and Fast X, it’s 2 Fast 2 Furious that has a reputation as the franchise’s ugly duckling, a minor cross-country detour. In actuality, this detachment from the larger enterprise is the film’s strength.Paul Walker returns in this sequel to 2001’s The Fast and the Furious as ex-LAPD police officer Brian O’Connor, now residing in Miami; at his side is newcomer Roman Pearce, played with aplomb by Tyrese Gibson. Reunited, the two old pals go undercover ostensibly to bust a drug ring, but plot scarcely registers in the film’s aspirations.Generic lines are drawn and director John Singleton paints within them in blistering primary colours: every car is either hot pink or lime green, or else adorned in gaudy decals. Brian and Roman’s oscillating mishaps with police and cartel alike are ornamentation for the true spectacle: souped-up vehicles driving irresponsibly fast, loudly. Furiously, even! Singleton charts a nimble path through South Florida. His film-making is, like the convoy of cars that propel the narrative, bright, plastic and tactile.View image in fullscreenThe film’s blistering primary colours: ‘Every car is either hot pink or lime green, or else adorned in gaudy decals.’Photograph: Universal/AllstarLater films in the franchise embrace thedigital sublimein their depiction ofphysically impossible,transcendent spectacle. The CGI in 2 Fast 2 Furious is beautifully expressive but there is great satisfaction in the film’s tangible textures too: blurring streets lit by neon underglows, sweat and dirt on your forehead, the shimmer of sunset on the ocean,wind flowing through your hairas you pummel down an open highway.The skies are so blue and the sun so bright that you’re momentarily convinced Walker, in peak blue eyes blond hair pretty boy mode, can wear a white tee better than anyone you’ve ever seen on screen. His Cali-bro posturing is perfect for a character teetering in the limbo between cop and robber. His dramatic scenes might be a little dubious, but Walker pops when he’s trading quips with Gibson; the film could cross the finish line on their acerbic sense of camaraderie alone.‘My brain has liquefied!’: what happened when one careful Skoda driver binged every Fast & Furious filmRead moreProtests against the franchise in its current state concern its unwieldy exponential growth under the rule of Vin Diesel, who became the sole Fast figurehead after Walker’s death in 2013. His stubborn belief in maintaining a simultaneously on- and off-screen family – perhaps derived from thedeeply felt loss of his confidant– means it’s too important to let any characters die. Latter-day entries are punctuated by flashbacks, retcons and revelations such that“Fast & Furious Timeline Explained”is an all-too-common piece of reporting. In a vacuum, 2 Fast 2 Furious is thoroughly unconcerned with longevity or coherence: if it can convince you that you’re an absolute fanatical revhead for an evening, then it’s done its job.2 Fast 2 Furious is streaming on Prime Video, Netflix, Binge and Stan in Australia, Sky in the UK and Prime Video and Peacock in the US.

This marathon concert, on what would have been his 95th birthday, celebrated them with warm affection.The music reflected Brendel’s own passions, skewing towards the classical repertoire. It began with Haydn’s Representation of Chaos from The Creation; but the evening’s punchlines came later. The orchestra, an ad hoc group of Brendel’s colleagues, proteges and friends, included leading orchestral and chamber musicians – and, in the case of Brett Dean, a composer reverting to his former viola-player persona. They were enthusiastically responsive to Simon Rattle’s conducting, leaning in to surges of sound or dropping back to the softest pianissimos.View image in fullscreenThe Takács Quartet, joined by Adrian Brendel (2nd from right), play Schubert’s Quintet.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouProceeds all went to theAlfred BrendelYoung Musician’s Trust, which gives students access to professional-standard pianos. This was no pushy fundraiser, though, and a general lack of speeches made the atmosphere less reverential; the music really did do the talking. So, too, did the presence of so many pianists who counted Brendel as a mentor. Imogen Cooper joined the orchestra and soprano Lucy Crowe in Mozart’s ariaCh’io scordi di te …; later, Tim Horton duetted with Brendel’s cellist son Adrian in an intensely felt performance of Liszt’s Elégie No 2, and Till Fellner and Paul Lewis teamed up for Schubert’s A minor Allegro, D947.View image in fullscreenThe music really did the talking: Lucy Crowe with Imogen Cooper at the piano for a Mozart aria, part of Alfred Brendel a Musical Celebration at the Barbican.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouThere was (seemingly) unplanned humour: some ongoing shtick involving the six pianists and their several piano stools, which apparently aren’t as interchangeable as you might think; and a moment when we weren’t sure whether we were applauding the arrival on stage of András Schiff to play JS Bach or the return to his seat in the audience of the evening’s doughty page-turner – a familiar face to Brendel’s London fans. And the musical comedy mostly worked too: not so much the obscure piece for “three left hands” by Mauricio Kagel that briefly united Rattle, Horton and Pierre-Laurent Aimard at the piano, but Brendel would have been delighted that the sold-out audience fell so eagerly into the trap of Haydn’s false ending to the finale of his Symphony No 90, not once but twice. A sequence of Brendel’s own drily humorous poems, interspersed with miniatures by Kurtág and Ligeti, came off thanks to the contrast between Harriet Walter’s delivery and Aimard’s controlled silliness at the piano.View image in fullscreenSurreal… a military-style band bookended the Brendel Celebration concert.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouIn surreal style, this sequence was bookended by a small military-style band – in scarlet coats, epaulettes and bearskin hats – playing two of Kagel’s Marches to Fall Short of Victory, shambolic in a very precisely written way. Perhaps it was equally, appropriately surreal that this flowed so well into the tense, tiptoeing darkness that opens Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No 3, the final work, with a solo performance by Lewis full of weight and conviction.View image in fullscreenAcceptance and thankfulness as well as loss: Simon Rattle at the Alfred Brendel a Musical Celebration concert at the Barbican.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouFor many, though, the evening’s highlight will have been the slow movement from Schubert’s C major Quintet, played by the Takács Quartet plus Adrian Brendel. It’s a piece in which there’s a sense that the melody is somehow missing, and it speaks sweetly but powerfully not only of absence, but of acceptance and thankfulness too. Here it said all those things eloquently, and more.Explore more on these topicsAlfred BrendelClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

I went on to read all of her novels, plays and poetry with great enthusiasm. Before Christmas, I returned to her penultimate novel,The Green Knight, having remembered very little of it. Yet from the very first page, I was reminded why I have always loved her work so deeply: the prose is rich, precise, disciplined and meticulously detailed; the many characters are so vividly rendered that none appears two-dimensional; each experiences and processes reality in a way that feels distinct and unmistakably individual; and the pacing of events feels perfectly judged. Although the novel is threaded with philosophical reflections on goodness and love, these never feel laboured or artificially imposed. Rather, they emerge naturally as an integral part of the novel’s dense and intricate tapestry.Alan Hollinghurst, author‘There’s a sense of our freedoms becoming vulnerable’: novelist Alan HollinghurstRead moreI’ve spent a month reading two poets whose work has been part of my life for more than 50 years. John Fuller’sMarston Meadowsopens with the immaculate corona of sonnets that inspired Ian McEwan’s new novel What We Can Know, but these give only a foretaste of a collection that ranges, with amazing wit, agility and deep feeling, through the changing perspectives of old age (Fuller is 89). To my mind, the most moving and luminous of all his books.The Poems of Seamus Heaney, superbly edited by Rosie Lavan, Bernard O’Donoghue and Matthew Hollis, contains surprises too: poems that were previously uncollected, some never seen before, and most of them fit to stand beside the literary landmarks of their time. It’s been as magical to find these new things as to reread the countless other poems known almost by heart.Our Evenings by Alan Hollinghurst is published by Pan Macmillan.

Delivery charges may apply.Kelly, Guardian readerI readSmall Things Like Theseby Claire Keegan with my Sauna Book Club (yes it’s a book club in a sauna – no, we don’t read in the sauna). I had enjoyed this title the first time I read it back in 2023, but this time I fell deep in to the story, maybe because of the time of year: this story is set at Christmastime in Dublin during the 1980s, with the eerie and unsettling backdrop of the local convent. I think it also touched a nerve because I have a daughter the same age as the girl that the protagonist Bill Furlong is trying to help. Bill is someone everyone deserves to know, someone who won’t look away – he makes the reader question their ethics and fills their hearts with hope. Keegan’s writing is so delicate, it amazes me how much she can say in one sentence. The book club enjoyed the book and we gave it a resounding 10/10.Samantha Harvey, authorSamantha Harvey: ‘I wrote love letters to Ross Poldark. Is this an admission too far?’Read moreI readChoiceby Neel Mukherjee a couple of months ago and it’s still echoing in me. It’s a novel of three stories – or perhaps one, in which the other two are embedded, so that we’re summoned into a labyrinth of moral uncertainty and offered no easy escape. It’s irresistible writing, elegant and shattering.I’m about halfway throughThe Spare RoombyHelen Garner, which is the first of her books I’ve read. She describes a kookaburra with a butter hangover, then with a few quick strokes conjures the radiance of a child and the spectre of death. I see why people rave about her, I will now too.Iris Murdoch’s newly publishedPoems from an Atticspan her life; they’re often written for a specific other, and I almost felt bad – voyeuristic – reading them. But obviously Ididread them, fascinated and uplifted by their unerring soul, their frankness and care. The final poem, Macaw in the Snow, is a bolt of light. It made me cry on the train.Orbital by Samantha Harvey is published by Vintage. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.Stuart, Guardian readerI’ve spent the majority of December readingIceby Jacek Dukaj, translated by Ursula Phillips. This is a remarkable novel about an alien invasion and an alternative history of Russia, set in 1924. The protagonist Benedykt Gieroslawski is sent to frozen Siberia to track down his father who is believed to be in cahoots with the invading Gleissen aliens who are slowly freezing the entirety of Europe. An incredible novel weighing in at nearly 1,200 pages. The world building and depth of character development are really something else.A large part of the novel takes place on the Trans-Siberian express, which only adds to the story and character development. It’s a heavy read – not one for trying when the TV is on in the background, but definitely one for sitting down quietly with and immersing oneself in.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhat we're readingAlan HollinghurstSamantha HarveySeamus HeaneyHelen GarnerIris MurdochShareReuse this content"

Another group flicks through racks of clothing, pulling out T-shirts that say “romance readers club” and “probably reading about fairies”.A poster on the wall, with tear-off tabs, invites visitors to take what they need: a love triangle, a love confession mid-dragon battle, a morally grey man or a cowboy.Half of the tabs have already been taken. This is a pop-up shop for bookish merchandise: visitors already know which tropes they want to go home with.I’ve come along with my sister, a devoted romance reader, and suddenly found myself amid a vibrant and rich fan community. The pop-up store is held by Books With Jess, an Australian small business that makes handmade book-themed merchandise.

Booktok and Bookstagram, on the social media sites TikTok and Instagram respectively, have exploded since the 2020 pandemic and romance and romantasy – a blending of romance and fantasy – are the most popular genres.The core participants are women in their 20s and 30s who grew up with online fan communities.A genre of swords and soulmates: the rise and rise of ‘romantasy’ novelsRead moreOne such reader is Jess*, a 25-year-old secondary school teacher from Brisbane who began reviewing romance novels on her Instagram account in 2020.“I grew up in what we like to refer to as the Wattpad era,” she says, referring to a fan-fiction site. Much of the writing was “pretty terrible,” she says, “but a lot of it was quite romance based and I read so much of that.“Once I got to university I started reading a little bit more of romance … and I’ve been pretty much reading it ever since.”She now reads between 200 and 400 books a year. Her Bookstagram has allowed her to connect with other romance readers around Australia and overseas – including her new housemate.“We initially connected over Instagram and figured out that we were both teachers, both read the same stuff and we’ve met up in person a bunch of times and now we’re about to move in together next year as roommates,” she says.“I’ve got quite a few friends over in America, Germany and other places who all enjoy the same things so it’s really cool to have someone to talk to about that same passion.”The online community is a big drawcard of the genre, say cousins Aleyna* and Leyla*. They started their online store, Trilogy of Romance, as a space to celebrate their love of romance novels.View image in fullscreenScarlett Hopper, Australian romance author and owner of Sydney bookshop Romancing the Novel.Photograph: Scarlett Hopper/Romancing The Novel“We noticed that romance – especially darker and trope-driven romance – didn’t always have a dedicated, judgment-free space in traditional bookstores and starting online allowed us to connect directly with readers who shared that passion,” they say in a joint statement.“The reception has been incredibly positive, we’ve built a loyal, engaged community that supports not just our store but each other.”Their customers are predominantly women aged from their 20s to 40s who are “very drawn to morally grey characters” – although hockey romance, another subgenre, is also popular.Dark romance is by far the biggest seller in books and merchandise, they say.Despite being the fastest growing genre along with science fiction in 2024, according to Neilsen Bookscan data, Australian bookstores do not tend to have stacked romance sections.

At first, the daily accrual of vocabulary was fun. Every lesson earned me experience points – a little reward that measured and reinforced my progress.But something odd happened. Over time, my focus shifted. As I climbed the weekly leaderboards, I found myself favouring lessons that offered the most points for the least effort. Things came to a head when I passed an entire holiday glued to my phone, repeating the same 30-second Kanji lesson over and over like a pigeon pecking a lever, ignoring my family and learning nothing.Philosopher C Thi Nguyen’s new book tackles precisely this kind of perverse behaviour. He argues that mistaking points for the point is a pervasive error that leads us to build our lives and societies around things we don’t want. “Value capture”, as Nguyen calls it, happens when the lines between what you care about and how you measure your progress, begin to blur. You internalise the metric – in some sense it supplants your original goal – until it has “redefined your core sense of what’s important”.He gives the example of American law school league tables, introduced to offer an ostensibly objective yardstick for candidates who had previously relied on promotional material and insider gossip. The new, supposedly hard, data focused on a few, narrow metrics.We optimise for salary or YouTube views and neglect the experiences that make life worth livingWhere previously law schools would distinguish themselves with mission statements outlining their unique philosophy and emphasis, league tables collapsed these nuanced, hard-to-quantify values into a single number – and forced schools to either chase that number, or lose out on funding and students. The result, Nguyen tells us, is that “huge shares of university resources have been diverted away from genuine pedagogical activity and toward efforts designed only to game the rankings”.Part of that ranking is calculated by how many applicants a school rejects each year. The logic goes: the higher the rejection rate, the more elite and desirable the school. This, Nguyen says, encourages many law schools to spend money soliciting applications from students with almost no chance of getting in, “simply so they’ll have more people to reject”.Nguyen is lucid, entertaining and precise, illustrating ideas with a mix of personal stories and real-world examples. He has a particular knack for conveying the specific, intrinsic pleasures of his many enthusiasms, from “the explosive hip twists” and “sweet joy” of rock climbing, to the meditative alchemy of fly-fishing, where he becomes “a nexus point in this gorgeously overwhelming flow of information”. The point of fly-fishing isn’t to catch a fish – it’s how you feel whiletryingto catch a fish.I was always going to be charmed by a book that can reference Reiner Knizia (“the Mozart of German game design”) one moment and Mario Odyssey speedruns the next. But this is no niche treatise. Value capture leads us, Nguyen argues, to waste our lives. We optimise for salary or YouTube views or our position on a leaderboard (he admits having made himself miserable by obsessing over philosophy department and journal rankings), and neglect the experiences that make life worth living.And at the level of society, value capture makes us fixate on metrics such as GDP, employment figures and exam grades. Quantitative data promises to turn hugely complex cross-sections of our world into portable summaries. It’s a seductive bargain: “delicious clarity” in the form of a simple score, at the expense of context and nuance. “This is the thought that actually keeps me awake at night,” says Nguyen, the “grim truth about the heart of data”.Our uncritical reverence for metrics allows for what Nguyen calls “objectivity laundering” – bureaucrats disguising their agency in decisions regarding our schools, hospitals and wellbeing, by evoking “the numbers” as impartial arbiters. Those in power choose which metrics to champion, then claim actions driven by those metrics somehow transcend ideology.The Score is a compelling read, urgent but never alarmist. For Nguyen, wonder, absorption and play are central to human flourishing.

There is Daphne, in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, who is so afraid she will be raped by Apollo that she begs her father to transform her into a laurel tree. More recently, in Han Kang’s The Vegetarian, brutalised Yeong-hye refuses food and takes root. Wilk argues that, in these stories and others, “a woman implants herself in despair, but also protest”.Rhett Davis’s Arborescence – an even-tempered, quietly satirical speculative novel – tells a story of cross-species transformation at scale. The narrator is a man, Bren, who at the outset is dismissive of unverified reports of “people standing around believing they’re trees”. His partner, Caelyn, is curious and undaunted. She drags him out for a hike. “I’m not sure I like forests,” he complains. “I don’t like that part of The Lord of the Rings at all. It’s really terrifying.”At “The Queue” where he works, Bren processes “work packages” for a manager he suspects is a “disembodied intelligence” that has hired a physically attractive human to represent him in meetings. Caelyn, by contrast, is “good at being good at things”. She trades a garden centre job for PhD research into people turning into trees. She becomes a famous academic, flying around the world arguing that humanity should let people “arboresce”, if that is what they choose to do.This provocative solution to ecological sustainability and an ageing population is pitched in the tradition of Jonathan Swift’s A Modest ProposalAs the world descends into reforestation, Bren dallies and drifts. For a while, he is Caelyn’s assistant. He thinks about a rabbit he didn’t rescue from the road. He reflects that work for The Queue “meant nothing”. He is easily distracted by food and drink. He eats a Reuben sandwich, even though it has fallen apart. He drinks gin with his mum. He visits his father in a nursing home, and listens (soberly) to “a confused monologue of goals, mud, elbows to the face, roaring crowds and a team that doesn’t exist”.Bren’s father’s death and references to rising temperatures give a clue to the real-world contexts that ground the novel. Mass voluntary arborescence is a provocative solution to the twin challenges of ecological sustainability and caring for an ageing population, pitched in the tradition of Jonathan Swift’s 1729 A Modest Proposal. The Irish writer’s viciously extended joke proposes a rational response to the problem of famine in Ireland: the Irish poor should sell their children as food for the wealthy.The only snag with aborescence is that people are attached, quite deeply, to other people. Bren visits a tree that was once his best friend from school and feels angry. They bonded over a comic and TV programme called Voidstar. Descriptions of Voidstar episodes punctuate the novel; their ambient weirdness and nostalgia contrasts sharply with Caelyn’s practicality and empiricism. Voidstar is a shapeshifting character, appearing variously as a “small faceless child”, “a seedling in a sleek, futuristic city”, and in one episode as the “gentlest chaos”.This description fits the novel itself. It is written in brief sections, some as short as a single line (“There are too many ways we can pretend we’re not here”). The writing is quick and careful, punchline-adjacent and mildly disorienting. The world outside a near-future Australia is sketchy, filled in with references to the UN and experts who say things like “this is the biggest economic change to affect the world this century”. Arborescence cycles through the familiar moods of the west’s environmental soul-searching – cynicism and optimism, dynamism and depletion, nostalgia and grief – but is an econovel that feels insulated from real ecological crisis.Caelyn’s research doesn’t establish a definitive reason why so many people are driven to go through the painful process of rooting to the soil. I wanted to understand why Bren himself feels increasing despair and desire for escape. One of the few clues comes when he reflects on his gender. “As a heterosexual male partner of a heterosexual woman in the first half of the twenty-first century, I should be able to support her dream and forgo dreams of my own,” he ruminates, “but something about that remains hard to swallow.”Arborescence by Rhett Davis is published by Fleet (£16.99).

But her career soon began to take off. She discusses provocation, perfectionism and telling people her secretsTue 6 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 07.08 ESTShare‘Especially in this country, I think you needed me. You didn’t realise it but you needed me, to lift some of your own shame.”Katherine Ryan, the 42-year-old Canadian comedian who has made her home in the UK for nearly 20 years, has brought her newly minted fourth child, Holland, to the Guardian offices and the baby is lying in a little blanket-nest on the table. Ryan whips off her breast pumps so they don’t make an annoying sound, but I hadn’t noticed the noise, as I was distracted by how adorable the baby is. The first thing you notice is the awesome capability of this woman, who can fully beam maternal love while crafting sequential thoughts in whole sentences, and never get distracted by anything.The second thing you notice is what she’s famous for – a natural, unaffected ballsiness, a rejection of artifice and contradiction. When she sprang on to the UK alternative comedy scene in 2008,her provocation was that she was very good-looking and didn’t pretend not to know it. “Trying to be glamorous or pretty was seen as man-pleasing,” she recalls of the early 2010s, “which was the opposite of what a funny person would do. It was a trend to be self-deprecating. If you went on stage in a glamorous outfit with your little push-up bra and heels, like, ‘I think I’m stunning,’ that would be seen as really off-putting, but I did it because that’s what I liked.”Then there was her material, which she summarises breezily: “Women, especially, needed someone to come along and be like: ‘Hey, that’s OK. You can be a feminist and have a boob job and have been a bit of a slag for a while. You can be imperfect as a mother, as a partner and as a chooser of men. You can be someone who is afraid of men, but is confident enough to slag them off; you don’t have to be nice to them the whole time.’”View image in fullscreen‘If you went on stage in your little push-up bra and heels, that would be seen as really off-putting’ … Ryan performs at Latitude festival in 2015.Photograph: Matthew Baker/WireImageThe drumbeat to that is an insistence on what’s real: if you have your baby with you, you most likely have your breast pumps; if you have the jawline of a youngster, you’ve most likelyhad tweakments; if you want to lose weight, well, there are drugs for that. “I’m not on any yet, but I’ll think about them when I’ve stopped breastfeeding,” she says. It gets to the root of how female emancipation is conceived, which it strikes me hasn’t really changed in the past 50 years: liberation means looking great but never thinking about it; being universally desired, but never chasing the male gaze; having an impermeable sense of self which God forbid you would ever surgically enhance; and allied to all that, women, especially, are supposed to never think about money but nevertheless thrive under the relentlessness of late capitalist conditions. All of which is kept afloat by the majority of us bullshitting, most of the time.“For a long time people went: ‘What? She just speaks about things?’ But I’m not trying to be provocative all the time. My experiences, behaviours and mistakes, they exist in this space between pride and shame. It happened, I talk about it, and maybe reprieve comes out of the jokes. I love telling people secrets; I want people to tell me their secrets. I want to know mistakes people have made. I don’t know why I’m so thirsty for it, but I feel it like a bond.”Ryan grew up in Sarnia, Ontario, a place that was not especially affluent or urban and had a lively amateur dramatics musicals scene. Her dad ran an engineering company, her mother was in IT, and they expected a lot of her because she was sparky, a perfectionist. She wanted to escape from the age of about seven. “It was the kind of town where people are very happy to live next door to their parents and stay there for a long time and have each other’s children. When I go back now, all these kids look really familiar to me, because I grew up with both their parents.” But didn’t she marry (or rather, enter into a civil partnership with) her own high school sweetheart? She went back to Sarnia to film an episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, caught up with Bobby Kootstra, who she dated as a teenager, and now – six years later – they have three children together, plus Violet, now 16, who Ryan had raised until then as a single mother. “Right,” says Ryan. “Sometimes I think there’s another life where I haven’t done that, and it’s still just Violet and me, chic, cosmopolitan, portable. But we can’t fully escape where we came from, it turns out.”View image in fullscreen‘We can’t fully escape where we came from’ … Ryan with her partner Bobby Kootstra.Photograph: Adam Lawrence/UKTVShe did escape for a bit, aged 18, and moved to Toronto, which she loved. These were the Hooters years, which has been another source of controversy, not just that she worked – and enjoyed working – in a topless bar (except this is a misconception: “You would be fired for being topless; you’re not allowed to take your shirt off”), but also for a bit in one of her routines where she talked about giving a manager a blowjob in return for being allowed to go home early. It crossed so many red lines – what even was that? Exploitation? Sex work? Predatory behaviour? Unsisterliness (towards whoever it was who had to stay late so she could leave early)? Whatever it was, you definitely weren’t supposed to joke about it.Ryan was amazed that her fellatio sequence generated outrage – she liked the guy! She also wanted to go home early. But it cracked open something broader: a strategic absolutism around sex, a sense that the price of the #MeToo movement was performed chastity. “I’ve always found this interesting, in debates about sex, consent and exploitation, the people who don’t understand the nuance of it. Therefore ifthisis abuse, why isn’tthatabuse?” She brings up Donald Trump supporterscomparing his commentson grabbing women by the pussy to Beyoncé singing about sex in her song Formation. “Trump supporters said: ‘Well, how’s that different?’ I thought: ‘How is it similar?’”She would never have moved to London in 2008had it not been for her then boyfriend. “Everyone said: ‘Don’t go to London, they have rats there.’ And I hated it, because I was instantly poor.”View image in fullscreen‘I knew I had jokes’ ... Ryan performing standup at Brighton Centre in February 2025.Photograph: Sorcha Bridge/Getty ImagesShe got a job in sales, was diagnosed with lupus, which can sometimes make it difficult to get pregnant, and at 23, decided to try to have a baby. “When you’re first diagnosed with something – I was quite ill at the time – you go to the worst-case scenario. My rationale with my boyfriend was, we’ve had so many ups and downs, if we haven’t split up by now, we never will. Now I see how long life is, and how many things can change. But at 23, I couldn’t see it.” She managed to get pregnant and had Violet.The next bit sounds as white-knuckle as one of those 1980s John Cleese films. While on maternity leave, she would look after Violet in the day and try to break into standup in the evening, taking her daughter with her. She knew from her sales job that she had no problem winning people over, and she had faith in her quickfire wit from her time at Hooters; more than that, she says simply, “I knew I had jokes.” The whole circuit was shot through with sexism – she won the Funny Women award in 2008, just over a year after she’d started performing, a prize that was conceived in the context of a turgid, continuing debate about whether womencouldbe funny. All the bookers were male, the comperes would performatively forget her name, or apologise to the audience that they had a girl coming on next, because of political correctness. She says female standups were “discouraged from being feminine … I think we were doing our best just to be invisible or emulate what the boys were doing. Bookers would say, ‘Women will be jealous of you, men will be distracted by you.’ But that wasn’t true.”Yet she loved being the underdog. “If you could win an audience back from there, it really felt good,” Ryan says. And she started winning newcomer awards. Her agent suggested she do an hour at the Edinburgh fringe, and she put together a sort of cabaret, dressed in a pageant tutu, because she didn’t have the material for 60 minutes of jokes. “Critically, that was panned far and wide. Very fair, bad reviews. But I think people admired my balls from the start.”View image in fullscreen‘I love money. I also think it’s provocative to talk about that’ … Ryan in The Duchess.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/Netflix © 2020She is scrupulously vague about Violet’s father, and has landed on an origin story for her daughter. “I tell Violet that she was very powerful. She was like a star in the sky. She wanted to be born. And to be born, she had to bring us together, at that time, and I’m glad that she was powerful enough to make that happen.” But Ryan realised pretty soon that Violet’s father “wasn’t going to be beneficial to us, financially or logistically”. From that point on, at still only 25, Ryan just got her head down. “I was going home to a baby. I didn’t mess around, I didn’t stay out for drinks, I didn’t have flatmates. I’d had a youth already – I didn’t take drugs or do anything too wild back in Canada, but I went to the Playboy Mansion, I got to be a podium dancer, I got to work at Hooters, we had fake IDs at 14, we were having bush parties. I’d done all that. By the time I was in London, I thought: ‘Now let’s get serious.’” Besides, she felt she couldn’t go back to Canada as a single parent. “There was a time when I really felt shame about it. There was this sense that I had chosen badly; in heteronormative relationships, women are the gatekeepers of who gets to be a father.”When Violet was six months old, Ryan successfully auditioned for Victoria Pile’s semi-improvised TV sitcom Campus – she was the worst thing in it, she says now, but the money kept her afloat for the next two years, and she’ll take that as a win. Then she got a spot on 8 Out of 10 Cats, and “after that, the phone didn’t stop ringing”. The way she tells it, she almost manifested her career. “Armed with the knowledge that my daughter deserved a really great life, and that I had cocked up enough things for us that I had to make good fast, and I knew I had jokes, I would overwrite and overprepare for auditions. I would walk into those rooms completely believing that I deserved to be there, that I would make the show better and that I should be cast.”View image in fullscreen‘My daughter deserved a really great life’ … Ryan with her daughter Violet in 2025.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockRyan has also never observed the celebrity omertà around money, the collective fantasy that everyone’s just doing what they love and, oh, wow, someone just sent a cheque to lil ol’ me. “I love money. I also think it’s provocative to talk about that. When I madeThe Duchess for Netflix, the lead female character, who was not based on my life but was obviously inspired by elements of it, did pottery and was really rich. It was questioned by the production company, all the way along. ‘Why does the daughter have a horse? She can’t have a horse.’ I was, like: ‘Why not? My daughter has a horse.’ Anyway, they killed the horse. No horse.”Her latest show,Out of Order, which returns for a second series, is a comics’ ensemble piece that she co-hosts with the comedian Rosie Jones. In a concept that feels almost essence-of-Ryan, teams of comedians compete to place members of the public in the right order in categories such as “who earns the most?” and “who’s had the most one-night stands?”. It has been eye-opening for her to see the abuse Jones gets online: “Rosie’s got being a lesbian, being disabled and being a woman, and the type of people who are happy to vocally abuse her, from their work account, just goes to show why it’s so necessary to have her front and centre. The show has loads of contributors who are gender-fluid or disabled or some type of alternative, but at the core of it, it’s just so funny.”She’s interesting on politics, never overtly agitprop, instinctively countercultural. “I think comedians have always decorated the truth with little lies to make you laugh. Politicians decorate a lie with little truths so that you almost believe them. So I think we’re like the photonegative of each other, though all of us need an audience and need to be liked, we share that in common.” She believes the comic’s purpose is nobler. “The real provocation is just demanding that people stop bullshitting themselves and each other.”Katherine Ryan’s standup special First Born Daughter is available on SkyComedy.

But during that period, the biggest single-day gross posted by any release wasn’t really a gross – or a movie. It was the series finale of the Netflix TV showStranger Things.Netflix made a deal to put the feature-length episode in theaters simultaneously with its streaming debut, andestimates put the numbersfor the 24 hours’ worth of shows, beginning at 8pm on New Year’s Eve and continuing throughout New Year’s Day, around $25m. That’s bigger than any single day of Avatar: Fire and Ash after its opening weekend. In fact, if the Stranger Things release banked over $30m, as some estimated, that would make it the second-biggest 24 hours for any release in December, beaten only by Avatar 3’s opening day.In ending, Stranger Things committed TV’s ultimate crimeRead moreAs it happens, those numbers are a little dicey – not just because Netflix doesn’t release box office grosses for its occasional theatrical releases, but because contractual issues dictated that the tickets for this event were technically free. At most cinemas showing the Stranger Things finale, attenders were actually purchasing $20 concession vouchers to reserve their seats. But that only underlines how lucrative this experiment was for theaters: rather than splitting the pot with the distributor as usual, that money presumably went entirely to exhibitors.Not every non-traditional release offers such a sweet deal. But various distributors and theaters alike are getting more creative about how to prop up a business that’s become increasingly dominated by big event movies, many of which are not as reliably huge as they used to be. Last fall, hot Broadway tickets like Hamilton (filmed with its original cast) and Merrily We Roll Along were available in movie theaters nationwide. Last year, Taylor Swift provided an injection of cash to follow up her 2023 concert film whena release partyfor her new album The Life of a Showgirl made $50m worldwide despite being cobbled together from one new music video, a series of no-frills lyric videos, and a bit of behind-the-scenes material. BTS put out a whole series of remastered concert films in the fall, and Netflix dipped into both its own fandom and a pop-music frenzy by arranging a series of theatrical engagements for its feature phenom KPop Demon Hunters. Like the Stranger Things release, this included a rare deal with AMC, the biggest movie theater chain in the US, and an unofficial enemy of the streamer. (Before 2025, only one Netflix feature has ever played at AMCs: a single-week engagement of Glass Onion. AMC has largely rejected the company’s appeal toward a shorter theatrical window.)View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift fans listen to a song during a listening event for Swift’s new album The Life of a Showgirl at the Astor Theatre in Melbourne on 3 October 2025.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesIt’s not all pop music, the stalwart opera and theater broadcasts, or sports programming, either. Targeted rereleases have become a multiplex staple, sometimes through such distributors as Fathom (which release multiple classics nationally every month) and sometimes direct from studios like Universal, who put Back to the Future and Jaws on Imax screens during slow periods for new releases last year. In some cities, the multiplexes have developed their own rep scenes; some theaters in the Regal chain, for example, have played a different “old” movie (ranging from 1930s monster classics to mid-century musicals to Christopher Nolan hits) every day since last September, something that’s continuing at least through January.It adds up to a strange, circular phenomenon. Entertainment that for much of the late 20th and early 21st century was associated with home viewing – sports, TV shows, rewatches of old favorite movies – has become potential big-screen fodder, even as countless feature films with major stars have been consigned to a straight-to-streaming release. Netflix and their ilk have helped train audiences to wait for streaming. Rather than resist that training, audiences have acquiesced and more or less refused to rush out and see as many movies as they used to (much less roll up to the theater just for the sake of seeing whatever’s playing). Yet there’s clearly still a collective pull towards gathering outside the living room.Some of this shift is probably sheer accounting. As much as some will still complain about movie theater prices or insist that their 75in flatscreen is roughly equivalent to a 50ft screen, good seats for a big-screen presentation are still more affordable (and easier to obtain) than the equivalent at a live-music show or sporting event, with a greater communal rush (and louder sound system) than what’s available in most homes.Some of it, though, is probably also a direct product of those shortened theatrical windows, and maybe a canny adaptation to them. Depending on how old you are, you might recall a time when movies would play in theaters for weeks or months – and even shorter theatrical releases would be followed by three to six to even 12 months before the movie in question would make it to home video formats. In 2026, it’s not unusual for a movie to be available to rent at home within two or three weeks of its opening weekend (which a lot of viewers have rounded in their heads to “on Netflix soon”, even if the reality is still often theatrical movies taking months to reach Netflix, if they’re licensed there at all). With a few big-ticket exceptions, the difference between paying to see a movie opening weekend or as soon as it hits premium VOD is negligible, a question less of necessity than preference. If you prefer to see a movie on the big screen, you’ll probably make time. If you could go either way, well, that decision will quickly be made for you.View image in fullscreenHamilton performers on stage.Photograph: Joan MarcusBy the same token, though, if it’s not unusual for a movie to hit some form of home video pretty quickly, then maybe it also erases any lingering sense of taboo over audiences paying an admission to watch something readily available elsewhere. Yes, you can watch Back to the Future or the Stranger Things finale or a big game at home, sometimes for free (or what feels like free, anyway; even sorta-free options require at least a reliable internet connection). Even that original-cast Hamilton released in September was actually streaming on Disney+ for years. But if everything is available everywhere – or anyway, if a lot of entertainment is available in a greater variety of ways – then there’s not always a reason to stick with the same method for every single block of time, any more than there’s reason to swear off ever eating food from a restaurant that you could learn to cook at home.Home-viewing advocates might roll their eyes at the outsized wonder with which some frequent moviegoers speak of the theatrical experience. Yet if theaters do survive – something most people who aren’t Netflix shareholders would probably ultimately favor – it may be due in large part to some immutable sense of reverence that they carry. To go out and see Stranger Things or a Jaws rerelease or a big soccer game at a movie theater is an act of devotion that defies simple expedience. A few viewers may have checked out those KPop Demon Hunters screenings without watching the movie on Netflix first; most of them, though, were attending to sing along with songs they already knew. A certain section of moviegoers will always prize the thrill of making that devotional choice sight unseen, for movies that could be great or terrible. But for others, maybe the cherished and the unproven are just switching places.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryStranger ThingsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with the right drugs and therapies, relief is possible from this debilitating and often misunderstood conditionMorgan OforiTue 6 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareIt was a dreary Monday morning in September 2016, and I was working as a teacher, trying to settle a new year 7 class, when a sharp pain bloomed behind my right eye. It was followed by quick jolts, like electric shocks. As each class came and went, the pain eased and then returned with greater intensity. Four times that day I left a teaching assistant with worksheets and ran to the school bathroom to douse my face with cold water. I took ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, but the pain remained unbearable.The headaches appeared repeatedly that autumn, and again in spring, and soon formed an annual pattern. September and October were the worst, then February and March. I could predict the routine: aura in the shower, early twinges on the train, full-blown agony in class by 9.30am. In late 2019, a GP finally referred me to a neurologist and I was diagnosed with cluster headaches.Cluster headaches typically begin with severe pain around one eye that lasts up to three hoursAbout one in 1,000people are affectedby the condition, and men are more frequently diagnosed. Cluster headaches typically begin with sudden, severe pain around one eye that peaks within minutes and lasts up to three hours. Attacks come in clusters, daily or multiple times a day, and are accompanied by red or watery eyes, drooping eyelids or facial sweating. I havethe episodic form, which arrives in seasonal bouts; others have chronic cluster headaches, defined by the absence of long pain-free periods.What unites sufferers is the intensity. Onestudy rated the painat 9.7 out of 10, higher than bone fractures or pancreatitis. Anotherfound 64% of cluster headache patientsexperienced suicidal thoughts during bouts; the number dropped to 4% when they were not in pain.View image in fullscreen‘Greater occipital nerve blocks became my main preventive tool’ … Morgan Ofori.Photograph: Ethan Parker/The GuardianVal Hobbs, 74, a chronic sufferer from Pembrokeshire, isn’t surprised. Her attacks began when she was two. “I would throw myself on the floor and bang my head. That was put down to being spoiled,” she says. Her symptoms worsened through childhood. Alcohol in her teens,like many triggers, made things worse. After drinking sherry at her school leaving party, she recalls barely being able to see on the bus home.Her family often interpreted her attacks as drunken episodes. Support eventually came from her father and then from her husband, Rod, who was diagnosed with epilepsy in early adulthood. “I was very lucky to find such an exceptional person,” she says. “We were meant to meet.” Hobbs took clerical work after moving to Wales in 1981, but often hid her condition. She was fired from one job, partly due to absences during attacks. Her breakthrough diagnosis came in 2002 at theNational Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgeryin London.Still, the inability to plan life around unpredictable attacks took its toll. She especially hated being unable to plan social events, being seen as unreliable as a colleague, and even having to be looked after by her children (at home and in public) in the midst of the paralysis caused by the worst episodes. “It robs you of the small freedoms we don’t appreciate until they’re gone,” she says. She remembers winning tickets for the queen’s golden jubilee concert, only to have an attack inside a portable toilet.Headaches have been described throughout history. “The first description of headache comes byway of the Mesopotamians in 4000BC,” write Seymour Diamond and Mary Franklin in their 2005 book, Headache Through the Ages. They attributed the disease to Tiu, an evil spirit who attacked his victims’ heads.The Ebers Papyrus, a record of ancient Egyptian medical knowledge dating from 1550BC, suggests crocodiles should be wrapped around the head to combat what some modern-day observers would describe as a migraine. In the middle ages, migraine was recognised as a distinct disorder, with treatments ranging from bloodletting and herbal concoctions to other, more superstitious remedies.It was the Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp who provided the first detailed description of a cluster headache. In his Observationes Medicae, published in 1641, Tulp speaks of a patient “afflicted with a very severe headache occurring and disappearing daily at fixed hours”.Cluster headaches were only officially recognised by the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society in 1988. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, they were thought to be caused by a problem with the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain, says Prof Peter Goadsby, a leading specialist in diagnosing and treating the condition.In 1998, Goadsby and the neuroscientist Arne May published the results of a study for which they had triggered cluster headaches in patients andmonitored the attacks in a brain scanner. The results, published in the Lancet, showed activation of the hypothalamus, which is responsible for human circadian rhythm, when patients were in pain, and a deactivation when they recovered.View image in fullscreenJamie Charteris’s cluster headaches were misdiagnosed as sinus problems.Photograph: HandoutDespite such advances, diagnosis remains slow. Jamie Charteris’s attacks began in 1986 and felt like “a modelling balloon being inflated behind my left eye”. GPs thought he had sinus problems; he underwent four surgeries before finally being diagnosed in 2014, after a doctor Googled his symptoms.Dr Nicholas Silver, a neurologist at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, says delays in diagnosis and treatment happen because patients are rarely seen mid-attack. “You’re tired and depressed, but not in agony,” he says. He proceeds by ruling out other primary headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type,hemicrania continua,paroxysmal hemicraniaand SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiformheadache), before diagnosing cluster headaches. A detailed history is essential: on which side do symptoms appear? For how long? What time of year? Are there triggers, such as alcohol? Do symptoms change with touch? Certain features such as redness, tearing, drooping eyelids and nasal congestion help confirm cluster headaches. Once diagnosed, patients may be referred to specialist centres including the Walton, or rapid-access clinics such as the one I attend at St Thomas’ hospital in London. But many first arrive in A&E or are given inadequate treatments.Dorothy Chapman, 78, is a trustee of the UK charity Ouch (Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headache). She has experienced cluster headaches for most of her life, although she hasn’t had an attack since 2016. When she was in her 20s, she had her teeth pulled because dentists misinterpreted her pain. She believes dentists still need much more awareness. When Charteris sought help from Ouch, it was Chapman who replied to his email. I remember calling the Ouch helpline during an attack in early 2021; a calm volunteer talked me through oxygen treatment and medication until the episode eased.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice)guidance on treatmentrecommends sufferers are offered high-flow oxygen and/or the anti-migraine drug triptan delivered by injection or nasal spray. No tablets, painkillers or opioids should be used. Preventive options include verapamil, a blood pressure medication, which apparently soothesHarry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe’sbouts.But Dr Giorgio Lambru, the consultant neurologist who diagnosed me, believes the Nice guidance needs updating to reflect a clearer treatment pathway and help GPs avoid misprescribing. For episodic patients, he says, timing is everything: “The duration of the bout dictates the treatment.” Short bouts with infrequent attacks are handled with abortive therapy alone: triptan injections or nasal sprays, plus oxygen. Longer or more intense bouts require preventives such as verapamil, sometimes paired with steroids, which act quickly before wearing off. Many patients also receive agreater occipital nerve blockduring a bout – an injection into the side of the head where the pain is that reduces nerve activity.The Nice guidance needs updating to reflect a clearer treatment pathway and help GPs avoid misprescribingIf these fail, Lambru may consider topiramate, an anti-epilepsy medication, or vagus nerve stimulation devices. Chronic patients sometimes require multiple nerve blocks, radio-frequency treatment or, in rare cases, neuromodulation through occipital nerve stimulation, in which a battery-operated device is implanted and zaps the nerve to calm it down. Lambru stresses that, unlike in migraines, frequent use of triptans to treat cluster headache rarely causes medication-overuse headaches – an important point missing from many GP guidelines.Patients also experiment with other approaches: cold air, cold showers, intense exercise, caffeine, vitamin D andin some cases psychedelics, though evidence remains largely anecdotal, according to Lambru. One promising emerging option is CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) targeting medication, used in migraine. Injectables such as galcanezumab, which aim to slow the potent inflammatory protein,show potential for episodiccluster headache treatmentbut are unavailableon the NHS.My own treatment journey has involved preventives and acute options when bouts strike. I briefly tried verapamil, but Covid restrictions made the required ECG monitoring (because of risks to the conduction of the heart) difficult. Oral steroids helped me temporarily but couldn’t be used long-term because of the increased risk of harm, such as weakened bones, eyesight problems and diabetes. Greater occipital nerve blocks became my main preventive tool. The moment I sense patterns emerging, I call the headache clinic at St Thomas’, and the nurses fit me in as soon as possible.View image in fullscreen‘Oxygen therapy constricts dilated blood vessels, reducing the pressure and pain’ … Morgan Ofori.Photograph: Ethan Parker/The GuardianWhen attacks hit, I use high-flow medical oxygen delivered to my home in tall industrial cylinders. The relief is extraordinary. Prof Goadsby and Dr Anna Cohen’s 2009study showed oxygencould make patients pain-free within 15 minutes, leading to its approval by Nice. During a cluster attack, blood flow in the brain increases. Oxygen therapy constricts the dilated blood vessels, reducing the pressure and pain while calming down overactive nerves. The drug sumatriptan, which reduces the release of pain-causing chemicals and blocks pain signals from being transmitted to the brain, never worked for me, despite trying several forms.Hobbs also relies heavily on oxygen, though she believes demand-valve masks, which deliver big bursts of oxygen quickly, could improve outcomes. Ouch has campaigned for wider access to these masks, though Lambru notes evidence is still emerging. The challenge is that only about one in 10 UK patients use or have access to oxygen – a stark shortfall, considering its effectiveness.At Ouch’s annual conference in Newcastle last summer, about 100 sufferers gathered with neurologists. There were quiet rooms, oxygen stations and sessions on new research and coping strategies. A recurring theme was the need for better data. Headache diaries help clinicians recognise patterns, but until recently most were kept by hand.Inspired by his own struggles, 37-year-old web developer Darshan Ramanagoudra created MyClusters, a free app for tracking attacks, triggers and treatment effectiveness. Within its first month, users from more than a dozen countries logged thousands of attacks. Ramanagoudra hopes better data will reduce misdiagnosis and strengthen research.“By the summer of 2023, I was getting multiple daily attacks. By the winter, it was about six a day, and that’s when I started reading a lot of medical papers,” says Ramanagoudra, who is based in the Netherlands. He consulted doctors and researchers to see what the online community in the Netherlands was saying, then started tracking it all on a spreadsheet. “It got a bit complicated, and I realised I could do pivot tables and things, but I figured someone else would want additional information. How were they going to do it?” The idea for MyClusters was born.Cluster headaches are ‘the most painful condition on the planet’. Sufferers are going to extreme – and secretive – measures for reliefRead moreThe percentage of cluster headache sufferers, diagnosed or undiagnosed, in each country is estimated to be about 6.5%, says Tom Zeller Jr, the author of the 2025 book The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Condition – and a Search for Relief. However, in terms of funding and research, “cluster headaches are given short shrift compared with the impact it has on our economies and on people’s individual lives”, he says. He believes this is a mistake. “It’s not a terminal disease, it’s a lifelong disease. But if you add up all the time a person spends being disabled by these bouts of head pain and other neurological symptoms, it adds up to a lot.”I’ve just emerged from my latest autumn bout. This time the pain struck on the left side, a first for me, and I received my first multi-cranial block to treat it. I was injected four times in the side of my head, plus another shot at the back. I’m not needle-phobic; I imagine I’m giving blood from my skull. The approach seems to have worked. Using MyClusters to track patterns, I’ve been headache-free for nearly six weeks.Winter brings respite, and is a time of calm. But sometime in this new year, I know the cycle will begin again. Cluster headaches are my own recurring, disabling season, never too far around the corner.Explore more on these topicsHealthHealth & wellbeingNeuroscienceMedical researchDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What can Iuse instead?Jill, via emailCoconut milk brings silkiness and sweet richness to curries, and also mellows spices, so any substitute will likely change the nature of the dish. That said, if you really want to avoid the white stuff, Karan Gokani, author ofIndian 101, would simply replace it with vegetable stock. Another easy swap (if you’re not averse to dairy) is yoghurt, says John Chantarasak, chef and co-owner ofAngloThaiin London, which is handy, because “that’s normally hanging about in the fridge”.Not all curries involve coconut milk, however, and it’s these that perhaps offer a better solution to Jill’s conundrum. “Once you get past that idea, you go into two realms,” says Sirichai Kularbwong of Thai restaurantSingburiin London, by which he means wet and dry curries. The latter involve frying curry paste (“usually containing dried chillies”) and seasoning with fish sauce (“in Jill’s case, a vegan fish sauce”), tamarind and sugar. “The consistency of the sauce is never thin, and you pair it with root vegetables and flat beans, and eat alongside rice,” he adds. Meanwhile, a favourite wet curry that doesn’t call for coconut milk isgaeng om, made with “a simple curry paste of garlic, chillies and lemongrass boiled with good veg stock and seasoned with vegan fish sauce”. Veg-wise, to that base you’d typically add pumpkin, mushrooms, maybe pak choi.Sundays are often batch-cook days round at Chantarasak’s, and start with roasting a cauliflower or squash with oil, salt and perhaps some garam masala. Next, you need a sauce: “Sweat onions, garlic and ginger, then add fenugreek leaf, green cardamom and nuts [cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, say], and saute.” Blend the lot with water until smooth, then return to the pan, add some yoghurt and stir in the roast veg.Vivek Singh, founder and executive chef ofthe Cinnamon Collection restaurants, would also go for cauliflower: “It’s a staple in so many households, and you can go basic with the spices, or get quite involved with cardamom, a cinnamon stick, cloves and a bay leaf.” Either way, start by heating oil in a pan, then add the whole spices and let them crackle. “Add sliced or chopped onions and cook, stirring, on high heat for 12-13 minutes, until caramelised. If you have some ginger and garlic paste, add that now, along with ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, ground red chilli powder and salt.” Fry for 30 seconds, tip in chopped or tinned tomatoes and peeled and diced raw potatoes (plus carrots, if you fancy). “Fry for a few minutes, then add cauliflower florets and fry for two minutes. Cover, sweat on low for five minutes, take off the lid and stir, giving it some real elbow grease.” Pour in a cup of water, bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. “Add a sprinkle of garam masala and a crumble of dried fenugreek leaves, if you have some, then stir in chopped fresh coriander and a squeeze of lemon.” Don’t forget to serve with chapatis.Finally,a simple rasamis sure to cosset and hug, especially this month. “It’s a south Indian tomato and black pepper broth,” Gokani says, “and it’s brilliant just sipped from a cup.” And who couldn’t do with some of that right about now?Got a culinary dilemma?

This one leans into the amazing varieties of root vegetables we have at our disposal, and it is especially stunning when layered and presented with all of the other elements: a bold mustard aïoli, crisp curried chickpeas, and an easy parsley and red onion salad that is quick-pickled to provide an acidic finish to a satisfying dish.Root vegetable rösti, crisp chickpeas with parsley, red onion pickled salad and mustard aïoliThese rösti are easy to customise (although I’d suggest going for a combination of at least two root vegetables); they freeze well, too, making those lazy weekend brunches that much easier.Prep30 minCook30 minServes2-4For the chickpeas400g tin chickpeas, drained2tbsp olive oil½tsp salt1tsp curry powder1tsp smoked paprikaFor the salad80g red onion, peeled and thinly sliced10g parsley leavesZest of 1 lemon, plus juice of ½1tsp sumac1 pinch saltFor the mustard aïoli100g mayonnaise1tbsp English mustardJuice of ½ lemonFor the rösti300g root vegetables(such as beetroot, sweet potato, parsnip), peeled and grated80g red onion, peeled and thinly sliced2tbsp plain flour1 eggNeutral oil,for cookingHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a baking sheet with baking paper. Pat the drained chickpeas dry with kitchen towel, then tip them on to the lined sheet. Add the olive oil, salt and spices, toss well, then bake for 15-20 minutes, until crisp.For the salad, use your hands to mix all the ingredients in a bowl, gently massaging the parsley and red onion as you do so. You can do this a few hours in advance, or even the night before.For the aïoli, mix all the ingredients in a bowl and season to taste.In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the rösti. Put a generous glug of neutral oil in a frying pan on a low-medium heat, then spoon in half the rösti mixture and flatten into a circle. Leave to cook for five to seven minutes, until the edges crisp up and the base releases itself from the pan, then carefully flip and cook for another five to seven minutes on the other side, until golden. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the residual heat of the oven while you repeat with the remaining rösti mix. If you’re serving more people, or want an easier time flipping the rösti, make them smaller, but bear in mind that the cooking time per side will be shorter.To assemble, put the rösti on a platter, drizzle the mustard aïoli on top, followed by a sprinkling of the crisp chickpeas and a generous heap of the pickled salad. Save any leftover chickpeas or aïoli to use in salads or sandwiches.Ferment: Simple Ferments and Pickles, and How to Eat Them, by Kenji Morimoto, is published by Pan Macmillan at £22.

Now I’m in love with my midlife situationshipNatasha GinnivanBored, lonely and emerging from lockdown, a less-traditional relationship was just what I was looking forTue 6 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 16.11 ESTShareWe were just two midlifers in our 50s who met back in 2020 using a popular dating app. Bored, lonely and emerging from lockdown we jumped at the chance for an outing. We had our first date at a trendy, dimly-lit Japanese restaurant and bar in Sydney’s Surry Hills. By our second lychee martini, we became aware of some mutual connections that we knew and discovered that we had actually grown up in the same place.There was an immediate feeling of familiarity and a shared sense of humour that clicked without effort. We were in no rush for anything too serious. In fact, it would take another five outings, including antique-trawling for some 70s-inspired crockery, before things would develop into more of a romantic connection.You could say we’ve been dating ever since but, in modern parlance, I’m inclined to call it more of a “situationship” than a full-blown relationship because it’s not an “all-in” arrangement. I don’t think that is too uncommon these days – partnership norms have shifted over the past decade and some reports suggest that there’s even some kind ofrelationship recessionout there.Caroline felt she was doomed to dating failure. Learning to sit with sadness was part of overcoming her loneliness | Ahona GuhaRead moreThe Oxford dictionary now describes asituationshipas a romantic relationship in which the couple are not official partners. An example provided with this definition is “I’m trying to turn our situationship into something more serious”.I can identify with the definition part but not so much with the example part.This well-used term is usually associated with non-commitment and can mean different things to different generations. The word,situationship, has been on the rise since the early noughties to denote insecurity in a connection. However, I think the reason this label is a fit forourarrangement is that despite being “committed partners” we run separate households and keep our finances separate.I have my place in the mountains and he has his in the city. If there were a metaphor to describe a vehicle for riding through life, ours might be a vintage motorbike with a sidecar rather than a couple’s convertible or the winnebago of a family unit.We take trips and vacations together, however we also have individual holidays interstate or overseas. I am not particularly concerned when he announces that he’s got a few weeks’ leave and would like to travel somewhere on his own – I’m usually busy with weekendmarketsanyway, or a line up ofblogarticles to write in my downtime.We do Christmas celebrations separately but come back together for New Year’s Eve, birthdays and for beach holidays with games nights during the break.I concluded early on in our relationship that we would probably always be more like “committed companions” than a full-blown relationship of interdependence. Perhaps the plastic tub I keep my clothes in at his place was the best clue. At a younger age this may have sent me into a spiral of insecurity, however, at this stage of life, my attitude is more like meh – whatever works.It could just be a stage-of-life thing and, without drawing excessively on the psychoanalytics of it,attachment theoryalso probably has something to do with it. In addition, we both come from large families that we can fall back on for support in challenging times, which probably buoys the relationship in immeasurable ways.In terms of marriage, I’ve been there, done that, got the T-shirt. I was 24 the first time I tied the knot and 28 the second time. At about 40, with two kids, I became single again and was just nudging the “grey divorce” age bracket.This is how we do it: ‘After 50 years together, I’m more orgasmic than ever’Read moreExperts claim that thegrey divorcephenomenon is not a spike but a shift as women think, “if not now then when?”Menopause can alsoreframethe kind of relationship that works best for women. As relationship expertEsther Perelsays, “most of us will have two or three marriages/ committed relationships in our lifetime – some of us will have them with the same person”.A younger me may have dreamt of the ever-after of a long-term relationship with only one partner. However, the older I get, the more philosophical I become and I can see how relationships – failures and successes – have the power to transform us.Maybe there is something to be said for living apart but together as a couple.My current relationship, although less traditional, is probably the longest surviving one since my two marriages. Who knows, one day we might trade the motorbike and sidecar for the couple’s convertible or Winnebago and hit that open road of life together. Though, at the risk of sounding terribly Zen about it, until then I’m at peace with staying in the question.Natasha Ginnivan is a researcher of psychology and ageing.

Here, on the flanks of Bickerton Hill, it is said that in the 18th century a heartbroken man calledJohn Harris of Handleylived as a hermit for several decades.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As locations to weather the storm of romantic trauma go, this – I mused as I stood above it on a crisp winter’s day – certainly takes some beating. Offering a panorama of nine counties of England and Wales from its entrance, I could spy the white disc of Jodrell Bank Observatory glistening in the sunlight, while the peaks and troughs of the Clwydian range appeared like a watermark in the distance.A map of places the walk on the Sandstone TrailI’d come here, not seeking solitude, but to meet up with Jose, an old friend I’d not seen for nine years, and to try a new walking package dreamed up by two Cheshire pubs along a prime section of the 34-mile (55km)Sandstone Trailbetween the villages of Tarporley and Malpas. The route follows theSandstone Ridge, an ancient landscape of escarpments and rolling hills, rising from the Cheshire Plain.View image in fullscreenA walker on the Sandstone Trail near Beeston Castle.Photograph: UK City Images/AlamyThe idea for the walk is simple: just because it’s winter doesn’t mean it has to be hard. Daylight hours are limited, the weather is less predictable, so why not stick to one 14-mile stretch, bookended with a comfy, warm room in each inn, and good food and drink – dinner on both nights and a cooked breakfast are included, as is an optional packed lunch. The pubs arrange the luggage transfer and a taxi when you finish to take you back to the start.We met in the Swan in Tarporley – a 16th-century coaching inn, where, in front of a roaring open fire, we caught up on old times, studied the walk map and enjoyed food made from ingredients farmed practically on the doorstep. As we tucked into the cheeseboard (Tarporley blue comes highly recommended), owner Woody Barlow told us how the idea was born in the summer when they held a charity fun run between the two pubs in memory of the late owner Si Lees-Jones.At this time of year, the trail has a lovely stillness about it – the woods and ridgelines look magical in the winter light“It was so successful, we began to think – these two pubs have always been popular with walkers, cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts, especially those doing the Sandstone Trail in sections,” he said. “Many were trying to organise accommodation night by night, but we realised we could offer something much more streamlined. Plus at this time of year, the trail has a lovely stillness about it – the woods and ridgelines look magical in the winter light.”I woke the next morning to the sound of rain on my window, but as I met Jose for breakfast – a hearty helping of eggs – the sky unexpectedly began to clear. Leaving the town, we followed country lanes, where the hedges bloomed with sloes. Acorns cracked under our boots. These nuts would once have been used for nourishing pigs before the start of medieval feasts – like those once held inBeeston Castle, the former royal fort built by the Earl of Cheshire on his return from the crusades in the 1220s, which filled the horizon.View image in fullscreenFog cloaks the trail high on the Sandstone Ridge.Photograph: George Pollock/AlamyWe cut through a muddy field, making a beeline for this landmark, then followed the Sandstone Trail waymarks over the Shropshire Union Canal at Wharton’s Lock. We reached the tall red walls of rubble-filled sandstone blocks and huge wooden doors of the castle, said to house treasure from Richard II.It was a tempting prospect, but with miles still to cover we made our way instead through the network of weaving pathways on Peckforton Hills, topped with towering red pines that give shelter from the icy wind but allow light to drop to the forest floor in dazzling spindles. Here we came across a Victorian castle folly built in the 1840s and now a hotel popular with wedding parties, but we were more taken with nature’s treasures in the form of sweet chestnuts on neighbouringBulkeley Hill. The bark of these old trees would have once been used by passing Romans to tan leather and the nuts were essential rations for legionnaires.The light emanating from the windows of the 300-year-old Lion pub welcomed us to our big finish nearly as warmly as the staffWe stopped here a while, enjoying our sandwiches from the pub on our first exposure to some of the tor-like sandstone that the ridge is named for, before soldiering on to our next summit – Raw Head on Bickerton Hill. At 227 metres (745ft), it’s not huge, but it is the highest point on the trail. We wandered through the forest talking about its history (its rocks were formed about 250m years ago in the Triassic period, and iron oxide has caused them to become banded in hues of red, terracotta and ochre, which cement the sand together) and our own past lives, discussing friends we once shared.As the sun hung ever lower in the sky, we still had some climbing to do on Bickerton Hill, home to the hermit’s cave. The area is replete with lowland heath, once used for grazing, thatching, and foraging. Bilberries still grow there.View image in fullscreenThe Lion in Malpas.Photograph: Phoebe SmithWe traced the edges of Maiden Castle – the remains of an iron age hill fort built between 500 and 600BC and still occupied when the Romans arrived in Britain – before descending to country lanes, where someone had kindly left a wheelbarrow of apples for hikers.The light emanating from the windows of the 300-year-old Lion pub welcomed us to our big finish nearly as warmly as the staff, who were suitably impressed with the distance we’d walked, making us feel like we’d had a proper adventure.Before we retired to bed we raised a glass – to the views, the hearty food and, of course, to heartbroken John Harris – in short, to our perfect winter walk.

I don’t like to let them go. I love the mischief of the days and nights over Christmastide. They sit outside ordinary time, disappearing and extending of their own accord. I enjoy the historical ambiguity over when Twelfth Night falls: the 5th, or this night? I don’t want to be pressed by traditions or superstitions, making up my own ways to say goodbye to the festive period – yet still, I’m wary of them.We used to cut our tree from the estate we lived on, but in recent years we’ve chosen one from Willis Farm, high on the downs, where they’re grown sustainably, with wildlife in mind. Ours is a colourful tree. Each bauble has meaning and I’m sorry to see them go. Some are from childhood; a treasured wooden goose, and a beaver nestled in a walnut shell, came from a Christmas shop in Banff, Alberta, bought on a day off from ranching in 1989.View image in fullscreenA decorative beaver nestled in a walnut shell.Photograph: Nicola ChesterThere are silver acorns and golden apples, and an inordinate number of birds and animals – a sleeping fawn, a bejewelled owl, a badger in a dressing gown smoking a pipe. There are clay ornaments made years ago by our children, in the school up the lane where I made this year’s wreath. Place, memory, irreverence, reverence, the outside in, all celebrated.I’ll disentangle the now-brittle golden-green mistletoe from the ceiling light. I’ll freeze the berries and, come spring, press them into the leaf scars on apple boughs, and hope for growth. I’ll take the crunchy remains of our wind-tossed wreath and redistribute them about the garden.View image in fullscreenHolly, ivy and hawthorn berries have many uses.Photograph: Nicola ChesterThis year we’ve made new places for old things. The swag of tinsel that looped down the banister of our 1950s cottage for two decades now makes a grotto of our bungalow kitchen arch, prinked with sprays of now-curled fir, holly, ivy and hawthorn berries. I’ll dismantle it, extricate more sprigs from the felted mouse choir that makes a stage of our mantelpiece, and send all the greenery up the chimney of the lit fire, before dashing outside to watch the sparks rise into the night.

So how do you know when to refresh and when to replace?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The hackOld soil isn’t always bad soil. Most potting mixes lose structure and nutrition over time, but they can often be revived with a bit of care. If the mix smells musty, contains mould or has signs offungus gnats, it’s best to discard it. But if it’s dry, healthy and crumbly, you can usually bring it back to life.The methodTip the used soil into a clean container, break up any clumps, and remove old roots or debris. To refresh it, mix in around one-third new compost, plus a handful of perlite or coco coir, to increase aeration and drainage. For large tropical plants, add a slow-release fertiliser. If you’re unsure about pests, moisten the soil, place it on a tray, cover with foil, and bake it in an oven at 82-93C (180-200F) for 30 minutes to sterilise it.The testI used refreshed soil for repotting a pothos. My plant remained happy and sent out new growth within weeks.The verdictRefresh when you can, replace when you must. A little maintenance turns old soil from waste into a healthy base for new growth – good for your plants and the planet.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsHouseplant hacksGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s tortured – they have a torture chamber in the middle of Caracas that they’re closing up.” Trump did not elaborate on this claim.Trump has faced widespreadscornfor his dancing at rallies, includingto the disco song YMCA, but supporters have lauded and copied it.The president said his wife, Melania, considered his signature moves to be unpresidential. “She hates it when I dance. I said, ‘everybody wants me to dance, darling’.”He said the first lady replied: “They don’t like it. They’re just being nice to you.”Trump told her she was wrong. “The place goes crazy.

There are armed civilians here. You never know what might happen, they might attack people.”View image in fullscreenA member of colectivos takes part in a march calling for the release of Maduro.Photograph: Gaby Oráa/ReutersA semblance of normality returned to much of the city, with shops and bakeries reopening and people going to work – but uncertainty over what will happen next created a febrile mood.The interim president,Delcy Rodríguez, has sought to project a sense of calm and control since being sworn in on Monday but there was no disguising the government’s shock and jitteriness.On Tuesday, Rodríguez appeared to harden her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to Donald Trump’s claim that the US was running the South American country.It marked anothershift in tonefrom Maduro’s former vice-president who released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.In addition to the humiliation of Maduro’sappearance in a New York courton narco-trafficking charges, authorities in Caracas face the risk of a fresh US attack, economic collapse, internal regime fracture and the return of overseas-based opposition leaders.Gunfire erupted on Monday night when security forces shot at unauthorised drones which reportedly were mistaken for another US operation. “There was no confrontation, the entire country remains completely calm,” Simon Arrechider, the deputy information minister, told reporters.But it is a tense calm.On Monday at least 14 journalists and media employees, including 13 members of international media organisations, weredetained in Caracas. All but one were later released.An emergency decree has sought to stamp out any public celebration of Maduro’s ouster and ordered police to seek and detain “everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.Footage posted on social media showed colectivos – some wearing masks – blocking highways, roving pro-opposition neighbourhoods and questioning residents, prompting people to warn friends and family via WhatsApp and other platforms to leave phones at home or to scrub them of political content.View image in fullscreenAn emergency decree has sought to stamp out any public celebration of Maduro’s ouster.Photograph: Gaby Oráa/ReutersThe interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, posted a photo of himself posing with police who cradled weapons and chanted “always loyal, never traitors”.Jeaneth Fuentes, 53, a doctor at a private clinic in Caracas, said the presence of armed groups – some in uniform, others in civilian clothes – made her commute to and from work feel like a gamble. “It’s frightening, terrifying.”Thegunfire on Monday nightcompounded the sense that anything might happen, she said. “I can’t plan, it’s living each minute at a time.” She leaves home only for work, and never after 6pm.Fuentes expressed hope the current turmoil might lead to the end of rule by chavismo, the movement Hugo Chávez brought to power in 1999. “If something was built over so many years, it can’t be torn down in a day.”Government supporters, in contrast, condemned the abduction of Maduro and said they would defend Venezuela’s sovereignty. “There is a fighting spirit inherent in the Venezuelan people,” said Willmer Flores, a finance ministry employee. “We are the liberators of America, and we are not intimidated by anything.” He pledged solidarity with Maduro.From elation to frustration: Trump snub wrongfoots Venezuela’s oppositionRead moreWith the Trump administration warning of potential fresh military strikes, and ablockade on oil exportssqueezing revenues, there is speculation about divisions within the regime over how to accommodate Trump while retaining anti-imperialist credentials. Unlike Rodríguez, who faces no criminal charges in the US, ministers like Cabello who are accused of narco-trafficking could lose not just their power but their liberty.Another concern for the government isMaría Corina Machado, the fugitive opposition leader who mobilised millions of voters last year, slipped to Oslo to collect her Nobel peace price and is now vowing to return.“I’m planning to go as soon as possible back home,”she told Fox News. “We believe that this transition should move forward,” she told Fox News in an interview. “We won an election by a landslide under fraudulent conditions. In free and fair elections, we will win over 90% of the votes.”Trump however has publiclydismissed Machado, saying she lacks support in Venezuela, and tacitly endorsed continued chavista rule under Rodríguez – on condition she meets US demands, includingfavoured accessfor US oil companies.Explore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaDelcy RodríguezNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts aren’t so sureIndustry insiders say US oil firms want to ‘avoid getting screwed’ and will proceed with extreme caution in regionAnalysis: Trump’s focus on Venezuelan oil reinforces claim action was never about ‘war on drugs’Callum Jonesin New YorkTue 6 Jan 2026 13.19 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 15.53 ESTShareIndustry experts have expressed skepticism overDonald Trump’s bullish prediction that US big oil firms will rapidly invest tens of billions of dollars to fix Venezuelan infrastructure and ramp up production after the rendition of the country’s president,Nicolás Maduro.Without an “iron-clad guarantee” that the US federal government will fully reimburse them for the cost of rebuilding the country’s oil market, analysts expect global energy giants to proceed with extreme caution.The US president has nevertheless insisted theoil industrywill move quickly, boldly predicting that dominant US players could get an expanded oil operation “up and running” acrossVenezuela– reputedly home to the world’s largest crude oil reserves – in less than 18 months.“I think we can do it in less time than that,” Trump claimed in aninterviewwith NBC News on Monday. “But it’ll be a lot of money.”In the face of such sweeping declarations, US oil firms such as ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – the only US oil major still operating in Venezuela – have so fardeclined to publicly outline any such plans for investment.Dense, sticky and heavy: why Venezuelan crude oil appeals to US refineriesRead more“It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,” a Conoco spokesperson said this weekend. Hours earlier, Trump had stated at a press conference that “our very large United States oil companies” were poised to “go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country”.The ambitious timeline laid out by Trump could prove unrealistic. “It’s probably going to take three years for any kind of production bounce,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, who expects an increase of around half a million barrels per day (bpd) by “2029, maybe late 2028”.Energy firms will probably spend the first year sorting through new government and security contracts, he suggested, the second year investing in reconstruction, and only find themselves in a position to meaningfully increase output in the third.“Either the US is going to step up with guarantees, or we’re going to spend six to 12 months watching the dust settle,” added Pickering, who noted that multinationals’ interest in Venezuelan oil does not necessarily correspond with their appetite to invest heavily in a country with an uncertain future.“I think their interest is an eight, on a scale of one to 10,” he said. “I think their appetite is a four or five on a scale of one to 10, because there is no clarity yet.”Seasoned operators in the region believe the firms will tread carefully. “I expect that you’ll see all of them now say, ‘This is fantastic, it’s a great opportunity, and we have a team ready to go to Venezuela,’” Elliott Abrams, who served as Trump’s special envoy to Venezuela during his first term,told Politico. “But that’s politics … That doesn’t mean they’re going to invest.”Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect ofoil giants being reimbursed by the federal government for any investments they make in Venezuela.But the administration has yet to come forward with any detail on whether the US taxpayer will back them.Only an “iron-clad guarantee” from the government that they will be repaid for “every dollar spent” will prompt oil companies to move more quickly, according to Pickering.They want to “avoid getting screwed”, he said. “You need to be protected from sovereign risk, that we’ve seen in Venezuela already: you’ve got to protect against being nationalized again. You’ve also got to protect a different US administration in two years, saying: ‘I don’t think that’s a good idea, I’m not going to pay you back.’”Despite Trump’s hopes, big oil will be wary of rushing back to Venezuela | Nils PratleyRead moreThe bill would be vast. Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policyestimatedthat adding between half a million and a million bpd to Venezuelan oil production would require more than $10bn in investment over two to three years.But an increase on the scale mooted by Trump and his allies is expected to need much more. The Center on Global Energy Policy said building back Venezuelan output to the same level as the early 2010s, near 2.5m bpd, was estimated to take between $80bn and $90bn over six or seven years.Exxon, Chevron and Conoco did not respond to a request for comment on whether they were consulted ahead of Saturday’s attack. While the president said on Sunday that his administration had spoken to them before and after the operation in Venezuela, unnamed executives have refuted this claim in media reports.Trump issued a hint to the industry roughly a month before Saturday’s operation, vaguely advising it to “get ready”, the Wall Street Journalreported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaOil and gas companiesDonald TrumpOilEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In mid-December, the National Information and Communications Technology Authority (Nicta) ordered the company to halt operations because it was not licensed in PNG.“Starlink is currently not licensed to operate in Papua New Guinea, and until the legal process is completed, services cannot be allowed,” Nicta’s acting chief executive,Lume Polume, said.‘We want Starlink’: from isolation to integration – what happened to the Korubo people after contact?Read moreNicta is now waiting on the ombudsman or the courts in PNG to issue a directive over whether it will be granted a licence. No timing has been provided on when a directive will be issued.Starlink did not respond to a request for comment. In an email to customers, it said it wanted to provideinternet in PNGonce approvals were granted.There are no official figures on how many people use Starlink in PNG but the shutdown is causing distress for internet users across the country.Telecommunications analysts have estimated that before the shutdown, Starlink terminals served thousands of people, including some entire villages or districts in remote areas in the country. The service was mostly used in rural areas where mobile networks are unreliable or do not exist. Other satellite services are available but are often much more expensive.Businessman and former Maprik MP John Simon said the shutdown ignored the struggles of ordinary people and small businesses in PNG.“This is really bad for this country. Internet and online services have been very expensive and slow for years, yet we cannot listen to the little people out on the street and sort this out,” he said.“The PNG government must do something for the struggling small [businesses]. Ordinary people and small [businesses] rely on the cheapest and fastest option, and right now that is Starlink. This issue must be sorted.”The country’s communication minister declined to comment.About 200 people have signed an online petition asking for Starlink to be allowed to operate legally.Health workers and teachers have also said losing Starlink has affected their work and access to services. Businesses have said their ability to reach customers and process payments has been disrupted, and some farmers and traders now have to travel long distances to towns to access banking and other services.Simon Jack, a teacher at a high school in a remote part of Southern Highlands province, said the shutdown was making life hard for students.“Students need internet to check their results and see where they have been selected to study [this year]. For many of them, Starlink was the only option that worked.”Health worker Theresa Juni, from East Sepik province, said Starlink helped her clinic communicate with doctors in town and send reports quickly.“Now we have to wait days or travel just to send information. For patients who need urgent care, these delays can be dangerous.”Starlink has faced licensing issues in the Pacific before. In 2024, Tonga’s government ordered the internet satellite company to cease operations until it was granted a licence.

The imbalance in power is comparable to that between the US, which possesses the world’s most powerful army, and Venezuela, a small, middle-income country of just 30m which, like Taiwan, relies on friendly countries for its defence.The maps that show how China’s military is squeezing TaiwanRead moreOn Monday, Emily Thornberry, the chair of the UK’s foreign affairs committee,warnedthat China and Russia may be emboldened by the lack of condemnation for the US’s actions. But events in the Americas are unlikely to change Beijing’s fundamental thinking with regards to Taiwan.Firstly, although China cares about international narratives with regards to Taiwan, and puts great pressure on other countries to recognise Beijing’s claims on the island, it does not see the matter as being one of international laws. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and therefore a domestic political matter. “Beijing has not refrained from kinetic or other actions on Taiwan out of deference to international law and norms. It has pursued a strategy of coercion without violence,” said Ryan Hass, a former US diplomat in Beijing and a senior fellow at Brookings.1:24Maduro taken off helicopter in New York on way to court – videoShen Dingli, a senior international relations scholar in Shanghai, laid out the official view: “Cross-strait relations are not international relations and are not governed by international law. The United States’ approach toVenezuelaholds no relevance for cross-strait relations.”On the Chinese social media site Weibo, one popular nationalist government affairs commentator wrote: “Stop linking the US actions in Venezuela to the Taiwan issue … Their actions constitute a grave violation of international law and an infringement on Venezuela’s sovereignty, whereas our situation is strictly an internal national affair. There is absolutely no ‘comparability’ in terms of nature, methods or objectives.”Secondly, the biggest deterrence for China in launching an attack on Taiwan is the military balance in the Taiwan Strait. Although China has a more powerful military, Taiwan has the promise of support from the US in the event of an attack. Last week, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted several days of intensemilitary drills around Taiwan, designed to showcase its ability to blockade the island and fend off international assistance.The US Department of Defense believes that the PLA is on track to reach its 2027 goal of being able to achieve a “strategic decisive victory” over Taiwan, particularly with its rapid advances in military artificial intelligence, biotechnology and hypersonic missiles.But rather than feel worried by the news in Venezuela, many in Taiwan argued that the successful US military operation may actually give Beijing pause for thought.Some pointed out that Venezuela’s China-sourced weapons failed to defend against the US attack. Between 2010 and 2020, nearly 90% of China’s arms sales to the Americas went to Venezuela,according toChinaPower, a research project hosted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.“Why was the US military able to move in as if no one were there?” said Lin Ying Yu, an associate professor at Tamkang University in Taipei. “Everyone seemed to think that Chinese-made weapons were very impressive after the clashes between Indian and Pakistani air forces,” Lin said,referring tothe success of Chinese-made jets used by Pakistan in a brief conflict with India last year. “But now, there seems to be a different interpretation.”Sung Wen-Ti, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub who is based in Taiwan, said: “The US military’s capacity for a decapitation strike, especially against Venezuela’s largely Chinese defence systems, ought to provide a deterrent that makes Beijing think about putting their [military] to the test against Washington.”The ‘Putinization’ of US foreign policy has arrived in VenezuelaRead moreStill, Donald Trump’s flagrant disregard for the international rules-based order, and the speed at which western leaders have toed Washington’s line, reveals the upending of global norms that is under way. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, hasdeclined to condemn Trump’s actions, despite the fact that experts have described the attack as illegal under international law. Many European leadershave also equivocated.View image in fullscreenThe US president, Donald Trump, watches the military operation in Venezuela unfold from his resort in Mar-a-Lago.Photograph: @realDonaldTrump/ReutersChina said on Monday that the US’s “blatant use of force against Venezuela seriously violates international law and basic norms in international relations”. China, along with Russia, backed an emergency UN security council meeting over the legality of the operation.Taiwan’s government declined to comment on the US’s actions, despite the fact that Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has repeatedly talked ofthe need to defend the international rules-based orderas a means of preventing a Chinese invasion.One popular Taiwanese blogger argued that in order to prevent itself from becoming “another Venezuela”, Taiwan should avoid causing trouble for the US, such as by becoming a source of drugs or refugees. In a Facebook post that received more than 30,000 likes, the popular YouTuber Chiu Wei-chieh, also known as “Froggy” Chiu, said that unlike in Venezuela, Taiwan’s leader has the popular support of the people. “Taiwan should not become Venezuela. That means clenching our five fingers tighter, uniting, and not becoming easy prey in their eyes,” he wrote.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaVenezuelaDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But sources have told Guardian Australia the legal dispute has been settled, with an announcement to be made in the coming weeks.Court records show the case was finalised and dismissed with the consent of the parties in November.The university did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about the settlement and whether Descheemaeker was still employed at MLS.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn a statement, a spokesperson for the university confirmed the federal circuit and family court had dismissed the proceedings brought by Descheemaeker.“The University cannot make any further comment at this time,” the spokesperson said.Law professor who claimed ‘Blak’ activists were leading University of Melbourne to ‘destruction’ sues for discriminationRead moreThe university tried to dismiss Descheemaeker after the email, sent in response to the announcement ofa cultural safety review at the university, was leaked. In the email, Descheemaeker said MLS was “celebrating the ‘noble savage’” and likened it to an “ideological re-education camp”.He wrote that there was “absolutely no end to where ‘Blak’ activists are meaning to take us – except destruction”.Descheemaeker alleged the University of Melbourne had taken adverse action against him by suspending his employment due to his “political opinion”, court documents show.In a court hearing last September, Descheemaeker’s legal team argued the university had attempted to expel himover his political expressionafter it unearthed allegedly racist emails, the court heard.Descheemaeker’s barrister, Dimitri Ternovski, said the professor’s comments in the emails were political opinions and were not racist. He said his client’s correspondence was protected by the university’s academic freedom of expression policy.Ternovski said the leaked August 2023 email used “colourful language” to push back against “identity politics” increasingly being injected into MLS’s curriculum and was meant only for the dean’s eyes.Only a small part of the university’s defence was heard in September as both sides agreed to an adjournment.Marc Felman KC, representing the university, said there was no prima facie case that Descheemaeker’s proposed dismissal was unlawful. He described the case as “hopeless”.The university commissioned the cultural safety review in 2023 – the same year Indigenous academic Dr Eddie Cubilloresigned from his role as an associate deanand senior fellow at MLS after public complaints over institutional racism at the faculty.Explore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesAustralian educationVictoriaIndigenous AustraliansRacenewsShareReuse this content"

All three were taken to the Day Street police station and released after the protest without charge, police said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe woman, who asked not to be named for fear of professional repercussions, said several police officers approached her at the protest and asked her to remove her jacket. About 300 people attended the protest despite aNew South Wales police prohibition on public demonstrations.When the woman asked why, she said police told her the jacket was “unlawful”.“I said to them, ‘Can you direct me to the specific bit of legislation that outlaws this statement?’” she said. “I knew that it was controversial, obviously, but I knew that wasn’t a reason for me to be arrested.”The woman said police told her they would point her to the legislation once she arrived at the police station, where she would be taken if she did not remove her jacket.When she refused, she was placed under arrest and spent about an hour at the police station before being released, she said. She said no legislation prohibiting the phrase was provided.NSW police did not respond to further questions about the woman’s arrest.There is no federal criminal offence in Australia that explicitly names “globalise the intifada” as an illegal slogan but the NSW government wants toexpand its hate speech lawsto ban certain phrases, including “globalise the intifada”, which the government views as inciting violence.What does ‘globalise the intifada’ mean, and why does NSW want to ban the chant?Read moreIntifada is an Arabic word that translates to uprising or “shaking off” and is the term used by Palestinians for uprisings against Israel.The first Palestinian intifada occurred between 1987 and 1993. It began in December 1987 after an Israeli truck struck two vehicles in Gaza, killing four Palestinians. The event sparked unrest and brutal reprisals from Israeli forces.While figures vary,estimates suggestat least 1,300 Palestinians and 100 Israelis were killed by the end of the intifada.A second,more violent, intifadabegan in 2000 and continued until 2005. More than 3,000 Palestinians and about 1,000 Israelis were killed,according to a database maintained by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem.For Palestinians and their supporters, the phrase can mean resistance against oppression but many Jewish groups and leaders see it as a call to violence against people of their faith.The director of the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation, David Slucki, said it was an “offensive” and “threatening” phrase.“Intention and impact are two separate questions, and I think it is worthwhile recognising the impact, especially when the impact is harmful and threatening,” he said.But the woman said she didn’t consider “globalise the intifada” offensive as it “simply means shaking off, or uprising”.“This has got nothing to do with Judaism – Judaism and Zionism are not the same thing,” she said.In response to the Bondi massacre, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, singled out the phrase “globalise the intifada” as “hateful, violent rhetoric” that he intended to ban. A NSW parliamentary inquiry into banning phrases including “globalise the intifada” isunder waybefore new hate speech laws are voted on this year.Addressing the media on 20 December, Minns said anyone thinking they could use the slogan “globalise the intifada” before the legislative reforms should “think again”.“We’ve got strong advice indicating that phrase … is already in breach of hate speech laws in NSW,” he said. “This legislation will put it beyond a shadow of a doubt … Police aren’t mucking around now.”Under the NSW Crimes Act, it is an offence to publicly threaten or incite violence against a person or group on the grounds of ethno-religious origin, however the conduct must incite or threaten violence, not merely offend.The woman said she did not go to the protest with any “specific agenda” other than to oppose “increasing silencing and breaches of civil rights and our rights to protest”.“I should never have been arrested,” she said. “I wasn’t breaching the peace. I was there as a peaceful protester.”Josh Lees, an organiser for the Australia-based Palestine Action Group, who was present at the protest, said the fact the woman had been released without charge showed her arrest was a “gross overreach”.“It’s a very disturbing portent of what may lie ahead if Minns’ threatened laws are passed, with peaceful, anti-genocide protesters being snatched off the streets,” he said.The president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Timothy Roberts, said more legislation was “not necessary, nor effective at stopping hate”.“We have a government that has restricted protest and freedom of speech in the face of cautions, like those from the NSW Law Reform Commission, which advise against changes to hate speech laws at the cost of infringing on our right to communicate with each other,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

Three sources said several names were in the mix for the No 1 spot on the ticket, including the former Dunkley candidate and Frankston mayor Nathan Conroy, former Mordialloc candidate Phillip Pease and Manju Hanumantharayappa, who was No 2 on theLiberal partyticket in 2022 and narrowly missed out on the final upper house spot.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailConroy is also being sounded out to run in Nepean afterthe shock resignation of the party’s deputy leader, Sam Groth, on Monday, one senior Liberal figure said.Hermans told Guardian Australia she had heard “rumours and complaints from party members” about a challenge but had not been contacted directly by any potential candidate.“If I am being challenged, then my opponent is already showing themself to be unprincipled and gutless,” Hermans said.She said the second spot on the ticket was “gettable” and should be contested.“I have worked hard, taken the challenge to Labor, tilled new ground in red heartlands, and I would consider it a major failing of the party if I am to be penalised and challenged for being conscientious and committed to fighting tirelessly to represent the Liberal party and help my local community,” Hermans said.Deeming supporters have said she will “not go down without a fight”.The MP declined to comment when contacted by Guardian Australia as party rules prohibit candidates from commenting publicly on preselections.“So far she hasn’t lost,” one supporter said, pointing to Deeming’ssuccessful defamation caseagainst the former opposition leader John Pesutto.The partyloaned Pesutto $1.5mto help pay the $2.3m in legal costs, which is nowsubject to a court challenge.Sam Groth to quit Victorian politics after defamation battle with News Corp and internal party divisionsRead moreGourisetty is listed on Pesutto’s parliamentary register of interests as a donor to his legal fund. He previously challenged Deeming at the 2022 preselection, having earlier run in the No 2 spot in 2018 and as the Liberal candidate for Tarneit in 2014.At the 2022 contest, he failed to secure the backing of the then state party president, Robert Clark, and his allies, in part due to breaches of the food safety act he pleaded guilty to in 2019.Since then, Gourisetty has built significant support across the western suburbs branches that make up the region, while the party’s executive committee hasskewed moderate under the new president, Philip Davis.Sources close to Gourisetty say he has the numbers in eight of the region’s 11 branches but Deeming’s supporters dispute this figure. They say she has strong grassroots support and endorsements from high-profile Liberal figures.Meanwhile, in eastern Victoria, two sources confirmed senior Liberals had approached journalist and author Sue Smethurst to run against Heath. She previously ran for the spot in 2021. Smethurst declined to comment to Guardian Australia.Heath’s supporters downplayed the prospect of a challenge, pointing to her strong support in local branches and in the party room, including her recent promotion to the shadow cabinet.Steve Brooks is expected to secure enough support to replace long-serving MP Wendy Lovell,who resigned on Monday, in Northern Victoria. The No 2 spot on the north-east metropolitan ticket will also be filled after MP Nick McGowan’s decision to contest the lower-house seat of Ringwood.Victorian Labor has delayed its upper house preselections as itawaits an outcome on group voting ticketsand hashes out itsstability deal between factions.Gourisetty, Conroy, Hanumantharayappa, Pease and Heath were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsVictoriaLiberal partyCoalitionnewsShareReuse this content"

Macron made it clear that the goal of the force would be “to provide reassurance after the ceasefire” and noted it would be stationed “a long way behind the contact line”. There was no further clarity given immediately on the size or scope of the potential force.Macron said the coalition had also drawn up a plan to take on “ceasefire monitoring commitments under American leadership” as well as “long-term support to Ukrainian armed forces who are and will remain in the frontline of defence”.Answering a question about whether the US would come to the aid of European forces if they were attacked in Ukraine, Witkoff said the security guarantees were “as strong as anyone has ever seen” and were meant to “deter any further attacks […] if there are any attacks they’re meant to defend. And they will do both.”He added: “The president does not back down from his commitments, he is strong for the country of Ukraine and for a peace deal. We will be there for the Ukrainians in helping them to get to that final peace,” said Witkoff.Witkoff and Kushner were in Paris representing the US after the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who had been due to attend the talks, pulled out after Trump’s Venezuela attack.The talks in Paris came as Trump’s attention shifts from Ukraine to Venezuela, and as his repeated threats to annex Greenland arecausing friction in the US-Europe relationship. Several questions at a joint press conference following the signing revolved around whether Europe could trust US security guarantees at a time when Trump was threatening another Nato member with military action.Separately, US and Ukrainian delegations have been trying to sign a bilateral peace agreement for weeks, which the White House would then take to Russia. Zelenskyy and others from the Ukrainian delegation were due to meet separately with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday evening.However, Zelenskyy said the issue of Ukraine giving up territory remained a sticking point in the talks. “We have a number of ideas that could be helpful,” he said, adding that if the negotiating teams could not come to an agreement, he was ready to discuss directly with Trump.Witkoff agreed that territory “will be the most critical issue” in discussions. “Hopefully we’ll be able to come up with certain compromises,” he said.AlthoughTrump has repeatedly claimed that peace is just around the corner, there has been little sign that Moscow is ready for a deal, and Russian officials have repeatedly ruled out a temporary ceasefire or quick deal, saying they want a comprehensive settlement that addresses what they claim are the “root causes” of the conflict.The Kremlin has also said it will categorically oppose any Nato soldiers being based on Ukrainian soil as part of any deal, and as Moscow appears to be content with continuing fighting for now, the prospect of a negotiated deal followed by a subsequent force deployment seems unlikely at least in the short term.Starmer ackowledged that reality in his comments on Tuesday. “We are closer to [peace] than ever but of course the hardest yards are still ahead,” he said. “We can only get to a peace deal if Putin is ready to make compromises. Putin is not showing he is ready for peace,” he added.The Paris meeting gathered an impressive roster of world leaders, with 27 heads of state or government coming to Paris for the talks. There were also a series of meetings on the sidelines of the summit, including of French, British, Ukrainian and Nato military chiefs.Italy’s Georgia Meloni and Poland’s Donald Tusk said after the talks that their nations would not contribute troops to any mission to Ukraine. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said German troops could contribute to a force, but would be based in neighbouring countries, not inside Ukraine.Over the weekend, Zelenskyy said he feared that “not everyone is ready” to commit forces to Ukraine, and conceded that intelligence sharing and weapons transfers were also crucial modes of support. However, he said British and French commitments to deploy forces would be essential for any security guarantees to have meaning.“Speaking frankly as president, even the very existence of the coalition depends on whether certain countries are ready to step up their presence,” he said. “If they are not ready at all, then it is not really a ‘coalition of the willing.’”Explore more on these topicsUkraineFranceForeign policyRussiaEmmanuel MacronKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

It would, she said, be the end of “everything”.That was followed by an intense diplomatic effort, which led to the joint European leaders’ statement in support of Copenhagen, released before the international summit in Paris discussing security guarantees for Ukraine.The European leaders emphasised that security in the Arctic had to be achieved collectively with Nato allies, rather than by the US seizing control of another Nato member’s territory.“Nato has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European allies are stepping up,” the statement said. “We and many other allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.”Denmark and Greenland asked to meet the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, urgently to “discuss the significant statement made by the United States about Greenland”, Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, wrote on social media.Lord Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, warned that if the US were to annex Greenland it would be disastrous for Nato, amounting to, “for all practical purposes, the end of an alliance which is based essentially on trust”.Security relationships such as the coalition of the willing in support of Ukraine, led by the UK and France and supported by Germany, would “take on a much greater significance alongside bilateral defence links with the US”.On Tuesday night, the White House said Trump and his team were discussing options for acquiring Greenland and thatusing the US military for this was “always an option”.“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region.“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” the White House said in a statement in response to queries from Reuters.Earlier, Miller had suggested that Denmark does not have a right to the Arctic territory, which is a former Danish colony. Copenhagen continues to control Greenland’s foreign and security policy.US attack on Greenland would mean end of Nato, says Danish PMRead moreAsked whether military action against Greenland was off the table, he incorrectly stated that its population was 30,000 when in fact it is 57,000, saying: “What do you mean, military action against Greenland? Greenland has a population of 30,000 people.“The real question is what right does Denmark have to assert control over Greenland? What is the basis of their territorial claim? What is their basis of having Greenland as a colony of Denmark?”Map centred on the north pole, with Greenland, the US, Russia and China highlightedThere was, he said, “no need to even think or talk about” a military operation in Greenland, adding: “Nobody is going to fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland. That doesn’t make any sense.”Miller’s interview was conducted after his wife, the rightwing podcaster Katie Miller, posted a map on X of Greenland draped in a US flag with the caption “SOON”.But late on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported US secretary of state Marco Rubio as downplaying the possibility of military action, saying Trump still intended to buy Greenland.3:55Denmark, Greenland push back on Trump remarks, say Greenland not for conquest - videoNaaja H Nathanielsen, the Greenlandic minister for business, mineral resources, energy, justice and gender equality, told the Guardian: “The people of Greenland take this potential threat very hard and are anxious and afraid.”Greenland long been a “good American ally”, Nathanielsen said, but this “does not transfer into an acceptance of – or interest in – becoming Americans”.She added: “We are very few, but we are a people in our own right and insist that we are the ones to decide the future of Greenland.”Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, also made a strong statement in which he urged Trump to give up his “fantasies about annexation” and accused the US of “completely and utterly unacceptable” rhetoric. “Enough is enough,” he said.View image in fullscreenJens-Frederik Nielsen, the prime minister of Greenland.Photograph: Oscar Scott Carl/ReutersInuit people are understood to have lived in Greenland since as early as 2500 BCE.

This is why an attack on Nato ally would end alliance. And what do Greenlanders think?Miranda BryantTue 6 Jan 2026 12.35 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 19.09 ESTShareSoon afterDonald Trump’s removal of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, last weekend, he quickly moved on to the subject of Greenland, renewing calls for a US takeover of the Arctic territory.The US president said on Sunday that he neededGreenland“very badly”, prompting a ramping up of tensions between the US, Greenland and Denmark.Greenland is part of the Danish kingdom.Denmarkformerly ruled it as a colony and today still controls its foreign and security policy.Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has said that an attack by the US on a Nato ally – in this case Greenland as part of Denmark – would meanthe end of the alliance. Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, has urged Trump to give up his “fantasies about annexation”. European leaders have also given Denmark and Greenland their backing, saying“Greenland belongs to its people”.But according to Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s top aides, the administration is determined to acquire Greenland and believes it will do so without the need for military intervention.Why is Donald Trump so fixated with Greenland?Greenland has long been on Trump’s agenda but the reasons behind it have changed over time.In 2019, during his first term, he confirmed reportsthat he had been urging aides to find out how the US could buy the vast Arctic island, describing a sale as “essentially a large real estate deal”. Last January when Trump, then president-elect, said he needed control of Greenland he said it was for“economic security”. But in recent days he has said he needs Greenland“from the standpoint of national security”– despite the risk this would pose to the future of Nato.Strategically positioned between the US and Russia, Greenland is viewed as increasingly important for defence and is emerging as a geopolitical battleground as the climate crisis worsens.As well as oil and gas, Greenland’s supply of multiple in-demand raw materials for green technology is attracting interest from around the world – including from China, which dominates global rare earth production and has threatened to restrict the export of critical minerals. By acquiring Greenland, the US could keep China out.The rapid melting of the island’s huge ice sheets and glaciers could open up oil drilling (although Greenland stopped granting exploration licences in 2021) and mining for essential minerals including copper, lithium, cobalt and nickel.Melting Arctic ice is also opening up new shipping routes, providing alternatives to the Suez canal through the Arctic that shorten the journey from western Europe to east Asia by almost half. China and Russia agreed in November to collaborate on developing new Arctic shipping routes.Greenland is already an important military base for the US and its ballistic missile early warning system. The US has had a military base at Pituffik (previously Thule) since the cold war.What has Denmark got to do with it?Inuit people are understood to have lived in Greenland since as early as 2,500BC and it was reached by Norse seafarers in the first millennium AD, who established settlements lasting several centuries. Modern colonisation began after the arrival of Hans Egede in 1721, acting with the support of what was then Denmark-Norway. During the second world war, when Denmark was occupied by Germany, Greenland was occupied by the US and was returned to Denmark in 1945.It became part of the kingdom of Denmark in 1953, and in 1979 home rule was introduced. But Denmark still controls Greenland’s foreign and security policy. It has its own parliament, Inatsisartut, and two MPs in the Danish parliament, Folketing. But calls for independence have been growing.Tensions have escalated significantly between Greenland and Denmark in recent years. There is intense anger in Greenland over investigations into theforced contraceptive (IUD) scandalof the 1960s and 70s, prompting the former Greenlandic prime minister to accuse Denmark of genocide. There have also been protests in Copenhagen and Nuuk over theseparation of Greenlandic childrenfrom their parents.SinceDonald Trump Jr’s high profile visit to Nuuk last January, escalating Denmark’s fears over US plans in relation to Greenland, Frederiksen’s government has made efforts to restore relations with Greenland.Denmark hasbannedthe use of highly controversial “parenting competency” tests on Greenlandic people that have resulted in Greenlandic mothers being separated from their children. In September, after years of failing to acknowledge the violations, Denmark officially apologised to the victims of the IUD scandal, in which thousands of Greenlandic women and girls were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils without their knowledge or consent. And in December, victimswon a legal fightwith the Danish government to receive compensation.In recent years there has been growing support for Greenlandic independence. But amid the spectre of Trump’s threat, Greenland in March formed a new four-party coalition government in a show of national unity, with the first page of the coalition agreement stating: “Greenland belongs to us.” The pro-independence party, Naleraq, which is the most US- and Trump-friendly party, came second in the election and is now in opposition.According to a 2009 agreement with Denmark, Greenland must hold a successful referendum before declaring independence.What do Greenland and Denmark make of Trump’s advances?Frederiksen has said that any US attack on a Nato ally would be the end of “everything”.“If the United States decides to militarily attack another Nato country, then everything would stop – that includes Nato and therefore post-second world war security,” Frederiksen told Danish television network TV2.Nielsen has said that “threats, pressure and talk of annexation have no place between friends” and that “enough is enough”.In his new year’s speech, King Frederik praised the “strength and pride” of Greenlanders during what he referred to as a “turbulent time”. The previous year he unveiled a new Danish royal coat of arms that more prominently featured the autonomous territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands, in what was seen by some as a rebuke to Trump.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropeUS foreign policyDonald Trump JrnewsShareReuse this content"

You cannot simply take a collection of artworks and transplant it into another ecosystem, because such an ecosystem does not exist.”The Antwerp museum’s collection also includes works by international artists such as Kerry James Marshall, Anish Kapoor and Marina Abramović.British artist Kapoor has protested against plans to move his works to Ghent, telling the culture ministry in an email seen by the Guardian: “I cannot accept that they might be removed from M HKA or otherwise put at risk as part of any institutional reorganisation.”Belgium faces a budget deficit of 5.4% of GDP, one of the largest in the eurozone. The arts sector in particular is facing dramatic cuts, with austerity measures also suggesting an uncertain future for Brussels’ new Kanal museum, originally designated to become one of the largest new arts complexes inEuropewhen it is scheduled to open at the end of this year.‘Is this doable?’: why political paralysis threatens an ambitious Brussels arts complexRead moreUnder the proposals of Flanders’ socialist culture minister, Caroline Gennez, the museum sector would be streamlined so that art collections in the region are concentrated at three beacon museums for historical, modern and contemporary art.Flanders has a plethora of contemporary art museums: in addition to M HKA in Antwerp and Smak in Ghent, there is Musea Brugge in Bruges and Museum M in Leuven.View image in fullscreenAnish Kapoor said that he could not accept his works at M HKA being ‘put at risk as part of any institutional reorganisation’Photograph: Action Press/REX/ShutterstockWhether the proposed shake-up would actually lower costs has been questioned by Belgium’s financial inspectorate, however. In a memorandum sent to Gennez in October, it gave an unfavourable opinion on the proposals, suggesting their impact on the budget would be “fragmentary”.While transplanting the museum’s permanent collection could reduce operating costs from around €8m to €5m, it is understood that in future the Antwerp institution would have to spend money to borrow works or buy in exhibitions to attract visitors.Ghent’s Smak, located about an hour’s train ride from the Antwerp museum, is also thought to currently not have enough space to adequately store M HKA’s collection, and would need investment to expand its storage capacity.Explore more on these topicsBelgiumArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Even if it wants to do this, it will be forced to put heavy pressure on the lower deciles of society by printing money. The country’s income is certain and our resources aren’t unlimited,” Pezeshkian said in a speech on Tuesday.The dwindling purchasing power that first triggered the protests has continued to decline, with the Iranian rial dropping to a historic low of 1.46m to the US dollar. The currency has lost about two-thirds of its value in the past three years and its nosedive has accelerated in recent months.Iran’s central bank has meanwhile said as the currency falls that it would curb a programme to businesses that gives a preferential exchange rate on dollars – a move that is likely to lead to further price increases and shortages for consumers.An end to subsidised exchange could further exacerbate shortages in Iranian grocery stores. Iran’s state news agency said the average price of a bottle of cooking oil had recently doubled in price, while other goods are simply unavailable as traders hoard products in anticipation of further inflation.View image in fullscreenA shopkeeper in his store in northern Tehran. The average price of a bottle of cooking oil recently doubled in price.Photograph: Vahid Salemi/APPezeshian said the government may have to tighten its belt, blaming worsening economic conditions on sanctions, saying “oil is under embargo and sources of income are limited”.The president said the government would open an investigation into allegations of security forces’ violence against protesters in Illam province. He also mentioned “an incident in a hospital in the city of Illam”, referencing the footage of officers raiding a hospital there.The videos were directly referenced by the US state department, which said that “beating medical staff and attacking the wounded with teargas and ammunition is a clear crime against humanity”, in a post on X from its Farsi-language account.The Iranian government has been toeing a careful line between an all-out crackdown on protesters and appearing lax, offering dialogue while security forces carried out arrests and at times appeared to use violence against demonstrators.The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday that the demands of protesters were legitimate, but that rioters among the demonstrators should be “put in their place”. The state-aligned Fars news agency said 250 police officers and 45 members of the volunteer paramilitary Basij force were injured in the demonstrations.Donald Trump hasthreatened to intervenein Iran if the government kills protesters, a comment that drew angry warnings from top Iranian officials. The US threat carried extra weight after the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was captured and brought to New York by US forces on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The construction work would seal a land grab the British government hasdescribed as“a flagrant breach of international law”.Building settlements in this area is a decades-old idea with cross-party backing inIsrael, mooted initially in the 1990s by Yitzhak Rabin, the Labor prime minister and Nobel peace laureate who was assassinated in 1995 by a rightwing nationalist.For years, construction was blocked by the US and the country’s European allies, for the same reason that the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, and key ministers have embraced the plan.Map of Israeli settlements and outposts in the West BankBoth critics and supporters agree that moving tens of thousands of Israeli settlers into a triangle of occupied land between Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah would be critically damaging to efforts to reach a two-state solution.“Construction in E1 is intended to create irreversible facts on the ground leading to a one-state reality, which all indications suggest would take the form of an apartheid regime,” said Mizrachi.Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who is himself a settler, said last year that Donald Trump had abandoned longstanding US opposition to the E1 plan.The state department did not comment on Trump’s position, but in August Israeli authorities gave formal planning approval to the project and Smotrich said it would “bury” the idea of a sovereignPalestine.“Those in the world trying to recognise a Palestinian state will get an answer from us on the ground,” he said at the time. “Not through documents, not through decisions or declarations, but through facts. Facts of homes, neighbourhoods, roads and Jewish families building their lives.”More than 20 countries including Israeli allies France, Canada, Italy and Australia condemned the decision as an unacceptable violation of international law that risked fuelling further violence.Undeterred, Israel pressed ahead with construction planning. In September, the ministry of housing signed an agreement to fund infrastructure construction for E1 and the expansion of neighbouring Ma’ale Adumim, at a ceremony presided over by Netanyahu.“We said there will be no Palestinian state, and indeed there will be no Palestinian state! This place is ours,” Netanyahu said.Sitting beside him was Smotrich, who has been put under sanctions by countries including the UK, Canada and Australia for “repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities”, and the leader of the settler organisation Amana, also sanctioned by the UK for supporting and sponsoring violence against Palestinians.Netanyahu’s enthusiasm has been reflected in the rapid progress towards breaking ground. It would usually take six months to a year to prepare tenders after planning approval for a settlement, rather than just four months for the vast E1 construction, said Hagit Ofran, a settlement expert at Peace Now.If there is similar speed in other stages of approval and securing contracts, builders could be bringing in bulldozers before national elections due to be held by October.“I am afraid we will see construction in coming months,” said Ofran. “They are doing whatever they can now to create as much irreversible [change] as possible throughout the West Bank, as fast as possible.”Winning bids can be selected within days of the tender closing. The next stage is agreeing details of a contract, which usually takes weeks. When the contract is signed, the final step before construction can start is securing building permits from the municipality, which can take months.The infrastructure deal is with the municipality of neighbouring Ma’ale Adumim, as E1 is formally classified as an extension of that settlement towards Jerusalem, rather than a new project.It is only one in a series of settlement expansions pursued by a government with an aggressive construction agenda in occupied Palestine.In December, Israel approved a proposal for19 new settlementsin the occupied West Bank, including two that were previously evacuated under a 2005 plan to withdraw Israeli settlers from Gaza and parts of the West Bank.In 2022, there were 141 settlements across the West Bank. After recently approved settlements are built there will be 210, according to Peace Now.The Israeli military has already been deployed to areas where settlements were evacuated, to set up bases ahead of the arrival of the new settlers.There has also been a surge in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli soldiers and settlers during Israel’s war in Gaza, which a UN commission and Israeli and international rights groups consider genocidal.Since October 2023, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, at least one in five of them children, and tens of thousands have been forcefully displaced from their homes.There is little political opposition to attempts to expand Israeli control of the West Bank from any mainstream Israeli political party, and Israeli soldiers and settlers target Palestinians in a climate of widespreadimpunity.The UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) in 2024ruledthat Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories violated international law. The sweeping advisory opinion ordered Israel to end the occupation “as rapidly as possible” and make full reparations for its “internationally wrongful acts”.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It said 29 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed.The semiofficial Fars news agency reported late Monday that some 250 police officers and 45 members of the Guard’s all-volunteer Basij force have been hurt in the demonstrations.A switch in the system of foreign exchange subsidies announced by Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, may lead to a short-term rise in food prices, but is intended to be ameliorated by a new system of direct subsidies to consumers. Previously the subsidies were given to those importing products from abroad through exchange rate subsidies. But the decade-old system was wide open for corruption and leakage.Official figures released on Monday showed that inflation had reached 52.6% in December. Inflation, and a collapse in the value of the rial, led to the protests that began in Tehran’s bazaar, but have now spread to more than 100 towns and cities, including many smaller towns. Police were seen entering the University of Birjand in the south-east of Iran, arresting students inside one of the largest universities in the east of Iran.The promise of economic reforms were made as the head of Iran’s judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said the period of “concessions and appeasement” to the protesters were over. Ejei accused the United States and Israel of openly and officially supporting the “chaos” in Iran and said that because of this support, “the rioters should know that if concessions were made in previous periods, there will be no more such concessions and appeasements”.Donald Trump again vowed the US would come to the defence of the protesters if they were attacked, vowing that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters” the US “will come to their rescue”. The Iranian foreign ministry accused Trump of “psychological warfare” on the Iranian people.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tehran on 29 December.Photograph: undefined/APBut leaders of the Reform Front – the movement with which Pezeshkian is associated – demanded action against those in the security services accused of chasing and firing on protesters inside the Imam Khomeini hospital in Malekshahi, Ilam province.Azar Mansouri, writing on the X social network, described the incident as “a disaster”. She urged: “As soon as possible and with justice, address the tragedy that occurred in Malekshahi, Ilam. Identify the perpetrators, introduce them to the public, and bring them to justice so that this wound can heal a little.”According to reports on social media, security forces had opened fire on protesters.On Monday António Guterres, the secretary general of the UN, called on Iran to respect demonstrators’ right to “protest peacefully”.Guterres “underscores the need to prevent any further casualties”, his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said. “He also calls on the authorities to uphold the right of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly” and that “all individuals must be allowed to protest peacefully and express their grievances”.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed the protests had expanded dramatically, adding: “We may well be at a defining moment, a moment when the Iranian people take their destiny in their own hands.” Many such predictions have been made in the past, only for the theocracy to survive.Iran’s future may turn on whether within the confines of continued US economic sanctions, policymakers can find enough room for manoeuvre to tackle corruption, stabilise the currency, reduce inflation and remove the levels of state intervention holding back industrial production. The frequent industrial shut downs caused by electricity and water shortages is also hampering production.In remarks on 1 January, Pezeshkian said he was abolishing the system of preferential foreign exchange rates, a complex system of distorting subsidies that he said fuelled corruption and failed to help the poor. Pezeshkian explained: “We are not removing subsidies, we are delivering them to the final consumers.”Fatemeh Mohajerani, his spokesperson, said on Monday: “It is evident that by ending or reducing subsidised and preferential official foreign currency exchange rates, the prices of some items will rise.”Revisions to the budget being examined by the parliament include pay rises of up to 43% instead of 20%, a cut in value-added tax to 10% from 12%, and the allocation of $8.8bn in subsidised foreign exchange to curb price rises for basic goods.The budget will earmark funds for guaranteed wheat purchases to supply bread and for adjusting pensioners’ salaries.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Naran’s father was driving Dev to visit his older brother, Neel, who was being treated in hospital.Returning on the M6, the car halted on what would been a hard shoulder, had it not been converted for use as part ofa smart motorway; a lorry ploughed into them, killing Dev. His grandfather died a few years later, suffering from serious injuries sustained in the crash. Neel did not speak or walk for some time after receiving the news, and died in 2024.Having first campaigned for changes to smart motorways, Naran pushed for action to make all vehicles safer, using technology such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB), where alerts sound and then the brakes are applied automatically if the driver does not slow in time to avert a crash.She said: “Had the lorry involved had autonomous braking, that collision could potentially have been avoided completely and Dev could have walked out and come home to me that night.“So Dev’s Law and AEB really has come from that – my whole campaign has been looking at every element, every factor that’s been involved in Dev’s death. That was a major factor involved and I truly think it’s a life-saving-based technology.”Different types of driver-assistance technology, including AEB, lane-keeping and other alerts, are features of most new cars but are not mandatory in Britain,Naran, 42, a senior lecturer in clinical pharmacy at Leicester’s De Montfort University, has brought her professional skills to the campaign and stressed the importance of consultation and “separating the emotion from the evidence”.View image in fullscreenMeera said Dev (left) had been ‘best friend and cheerleader’ to his older brother, Neel.Photograph: Meera NaranLocal transport minister Lilian Greenwood said the strategy was “built on evidence, but it is driven by the voices of those who have experienced the devastating consequences of road collisions first-hand”.She paid tribute to Naran for working “tirelessly in memory of her son Dev to champion life-saving technologies”.Naran said Dev had been “best friend and cheerleader” to his older brother Neel, who had complex health needs including epilepsy. “When he found Dev was gone, he slowly gave up.”She said her focus had become “waking up every day and using that grief to make something far more important than us and see that change happen”.She added: “For this government to look at this and not only give their word that they’re going to make that change but to actually see that they have included it in the strategy is really important.“Campaigning through both their losses has been unbelievably difficult but it was bigger than my grief, it was bigger than me, it was bigger than their story.“For me it’s going to be a lifelong campaign to reduce road deaths. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.”Explore more on these topicsTransport policyTransportMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

This was all forming part of the heat of the situation, so based on that, the commanders tried to make the right decision.”The fixture was classified high risk by WMP, with the force pointing to alleged violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the 2024 Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam.However, Dutch police have disputed the accuracy of this information.Guildford denied he or the police force were politically motivated to find evidence to justify the ban.“From everything that I’ve read, and the commanders that I spoke to, I do not believe that there was political influence on that decision.“Lots of local politicians and local members of the community I’m sure wanted to try and influence it, but I honestly don’t think it was influenced,” he told the committee.Guildford defended claims by committee chair Karen Bradley that it felt like the force was “scraping” to find a reason to justify the ban.“I’m really sorry if it comes across in that way. That was absolutely not the case,” he said.Appearing before MPs, the Birmingham council leader John Cotton refused to comment on whether he had confidence in Guildford. He said: “I do have concerns about the quality of the material provided to the SAG.”In the second evidence hearing, Bradley concluded by telling Guildford her colleagues would be producing a report. Committee sources expect it will be critical.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said West Midlands police had “presented an inversion of reality and misled a parliamentary committee”.She wrote on X: “We have had enough of this in Britain. The chief constable’s position is untenable. The British police serve the British public, not local sectarian interests.”The home affairs committee’s report is one of several into the incident, with some suggesting the ban was caving in to antisemitism.His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary has been ordered by the home secretary to investigate the intelligence presented by WMP.Keir Starmer denounced the ban, which came shortly after the terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue in which two worshippers died, as have opposition parties.Maccabi Tel Aviv declined their allocation of tickets.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMaccabi Tel AvivWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Starmer said a relentless focus on the cost of living would meanLabourcould win the next election, though the prime minister’s new year plan has already been derailed by the need to respond to Donald Trump’s raid on Venezuela and threats towards Greenland.Starmer, who spent the final months of last year dogged by leadership speculation, said he had strong faith in his cabinet and he would “relish” the fight against Reform.The latest YouGov poll put the Conservatives ahead of Labour for the first time since the general election, both of them behind Reform, with Labour on just 17%.Ministers saw a presentation that urged them not to panic about Labour’s dismal poll ratings, likening them to the plummeting popularity of previous governments after taking office.But the presentation did not include direct comparisons of previous governments with the current government, according to sources. Starmer’s ratings are unprecedentedly low for a new administration, partly because of the effect of a new party dominating the polls.Starmer said No 10 strategists were looking closely at the re-elections of centre-left governments in Norway, Canada and Australia and how they revived their fortunes by focusing on the cost of living, though Trump’s election was a key factor in the latter two.The prime minister’s visit to Reading on Monday, which was aimed at highlighting frozen bus and rail fares, was dominated by questions over the future of Greenland and the abduction of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, who has been indicted in New York since his capture by US troops.Starmer – who travelled to Paris on Tuesday to attend a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” on Ukraine – told his cabinet that the government had to keep a tight domestic focus.“A Labour government renewing the country or a Reform movement that feeds on grievance, decline and division,” he said. “They want a weaker state, they want to inject bile into our communities, they want to appease Putin. This is the fight of our political lives and one that we must relish.“I do not underestimate the scale of the task. But I have no doubt about this team. Governments do not lose because polls go down. They lose when they lose belief or nerve. We will do neither.”Starmer will try to bring focus back to the government’s actions on the cost of living with another UK visit on Thursday after legislation is introduced to end the two-child benefit cap, a key ask of Labour MPs and a measure that will bring almost half a million children out of poverty.The new Labour deputy leader,Lucy Powell, attended cabinet, saying she was looking forward to “helping to tell the story of whose side we are on”.Powell told MPs on Monday night that the party would switch to an“incumbency first”model to protect MPs at the next election rather than targeting seats and would support MPs to become “leaders in their communities” and learn how to benefit politically from changes made by the government, for which MPs have so far gained little credit.She also told MPs in the first parliamentary Labour party meeting of the year that they needed to stop infighting amid continued discontent with Starmer’s leadership.MPs will be offered workshops by organisers in Labour HQ on how to take credit for improvements in the local area or for policies directly helping constituents that have been implemented by the Labour government, including frozen rail fares, local community and high street funding and the warm home discount extension.“It’s a big switch organisationally and politically,” a Labour source said. “There’s tools and training the party is providing but Lucy and Anna Turley [the Labour party chair] are leading some political work about what else is needed and how MPs can support and share best practice.”Powell told the PLP meeting that the government needed to speak more directly about its achievements and said “dark forces” did not want a Labour administration to succeed.“We’ve got a big argument to make and win. That Labour is on the side of ordinary people addressing the cost of living crisis, rewiring the country in the interests of the many not the few, taking on the vested interests, holding the powerful to account,” she said.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerMorgan McSweeneyLucy PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

The local authority warned there was a “good chance” some rural communities would be cut off and there could be power cuts.View image in fullscreenA snowplough clears a road in Alford, Aberdeenshire.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesThe Met Office has extended a yellow warning for ice across most of England,Walesand southern Scotland until 10am on Wednesday, with a similar yellow warning for Northern Ireland until 11am.A yellow warning means some disruption is possible, such as travel delays, but many people can continue with their daily routine, according to the Met Office.There is a yellow warning for snow and ice in place until midnight on Wednesday for the rest of northern Scotland, where up to 20cm of fresh snow is expected in some areas, with strong winds causing drifting.Cold snap grips UK and Europe – in picturesRead moreStorm Goretti is expected to bring disruption in south-west England, with a yellow warning for strong winds in place for Cornwall, Devon and the Isles of Scilly from 3pm on Thursday until just before midnight.View image in fullscreenA snow-covered golf course and residential properties on the outskirts of Glossop, Derbyshire.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Met Office has issued snow warnings for large parts of England and Wales from 6pm on Thursday until midday on Friday when a deep area of low pressure will move across the south of the UK bringing rain, snow and strong winds.The severe wintry weather will be brought by the strong winds over northern France, named Storm Goretti by the country’s official forecaster, Météo France.On Tuesday, seven midweek football matches were cancelled in Scotland because of the freezing conditions.Police Scotland said the impact of the snow was likely to be felt over the next few days in the north and north-east of Scotland, and urged people to follow travel advice.Aberdeenshire council said it anticipated a “prolonged period of significant impacts” with many remote villages already cut off. The council has brought in additional equipment, including snow blowers, to clear routes, while 4,000 tonnes of salt reserves to help grit roads are arriving by boat.Hundreds of thousands of households around the country are receiving a £25 cold weather payment to help heating costs during the drop in temperature. Those living in Cumbria and Northumberland could receive a £50 payout. Those who are deemed vulnerable, including pensioners, are eligible to receive the payments when the temperature drops below freezing.The UK Health Security Agency has further extended an amber cold health alert for all regions of England until Sunday.View image in fullscreenPeople walking in Little Venice near Paddington, London.Photograph: James Manning/PAHarriet Cross, the Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan in the north-east of Scotland, praised more than 100 “heroic” farmers and contractors for rescuing drivers, clearing roads and helping to transport supplies in blizzard conditions.Cross, whose constituency is one of the worst affected by the treacherous weather, said: “Our heroic farmers have gone above and beyond to help stranded travellers to navigate through the treacherous conditions.”“Not only have they been out rescuing drivers and clearing roads, but our farmers have also been working round the clock caring for their own livestock as they battle against some of the worst snowfall in recent memory.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandEnglandWalesSnowWinternewsShareReuse this content"

A 19-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Both have been bailed pending further inquiries.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.Leavitt’s comments came as the leaders of major European powerspushed backagainst Trump’s long-running desire to seize the Arctic territory.In a show of solidarity on Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and other nations issued a joint statement with the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, urging the US to respect its sovereignty. They wrote in the statement that Arctic security was a top priority for Nato, a defense alliance that includes the United States and Greenland.“Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”Frederiksen previously warned that an attack by the US on a Nato ally would mean the“end” of the military allianceand “post-second world war security”. It would, she said, be the end of “everything”.Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, also urged Trump to give up his “fantasies about annexation” and accused the US of “completely and utterly unacceptable” rhetoric.“Enough is enough,” he said.Trump has renewed calls for a US takeover of Greenland after the dark-of-night arrest of Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, on Saturday. The next day, Trump said that he needed Greenland “very badly”, prompting a ramping-up of tensions among the US, the semi-autonomous Danish territory and Europe.Greenland has repeatedly stated that it does not want to be part of the US. The idea is also unpopular in the US,where one poll foundjust 7% of Americans agree with a military seizure of Greenland.In an earlier interview with CNN, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller suggested Denmark does not have a right to the Arctic territory, which is a former Danish colony and remains part of its kingdom. While the mineral-rich island, home to 56,000 people, has control over most internal affairs, Copenhagen continues to oversee its foreign and security policy.Miller also claimed military intervention would not be needed to take over the island because “nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland”.TheCNN interviewwas conducted after Miller’s wife, the rightwing podcaster Katie Miller,posted a photoof the US flag draped across a map of Greenland, captioned “SOON”.In a private briefing on Capitol Hill, the US secretary of state Marco Rubio told lawmakers on Monday that the administration would prefer to buy the island from Denmark rather than invade it,according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Strategically situated between the US and Russia, Greenland is viewed as an increasingly important defense hub and an emerging geopolitical battleground as the climate crisis and growing militarization raise tensions in the region. Trump has said Greenland is critical to the US’s national security, though the US already operates a base there.For years, European leaders mostly downplayed – or sometimes made light of – Trump’s interest in seizing Greenland. But Maduro’s swift capture by elite US forces has changed the tenor.Greenland’s government said it had asked the US state department for an “urgent” meeting with Rubio, Greenland’s minister for foreign affairs and research Vivian Motzfeldt, and the Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, to discuss “the US’s claims about our country”.Rasmussen told theDanish public broadcaster DRthat a meeting would give the Danes and Greenlanders a chance to correct some of Trump’s claims, including that there are a lot of Russian and Chinese ships around Greenland, and that China exerts great influence there through investments.“We do not share this image that Greenland is plastered with Chinese investments … nor that there are Chinese warships up and down along Greenland,” he said, according to the broadcaster. Rasmussen spoke to reporters afteran emergency sessionof Denmark’s foreign policy committee and defense ministry with just one item on the agenda: “The Kingdom’s relations with the United States.”Denmark’s defense minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said after the meeting that Denmark had spent billions to increase security in Greenland, not, as Trump had claimed this week, by adding just “one more dog sled”.At a press conference in Paris on Tuesday, Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, who touted new commitments from the Trump administration to defend Ukraine, was asked pointedly: “What value do these commitments have on the very day that at the highest levels of government in Washington they are talking about seizing the sovereign territory of a fellow Nato member?”Starmer said he stood by the statement he made on Monday, when he said that “Greenland and the Kingdom ofDenmarkmust determine the future of Greenland and nobody else”.Meanwhile, in Washington, top congressional Republicans sought to downplay the likelihood of military action in Greenland, with the Senate majority leader, John Thune,tellingPolitico: “That to me is not something anybody is contemplating seriously.”Congressman Ryan Zinke, a Republican from Montana who served as secretary of the interior during the first Trump administration, said he was not surprised that Trump would decline to rule out the use of military force to seize Greenland.“The president rarely rules out any option,” hetoldNewsNation on Tuesday, adding: “But Greenland is different. Greenland is obviously a Nato partner.”But Democrats warned that Trump’s threats should be taken seriously. The US senator Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona, has introduced legislation that would “prohibit the use of funds for military force or other hostilities against Greenland”. In a post on X, he accused Trump of wanting Greenland simply to possess a “giant island with his name on it”.“He wouldn’t think twice about putting our troops in danger if it makes him feel big and strong,” Gallego wrote. “The US military is not a toy.”Robert Mackey contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsGreenlandUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We will not let that happen,” the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said at an unofficial hearing his party convened to examine the effects of the attack.The anniversary was the first since Trump returned to office nearly a year ago and immediately pardoned almost everyone convicted or charged over the violence, the crowning achievement of a campaign that Republicans began almost immediately in the attack’s aftermath to blunt public outrage.Noting that some of the roughly 1,500 people whom the president pardoned were convicted of other serious offenses before and after January 6, Jeffries said: “It’s been a Trump-inspired crime spree. Why won’t Republicans in Congress condemn this dangerous behavior and ongoing threat to public safety?”Though the attack sent lawmakers from both parties fleeing when rioters breached the Capitol during the joint session of Congress that certified Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, few Republicans noted the anniversary. Those who did downplayed its severity, or sought to steer blame towards theDemocrats.“On this day in history in 2021, thousands of peaceful grandmothers and others gathered inWashington DCto take a self-guided, albeit unauthorized, tour of the US Capitol building,” Republican congressman Mike Collins wrote on X.He went on to inaccurately claim that the president’s “supporters walked to the Capitol to exercise their First Amendment right about the irregularities of the 2020 election. During this time, some individuals entered the Capitol, took photos, and explored the building before leaving.”Trump made no public comments about the anniversary, and his top officials sought to push his administration’s message that the president deserves no blame for the violence. “Never forget the lies Democrats and the media tried to force upon the American people,” the White House communications director, Steven Cheung, wrote on X.He unveiled a website that offered a distorted timeline of the day’s events. Cheung later described the website as a “trap” that news outlets fell for.View image in fullscreenPardoned January 6 rioters and their supporters gather in front of the White House.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/EPAThe insurrection has been linked to nine deaths as well as dozens of injuries, and it was extensively documented in videos shot by journalists, police and the rioters themselves. A bipartisan congressional committee that investigated the attack determined that Trump should face charges for his involvement,sayinglawmakers “developed significant evidence that President Trump intended to disrupt the peaceful transition of power under our constitution”.In his testimony on Tuesday before the Democratic-convened hearing, former US Capitol police officer Winston Pingeon described being attacked by rioters who said: “President Trump sent us.”“Pardoning criminals who severely beat me and my fellow officers that day is completely unacceptable. We cannot accept violent felons being pardoned and released back into our neighborhoods without consequence. That is not justice,” Pingeon said.Pam Hemphill, a rioter who refused her pardon, said she had appeared at the hearing to “make amends”.“Accepting that pardon would be lying about what happened on January the sixth. I am guilty, and I own that guilt,” she said, adding that she had “fallen for the president’s lies, just like many of his supporters”.The occasion reinvigorated controversy over a plaque that Congress has required by law be installed at the Capitol in honor of the officers who responded to the attack, but which the Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has yet to install.“They have a legal requirement to put it up, and I call on Speaker Johnson to put it up today. It’s gathering dust in a closet somewhere,” said Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin.In a speech on the Senate floor, Thom Tillis, a Republican senator who is not seeking re-election after clashing with Trump, simultaneously criticized Democrats for creating “an attitude around here that law enforcement is bad” with their support of the racial justice protests that broke out in 2020 following George Floyd’s death.But he also criticized Trump’s pardons, saying: “We let bad people go, and we sent the message that if you come to this Capitol and you’ve got the right president in office, he’s going to let you get past things … that not any one of us would get away with if we did it back in our home state.”In the afternoon, several dozen protesters, some of whom wore shirts and hats indicating they had received pardons, marched from the White House Ellipse, where Trump delivered his speech five years ago, to the Capitol. They were halted short of its grounds by a line of police officers, but a smaller group was later allowed to go to its west front to place flowers in honor of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was fatally shot by a Capitol police officer as she attempted to breach a barricaded door during the insurrection.Last year, the Trump administration agreed to a nearly $5m payout to her family, and to give Babbitt, an air force and air national guard vet,military honors.Democratic congressman Tom Suozzi briefly confronted the protesters, who hurled insults at him as he asked: “How do you feel about tasing a police officer? How do you feel about committing crimes?”“Oh, we didn’t commit no crimes,” a protester yelled back.In an interview, Enrique Tarrio, the former national leader of the far-right Proud Boys group who was convicted of charges related to the attack on the Capitol and then pardoned by Trump, said he expected such marches would take place every January 6.“I think now people get to see both sides of the coin, and they get to make an informed decision based on that,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS Capitol attackDemocratsRepublicansDonald TrumpUS elections 2020US crimeWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts aren’t so sureIndustry insiders say US oil firms want to ‘avoid getting screwed’ and will proceed with extreme caution in regionAnalysis: Trump’s focus on Venezuelan oil reinforces claim action was never about ‘war on drugs’Callum Jonesin New YorkTue 6 Jan 2026 13.19 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 15.53 ESTShareIndustry experts have expressed skepticism overDonald Trump’s bullish prediction that US big oil firms will rapidly invest tens of billions of dollars to fix Venezuelan infrastructure and ramp up production after the rendition of the country’s president,Nicolás Maduro.Without an “iron-clad guarantee” that the US federal government will fully reimburse them for the cost of rebuilding the country’s oil market, analysts expect global energy giants to proceed with extreme caution.The US president has nevertheless insisted theoil industrywill move quickly, boldly predicting that dominant US players could get an expanded oil operation “up and running” acrossVenezuela– reputedly home to the world’s largest crude oil reserves – in less than 18 months.“I think we can do it in less time than that,” Trump claimed in aninterviewwith NBC News on Monday. “But it’ll be a lot of money.”In the face of such sweeping declarations, US oil firms such as ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – the only US oil major still operating in Venezuela – have so fardeclined to publicly outline any such plans for investment.Dense, sticky and heavy: why Venezuelan crude oil appeals to US refineriesRead more“It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,” a Conoco spokesperson said this weekend. Hours earlier, Trump had stated at a press conference that “our very large United States oil companies” were poised to “go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure and start making money for the country”.The ambitious timeline laid out by Trump could prove unrealistic. “It’s probably going to take three years for any kind of production bounce,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, who expects an increase of around half a million barrels per day (bpd) by “2029, maybe late 2028”.Energy firms will probably spend the first year sorting through new government and security contracts, he suggested, the second year investing in reconstruction, and only find themselves in a position to meaningfully increase output in the third.“Either the US is going to step up with guarantees, or we’re going to spend six to 12 months watching the dust settle,” added Pickering, who noted that multinationals’ interest in Venezuelan oil does not necessarily correspond with their appetite to invest heavily in a country with an uncertain future.“I think their interest is an eight, on a scale of one to 10,” he said. “I think their appetite is a four or five on a scale of one to 10, because there is no clarity yet.”Seasoned operators in the region believe the firms will tread carefully. “I expect that you’ll see all of them now say, ‘This is fantastic, it’s a great opportunity, and we have a team ready to go to Venezuela,’” Elliott Abrams, who served as Trump’s special envoy to Venezuela during his first term,told Politico. “But that’s politics … That doesn’t mean they’re going to invest.”Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect ofoil giants being reimbursed by the federal government for any investments they make in Venezuela.But the administration has yet to come forward with any detail on whether the US taxpayer will back them.Only an “iron-clad guarantee” from the government that they will be repaid for “every dollar spent” will prompt oil companies to move more quickly, according to Pickering.They want to “avoid getting screwed”, he said. “You need to be protected from sovereign risk, that we’ve seen in Venezuela already: you’ve got to protect against being nationalized again. You’ve also got to protect a different US administration in two years, saying: ‘I don’t think that’s a good idea, I’m not going to pay you back.’”Despite Trump’s hopes, big oil will be wary of rushing back to Venezuela | Nils PratleyRead moreThe bill would be vast. Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policyestimatedthat adding between half a million and a million bpd to Venezuelan oil production would require more than $10bn in investment over two to three years.But an increase on the scale mooted by Trump and his allies is expected to need much more. The Center on Global Energy Policy said building back Venezuelan output to the same level as the early 2010s, near 2.5m bpd, was estimated to take between $80bn and $90bn over six or seven years.Exxon, Chevron and Conoco did not respond to a request for comment on whether they were consulted ahead of Saturday’s attack. While the president said on Sunday that his administration had spoken to them before and after the operation in Venezuela, unnamed executives have refuted this claim in media reports.Trump issued a hint to the industry roughly a month before Saturday’s operation, vaguely advising it to “get ready”, the Wall Street Journalreported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaOil and gas companiesDonald TrumpOilEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

A right wing former Australian finance minister, who previously argued in favour of fossil fuels and against green energy targets, Cormann is the last remaining head of a major international organisation to be appointed with the US president’s backing.The most recent version of the dealwaters down a landmark 2021 agreementthat set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal manoeuvres to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.Those havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.Donald Trump criticised the 2021 deal negotiated by the Biden administration, saying it wasn’t applicable in the US. TheTrump administrationthen threatened retaliatory taxes against countries that imposed levies on US firms under the 2021 deal.Former treasury secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans at the time, who said it would make the US less competitive in a global economy.The Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on US companies.Tax transparency groups have criticised the amended OECD plan.“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the Fact Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.Tax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.With Associated Press and ReutersExplore more on these topicsGlobal economyOECDTax havensTrump administrationG7Corporate governanceShareReuse this content"

The union argues this directive has triggered a sweeping crackdown on constitutionally protected speech.“Public school teachers and other employees do not surrender their first amendment rights simply by virtue of their employment,”the lawsuit reads.The lawsuit describes cases of four teachers who faced discipline ranging from termination to formal investigations after making personal social media posts criticizing Kirk’s rightwing positions on issues including race and immigration. According to the complaint, educators were punished despite posting from personal accounts, outside work hours, and without causing any disruption to school operations.The Texas Education Agency has received more than 350 complaints about educators’ social media activity related to Kirk’s death,according to the Texas Tribune. As of Sunday, the agency told the Tribune that 95 complaints remained under investigation, with hundreds dismissed or found unsubstantiated.“Simply being under investigation negatively impacts an educator’s reputation, requires resource expenditures for legal representation, and can have lasting detrimental impacts on an employee’s long-term employment prospects, even outside of the education arena,” the lawsuit adds.The lawsuit does not seek monetary damages but asks the court to call the investigation policy unconstitutional, stop all related probes, and require Morath to issue new, corrective guidance clarifying that districts don’t need to report comments made by the educators.The Texas Education Agency declined to respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsTexasCharlie Kirk shootingUS educationnewsShareReuse this content"

But during that period, the biggest single-day gross posted by any release wasn’t really a gross – or a movie. It was the series finale of the Netflix TV showStranger Things.Netflix made a deal to put the feature-length episode in theaters simultaneously with its streaming debut, andestimates put the numbersfor the 24 hours’ worth of shows, beginning at 8pm on New Year’s Eve and continuing throughout New Year’s Day, around $25m. That’s bigger than any single day of Avatar: Fire and Ash after its opening weekend. In fact, if the Stranger Things release banked over $30m, as some estimated, that would make it the second-biggest 24 hours for any release in December, beaten only by Avatar 3’s opening day.In ending, Stranger Things committed TV’s ultimate crimeRead moreAs it happens, those numbers are a little dicey – not just because Netflix doesn’t release box office grosses for its occasional theatrical releases, but because contractual issues dictated that the tickets for this event were technically free. At most cinemas showing the Stranger Things finale, attenders were actually purchasing $20 concession vouchers to reserve their seats. But that only underlines how lucrative this experiment was for theaters: rather than splitting the pot with the distributor as usual, that money presumably went entirely to exhibitors.Not every non-traditional release offers such a sweet deal. But various distributors and theaters alike are getting more creative about how to prop up a business that’s become increasingly dominated by big event movies, many of which are not as reliably huge as they used to be. Last fall, hot Broadway tickets like Hamilton (filmed with its original cast) and Merrily We Roll Along were available in movie theaters nationwide. Last year, Taylor Swift provided an injection of cash to follow up her 2023 concert film whena release partyfor her new album The Life of a Showgirl made $50m worldwide despite being cobbled together from one new music video, a series of no-frills lyric videos, and a bit of behind-the-scenes material. BTS put out a whole series of remastered concert films in the fall, and Netflix dipped into both its own fandom and a pop-music frenzy by arranging a series of theatrical engagements for its feature phenom KPop Demon Hunters. Like the Stranger Things release, this included a rare deal with AMC, the biggest movie theater chain in the US, and an unofficial enemy of the streamer. (Before 2025, only one Netflix feature has ever played at AMCs: a single-week engagement of Glass Onion. AMC has largely rejected the company’s appeal toward a shorter theatrical window.)View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift fans listen to a song during a listening event for Swift’s new album The Life of a Showgirl at the Astor Theatre in Melbourne on 3 October 2025.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesIt’s not all pop music, the stalwart opera and theater broadcasts, or sports programming, either. Targeted rereleases have become a multiplex staple, sometimes through such distributors as Fathom (which release multiple classics nationally every month) and sometimes direct from studios like Universal, who put Back to the Future and Jaws on Imax screens during slow periods for new releases last year. In some cities, the multiplexes have developed their own rep scenes; some theaters in the Regal chain, for example, have played a different “old” movie (ranging from 1930s monster classics to mid-century musicals to Christopher Nolan hits) every day since last September, something that’s continuing at least through January.It adds up to a strange, circular phenomenon. Entertainment that for much of the late 20th and early 21st century was associated with home viewing – sports, TV shows, rewatches of old favorite movies – has become potential big-screen fodder, even as countless feature films with major stars have been consigned to a straight-to-streaming release. Netflix and their ilk have helped train audiences to wait for streaming. Rather than resist that training, audiences have acquiesced and more or less refused to rush out and see as many movies as they used to (much less roll up to the theater just for the sake of seeing whatever’s playing). Yet there’s clearly still a collective pull towards gathering outside the living room.Some of this shift is probably sheer accounting. As much as some will still complain about movie theater prices or insist that their 75in flatscreen is roughly equivalent to a 50ft screen, good seats for a big-screen presentation are still more affordable (and easier to obtain) than the equivalent at a live-music show or sporting event, with a greater communal rush (and louder sound system) than what’s available in most homes.Some of it, though, is probably also a direct product of those shortened theatrical windows, and maybe a canny adaptation to them. Depending on how old you are, you might recall a time when movies would play in theaters for weeks or months – and even shorter theatrical releases would be followed by three to six to even 12 months before the movie in question would make it to home video formats. In 2026, it’s not unusual for a movie to be available to rent at home within two or three weeks of its opening weekend (which a lot of viewers have rounded in their heads to “on Netflix soon”, even if the reality is still often theatrical movies taking months to reach Netflix, if they’re licensed there at all). With a few big-ticket exceptions, the difference between paying to see a movie opening weekend or as soon as it hits premium VOD is negligible, a question less of necessity than preference. If you prefer to see a movie on the big screen, you’ll probably make time. If you could go either way, well, that decision will quickly be made for you.View image in fullscreenHamilton performers on stage.Photograph: Joan MarcusBy the same token, though, if it’s not unusual for a movie to hit some form of home video pretty quickly, then maybe it also erases any lingering sense of taboo over audiences paying an admission to watch something readily available elsewhere. Yes, you can watch Back to the Future or the Stranger Things finale or a big game at home, sometimes for free (or what feels like free, anyway; even sorta-free options require at least a reliable internet connection). Even that original-cast Hamilton released in September was actually streaming on Disney+ for years. But if everything is available everywhere – or anyway, if a lot of entertainment is available in a greater variety of ways – then there’s not always a reason to stick with the same method for every single block of time, any more than there’s reason to swear off ever eating food from a restaurant that you could learn to cook at home.Home-viewing advocates might roll their eyes at the outsized wonder with which some frequent moviegoers speak of the theatrical experience. Yet if theaters do survive – something most people who aren’t Netflix shareholders would probably ultimately favor – it may be due in large part to some immutable sense of reverence that they carry. To go out and see Stranger Things or a Jaws rerelease or a big soccer game at a movie theater is an act of devotion that defies simple expedience. A few viewers may have checked out those KPop Demon Hunters screenings without watching the movie on Netflix first; most of them, though, were attending to sing along with songs they already knew. A certain section of moviegoers will always prize the thrill of making that devotional choice sight unseen, for movies that could be great or terrible. But for others, maybe the cherished and the unproven are just switching places.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryStranger ThingsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Venezuela also has significant gold holdings – including bullion worth at least $1.95bn (£1.4bn) frozen in Britain.For years the gold bars have been the subject of atussle in the London courts, entangling the Bank and the UK government in Venezuelan politics and a geopolitical battle that is now taking a fresh twist.Venezuela has about 31 tonnes of gold held in the vaults of Threadneedle Street, equivalent to about 15% of its total foreign currency reserves.UK court documentsput the value in 2020 at about $1.95bn. However, thegold price has more than doubled since, meaning the bars are probably worth considerably more.Held in London since the 1980s, the practice of governments storing bullion in Britain is not unusual: the Bank keeps about400,000 bars on behalf of governments and institutions worldwide, as the second-largest global storage hub after the New York Federal Reserve.View image in fullscreenVenezuela has about 31 tonnes of gold held in the vaults of Threadneedle Street.Photograph: David Levenson/AlamySince 2018, however, Caracas has been blocked from repatriating the gold amid pressure on Maduro, after thedisputed outcome of Venezuela’s presidential electionsthat year – including Donald Trump imposingUS sanctionsduring his first term in the White House.Britain, along with dozens of other countries, did not recognise Maduro as the country’s legitimate leader. Opposition figures at the time urged the Bank not to hand over the money, arguing his administration would either steal the gold or use it to finance his dictatorial government.A memoir by Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton also later revealed that the UK Foreign Office agreed to block the gold transfer at the request of the US.In 2020, Venezuela sued in the London courts to recover the gold, and the Maduro government argued it needed money for its pandemic response. However, the then opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, also claimed control – with an ensuing legal battle complicated after the UK governmentformally recognised Guaidóas interim head of state.Despite multiple twists, and with Guaidó no longer recognised, the legal case remains unresolved.Venezuela’s interim leader after Maduro’s deposition, Delcy Rodríguez, has previously struck a defiant tone – labelling the Bank’s refusal to release the gold bars as “blatant piracy” during her time as Maduro’s vice-president.View image in fullscreenVenezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, has previously described the Bank of England’s refusal to release the gold bars as ‘blatant piracy’.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersIn 2020, she was involved in a scandal in Spain that became known as “Delcygate” involving the alleged sale of $68m of gold bars, after a surreptitious flight to Madrid to meet Spain’s transport minister despite an EU travel ban.While Rodriguez has taken aconciliatory stancesince Maduro’s capture, offering to work with the US, Yvette Cooper, the UK foreign secretary, told MPs in the Commons on Monday that Britain continued not to officially recognise the Venezuelan administration because it was “important that we have the pressure in place to have a transition to a democracy”.“Obviously there are independent decisions for theBank of Englandto take but our principles are about maintaining and pursuing the stability and the transition to a democracy and that is what is guiding our approach to recognition,” Cooper said.The immobilisation of sovereign reserves is not isolated to Venezuela, yet is becoming increasingly contentious amid fractious geopolitical conditions – with more countries seeking to repatriate their overseas holdings. Analysts believe this is one of the driving factors behind gold’srecent rally– amid growing international mistrust of the US under Trump and a breakdown of the rules-based global order.After Vladimir Putin’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, western governments led by the US – including the UK and the EU – froze about $300bn in Russian central bank assets. Most were held atEuroclear in Brussels, leading to pressure on the Belgian government from Moscow last month.The first case of international sanctions on central bank assets is thought to be the 1918 Soviet confiscation of gold shipped to Moscow by Romania during the first world war. Axis powers during the second world war also had their assets targeted by Washington. Others include North Korea and Egypt in the 1950s, and Vietnam, Cambodia and Iran in the 1970s.The Bank of England declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsBank of EnglandGoldVenezuelafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The London Stadium was half empty on another dismal night, encapsulating the apathy gripping this miserable club, and it is hard to see a way out for Nuno Espírito Santo’s accident prone side after a combination of ­misfortune and dismal defending left them seven points belowNottingham Forestin 17th place.There was a disallowed goal for Crysencio Summerville when West Ham were leading 1-0 at the start of the second half. Nuno had charged around his technical area, a big grin spread across his face, but he was watching in despair moments later. Forest replied straight away, Nicolás Domínguez heading in an opportunistic equaliser, and they boosted their survival hopes when a clumsy attempt at a clearing punch from Alphonse Areola sparked the video assistant referee review that ended with Morgan Gibbs-White scoring the winning penalty in the 89th minute.West Ham v Nottingham Forest: Premier League – liveRead moreIt does not matter that West Ham produced one of their livelier displays of the season. They grumbled at Tony Harrington pointing to the spot after a flapping Areola flattened Gibbs-White but this was a missed opportunity. Forest were poor. They were booed off at half-time and for a while it seemed the only thing Sean Dyche’s side were going to get right was show safe hands when West Ham passed them the Premier League’s crisis baton.That, of course, reckoned without West Ham’s self-destructive tendencies. They have not kept a clean sheetsince appointing Nunoand, although they mustered some fight after theshocker at Wolves, they ultimately lacked the belief and organisation to close the gap on Forest to one point.“We have to keep believing,” Nuno said. “It is about how we react. We have to realise we did enough to win. It’s not over. There’s a lot of football still to be played.”Yet there has been no improvement under Nuno. West Ham are winless in 10 games and there was some pointed talk from Tomas Soucek after an eighth defeat at home this season. “We have to be honest with each other and it will show who cares or not,” the midfielder said.“If ­someone is relaxed then they should be out of the squad.”Nuno, whose position will surely be reviewed now, did not detect a lack of effort against his former club. The issue was more that West Ham are short of tactical discipline and quality after years of shoddy recruitment.View image in fullscreenNicolás Domínguez’s header loops into the West Ham net.Photograph: John Walton/PAThe frustration was that a better team would have beaten Forest, who didn’t have to play particularly well to ease the pressure on Dyche by ending a run of four straight defeats.Forest fell behind when the ineffective Omari Hutchinson conceded a needless corner in the 13th minute. Summerville crossed and Soucek’s flick went in off Murillo.Soon, though, there were anti-board chants from the home fans. Nuno is symptom rather than cause. Repeated errors from David Sullivan, West Ham’s largest shareholder and most influential figure, are the real reason why this weekend’s FA Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers will feel like an early taste of life in the Championship next season.Desperation has taken hold. West Ham have backed Nuno, landing his targets. Taty Castellanos, the£26m Argentinian striker, showed willing before tiring on his debut. Pablo Felipe, a Brazilian forward plucked from the Portuguese top flight last week, also came on. It remains to be seen if these players can save West Ham.It is certainly strange that West Ham look ready to let Callum ­Wilson depart five months after joining the club. The experienced striker was withdrawn from the squad on the day of the game and is expected to leave by mutual consent.Perhaps Forest will pick Wilson up. They were blunt for long spells – Igor Jesus struggled – and have toiled since a 3-0 defeat by West Ham in August signalled the end of Nuno’s time at the City Ground. The initial momentum generated by Dyche faded during the festive period and there have been reports that Edu’s job as Forest’s global head of football is under threat.“There was a lot of noise around the game,” Dyche said. “We’ve played better since I’ve been at the club. But today wasn’t about that. It was about the winning mentality. It can’t always be beautiful.” Forest’s threats before half-time were limited to Neco Williams testing Areola and Callum Hudson-Odoi hitting the bar. Dyche saw too much ineffective passing. He told his side to be more direct in the second half and they improved after Summerville’s goal was disallowed for offside against Castellanos.Soon it was 1-1, Elliot Anderson’s corner met by Domínguez, the header drifting over Kyle Walker-Peters on the line. It was West Ham’s 13th concession from a set piece this season. They chased a winner and there were chances for Jarrod Bowen, Pablo and Walker-Peters. But the sinking feeling grew after Areola’s foul on Gibbs-White.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Ironically, his final game with the Ravens came against the only name ahead of him in terms of tenure length – Mike Tomlin, who has been in charge of the Pittsburgh Steelers for 19 seasons.The Ravens experienced a sustained run of success under Harbaugh, reaching the playoffs in 12 of his 18 seasons and winning the AFC North division six times. Harbaugh led his team to Super Bowl XLVII in the 2012 season, winning the title against his brother Jim in what was colloquially referred to asthe “HarBowl”.By and large, though, most of Harbaugh’s playoff success came early in his tenure. The Ravens made the AFC Championship Game three times in his first five years as head coach, but only once in the seasons since. This was despite havingtwo-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jacksonunder center for many of those seasons.Lamar Jackson is a once in a lifetime talent. And the Ravens are still going backwardsRead moreThe 2025 season was easily the most disappointing of his tenure. The Ravens started the season as Super Bowl favourites but finished with an 8-9 record, missing the playoffs aftera late missed field goalon Sunday against the Steelers, their bitter division rivals.Harbaugh had signed a three-year contract extension this past offseason, running until the 2028 season. The 63-year-old ranks 12th all time in wins by an NFL head coach. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Harbaugh’s next job could come on the media side as a TV analyst – a destination that was also speculated for Tomlin had he finished on the losing end of Sunday’s season finale and been dismissed afterward.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsBaltimore RavensnewsShareReuse this content"

Survive losing a crucial European final against one of the worst Tottenham teams in living memory. He could survive losing at home against West Ham and Wolves, finishing 15th, the tactical inflexibility, laying waste to some of the club’s best homegrown talent, the 32% win rate, calling his team the worst in Manchester United history. But there was one adversary with whom Ruben Amorim wouldnot be allowed to dance. You come at Jason Wilcox, and you best not miss.Unfortunately, like many a Premiership right-back in Blackburn’s title-winning 1994‑95 season, Amorim came at Jason Wilcox and appears to have missed. Even the most distracted of readers will notice the irony here: a coach who often railed at his players for losing one-on-one duels crumbling in the face of the white heat and animal charisma of one of the Premier League’s most feared sporting directors.Ruben Amorim axed: what now for Manchester United? Football Weekly - podcastRead moreFrankly this whole bruising episode seems to paint Jason Wilcox in a whole new light. Perhaps it might have been easy, based on his nine months of experience in a similar role at Southampton, to regard Jason Wilcox as little more than a drudge in the United exoskeleton: a man who owed his position as much to his friendship with his former boss Omar Berrada as any verifiable talent. How wrong we all were. In brilliantly outmanoeuvring United’s feted head coach, as he outmanoeuvred the hapless Dan Ashworth before him, Jason Wilcox has proved himself as one of the sport’s true generals: a strategic mind of which United’s mid-table rivals will now be rightly wary.For example, it was Jason Wilcox who, having been part of the hierarchy that hired the 3-4-3 fundamentalist Amorim in the first place, was instrumental in trying to persuade Amorim to abandon his beloved 3-4-3. Naturally, these entreaties met a certain resistance. But perhaps these judgments carry more weight when delivered from the mouth of a man of the unimpeachable football pedigree of Jason Wilcox, a veteran of three England caps and a role in a title‑winning side from 31 years ago.Perhaps in time Jason Wilcox may be persuaded to explain his thought processes to the rest of us. Perhaps at some point he might be asked why Amorim is walking away with a full payout, with no compensation reduction clause in place. But Jason Wilcox speaks rarely in public, and with very good reason. The real thinkers of this sport – men like Jason Wilcox – simply operate at a level beyond our own prosaic understanding. If he ever did speak, most likely all we would hear is a series of ultrasonic blips and four-dimensional whirring. Wanting is not quite the same as being ready to receive.View image in fullscreenSir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly proposed playing Bryan Mbeumo at right wing-back.Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty ImagesBut of course, in training our focus on Jason Wilcox we are obscuring the true genius behind the modern United throne. Jason Wilcox is, after all, simply carrying out the commands of his ultimate line manager, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in private has made very clear his preference for a back four. According to reports, Ratcliffe has also proposed playing Bryan Mbeumo as a right wing-back. Ratcliffe is keen for United to embrace data science and analytics. According to ESPN, in an executive meeting early in his minority ownership, he announced that United’s style of play “will be determined in this room”.After all, Sir Jim is an expert in this technical footballing stuff, drawing from his previous experience in petrochemicals and sailing. Above all he is incredibly rich and, as we all know, the rich are the best of us: more insightful, more wise, more tactically astute, simplysuperior. Who else would you trust to oversee an enlightened programme of cost-cutting, the construction of a new stadium that looks a lot like someone’s leftover knitting, the signing of Benjamin Sesko?From academy to Champions League: next manager’s Manchester United in-trayRead moreThis is a trend we are increasingly seeing at the elite levels of the game. For decades clubs foolishly entrusted big footballing decisions to low-level employees like managers, scouts – even footballers. Perhaps it was once possible for a young, visionary coach with ideas and energy to go into a club and see their vision supported to fruition. But how many businesses have these guys set up? How many mass redundancies have they overseen? Better by far to invest the real power where it rightly belongs: the executive class, the open-necked shirt brigade, the guys with the jaw-dropping LinkedIn profiles. Better by far to determine the tactics in the boardroom and hire someone who can tailor their offering accordingly. If coaches were once chefs, they are now more akin to Deliveroo drivers: not really responsible for the food, but still ultimately answerable if it arrives cold or leaks out of the box.In the meantime, their job has become less about defining the vision and more about selling it: the receptionist on the front desk, the public face of an organisation they can do little to influence. Enzo Maresca at Chelsea takes a squad of literal children into the Champions League and wins two medium-sized trophies, and essentially gets sacked for talking. Wilfried Nancy at Celtic seeshis reputation ruinedwhile the people who hired him live to blunder another day.Perhaps on some microcosmic level this is simply neoliberalism in action: the elevation of a gilded overclass who can never be wrong, whose decisions are always sacrosanct, whose mistakes can always be sacked away without explanation. Hire the 3-4-3 coach and then dismiss him for playing too much 3-4-3. Hire the process guy and then bin him for taking too long. And above all be grateful; for your modest season ticket price rises, for your new summer signings, for the fact that the grownups – however well qualified – are in charge.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimcommentShareReuse this content"

NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said last month in Winnipeg that the league will not send its players if there are any safety concerns with the ice.The league is sending its own experts to Italy to ensure the ice is safe. The facility features rinks smaller than NHL standards but still within IIHF standards.Tardif noted the IIHF isn’t overseeing construction – that’s up to the International Olympic Committee and local organizing officials – and can do only so much in terms of the timeline.Tardif said he will be traveling to Italy with officials from the league and the NHL Players’ Association later this week for a test event at the venue.“I’m confident about the quality of the infrastructure,” he said. “We would have liked to sleep much better … I think we will have a good competition, but maybe you can ask me the question after (this week).”The NHL was caught off guard when it became apparent the two rinks’ dimensions will be slightly wider and three feet shorter than what the league and International Ice Hockey Federation agreed upon. Daly said the league and NHLPA have reminded the IIHF that they expect the ice surface to be standard NHL size at the 2030 Olympics in France.Explore more on these topicsOlympic GamesIce hockeyNHLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Phelps will leave the company at the end of the month, ahead of the start of the first exhibition race of the season on 1 February.He was named Nascar’s first commissioner last season after a courting process for the same role by the PGA golf tour. The opportunity with the PGA was revealed during December testimony of the antitrust trial brought by two race teams against Nascar and Phelps testified he pulled out of consideration for that role upon the Nascar promotion from president.Nascar driver Denny Hamlin’s father dies in North Carolina house fireRead moreThe top executive at Nascar was deeply bruised during the trial – and the discovery process leading into it – when communications he exchanged with his leadership team was exposed. In one exchange, Phelps called Hall of Fame team owner Richard Childress “a stupid redneck” who “needs to be taken out back and flogged.”That led Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris, an ardent supporter of both Nascar and Richard Childress Racing, to write a damning letter demanding Phelps’ removal as commissioner.After he concluded his testimony in the nine-day trial last month, Phelps left the stand with his jaw clenched, his face red, and he made no eye contact with Nascar’s owners as he briskly headed directly out of the courtroom. His fiancee trailed after him as he even refused to look in her direction.Nascar settled the lawsuit with 23XI Racing, owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by Bob Jenkins, the day after Morris’ letter went public and two days after Phelps’ testimony.“As a lifelong race fan, it gives me immense pride to have served as Nascar’s first Commissioner and to lead our great sport through so many incredible challenges, opportunities and firsts over my 20 years,” Phelps said in a statement. “Our sport is built on the passion of our fans, the dedication of our teams and partners, and the commitment of our wonderful employees.“It has been an honor to help synthesize the enthusiasm of long-standing Nascar stakeholders with that of new entrants to our ecosystem, such as media partners, auto manufacturers, track operators, and incredible racing talent.”Nascar settles antitrust lawsuit with Michael Jordan–backed team after bruising trialRead moreHe added he will seek “new pursuits in sports and other industries” and thanked colleagues, friends and fans that “played such an important and motivational role in my career.”He also thanked the France family, the founders and owners of Nascar, who hired him away from the NFL two decades ago and promoted him to a position that could have netted him $5m annually with bonuses.“Words cannot fully convey the deep appreciation I have for this life-changing experience, for the trust of the France family, and for having a place in Nascar’s amazing history,” Phelps concluded.Phelps is a native of Vermont, where as a child he became a fan of local racing. He graduated from both the University of Vermont, where he set the school record in the 800 meters, and Boston College, where he earned a masters in business administration.Nascar said that Phelps’ leadership transformed a stale schedule with new events, “bucket list fan experiences,” and reshaped its strategic vision. Phelps was also lauded for expanding NASCAR’s international footprint, securing long-term media rights and charter agreements, and building a leadership team that is focused on building the future of stock car racing with fan experience at its core.“Steve will forever be remembered as one of Nascar’s most impactful leaders,” said Jim France, the Nascar chair and CEO. “For decades he has worked tirelessly to thrill fans, support teams and execute a vision for the sport that has treated us all to some of the greatest moments in our nearly 80-year history.”Phelps also led Nascar as it became the first sport to return to competition during the Covid-19 shutdown, as well as developing races inside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the downtown streets of Chicago.“Steve leaves Nascar with a transformative legacy of innovation and collaboration with an unrelenting growth mindset,” France added.Police say Nascar great Greg Biffle and family among seven dead in jet crashRead moreLesa France Kennedy, the Nascarexecutive vice-chair, said “while his career may take him elsewhere, he’ll always have a place in our Nascar family.”Nascar did not announce any additional leadership or personnel changes and said there are no immediate plans to replace him as commissioner or to seek outside leadership. His responsibilities will be delegated internally through NASCAR’s president – now Steve O’Donnell – and the executive leadership team.O’Donnell moved into Phelps’ role as president upon Phelps’ promotion to commissioner. Although the two were mostly in favor of improving revenue-sharing for the teams in over two-plus years of bitter negotiations, the discovery process showed their growing frustration with NASCAR’s board of directors over its refusal to make the charters permanent.Phelps appeared to be an advocate for more concessions for the race teams, but as the process dragged on, he ultimately fell in line with the France family and that’s when his communications became more pointed. He testified he felt the teams had received a fair deal on the new charter agreements.But it was the attacks on Childress that drew the most attention and Phelps said in court he regretted his words, had apologized to Childress and explained he was venting out of frustration.It wasn’t good enough for Morris, a longtime backer of Childress teams.“We can’t help but wonder what would happen if Major League Baseball brought in a new commissioner and he or she trash-talked one of the true legends who built the game like Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth?” Morris wrote. “Such blatant disrespect would probably not sit well with the fans – such a commissioner most likely wouldn’t, or shouldn’t, keep his or her job for very long!”Explore more on these topicsNascarMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Izzo, who coached Davis two decades ago, spoke in more detail about the incident after the game.“You know, I love Paul Davis,” Izzo said. “I really do. He’s one of my favorite guys. He’s always calling and doing things. But what he said, he should never say in the world. That ticked me off.”The 41-year-old Davis played for Michigan State from 2002-06 and was a three-year starter. He had career averages of 13.2 points and seven rebounds, including 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds his senior season.He played in the NBA with the Los Angeles Clippers from 2006-09 and the Washington Wizards in 2009-10.Izzo praised Davis for continually coming back to campus and occasionally helping work players out in the summer. Izzo said he wants Davis to keep returning.First, however, Izzo said he wants to have a chat with his former player about what happened Monday.“I’m going to have to call him tomorrow and tell him what I thought of it,” Izzo said. “And you know what? He’ll say, ‘I screwed up, Coach. Sorry.’ He kind of got after the official, and he was 150% wrong.”Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

On paper, it was a dream. Jack Draper andEmma Raducanu, the top tennis players in the country and figureheads of a new generation, finally united on the same side of the court.However, recent history has shown that things are never straightforward with Britain’s two greatest hopes. Both players have had to navigate injuries and physical problems in their young careers, so to some fans and onlookers the real question was which player would withdraw first.Draper won that race, but on the first day of the 2026 season neither player was physically prepared to take to the court.Raducanu fails to last distance as Britain suffer bitter United Cup loss to GreeceRead moreOn Sunday, Raducanuwithdrew from her scheduled season openeragainst Naomi Osaka after being sidelined for much of her off-season with a foot injury. She eventually took to the court for Great Britain’s second tie against Greece, where she faced the former world No 3 Maria Sakkari. She handled herself well enough and did not appear to have any issues with her foot. But between her struggles to find her timing early on and howshe rapidly faded physically in set three, her lack of preparation caught up with her.Raducanu has a week to ensure that she is better prepared for her first individual tournament at the Hobart WTA 250 event. For now, the situation surrounding Draper is more curious. He withdrew from the entire Australian Open swing due to his recovery from the bone bruise injury to his left arm, meaning this latest injury saga will last at least six months. He played just one match in this period, winning in the first round at the US Open thenwithdrawing from the tournament.During his injury announcement in December, Draper admirably opted to take an optimistic outlook on his situation. He said he was in the final stages of his recovery and close to a return. One of the key factors in his decision to skip Australia altogether, he noted, was the prospect of competing in the gruelling best-of-five-sets format at the Australian Open, which he was not ready for. Monday provided more hopeful news with a potential date for Draper’s return. He was named as part of Great Britain’s full‑strength Davis Cup team for their Qualifier tie against Norway on 5 and 6 February, a week after the Australian Open.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu on her way to defeat against Maria Sakkari at the United Cup.Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesStill, this is a devastating period in the 24-year-old’s career. Draper’s time as a professional has often been defined by injuries and physical issues. In his first ATP match at the Miami Open in 2021, a 19-year-old Draperwas forced to retireafter a tight opening set because of cramps in the difficult Florida heat, an introduction to the tour that in some ways has set the tone for years of battles with his own body.Midway through last year, Draper was understandably hopeful that he was moving past his injury issues. The shoulder injury thatforced him to miss Wimbledonand most of the summer tournaments in 2023 had a transformative effect on his career, pushing him to mature and fully devote himself to his singular goal of fulfilling his potential. His transcendent year between 2024 and 2025 soon followed. Draper reached theUS Open semi-finals, he won his first Masters 1000 titleat Indian Wellsand he rose to No 4 in the ATP rankings, gaining experience and learning lessons.The most concerning part of Draper’s career is how rare the stretches of good health have been. He is still young with many years ahead of him, but he is not a child. Most players around his age have compiled a large number of matches, allowing them to continue their physical and mental evolution.Of those born in the 2000s ranked in the world’s top 10, the 22-year-old Carlos Alcaraz has already played 345 ATP singles main-draw matches, the 24-year-old Jannik Sinner 407, the 25-year-old Félix Auger-Aliassime 436 and the 23-year-old Lorenzo Musetti 310. Draper has contested only 169 in his career. Even the 23-year-old Ben Shelton, who turned professional in August 2022 after spending his earlier years in college, has played 19 more matches than Draper.View image in fullscreenJack Draper has not played since the US Open in August.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APWith that in mind, this is surely a critical year in Draper’s career. His results last year confirmed what has been clear for a long time – Draper is capable of competing for the biggest titles in the world and he is in the conversation as one of the few potential rivals for Alcaraz and Sinner. He has everything he could possibly need, from his destructive, well-rounded left-hand game to his work ethic and mental toughness. Surrounded by a tight, large team of proven professionals, he is clearly doing everything he possibly can to perform at the highest level. He just needs to be healthy.Explore more on these topicsTennisJack DraperEmma RaducanuanalysisShareReuse this content"

He said on Tuesday at a Strasbourg press conference: “I have had interest from many clubs, including Champions League clubs, which I have always been open with to [club president] Marc [Keller] and our ownership. I will love this club for the rest of my life but I cannot turn down Chelsea.”After Marescadeparted Stamford Bridgein acrimonious circumstances last week, Rosenior immediately became the leading contender. But the move was held up by BlueCo, the investment vehicle that owns ­Chelsea and Strasbourg, needing to be sensitive to the requirements of both clubs. Strasbourg have ­finalised a deal for Gary O’Neil to be their manager.Rosenior needs bright start at Chelsea to avoid being a focus for fan discontent | Jacob SteinbergRead moreRosenior told Chelsea’s website: “This is a club with a unique spirit and a proud history of winning ­trophies. My job is to protect that identity and create a team that reflects these values in every game we play as we continue winning trophies. To be entrusted with this role means the world to me and I want to thank all involved for the opportunity and faith in undertaking this job.”Rosenior, who leavesStrasbourgwith his young side seventh in Ligue 1, has longstanding relationships with three of Chelsea’s five sporting directors. His contract runs for one year longer than the sporting directors’, whereas Maresca had a deal until 2029 with a club option of a further year.The former Hull manager is regarded as a bright prospect and there will not have to be a major tactical shift away from Maresca’s template. Chelsea, who are fifth in the Premier League, visit Fulham on Wednesday. They host the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against ­Arsenal next week.“I am so excited about the future,” Rosenior said. “I have worked my whole life to be a coach and manage a world-class football club. That does bring sadness for what I am leaving behind. This is emotional as it is my last day and time I wake up as a ­Strasbourg manager.”Rosenior said that two of his assistants, Kalifa Cissé and Justin Walker, and Strasbourg’s head of analysis, Ben Warner, would come with him to Chelsea.The Strasbourg Supporters’ Federa­tion, which opposes multi-club ownership, issued a strongly worded statement. “The transfer of Liam Rosenior marks another humiliating step in Racing’s subservience to Chelsea,” it said.“For two and a half years we, with others, have tried to raise awareness about this issue. The problem goes far beyond the mid-season sporting impact and the ambitions of a young coach. It is structural, the future of French club football is at stake.”Maresca wrote on Instagram that he had departed Chelsea “with the inner peace of leaving a prestigious club like Chelsea where it deserves to be” and sent thanks to the fans and players.The appointment of Rosenior coincided with a new survey of Chelsea Supporters’ Trust members ­showing major dissatisfaction with the running of the club: 52.5% of respondents said they were very unconfident that Chelsea will be able to sustain on‑pitch success over the next three to five years, 53.7% said that they had no confidence in the ownership’s football decisions and a majority expressed a strong lack of belief in the sporting structure.Explore more on these topicsChelseaStrasbourgnewsShareReuse this content"

It was 2-0 on 32 minutes and this time Diallo was the creator as his trickery on the right wing ended with a low cross that was cleverly left by Franck Kessié and the ball reached Diomande, who side-footed into the net from 18 yards.The Burkinabé were inches away from pulling a goal back when Dango Ouattara’s shot from a tight angle hit a post, but it proved a rare bright moment. The Ivorians kept pushing forward and Touré broke free on the left-hand side of the box as full time loomed. With Koffi perhaps expecting a cross, the teenage winger instead slotted in at the near post for his second of the campaign.TheAlgeriasubstitute Adil Boulbina slammed home a last-gasp winner a minute from the end of extra time as his side overcame theDemocratic Republic of the Congo1-0 to book a place in the quarter-finals.View image in fullscreenAdil Boulbina lets fly for what proved to be Algeria’s winner.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APJust as the game was headed to a penalty shootout, Boulbina cut in off the left wing before unleashing a dipping shot that flew in, clipping the underside of the crossbar on the way.It was as much as the more enterprising Algeria deserved, having created more opportunities throughout the encounter. They will now be up against Nigeria in their quarter-final in Marrakech on Saturday.Algeria dominated the early stages at the Stade Moulay El Hassan as DRC adopted a cautious approach, and flying full-back Rafik Belghali caused panic when he whipped in a 21st-minute cross that the DRC captain, Chancel Mbemba, almost turned into his own net. But by the midway point of the half, DRC had forged a good chance of their own with a breakaway from Cédric Bakambu that forced a save from the Algeria goalkeeper Luca Zidane. The resultant corner was headed narrowly wide by Axel Tuanzebe.Algeria’s captain, Riyad Mahrez, made relatively little contribution but, before being taken off in the 70th minute, he drove a free-kick narrowly over the crossbar. His teammates, however, probed in the closing stages and saw Mohamed Amoura strike an effort from an angle straight at the Congolese goalkeeper Lionel Mpasi, who made another smart stop to deny Anis Hadj Moussa in the 86th minute.Mpasi, a reserve at Ligue 1’s Le Havre, kept his side in the contest in extra time with two sharp saves from Farès Chaïbi in the final 10 minutes but there was nothing he could do to stop Boulbina’s piledriver.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Côte d’Ivoire football teamBurkina FasoAlgeria football teamDemocratic Republic of the Congo football teamAfrica Cup of NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Austrian’s contract expires this summer and the ambitious 51-year-old is understood to be open then to joining United or another big club.Glasner held discussions with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, over a new deal this season but talks were put on ice during a hectic run of fixtures, the FA Cup winners playing two games a week since the end of August owing to European commitments. He revealed more talks are expected after Palace begin their FA Cup defence against Macclesfield on Saturday but offered no guarantees he will stay.Manchester City weigh up move for Guéhi after Gvardiol breaks shinboneRead more“I think in the next weeks we will intensify the talks,” Glasner said. “Everyone gets three days off after Macclesfield and then we have to target four regular weeks and in those weeks we will intensify the talks and I expect to find a final decision.”Asked whether the uncertainty over his future was a distraction, he said: “I don’t really care about it, because I can’t affect it if there are rumours, speculation. That’s why I don’t want to respond to it, because I can sign today, or a player can sign today, a contract extension and leave in summer … The length of a contract in these times doesn’t say anything about your future.”Manchester City are weighing up a bid for Guéhi, with Palace thought to want £40m for their captain despite his contract expiring in the summer. Glasner conceded that the England defender’s future was out of his hands. “Everybody wants that he plays for Crystal Palace, signs a new contract and stays here for ever,” he said.“On the other side, there’s the situation that the contract ends in the summer and if somebody is coming, there will be a moment when the club says: ‘Now the financial issue is more important than the sport issue.’ We have to do it and try to get the best. That’s why I’m always saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Because this is different.“There will be a threshold where the club has to say [sell] … If the player says: ‘I want to leave’ and the money is above the threshold, it will happen. I’m not so naive not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.”Injury-hit Palace will be without Nathaniel Clyne and Jefferson Lerma against Aston Villa on Wednesday, although Chris Richards will be back among the substitutes after a foot injury. Glasner said he was in “constant discussion” with Parish over adding reinforcements in January after signing Brennan Johnson from Tottenham for a club record £35m but denied that his future could depend on how much backing he gets in the transfer market.“Believe me, nothing that happens in the transfer window, nothing, affects my decision, in both directions,” he said. Glasner also said Romain Esse is expected to join Coventry on loan until the end of the season.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

He has longstanding relationships with three of the five sporting directors and will know from his time at Strasbourg, who are part of the same ownership, that the head coach’s best chance of surviving is not to make the mistake of rebelling against the structure.Rosenior will have to show more political savvy than Enzo Maresca, whotalked himself out of the joblast week. Yet given the 41‑year‑old is familiar with the working conditions at BlueCo, the investment vehicle that owns Chelsea and Strasbourg, his biggest challenge is unlikely to be managing upwards. Rosenior will know where to train his focus and not to rock the boat. Crucially, he does not inherit a team in crisis. Chelsea are fifth and earned acreditable draw at Manchester Cityon Sunday; despite the rancour of Maresca’s final days, this is not a situation that calls for a major rebuild.Liam Rosenior confirmed as Chelsea head coach on contract to 2032Read moreIt will be more about minor adjustments for Rosenior. He needs to rouse Cole Palmer, whose season has been disrupted by a groin injury, and work out how to eradicate Chelsea’s habit of throwing away leads, particularly at home. Better discipline will help. Rosenior will surely not like that his young side are bottom of the fair play table after picking up 43 yellow cards and four reds in 20 league games.But these are things the Englishman can control. Less predictable is how he will be received by Chelsea’s supporters. Already there is a sense of dissatisfaction. A lot of fans are unhappy about how the club have been run under the Todd Boehly‑Clearlake Capital ownership and it is a worry that Rosenior finds himself in the unfortunate position of being perceived by some as a yes man who is getting the job only because his bosses know he will do as he is told.Getting an impressionable young squad on board will be less taxing. Although Rosenior has never dealt with stars such as Palmer and Enzo Fernández, this is a milder dressing room compared with the one run by John Terry. The players will respond to good coaching. However, Maresca had the respect of the team and still ran into problems with supporters who disliked his methodical football, called him a Championship manager in difficult times and decried him as a puppet for the board.It will not be easy for Rosenior to combat a similar narrative, even though it is unfair. Some Chelsea fans are so aggrieved by the manner of Maresca’s departure that they plan to stage a protest against the board before the home game against Brentford on 17 January. For Rosenior, the danger is getting caught in the crossfire. Many fans are not at ease with what they regard as their club’s identity changing.Some complain of a creeping Americanisation on matchdays and are not happy about ticketing processes. Others simply say standards have dropped since the Roman Abramovich era; they join Maresca in questioning the Chelsea project and wonder how Rosenior, whose experience of management in England is limited to stints at Derby and Hull, is qualified to take on a job of this size.The counter, of course, is that Rosenior has more on his CV than Maresca did when Chelsea hired the Italian after he led Leicester to the Championship title. But this is about perception. The fact that Rosenior is part of the system makes fans jumpy. It means he has to get the messaging right. He has to look, feel and speak like a Chelsea manager from day one. The mind goes back to when Graham Potter replaced Thomas Tuchel shortly after the takeover in 2022. Potter was a bright, young English manager and proven in the Premier League, but he was not a big name and it immediately felt ominous when he admitted at his unveiling that he had never been to a Champions League game.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer is key to Chelsea’s fortunes but his season has been disrupted by a groin injury.Photograph: Paul Currie/ShutterstockFans pay attention to this stuff. They have seen Chelsea win the Champions League twice and pine for the days when the removal of a manager meant Abramovich would be looking for someone of the calibre of Carlo Ancelotti, José Mourinho or Tuchel.But the culture has changed, broadly because of a strategy led by Behdad Eghbali, Clearlake’s co-founder. Chelsea buy and hire young. It is a long-term project but supporters are impatient and frustration bubbles up when results dip, which often leaves the manager in the firing line.Stamford Bridge has not always been a happy place during the past three years. Potter never settled during his seven months and was showered with abuse during a damaging defeat by Southampton in February 2023. Mauricio Pochettino, a Tottenham hero, also struggled to win people over during his single season and, for all that Maresca tried to cuddle up to supporters during his final weeks, the Italian never really had a warm relationship with the crowd.The problem is that the fans regard managers as a symbol of an ownership many remain unconvinced by. It is almost a learned response to hound them after a disappointing performance. Maresca was booed during and afterhis final game in charge. Take a step back, though, and the interesting question is whether the boos were meant for him or the project as a whole.It means Rosenior is not walking into an easy environment. The pressure will be on immediately. Chelsea are in a battle for the top four, face Arsenal in a Carabao Cup semi-final and have two Champions League games before the end of the month. It is a tough start for Rosenior but rising to the challenge would help him win over the doubters.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Crystal Palace captain,Marc Guéhi, is of interest.City are contemplating a bid for Guéhi and are close to completinga move for the forward Antoine Semenyo, who is due for a medical on Thursday after playing a final game for Bournemouth on Wednesday at home against Tottenham. City have agreed to pay Semenyo’s almost £65m release clause.Dias and Josko Gvardiol, who has a broken shinbone, were forced off inthe draw with Chelsea on Sunday, leaving City with 13 fit senior outfield players for Brighton’s visit on Wednesday. The academy graduate Max Alleyne has been recalled from a loan at Watford to bolster central defensive options in the short term.“Khusa [Abdukodir Khusanov] and Nathan [Aké] are back as central defenders, Max came back from the loan – I appreciate what Watford have done for the young lad,” Guardiola said. “The rest, Omar [Marmoush] and Rayan [Aït-Nouri] are at Afcon, and injuries to John [Stones], to Oscar Bobb.”Gvardiol, who required surgery, is unlikely to play again this season. There is no timeline on a return date for Stones, who has a thigh injury.Stones, who has missed 59 games for club and country over the past 18 months, is out of contract in the summer and Guardiola indicated the 31-year-old would not be offered fresh terms. “What happened in the last two seasons will define the decision at the end of the season,” he said.The manager was upbeat regarding the challenge facing his squad. “With the spirit that we have, always we can cope,” Guardiola said. “Maybe we will get something but it’s completely different, we are not going to buy four or five players like happened last season.”Guardiola added: “I prefer not to have that challenge [of managing the injury crisis], to be honest. It is what it is. To fight for the titles to be there, you need demanding schedules for every season, and unfortunately it happened last season. Last season it happened in November, this season happened in January a little bit, but we have enough. We don’t have much, we have first-team 13, 14 players. Some of them are coming back, and go for it.”Guardiola said of potential defensive reinforcements: “We’ll see [about] a transfer, we will be creative. We’ll find some solutions.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolanewsShareReuse this content"

It was the team’s 10th away defeat in a row and ended the 34-year-old’s tenure after seven months.Mason was appointed on a three-year deal after holding a variety of roles at Tottenham, including interim manager and assistant to Ange Postecoglou. West Brom said two members of Mason’s staff, Nigel Gibbs and Sam Pooley, had also left.“The club would like to place on record its thanks to Ryan, Nigel and Sam for their efforts and wishes all three the very best for the future,” West Brom said. “First-team coach James Morrison will oversee first-team affairs on an interim basis until a new staff is appointed.”Mason began with three wins and a draw from his first four league matches but won only six of his next 22 games and four of his last five fixtures ended in defeat. He departs with the club seven points above the relegation zone and 10 points adrift of the playoffs.West Brom play at Swansea in the FA Cup third round on Sunday before resuming their Championship campaign at home to second-placed Middlesbrough the following Friday. The club made Mason the permanent successor to Tony Mowbray, who was sacked in April 2025.Since Tony Pulis left West Brom in 2017 only one of their nine managers, Carlos Corberán, has overseen more than 100 games.PosTeamPGDPts1Coventry2628522Middlesbrough2611463Ipswich2518444Preston North End2611435Millwall26-4436Watford258417Hull252418Stoke269409Wrexham2664010Bristol City2693911QPR26-13812Leicester26-13713Derby2603514Birmingham26-13415Southampton2603316Sheff Utd25-23217Swansea26-63218West Brom26-63119Charlton25-72920Blackburn25-62821Portsmouth24-142522Norwich26-112423Oxford Utd25-102224Sheff Wed25-33-7Explore more on these topicsWest Bromwich AlbionChampionshipShareReuse this content"

Under the deal for The Overlap, Neville will remain co-chair of the company.He also co-founded the sports entertainment production company Buzz 16 in 2017.Neville launched The Overlap only in 2021, but it is now one of the UK’s most popular football content channels. The company said it has more than 38m monthly views on YouTube and achieved 2.2bn views across all platforms in 2025.“The Overlap started as an idea that we thought people might like and we went for it,” Neville said. “What has happened since then has been a great journey and it’s a team that I love working with and I’m incredibly proud to be a part of. We never thought of it as a business, we just wanted to create something that people loved and would come back to watch every week.“We see huge growth potential for The Overlap and have spent the last few months in a strategic investment process and are delighted to have found the perfect partner in Global to power us forward and create The Overlap Network with the aim of becoming a world-leading football and sports media platform.”As well as highlighting the importance now placed on video podcasting, the deal demonstrates the rapid challenge YouTube outlets are posing to traditional broadcasters. Many of the biggest names on The Overlap are former sports professionals who made their names as pundits on Sky Sports and other mainstream channels.The Overlap has already attracted attention for the often astringent views of Keane, never one to pull his punches in his assessments, as well as with its interviews with the likes of the former Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli and Wayne Rooney.Wright’s views on the treatment of Jude Bellinghamalso earned headlines.It has even dipped its toe in live broadcasting, recently winning the rights to the German Bundesliga. It shares the rights with the BBC and That’s Football, another YouTube channelrun by the YouTuber Mark Goldbridge.While The Overlap network already includes cricket and rugby channels, as well as one focusing on the US, the plan is to widen it into “a media network spanning multiple brands and channels across sports verticals, led by football”.Simon Pitts, Global’s group chief executive, said: “Gary and Scott [now CEO] have done an extraordinary job building The Overlap and we’re thrilled to welcome them and their fantastic team to Global as we embark on this next phase of growth together.“We want Global Studios to be the home of the best audio and video brands on the planet and The Overlap’s ambition, creativity and unrivalled connection with fans is a perfect fit.”Explore more on these topicsGary NevilleYouTubePodcastingEuropeDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

He is no fan of enclosed spaces, but there is much more to it. The passing Wolves defender Yerson Mosquera spots Ruiz and pops in for a brief chat with a fellow Colombian. Minutes later an under-21s player seeks Ruiz’s counsel on a non-footballing matter.“It’s a blessing to have these relationships,” Ruiz says. “To see them not just for what everybody else sees: a centre-back, a striker for Wolves. These guys are like family to me. I’m lucky to get to see this side of them, to be there when things are good, when things are bad. We’re not just players and staff here. It’s something more.”Ruiz’s office has no desk or computer. Scores of gold shirts glisten on hangers. Two printing machines sit in one corner. Every inch of every wall is covered in shelving and pigeonholes, each crammed with kit, badges, lettering and numbering. Ruiz is Wolves’ head of kit, but he and his team – assistant Barry Piper and part-time staff Ian Round and Steve Hooper – are far more than simply shirt sorters.Snow covers the ground at Wolves’ intimate and buzzing Sir Jack Hayward complex, but Ruiz, who joined in August after more than 20 years in New York, staunchly wears his shorts. What turns out to beWolves’ first Premier League victory of the seasonis 24 hours away, anhonourable draw at Old Traffordhaving concluded little more 48 hours earlier.Despite the packed schedule, Ruiz aims to have two sets of everything ready. As he adds José Sá’s name to goalkeeping tops, Ruiz estimates that badges, numbers and names (approved at the start of each season) are affixed to 50-plus shirts weekly.View image in fullscreenSean Ruiz centres the letters on Wolves’ kit by eye, which he does on more than 50 shirts every week.Photograph: Brett Patzke/Wolverhampton Wanderers FCLetters are centred by eye, with the drop from the collar measured using a small piece of card. How long is that? “No idea,” Ruiz says. “It was just here when I arrived and I’ve continued using it.”Next to the club shirts are dozens of opposition kits swapped post-match. “Eventually the players remember they’ve given them to us to wash. Sometimes weeks later they’ll wander in like: ‘Oh, do you have this jersey?’ It’s funny.”In a standard one-game week, Tuesday is prep day and on Wednesday “we really bang everything out”, Ruiz says. Staff and player kit bundles are made up, leaving Thursday and Friday as “loose-end days”.Each player gets two match shirts, with a third set printed just in case. Most players change at half-time, making it easy to gather a shirt for sale on matchwornshirts.com.Some want long sleeves, others short. Some like baggy, others tight. Under-18s are not allowed to wear gambling sponsor logos. Where is all this information held? “In here,” Ruiz says, tapping his head. “I’ve always said I should do lists, but …”View image in fullscreenThe team’s preferred colours for each fixture are submitted to the Premier League for approval, but can mean late changes for kit staff.Photograph: Brett Patzke/Wolverhampton Wanderers FCCan he name each player, number, size and shirt preference from memory? “No problem – from 1 to 38,” he says with a laugh before admitting he is still haunted by a missing two digits during his time at New York Red Bulls.When unpacking shirts in Los Angeles, Ruiz discovered that 23 was missing. Fortunately, the shirt manufacturer was based nearby and his contact sourced a co-worker to sort one. “Any other city in the country and that doesn’t happen. We were using red letters and numbers no other team used.”Behind Ruiz, a list stuck to the wall sets out Wolves preferred colours for each fixture and is submitted to the Premier League for approval. Late changes are the bane of kit staff’s existence.Boots require a post-training clean, when the grass is freshest, and the day’s final task is resetting the training-ground dressing room.Ruiz did not dream of this career; he stumbled into it. He assisted his dad, Fernando, as a teenager at the MetroStars, now the Red Bulls. Upon Fernando’s cancer diagnosis, Ruiz stepped up to the first team. Thankfully, Fernando recovered fully, but after graduation Ruiz became a “full-blown kit guy”.Molineux matchdays begin six hours before kick-off. Ruiz and Piper, an eight-year veteran who worked with England, load their blank white van (branding would increase susceptibility to theft on away trips) with shirts, shorts, goalkeeping gloves, coats, base layers, towels, boots, flip-flops, chewing gum, coffee and, crucially, a small white tactics board.A 10-minute drive later, security guards are helping unpack laundry bins, boxes and igloos into a vast multi-room dressing area. Once the team is confirmed, Ruiz can hang shirts in formation order – a new request by Rob Edwards. He then calls the digital department so that the screens above each place can be set accordingly.View image in fullscreenRuiz has little respite on matchdays as he sets the substitution board.Photograph: Brett Patzke/Wolverhampton Wanderers FCAs the dressing room fills, the individual routines and nuances show themselves. The goalkeeper Sam Johnstone always clocks his socks and requests an extra pair anyway. Tolu Arokodare trusts only Harry Warren, a matchday assistant, to steam his boots. Warren must inflate the match ball. “Matchdays are the best days,” Piper says as he flits around arranging bench coats. “Training days are about ticking over – this is when it comes alive.”The game brings little respite. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up again. Hwang Hee-chan needs his trainers. More bananas are required. The substitutions board must be set.That was a new one for Ruiz who told a white lie when he was asked about previous experience. “I had no idea what I was doing,” he says, grinning. “But you can’t say no in a new place, can you? You’re in the service business. You’ve got to figure it out.” His first task? A quadruple switch against Manchester City.After the rarest of victories, 3-0 against West Ham, the buzz under the main stand is palpable. Ruiz’s team enjoy a brief catchup with their West Ham counterparts, who face a long drive and an evening’s work.Then it is back to the training ground. “1pm leave for Everton on Wednesday?” Ruiz says. Piper and Warren nod. And on it goes.Explore more on these topicsWolverhampton WanderersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Negotiations between his camp and the club are believed to be under way. Senior players, led by Bruno Fernandes and Harry ­Maguire, would welcome his tem­porary appointment.From academy to Champions League: next manager’s Manchester United in-trayRead moreShould Solskjær be given the role, it is understood he would hope to make the position permanent if he proves a successful interim appointment. While it is not definite that he will be appointed, if he is and subsequently proves himself, it would be a repeat of history. In December 2018 Solskjær replaced José Mourinho in a caretaker capacity, and oversaw an upturn that led to him being given the permanent role the following March.As the executive are working primarily on a temporary appointment there seems little chance that Solskjær will be recruited as the new permanent No 1 now.His strong pedigree makes him a serious option for Wilcox and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, who view him as being able to affect results positively and restore a ­feelgood factor. Solskjær and Michael Carrick, the former United midfielder who had a spell in caretaker charge in 2021, are believed to have been contacted on Tuesday. No prospective candidate has been met in person yet, but they will be before an appointment is made.Solskjær led United to two top‑three finishes, in 2020 and 2021, andthe 2021 Europa League final, which was lost on penalties against Villarreal. A dire run of form the following season led to hissacking in late Novemberwith the side seventh. Solskjær is out of work after being sacked by Besiktas in August. That was his first job since leaving United.Carrick was caretaker for three games from late Novemberto early December2021, winning two and drawing the other. He is also thought to be open to the position.The stand-in head coach for at least tonight’s game against Burnley, Darren Fletcher, is another candidate for the job until the end of the season. The Scot said he had sought his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson’s approval before accepting the emergency role.“I don’t like to make any major decisions without speaking to Sir Alex – something I’ve done since I’ve been at the club [from 1995-2015 as a player] and when I left the club,” Fletcher said. “Ultimately this was to get his blessing. He deserves that respect. I wanted to run it by him and he was supportive.”Fletcher, who would not be drawn on whether he will change from Amorim’s favoured back three to a four, was asked about scrutiny of the club, ­including from his former United teammates Gary Neville, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Rio Ferdinand.“I came into the team in a season where we finished second and it was the end of the world,” he said. “Manchester United is the biggest club in the world so scrutiny is standard. You have to deal with it. Embrace the challenge of being at ­Manchester United. You can’t ask them [former players] to go easier, because they’re ­passionate guys. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room, taking it all in. People want to be entertained, a standard of what Manchester United is.”Fletcher was asked on Tuesday how many matches he will take charge of. He said: “The focus was on this game and then we’ll speak after. It all happened very quickly on Monday morning. I had a game to prepare and a quick turnaround, training session to organise, speak to the players. It’s important that we give the Burnley match the respect and focus it needs.”View image in fullscreenDarren Fletcher addresses the media on Tuesday. He said it was ‘an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team’.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesQuestioned about whether he wanted the job permanently, he said: “Honestly, it’s not something I’ve thought about. I’m focusing on Burnley. That discussion is for after the game.”His first two days in charge have been memorable. “Surreal and an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,” the 41‑year‑old said.“I don’t even think in my wildest dreams this was something that could potentially happen. I’m really proud to do it, not in the circumstances [Amorim’s sacking] I expected it to happen. So that doesn’t sit quite easy with me, but I’ve got a job to do.”Fletcher will be boosted by the return of the captain, Fernandes, and Mason Mount from injury. “They have trained and will be back in the squad on managed minutes,” he said. “That is good news.” Kobbie Mainoo could also return after a calf problem.Time constrictions mean Fletcher has spoken individually only to ­Fernandes, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, though he plans to talk with more players. “I had a conversation with Bruno because he’s the captain and focused on a ­couple of players who I don’t know so well – Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko,” he said.Oliver Glasner refused to be drawn on suggestions he could take over at United in the summer. “I’m not allowed to bet,” the Crystal Palace manager said when informed he is the bookmakers’ favourite.“My contract is one paragraph. I tell you I’m not allowed to bet, and I don’t look at it. I’m Crystal Palace manager, and I think it just makes no sense, and it’s wasting time for you to ask me any more questions, so I don’t talk about any other club than Crystal Palace.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedOle Gunnar SolskjaernewsShareReuse this content"

Greenberg has also confirmed the views are not those of Cricket NSW, given Clark is a NSW selector and board member.Smith and Head hit centuries to help Australia grind England into the dustRead moreAllsopp is well regarded by officials at CA, having risen through the ranks from a high-performance manager, women’s state coach and boss of Cricket ACT after working in NSW’s pathways setup. Bailey has had a run of success since taking over as chief selector in 2021, all the while receiving regular criticism from past players. That in itself is known to have upset Australia’s coaching team.The national broadcaster is generally given a player at stumps each day for an on-air interview, but it is understood CA did not feel it appropriate to do so after play on day three in Sydney. AAP has been told there is no contractual obligation for CA to provide the ABC a player, but it is expected post-play interviews will resume as normal on Wednesday.On Tuesday evening, Steve Smith spoke to other broadcasters following his century, as Australia took charge of the fifth Ashes Test against England. That then prompted ABC commentator Corbin Middlemas to hit out at CA on air over the matter.“It is extremely disappointing from the fact that people in the regions and people who listen to ABC radio right across the country that obviously at this time don’t get the chance to hear from the Australian cricket team,” Middlemas said. “The Australian team is a public good. It is not a private team, not private enterprise. They are the custodians of the game as it sits at the moment and is a team all Australians have a stake in it.”Clark then said he had spoken “cordially” with Greenberg about his views on Tuesday. “I am not going to get into a public spat with Todd. I have known Todd for 20 odd years. We worked together at the NRL. We are friends. We played golf together,” he said. “We have had disagreements. We will continue to have disagreements. We obviously don’t agree and that’s cool.“I will probably see him later tonight at a function and we will probably have a laugh about it. From my point of view there is no point in having a war of words about this.other than to confirm that I went and found Todd.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketAustralian Broadcasting CorporationAustralian medianewsShareReuse this content"

We must all come together to stamp it out.”Her comments came amid warnings that the Online Safety Act, which aims to tackle online harms and protect children, needs to be urgently toughened up despite pressure from the Trump administration to water it down.One expert criticised the “tennis game” between platforms such asXand UK regulators when problems arose and called the government response “worryingly slow”.Jessaline Caine, a survivor of child sexual abuse, called the government’s response “spineless” and told the Guardian that on Tuesday morning the chatbot was still obeying requests to manipulate an image of her as a three-year-old to dress her in a string bikini. Her identical requests made to ChatGPT and Gemini were rejected.“Other platforms have these safeguards so why does Grok allow the creation of these images?” she said. “The images I’ve seen are so vile and degrading. The government has been very reactive. These AI tools need better regulation.”On Monday, Ofcom said it was aware of serious concerns raised about Grok creating undressed images of people and sexualised images of children. It said it had contacted X and xAI “to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK” and would assess the need for an investigation based on the company’s response.The pressure is growing on ministers to take a tougher line. The crossbench peer and online child safety campaigner Beeban Kidron has urged the government to “show some backbone” and called for the Online Safety Act regime to be “reassessed so it is swifter and has more teeth”.Speaking about X, she said: “If any other consumer product caused this level of harm, it would already have been recalled.”She said Ofcom needed to act “in days not years” and called for users to walk “away from products that show no serious intent to prevent harm to children, women and democracy”.Ofcom has powers to fine tech platforms up to £18m or 10% of their qualifying global revenues, whichever is higher. The biggest penalty to date came last month when a porn provider that failed to carry out mandatory age checkswas fined £1m.Last month, ministers promised new laws to ban “nudification” tools, which use generative AI to turn images of real people into fake nude pictures and videos without their permission. It remains unclear when that ban will be enforced.Sarah Smith, the innovation lead at the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, a charity that works to prevent child abuse, called for X to immediately disable Grok’s image-editing features “until robust safeguards are in place to stop this from happening again”.X did not respond to a request for comment on Kendall’s remarks. It said on Monday: “We take action against illegal content on X, including child sexual abuse material, by removing it, permanently suspending accounts and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.”Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity adviser at at the security software firm ESET, criticised the “tennis game” between platforms such as X and UK regulators and called the government response “worryingly slow”.He said that as AI increasingly allowed faked images to be rendered as longer videos, the consequences for people’s lives would only become worse.“It is unbelievable that this is able to occur in 2026,” he said. “We have to move forward with extreme regulation. Any grey area we offer will be abused. The government is not understanding the bigger picture here.”It is already illegal to create or share non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including sexual deepfakes created with AI. Fake images of people in bikinis may qualify as intimate images, as thedefinitionin law includes the person having naked breasts, buttocks or genitals or having those parts only covered by underwear. Indecent imagesincludethose depicting children in erotic poses without sexual activity.Lady Kidron said AI-generated pictures of children in bikinis may not be child sexual abuse material but they were contemptuous of children’s privacy and agency.“We cannot live in a world in which a kid can’t post a picture of winning a race unless they are willing to be sexualised and humiliated,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIAI (artificial intelligence)XOnline abuseChild protectionLiz KendallInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

If the law won’t stop it, perhaps his investors willSophia Smith GalerThe owner of X has grown used to acting with impunity – but this may be a red line for those with ‘conservative values’ who fund his adventures in free speechTue 6 Jan 2026 10.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 13.39 ESTShareIt’s a sickening law of the internet that the first thing people will try to do with a new tool is strip women. Grok, X’s AI chatbot, has been used repeatedly by usersin recent daysto undress images of women and minors. The news outlet Reuters identified 102 requests in a 10-minute period last Friday from users to get Grok to edit people into bikinis, the majority of these targeting young women. Grok complied with at least 21 of them.There is no excuse for releasing exploitative tools on the internet when you are sitting on$10bn (£7.5bn) in cash. Every platform with AI integration (which now covers almost the entire internet) is planning for the same challenges; if you want to enable users to create images and even videos with generative AI, how do you do so without letting the same people cause harm? Tech companies spend money behind the scenes that you’ll never see as a user to wrestle with this; they’ll do “red teaming”, in which they pretend to be bad actors in order to test their products. They’ll launch beta tests to probe and review features within trusted environments.With every iteration, they’ll bring in safeguards, not only to keep users safe and comply with the law, but to appease investors who don’t want to be associated with online malfeasance. But from the start, Elon Musk didn’t seem to act as if he thought digital stripping was a problem. It’s Musk’s prerogative if he feels that someone turning a Ben Affleck smoking meme into an image of Musk half-nakedis “perfect”. That doesn’t stop the sharing of non-consensual AI deepfakes from being illegal in many jurisdictions,including the UK, where offenders can be charged for sharing these images, or the creation of sexual images of children.One useful thing Grok has done this week is reveal how it has been programmed. When a user interrogated it as to why it had manipulated an image of the Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, so that she appeared in a bikini, itargued that it was satirebecause she had been speaking about a burqa ban. It went on to insist that itwasn’t a deepfake of a real photo,but an AI-generated illustration (wrong), and added that it aims to balance fun with ethics, “avoiding real harm while responding creatively” to requests.For someone who supposedly values humour, it is strange that Musk has tried to furnish a chatbot with it. Chatbots are misnamed in that they actually have no idea of how to speak – they generate text by predicting what is most likely to come next, using statistical patterns and data training as opposed to genuine insight. Grok’s excuses show its parameters for safety or for sticking to the facts have not been robustly tested; it has been programmed for entertainment.As the week has developed, Musk appears to have found the joke less funny himself. “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,”Musk threatened on 3 Januarywith what came across as all the gravitas of a garlic dough ball. Between 2023 and 2024, X dramatically reduced trust and safety staffing, and is over-reliant on user reporting. This means that many bad actors can still get away with illegal behaviour on the platform.Rather than acknowledge that X could help deal with the problem itself, Musk has lumped the responsibility of investigation on law enforcement and the blame on X’s users. Ofcom, as well as the European Commission, may well throw the book back at him if they investigate and find X’s policies lacking – but even then, Musk may well evade accountability, as currently appears to be the case with the€120m fine issued to Xover its blue tick badges.View image in fullscreenAI-generated image of Elon Musk in a bikini created by Musk using Grok and posted on X @elonmuskIllustration: @elonmuskOther AI agent tools such as ChatGPT and Meta AI prohibit non-consensual deepfake pornography and appear to enforce this, which raises the question: why can’t Grok? How the world chooses to police the platform for so flagrantly allowing crimes to be committed on it will prove once and for all whether figures such as Musk can operate with impunity. I am interested in seeing how the political right, who have enjoyedX bending in their directionsince Musk’s takeover, will react to this. Protecting women and children is a core tenet of conservative values, and rightwing voices in the US now face a moral test. In the coming weeks, we’re going to see if they are still willing to defend a US company in the name of free speech, even when it allows people to createsexualised content of children.From my vantage point as a former daily user,Xhas long felt inhospitable – and this week’s events are the latest in a line of digital abominations that remind me it was a good decision to move my output elsewhere. But an active, hostile environment normalising this behaviour still hurts us, regardless of whether we’re there or not, as these images will spread around the internet. The damage – the assault – marks us whether we’re still X users or not.Someone has to do something – and if international governments can’t motivate X to change, then maybe some of its investors can.xAI is burning through billionsfor its AI development, and will be guzzling data by allowing its users to generate images willy- nilly; respecting various international laws wouldn’t only be, er, more legal – but it’d be cheaper, too.Grok’s purpose is to maximise “truth and objectivity”, according to its own website, but today as I scroll its cesspit, all I’ve seen it maximise are a Swedish politician’s “knockers” at the request of an anonymous user. News reporting is now also charting a slew of manipulated bikini images of 14-year-olds. “We report suspected child sexual abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,” xAI’s acceptable use policy claims. But how comfortable will the company be reporting its own monster?Sophia Smith Galer is a journalist and content creator.

Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”Nvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”Huang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.He revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.The Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.Huang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.To get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.While Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaAI (artificial intelligence)Self-driving carsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

So friction-maxxing means doing hard things that will ultimately make you a better person?That’s exactly it, although “friction-maxxing” is cooler because it sounds vaguely futuristic.How did the term come about?Via a piece inThe Cutcalled “In 2026, we are friction-maxxing” in which writer Kathryn Jezer-Morton advocates for avoiding things that make your life more convenient.Likepenicillin?No, obviously not penicillin. But things such asChatGPT, location sharing and Uber Eats, which help you achieve things that historically took significant amounts of time and effort. Jezer-Morton argues that this culture of slick convenience only serves to infantilise us.But it’s so easy.Yes, and that robs us of our sense of satisfaction. So you just used AI to write a school essay. Congratulations, you have achieved nothing of worth.Whereas if you friction-maxx?Then you’ve searched inside yourself. You’ve nudged your own personal boundaries, and discovered that you are more capable than you ever knew. You are building a foundation of perseverance and resilience that you cannot get from typing a prompt into a chatbot.I love this! What else does Jezer-Morton advocate?She also suggests sending your children on small errands (adding the friction of knowing they’ll do a bad job) and inviting people to your house without cleaning it properly (so you can enjoy the sweet friction of being judged).What the hell? That’sweird.No, it’s friction-maxxing, although admittedly at a higher level than I would be comfortable with.Anyway, hooray for banishing convenientthings. Let’s ban automatic gearboxes while we’re at it!No, there’s no need for that.Dishwashers? Refrigerators?No, both of those are probably fine as well.Mechanised agriculture? The printing press?I see what you’re getting at. You’re saying we live in a world that is already filled with thousands of inventions which have, for hundreds of years, improved the lives of millions of people through increased convenience, and therefore it does seem slightly arbitrary to choose this exact moment in time to draw a line in the sand. You’re saying we should only use friction-maxxing when it comes to things that we didn’t grow up with.No, I’m saying that I really hate mechanised agriculture.Oh, fine then.

The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared toreferenceAI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University,calledthe piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.View image in fullscreen‘Our timelines … are a bit longer still,’ Daniel Kokotajlo wrote.Photograph: Twitter/XTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, withofficialsandexpertspredicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.Kokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”Kokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.However, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.Generation AI: fears of ‘social divide’ unless all children learn computing skillsRead more“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,”wroteKokotajlo in a post on X.Creating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman,saidin October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”Andrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingOpenAISam AltmanJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

There were fake photos ofNicolás Madurobeing escorted off a plane by US law enforcement agents, images of jubilant Venezuelans pouring into the streets of Caracas and videos of missiles raining down on the city – all fake.Deposed Maduro pleads not guilty after capture in shock US attack on VenezuelaRead moreThe fabricated content intermixed with real videos and photos of US aircraft flying over the Venezuelan capital and explosions lighting up the dark sky. A lack of verified information about the raid coupled with AI tools’ rapidly advancing capabilities made discerning fact from fiction about the incursion on Caracas difficult.By the time Trump posted averified photoof Maduro blindfolded, handcuffed and dressed in grey sweatpants aboard the USS Iwo Jima warship, the fake images with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents had already gone viral. Across X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, the AI photos have been seen and shared millions of times, according to the factchecking site NewsGuard.Vince Lago, the mayor of Coral Gables, Florida,posted the fake photoof Maduro being escorted by the DEA agents to Instagram, saying that the Venezuelan president “is the leader of a narco-terrorist organization threatening our country”. Lago’s post received more than 1500 likes and is still up as of this writing.Tools for detecting manipulated content, such as reverse image search and AI-detection sites, can helpassess whether online images are accurate, but they are inconsistent. Sofia Rubinson, a senior editor who studies misinformation and conspiracy theories for NewsGuard, told the Guardian that the fake images of Caracas are similar to actual events, which makes it even more difficult to figure out what is real.“Many of the AI-generated and out-of-context visuals that are currently flooding social media do not drastically distort the facts on the ground,” Rubinson said. “Still, the use of AI-generated fabrications and dramatic, out-of-context footage is being used to fill gaps in real-time reporting and represents another tactic in the misinformation wars – and one that is harder for fact checkers to expose because the visuals often approximate reality.”NewsGuardreleased a reporton Monday afternoon that identified five fabricated and out-of-context photos as well as two videos of the military operation in Venezuela. One AI-generated photo shows a soldier posing next to Maduro, who has a black hood over his head. An out-of-context video shows a US special forces helicopter descending on a supposed Venezuelan military site – the actual footage was taken in June at the Fort Bragg army base in North Carolina.NewsGuard said the seven misleading photos and videos it identified have now garnered more than 14m views onXalone.Other footage from past events is also being circulated online and passed off as part of Saturday’s strike. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and Trump confidant, posted footage of a poster of the Venezuelan president on X saying that “the people of Venezuela are ripping down posters of Maduro”. According to Wired, thefootage is from 2024. Loomer has since removed the post.Another rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, posted on X an aerial video of thousands of people cheering in Caracas. “Millions of Venezuelans flooded the streets of Caracas and other major cities in celebration of the ouster of Communist dictator Nicholas Maduro,” Jones wrote. “Now we need to see the same type of energy here on the HomeFront!”The video, which is still up, has reached more than 2.2m views. Comments on the post from Community Notes, X’s crowdsource moderation tool, say that the video is “at least 18 months old”. A reverse image search of the video shows that the footage is actually from a protest in Caracas after Maduro’s disputed presidential win in July 2024.Grok, the platform’s AI chatbot, also disputes the timeline of Jones’ video, saying: “Current sources show no such celebrations in Caracas today, but pro-Maduro gatherings instead.”Meta, X and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)XVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasUS attack on VenezuelaInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

For instance, if you resort to task-oriented games such as Candy Crush for a mindless distraction, try acrochet kit.Make your phone harder to useIt can feel too easy to pick up your phone when you have a free second.To make it less convenient to scroll, offload tempting apps and power your phone off between uses, advised Dr Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation.Use your laptop insteadView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty ImagesIf you’re feeling brave, you can take a page from Lembke, who leaves her house without her phone and keeps any necessary apps on her laptop, “so that it’s not quite so accessible and quite so mobile”.Make your phone boringLembke advised turning on “grayscale” mode in your phone’s display settings, which “is a good way to make it less potent”. If you’re worried that you won’t remember how to switch it back to color,Price has sharedhow to create an accessibility shortcut that allows you to easily toggle between the two modes.Make your apps boringYou can also try decreasing your algorithm’s power. If you often fall down YouTuberabbit holes, turn off its “recommendations” feature.

How is it hurting you?” Price said.Take short, intentional screen breaksMany of the experts advised taking planned time away from your phone.Dr Larry Rosen, co-author ofThe Distracted Mindand a research psychologist, recommended “tech breaks”, consisting of two minutes of screen time, followed by 15 to 30 minutes of focused, distraction-free work. “Then you’re controlling the break,” he said.Take a long breakIf you’re up for a challenge, you can also try taking an extended break. “You do feel better,” Lembke said. It also forces you to connect with people in your life, she said: “In the face of boredom and discomfort, people typically reach out to other people.”Swap phones with someone you trustView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tatiana Maksimova/Getty ImagesIf you don’t want to go without a smartphone completely, try swapping with a loved one.On the weekends, Etkin, the Duke professor, trades phones with her partner. “That way, we can get ahold of each other if we need to, and we could check something if we need to.

A few of my favorites arewatercoloringand reading on myKindle. And despite the chilly weather, I lovegoing for a run. I also asked my Filter colleagues about screen-free things they liked to do, and here’s what they said.Nick Mokey, Filter editor:Now that I work from home, I actually miss the days of commuting into an office by bike every day, and I find myself inventing excuses to run errands on two wheels: buying groceries, getting a haircut, meeting friends for a beer.I’ve never arrived anywhere in a worse mood after biking there, and when I catch clear skies in the winter, a bike commute can become the highlight of an otherwise mundane day. With both no screenandno earbuds for safety, it’s a total disconnect from all things digital.Karen Yuan, Filter US commissioning editor:Is it a cop-out to say my favorite screen-free activity is taking a walk? Especially very long walks.A couple years ago, I fell in love with solo backpacking, and since then I’ve hiked through forests and dirt roads in Spain, France and Japan with my trustyOsprey Mira 32L. I love taking these walking tours of new places because they force me to just take in and enjoy what’s around me.And because I can’t always up and leave my everyday life, I try to keep that mindset at home, too – by taking long evening walks around my Brooklyn neighborhood that help me view all my familiar sights anew.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter USHealth & wellbeingSmartphonesNew yearSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Getting up in the dark decouples our life from our circadian rhythm (our body clock), with bodily processes such as cognition and metabolism put to work before they’re fully prepped.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Thank heavens, then, for sunrise alarm clocks. These “dawn simulation” devices glow with gradually intensifying brightness as your wake-up time approaches, kickstarting your circadian rhythm before you get out of bed. For many users, this results in a happier, healthier start to the day.Not all sunrise alarm clocks are made equal – for instance, only some are bright enough to be medically certified as light-therapy devices forSad(seasonal affective disorder) and other disorders. We’ve indicated the two alarms that have this certification in their specs below.I awoke with 10 of the best-rated wake-up lights from Lumie, Beurer, Philips, Dreamegg, Momcozy, Blueair and Lexon to find out which would make the most difference to my mornings. As a lifelong reluctant riser, I’ve found the experience of testing these devices a gamechanger – in fact, I’m now using one daily.

I’ve often felt lousy first thing, after waking up to a minutes-long medley of smartphone alarms.When, at last, I drag myself out of bed, I frequently spend the day reviewing all kinds of gadgets, from Sad lamps to electric heaters. It’s a freelance job I’ve been privileged to do since 2017 – and as we tumbled dimly into 2025, the Filter gave me one of my most quietly life-improving assignments yet: reviewing sunrise alarm clocks. I tested three additional models in winter 2025/26, and one of these has emerged as my favourite of all.The extent to which these gadgets have improved my mornings has surprised me – although it was greater in some cases than others. Frankly, I’d like other groggy wakers to feel the same benefit, and my reviews are written and ranked with this in mind.Some brands did not want the sunrise alarm clocks I sourced for testing back, so those will be donated for fundraising toCat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach sunrise alarm clock, including the Beurer Wake-up Light WL50 (pictured), was tested over at least two nights.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianThe only proper way to test a sunrise alarm clock is by using it to wake up each morning – so that’s exactly what I did.I used each model for at least two nights, testing out multiple light and alarm sound settings, and assessing the quality of wake-up for each device. I considered the brightness of each alarm, how close the glow felt to real sunlight, and the audio quality. Above all, I reflected on how lively and refreshed I felt after waking up with each one.Many sunrise alarm clocks also have a sundown function, so I used this where available too. I also tried using each sunrise alarm clock as a reading light, to help me finish the day – as well as start it – smartphone-free.Some sunrise alarm clocks go even further, with additional features such as app operability, multiple alarm profiles and mood lighting. To ensure a thorough review of each sunrise alarm clock, I played around with every possible customisation option and functionality.The best sunrise alarm clocks in 2026View image in fullscreenThe Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150, the Blueair Mini Restful sunrise clock air purifier and the Lexon Mina Sunrise.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianBest sunrise alarm clock overall:Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150LumieBodyclock Glow 150from£86.99£91.63 at Lumie£86.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperior sunrise simulation and pleasant alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveIt’s relatively expensive£91.63 at Lumie£86.99 at AmazonLumie is the brand that pioneered consumer-grade sunrise alarm clocks in the early 1990s, and that pedigree still shines through.Equipped with a comprehensive set of wake-up sounds and medical-grade sunrise simulation, the Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best sunrise alarm clock of the many I’ve tested. It comes at a premium price, but could pay dividends for your sleep cycle.Why we love itThe sunrise effect is among the most convincing I’ve experienced, rivalling the less fully featured (but slightly cheaper) Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which is reviewed below. It feels like waking to daylight, or emerging into a clearing after walking through dense woodland.I found this model easy to control and configure via the five buttons surrounding the digital display. All of the personalisations that really matter are available, including sunrise light intensity and duration.Crucially, there’s a great selection of alarm tones to choose between – not always the case with Lumie models – ranging from the wonderfully gentle to the brusquely rousing. I preferred “tropical birds” and “waves” to “beep” or “steam train”, although I enjoyed imagining a train enthusiast waking contentedly to the latter.It’s a shame that …there’s only one colour available: black (with a white lamp). This will suit some bedroom design schemes better than others.Certification:UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745 medical classificationModes:sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D12cmFeatures:light-sensitive auto-dimming displayBrightness settings:fiveSunrise duration:20, 30 or 45 minutesLumieBodyclock Glow 150from£86.99£91.63 at Lumie£86.99 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperior sunrise simulation and pleasant alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveIt’s relatively expensiveBest budget sunrise alarm:Momcozy Sunrise EchoMomcozySunrise Echo£47.99£47.99 at EbebekWhat we loveBroad selection of lilting alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveThe controls are a little fiddly£47.99 at EbebekThe clue’s in the name: the Momcozy Sunrise Echo comes primed with a selection of wake-up sounds intended specifically for mums, dads and their little ones. It’s also tough to topple, soft around the edges and weighs just 0.55kg.Why we love itI’m neither a parent nor a baby, but I can certainly hear the soothing quality in the Sunrise Echo’s 30-strong repertoire of wake-up sounds, which includes lullabies alongside the usual nature sounds and meditative drones. The sound quality is impressive, with plenty of mid-range frequencies and a touch of bass. It’s nicely balanced and not at all jarring.The Sunrise Echo creates a lilting light effect, rather than intensively light-therapising the sleeper as some higher-powered models do. It was easy to set up and customise the alarm using the well-labelled control buttons around the shoulder of the alarm clock. It was a little harder though, through a fug of sleepiness, to adjust the screen and light brightness via their respective dials on the rear of the device. Nonetheless, the Momcozy Sunrise Echo is an excellent, accessible option for users who don’t want a very bright wake-up.It’s a shame that …a few nice-to-have features are absent, including FM radio and multiple alarms.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D8.5cmFeatures:night light (seven colours), sleep aid sounds, digital clock display, adjustable sunrise durationBrightness settings:30Sunrise duration:30 minutesMomcozySunrise Echo£47.99£47.99 at EbebekWhat we loveBroad selection of lilting alarm tonesWhat we don’t loveThe controls are a little fiddlyBest sunrise alarm clock for heavy sleepers:Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100LumieBodyclock Spark 100from£88.20£88.49 at Healf£88.20 at AmazonWhat we loveOutstanding sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveLack of gentler alarm sounds£88.49 at Healf£88.20 at AmazonI woke up feeling great when I used the medical-grade Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which bathes the room in gradually intensifying, sun-like light for a set period before the alarm goes off.Why we love itThe device is supposed to realistically imitate the lightening shades of a sunrise – and it does so more convincingly than any other brand’s sunrise alarm clock. Depending on your chosen light intensity setting, it can get very bright.The Spark 100 also has a sunset feature that graduates through the same red, orange and white light colours used with the sunrise function, but in reverse order. After the sunset cycle, the light can either switch off entirely or remain in a gentle night-light mode, whichever you choose.Besides performing brilliantly as a wake-up light and sunset simulator, the Spark 100 is simply a nicely designed, well-made thing. I appreciated its soft-edged yet robust construction and handy features such as the cable organisation in the base. It’s a pleasure to have on the bedside table.It’s a shame that …the alarm tone sounds piercing at the higher three of its five volume levels. I found myself settling for a 2/5 – though very heavy sleepers may prefer (or even relish) the louder options.Certification:UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745 medical classificationModes:sunrise, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D12cmFeatures:tap to snooze, auto-dimming display, adjustable sunrise/sunset duration, adjustable digital display brightnessBrightness settings:fiveSunrise duration:30 minutesLumieBodyclock Spark 100from£88.20£88.49 at Healf£88.20 at AmazonWhat we loveOutstanding sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveLack of gentler alarm soundsBest sunrise alarm for late-night reading:Philips SmartSleepPhilipsSmartSleepfrom£160.37£188.99 at Philips£160.37 at AmazonWhat we loveBeautiful design and very good sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveOne of the most expensive options£188.99 at Philips£160.37 at AmazonThis lamp soon felt like part of the furniture on my bedside table. In typical Philips fashion, it’s a good-quality, dependable product, with a middle-of-the-road design that won’t look out of place in many bedrooms.Why we love itSetup is incredibly slick – I was able to set my alarm time, sound and brightness by following the simple prompts on the device’s display, without having to consult the manual. Subsequently tweaking your alarm(s) takes a bit of practice, but you’ll master all the controls you need after a few days.The SmartSleep’s wake-up capabilities are impressive, combining brilliant light with a diverse choice of alarm sounds. It also has FM radio and 3.5mm auxiliary audio input options for the user who has tired of Alpine and gong bath soundscapes. There’s a 5V USB charging outlet at the rear of the lamp, too, which could free up a valuable bedside power socket.I loved using this model as a reading light, as well as a sunrise alarm. Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful, which helped me get to sleep after reading pulpy detective novels late at night. The light can be deactivated with a press.It’s a shame that …it costs such a lot. The SmartSleep has a hefty price to match its impressive performance.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sleep mode with sunset simulation, bedside lightFootprint:W22 x D12cmFeatures:FM radio, Aux audio input, “RelaxBreathe” breathing exercises, adjustable sunrise duration, snooze, up to two wake-up profiles (with separate alarms)Brightness settings:25Sunrise duration:20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 minutesPhilipsSmartSleepfrom£160.37£188.99 at Philips£160.37 at AmazonWhat we loveBeautiful design and very good sunrise simulationWhat we don’t loveOne of the most expensive optionsBest mini sunrise alarm clock:Lexon Mina SunriseLexonMina Sunrisefrom£72.74£72.74 at FormAdore£80.16 at AmazonWhat we loveCute, chic designWhat we don’t loveAwkward controls£72.74 at FormAdore£80.16 at AmazonMy only general gripe with sunrise alarm clocks is that many of them are an aesthetic downgrade on a conventional bedside lamp – but this charming mini model from French brand Lexon is a stylish exception.Why we love itThe obvious draw here is the design, which comprises a cute, mushroom-shaped light and colourful metal base with a wraparound digital display. It fits very neatly on to a small or well-utilised bedside table.The sunrise light function roused me gently before the alarm tone (also gently rousing) sounded, and I got up feeling alert. Even though this isn’t a very bright light, it evidently did the trick, and it was suitable for bedtime reading, too.Depending on the model, you can choose from nine orfive alarm tones, all of which sound pleasantly full and rich. These include birdsong and water sounds, as well as some loud, piercing alarms that will suit particularly heavy sleepers.Beautifully finished and stoutly made, the Mina Sunrise is a cut above the rest in terms of build quality.It’s a shame that …the control buttons are on the base, and can’t be seen in the dark without a secondary light source such as a smartphone torch. You’d struggle to adjust the settings in the middle of the night.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W11 x D11cmFeatures:mood lighting (nine colours), snooze, cordless operationBrightness settings:fiveSunrise duration:30 minutesLexonMina Sunrisefrom£72.74£72.74 at FormAdore£80.16 at AmazonWhat we loveCute, chic designWhat we don’t loveAwkward controlsBest sunrise alarm clock for a gentle awakening:Lumie Sunrise AlarmLumieSunrise Alarmfrom£33.99£39.20 at John Lewis£33.99 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat value, with good sunrise simulation and soundsWhat we don’t loveLess bright than swankier Lumie modelsPhotograph: Pete Wise/The Guardian£39.20 at John Lewis£33.99 at AmazonImagine telling one of your ancestors that you were awoken this morning by your lamp, which was purring at you. I’m not pulling your leg, you might say, it’s all thanks to the Lumie Sunrise Alarm’s “kittens purring” alarm tone, which sits sweetly alongside four other natural sounds, including goats bleating and birdsong.Why we love itIn all seriousness, this is an excellent sunrise alarm clock, and it comes at a standout price. Its sunrise light subtly brightens during the minutes leading up to your chosen alarm time, producing a lovely awakening that really did remind me of natural light.I found it easy enough to set the Sunrise Alarm’s time and alarm, although pressing some of the buttons can be fiddly. Do keep the instruction manual handy, as there are lots of options and buttons to get your head around.It’s a shame that …it lacks a little bedside table appeal. But having said that, this sunrise alarm clock has incredible performance for the price.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W17 x D9cmFeatures:mood lighting (six colours)Brightness settings:10Sunrise duration:30 minutesLumieSunrise Alarmfrom£33.99£39.20 at John Lewis£33.99 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat value, with good sunrise simulation and soundsWhat we don’t loveLess bright than swankier Lumie modelsBest sunrise alarm clock for couples:Beurer Wake-up Light WL50BeurerWake-up Light WL50from£48.95£55.99 at John Lewis£48.95 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s packed with featuresWhat we don’t loveNot all the features are useful£55.99 at John Lewis£48.95 at AmazonThanks to its capability to save two alarms for different times (each with its own sound and light settings), the Beurer WL50 is a great choice for couples who get up at different times. That’s a rare feature in any sunrise alarm clock – let alone in such a reasonably priced model.Why we love itThe sunrise mode itself is gentle yet effective, and it’s easy to activate the device as a reading light with a simple, groggy tap. I really liked the alarm sounds you get with the WL50 too – which is just as well, as there are only two options.Perhaps that narrow choice of alarm tones sounds a little stingy, but it seems less so when you explore the WL50’s alternative audio options. It doubles up as an FM radio, with space to save up to 30 station presets, which you can listen to throughout the day or use as a livelier alternative to an alarm tone. Bluetooth connectivity and an AUX input expand your listening options further.Curiously, this sunrise alarm clock can be unplugged (when fully charged) and used on the go for up to three hours. It’s hard to imagine a situation wherein this would be useful, but I appreciate the gesture.It’s a shame that …the sound quality isn’t great (but it’s good enough for the half-awake).Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sunset simulation, bedside light, radio/speakerFootprint:W11 x D11cmFeatures:FM radio, AUX audio input, Bluetooth audio, portable use (up to three hours), LED mood lightBrightness settings:adjustableSunrise duration:10, 20 or 30 minutesBeurerWake-up Light WL50from£48.95£55.99 at John Lewis£48.95 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s packed with featuresWhat we don’t loveNot all the features are usefulThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘A beautifully designed alarm clock’: the Dreamegg Sunrise 1.Photograph: Pete Wise/The GuardianBlueair Mini Restful sunrise clock air purifierBlueairMini Restful sunrise clock air purifier£134£134 at BlueairWhat we loveInnovative sunrise and air purification comboWhat we don’t loveToo bulky for the bedside table£134 at BlueairBest for:an air-purifying sunrise alarm clockMost of us spend around a third of our time in bed, so a sunrise alarm clock that also purifies your bedroom air seems like a good idea. This model, the Blueair Mini Restful, is heralded as the world’s first.By sunrise alarm clock standards, it isn’t really mini. I found myself resting it on the floor, where I could see the digital display on the top, rather than putting it on my bedside table.The sunrise function proved effective, waking me reliably with warm, increasingly bright light before the alarm sounded. As for the purification, the Mini Restful certainly made my air feel fresher after a windowsill-sanding session had kicked up untold volumes of dust. The fan works exceptionally quietly, although I still preferred to run it only during the daytime (this can be automated via the Blueair app’s schedule feature).It didn’t make the final cut because …the sunrise alarm feature is only accessible via the Blueair app, and I feel that users should have the option to activate it manually. With that said, the app is a pleasure to use.Certification:none;modes:night light, sunrise alarm;footprint:W17 x D17cm;features:air purification, app control, alarm schedule;brightness settings:scale of 0-100%;sunrise duration:15-30 minutesBlueairMini Restful sunrise clock air purifier£134£134 at BlueairWhat we loveInnovative sunrise and air purification comboWhat we don’t loveToo bulky for the bedside tableDreamegg Sunrise 1DreameggSunrise 1from£79.99£79.99 at Dreamegg£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNicely pairs a textured front with mellow mood lightingWhat we don’t loveRelatively dim light£79.99 at Dreamegg£79.99 at AmazonBest for:soothing sleep soundsThis compact, great-looking device offers something different, with a selection of 29 ambient sounds that can be used as white noise to help you fall asleep. There are also five options for rousing you in the morning, including birdsong, a campfire crackling and, my favourite, waves breaking on a shore. For me, perhaps the only issue with this approach was that the sounds did a better job of putting me to sleep than they did of waking me up.The Sunrise 1 is a beautifully designed alarm clock, with a softly textured front and foolproof dimmer controls on either side to adjust the light level and digital display brightness. Reluctant risers will be pleased to note there’s a prominent snooze button at the top of the device – though, personally, I’ve rarely felt the need to use this feature while testing sunrise alarm clocks.It didn’t make the final cut because …its light is a little too dim for my taste.Certification:none;modes:sunrise alarm, white noise/sleep sounds, bedside light;footprint:W15 x D7.3cm;features:sleep sound timer, nine light colours, five wake-up sounds;brightness settings:adjustable;sunrise duration:5 to 60 minutesDreameggSunrise 1from£79.99£79.99 at Dreamegg£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveNicely pairs a textured front with mellow mood lightingWhat we don’t loveRelatively dim lightHatch Restore 2HatchRestore 2£222.82£222.82 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent sound libraryWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive£222.82 at AmazonBest for:customisation and smartphone connectivityIn some respects, this premium sunrise alarm clock has an edge over its competitors.

Some of the options – all of which are configurable with theHatch Sleepsmartphone app – are beautifully textured and more lifelike than anything I heard from competing products.The same Hatch Sleep app gives you access to additional audio content such as relaxing meditations and inspirational moments – but only if you’re willing to shell out £4.99 a month for aHatch+ subscription.

Sunrise alarm clocks tend to be far less bright than the average Sad lamp. With that said, the effect of light on our circadian rhythms has been shown to peak around the onset of dawn and early in the morning – so a mellow sunrise alarm may provide disproportionate benefits.If you’ve been diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder and are looking for a light therapy device, it’s best to ask your GP which product to use and how to get the most benefit. Sunrise alarm clocks that are classified as medical devices (indicated below each product above) are more likely to suit users seeking a therapeutic effect than models with no medical certifications.Why does it benefit us to wake with the sun?Getting up in the dark can feel awful, which makes a lot of sense because our bodies require light to wake up properly.Humans are diurnal, which means we’ve evolved to be more wakeful, energetic and capable of chasing mammoths over vast distances during daytime. When the brain recognises increasing light at dawn, it sends signals around other regions of the brain and to other organs to calibrate bodily processes including temperature regulation, hormone secretion and metabolism. And when darkness falls, the brain prepares us for sleep – a helpful effect that many of us compromise by looking at bright smartphone or laptop screens.These effects, which repeat every 24 hours, are our circadian rhythms. That is derived from the Latin wordscirca(approximately) anddiem(day), meaning around a day.So, the sun is the original and best alarm clock – activating our minds and bodies with light, rather than startling us awake with sound. Think of your sunrise alarm as a plucky stand-in to rely upon during the star’s shorter winter shifts.In the market for some new bed linen?

That was thereasonNicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leaderillegally abductedby US forces at the weekend, had given for Donald Trump’s fixation with his country. A better way to think about Venezuela is that oil was necessary but not sufficient. The presence ofvast reservesmade Mr Trump’s interest understandable – if Venezuela’s main export was bananas this would not have happened. But oil alone cannot explain the timing or scale of the move.Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy as well as expensive and slow to bring online; it will not immediately transform US energy systems, norrescuerefineries that have already adapted to years without it. Instead, oil is the “prize” around which otheragendas cohere. These include future profits for US firms; modest downward pressure on oil prices; depriving China of a meaningful ally in America’s backyard; putting pressure on Cuba; and US domestic political signalling in Florida. Each gain is small. But collectively Mr Trump could justify a high‑profile, theatrical – and unlawful – intervention even if the economic returns are incremental.Oil has been Venezuela’s curse as well as its blessing. Built on oil rentssince the 1920s, Venezuela’s booms overvalued its currency and made it import-dependent. A political pact in the 1960s that divided hydrocarbon spoils according to vote share amplified the damage, leaving Caracas dangerously exposed when oil prices collapsed in the early 1990s. That shockhasteneda failed coup led by a young military officer, Hugo Chávez. Six years later, Chávez was elected president, pledging to deploy oil wealth to reduce poverty and inequality.This year history looks like it is repeating itself. In 2002, theBushadministration covertly backed a business-ledcoupthat briefly toppled Chávez. The interim government dissolved democratic institutions and signalled a reversal ofstate-ledoil sector reforms. But mass protests saw Chávez’s return. The episode proved formative. It hardened the regime and entrenched an ideologicalstate machinery. This treated political opposition as an existential threat and used oil cash to develop patronage networks and secure military support.When oil pricescollapseda year after Chávez’s death in 2013, his Venezuela collapsed with them: dollars vanished; food and medicine became scarce; living standards tumbled.Eight million fled. Mr Maduro printed money to plug the gaps but, lacking productive capacity, the result was hyperinflation. Ad hoc fixes followed – andcorruptionflourished. The gap between Mr Maduro’s “man of the people” image and the rising wealth of insiders finished off the regime’s legitimacy. But removing Mr Maduro does not remove the system. Anyone outside Chavismo would inherit a state they do not control. Power still rests with Chavismo’s networks of fixers and generals. Small wonder, then, that Mr Trump left Mr Maduro’s deputy,Delcy Rodríguez, in charge.US sanctionsworsenedVenezuela’s slump, but lifting them alone will not restore growth: the industrial base has been hollowed out and skilled labour gone. IfUS oil majorstake a larger share of revenues, Caracas will be more cash-strapped than before. It is hard not to recall Iraq – not because Venezuela is Iraq, but because of how the decision was made. No single rationale was decisive about Caracas. Oil, drugs, ideological fixation and presidential ego all featured. Each was not enough on its own; together they saw Mr Trump make a high‑risk move with no clear endgame.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just don’t mention GreenlandJohn CraceIn an interview with Nick Robinson, the Tory leader made it clear she was thrilled to see the back of international law. May the best country win!Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.29 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 15.54 ESTShareThese weren’t exactly the words Kemi Badenoch had been hoping to hear. Halfway through her interview on the Today programme on Tuesday morning, the BBC presenter Nick Robinson observed that,in regard to the US coup in Venezuela, the Conservative leader’s position wasn’t that far off from Keir Starmer’s. You could sense the air go out of the room. In KemiWorld there is no greater dishonour than a likeness to the prime minister. Time for the fightback to begin. To create some distance.OK, Kemi said.Yes, she too drew the line at Greenland. That would be a step too far. There was no need for Donald Trump to claim the country for America. That was an action that could threaten Nato. And besides, as far as she knew, Greenland wasn’t a rogue narco state. She, too believed in a world of moral relativism. One where it was fine to invade countries whose regimes we disliked. There was one rule for the west and another for the rest.But as for Venezuela, she was all for the kidnap and imprisonment of Nicolás Maduro. Her only regret was that the UK hadn’t thought of doing it long ago. No one was mourning the demise of the dictator. Here was the thing. International law and the old rules-based order were just so last century. Margaret Thatcher might have voiced her disapproval of theAmerican invasion of Grenada in 1983, but were she alive today she would be all for the latest action in Venezuela.And just think of all the trouble Tony Blair had got himself in by inventing weapons of mass destruction. Just so that he could have a legal pretext for invading Iraq. These days, he would just have said: “C’mon guys. Let’s just get rid of Saddam Hussein and get our mitts on the oil.” And the rest of the world would have been grateful. Because that war worked out so well.More than anything, the American operation inVenezuelahad been the morally right thing to do. Kemi wasn’t too sure of the legal pretext, but there again she wasn’t much bothered. We now lived in a world where the strong and the powerful got to call all the shots. So why bother getting bogged down in all the legal niceties? Let’s just get stuck in. Instead of all this liberal hand-wringing about process, we should be lining up the next regimes we don’t like to depose them. Cut the time-wasting.That was the real difference between her and Starmer, Kemi said. Deep down, Keir was still a lawyer. Though he understood the rules-based order was all but dead and buried and that the US could get away with almost anything, he still mourned their loss. He thought the world had become a more dangerous, more anarchic place. One where the weak got crushed. But not Kemi. She was thrilled to see the back of international law. May the best country win. Or failing that, the strongest. Just leave Greenland alone. Greenland was different.“I don’t agree with a foreign policy of meetings and saying nice things to one another,” said Kemi. At which point,Nick Robinsonalmost fell off his chair before he remembered she had no chance of becoming the next prime minister. Just as well. Because it seems that Badenoch’s approach in international diplomacy is to go to war first and to ask questions afterwards. She doesn’t seem to realise that maintaining peace often also involves sitting around a table and trying to find common ground. I guess if she can’t help picking a fight with her friends, why should we expect her to be any different with her enemies?By now, Kemi was warming to her favourite subject. Why Starmer was so rubbish. If she had been prime minister, she would have been invited into The Donald’s war room, she suggested. Trump wouldn’t have dared make a move on Maduro without her say so. At some level, she genuinely believes this stuff. There again, she does have a problem with reality.This was too much for Robinson. He pointed out that no world leaders had been given the heads up by Trump and that in any case Starmer had not been wholly ineffectual. Like Kemi, he had decided to give The Donald a free pass on Venezuela because thecoalition of the willing needed US support on any peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine. So a degree of sycophancy was canny realpolitik. And in any case, Starmer had also negotiated tariff reductions. So not entirely useless.Kemi wouldn’t hear a word of this. She would have done much better than this. She couldn’t say quite how but we were expected to take her word on this. Right, said Robinson. So how many meetings have you had with Trump? “Er, none,” came the reply. Though she had spoken to him for 30 seconds at the state banquet and in that time he had apparently made it clear he thought she had a bright future. But hey, she had met Giorgia Meloni. Would that do? Nick tried to explain that it hadn’t been the Italian prime minister who had attacked Venezuela.The interview then switched to Brexit. How did Kemi think it was going? Apart from the fact that it was all going terribly and the UK was getting it all wrong, she would give it 10 out of 10. Because we had made it happen. That was all that really counted. People shouldn’t get too hung up about being much worse off than 10 years ago because that was a category error. The important thing was that it had been an exercise in sovereignty.Er, hello. She had spent the first 10 minutes of the interview saying that might was right and that other countries sovereignty was now up for grabs. And now she was claiming UK sovereignty as an inalienable right. It’s almost as if there is a missing connection in her synapse. That each sentence is subject to a memory wipe the moment she has moved on to the next one.We ended with Kemi insisting she had been a net zero sceptic for longer than Nigel Farage. Which was an out-and-out lie. Maybe Badenoch just wanted to start the year as she intended to go on. Constantly reshaping the truth to what she would like it to be. Which reminded her. Perhaps today would be the day that The Donald phoned her. She had given him her number at Windsor. And it was odd the president found the time to talk to any reporter in Washington and not her. After all, they had a possible invasion of Greenland to discuss.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchDonald TrumpNick RobinsonKeir StarmerVenezuelacommentShareReuse this content"

Can’t he take up a new hobby instead?Arwa MahdawiIt didn’t go very well for him last time, but the tech billionaire seems to have abandoned his plans for a third party and has renewed his bromance with the presidentTue 6 Jan 2026 09.47 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShare“You know, I’ve generally found that when I get involved in politics, it ends up badly,” Elon Musk mused on Nikhil Kamath’s podcastin November.Oh, we know, Elon, we most definitely know. The world is still reeling from the tech billionaire’s little experiment in politicking last year. Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) slashed federal jobs, dismantled foreign aid programmes and left atrail of chaosin its wake. It’s not clear whether any taxpayer money was saved, but experts are warning a lot of lives will be lost. By one calculation, there could beabout 14 million excess deathsacross the globe by 2030 if the US fails to restore aid funding. Thanks, Elon!Musk’s stint in politics didn’t just end badly for people reliant on US aid; his own brand took a beating. Last August, aGallup pollfound he was the most unpopular person in a list of global figures. He also had a highly publicisedfallout with Donald Trump last summer. As you may remember, Musk declared that he was going to start his own political party and Trump called his former “first buddy” a “TRAIN WRECK”. Musk also spent a lot of time trolling the president about the Epstein files. “Time to drop the really big bomb,” Muskposted on X in June, “@realdonaldtrump is in the Epstein files. That is why they have not been made public.”But that’s all ancient history. It would seem a lot of forgiving, forgetting anddeletingof inopportune social media posts has been done; now it’s time to brace ourselves for the Trump-Musk Bromance Part Two: Electric Boogaloo. Over the weekend Musk, who seems to have suddenly lost interest in the Epstein files, posted ablurry photoon X of him dining with Donald and Melania at Mar-a-Lago. They’d all had a “lovely dinner”, he gushed in the post, adding: “2026 is going to be amazing!” That dinner, by the way, took place shortly after the US captured the Venezuelan presidentNicolás Maduroand his wife. Was Musk in such high spirits because Trump was promising to invade Greenland next, and turn it into a Tesla factory? Or did the president tell Musk, who is obsessed with the UK, that he’d “liberatethe people of Britain” for him, as a little treat? I guess we’ll find out.Musk isn’t just breaking bread with Trump; he’s also giving the Republican party a lot of dough again. Axiosreportedin December that Musk had quietly been cutting big cheques for the midterms. On New Year’s Day, Musk seemingly made his renewed support public byrespondingto a post by a conservative influencer claiming Musk was “going all-in funding Republicans”. Musk appeared to confirm this with the statement: “America is toast if the radical left wins.” Looks like the billionaire has now abandoned his third party plans and is back on the Trump train.So who do we have to thank for two of the most awful men in the world joining forces again? Well, the ghost of Charlie Kirk for one. Before he was murdered, Kirktalkedabout how he was desperate to get Trump and Musk to reconcile. And his death seems to have achieved that: Kirk’s memorial in September brought the two men together for theirfirst public appearancesince the feud. Both Musk and the White House X accountpostedphotos of the pair sitting and chatting with the caption: “For Charlie.”JD Vance also played a role in getting the pair to kiss and make up. According to a Decemberreportby the Washington Post, Vance has been very busy brokering a truce and getting Musk to rethink his third party plans. The vice-president obviously has his own reasons for wanting to keep things cordial with the richest man in the world. Trump keeps insisting that his “health is perfect” and joking about a third term, but he’s not going to be around for ever. Musk’s unlimited funds played a large part in getting Trump back in the White House and you imagine Vance is keen to keep the money spigot on.Unfortunately, I don’t have billions of dollars I can use to get politicians to do my bidding. But I do have a wealth of unsolicited advice for Musk. Please sir, I’m begging you, can you take up a nice hobby? Or spend some quality time with your army of children, perhaps? Or get in one of your rockets and go for a very long ride in outer space? Just do something that isn’t meddling in the government! Because I have a feeling this new political act is going to end very badly for everyone.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpCharlie Kirk shootingJD VanceUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

US presidents promise isolation – and deliver warSimon JenkinsLast week’s events in Caracas come in a long line of American interventions. The White House has awesome power and is never shy of using itTue 6 Jan 2026 09.02 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.22 ESTShareIt is starting to trickle out. Last week in Caracas was not an invasion, it was a putsch. It was the militarised kidnap of one ruler to aid his more amenable deputy into power. Since April last year,according to reports, vice-president and now interim president Delcy Rodríguez and her brother Jorge – the president of the Venezuelan national assembly – have beendealing secretly with Washington. This has reportedly been via that hotspot of informal diplomacy, Qatar.We have yet to know the details. But the rumours are plausible that last week’s episode was staged to look outrageous, including Delcy Rodríguez’sinitial condemnationof it as atrocious. President Nicolás Maduro was handed over to the Americans swiftly and peacefully. The only slip was Trumpdescribing Delcyas “quite gracious” before she was hastily sworn into office soon after the raid. A more serious slip washis dismissalof the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, as lacking “the support within or the respect within the country”. She had championedEdmundo González Urrutia, probable winner ofthe rigged2024 Venezuelan election, for which she won the Nobel peace prize Trump so coveted. Why no mention of him from Trump?That the affair was an outrage against international law should of course be acknowledged. But the US has rarely paid that law much attention. The surprise is that there is so much surprise. One president after another has found the “manifest destiny” of the US, to proclaim and promote freedom wherever needed, more appealing. That the Caracas attack was also unconstitutional, in that Congress alone has the right to declare war, is supposedly covered by it being merely “law enforcement”.Keir Starmer is clearly hedging his bets by not jumping to conclusions. He has said next to nothing. When in 1983, Ronald Reagan similarly toppled a leftist regime in Venezuela’s near neighbour Grenada, Margaret Thatcher phoned him to protest furiously against the unprovoked attack on a Commonwealth state. Reagan took the call with his aides and switched her rant to speaker mode. He said with a smile:“Gee, isn’t she marvellous?”After last weekend’s operation, people quite reasonably seek clarity of events and motive, but the truth is that international interventions by powerful states are drenched in hypocrisy. Their true purpose may be commercial gain or domestic glory – or to aid an ally. Or it may be just to sound good. In his 1961 inaugural address, President John F Kennedypledgedthat the US would “pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty”. He then escalated conflict in Vietnam.All US presidents have started by obeying George Washington’s1796 appeal to isolationism, by swearing to stand aloof from distant conflicts, “the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns”. Thus Woodrow Wilson pledged he would not fight in the Great War and Franklin Roosevelt did likewise in the second world war. In 1940, FDRdeclared to America’s mothers: “I shall say it again and again and again, your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.” Just over one year later he did just that, as had Wilson.View image in fullscreenSalvaged busts of former US Presidents Lyndon Johnson (left) and George Washington, Williamsburg, Virginia, 25 August 2019.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe reality is that the global potency of the White House and the Pentagon establishment appears, in time, to become irresistible. It begs to be used. When the Soviet menace evaporated in the late 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev’s aide Georgi Arbatov, the Kremlin’s chief “Amerikanist”,commiserated with his US counterparts: “We are going to do a terrible thing to you,” he said. “We are going to deprive you of an enemy.”The US merely sought a new one, almost obsessively, and rarely with much concern for international law. When in 1990 George HW Bush kidnapped Panama’s president Manuel Noriegaas a drug lord, no one worried too much about the law. Nor did Britain, in 1999, in the clearly illegalbombing of Belgradeand the deployment of peacekeepersto Kosovo. When it joined in defeatingSaddam Hussein in 2003, the justification was that he threatened British national security. This was clearly absurd, yet parliament swallowed it. As for Britain’s helping topple the leaders of Afghanistan and Libya, it argued merely that they were bad people. Rich nations feel an obligation to come to the aid of oppressed ones, which is pretty much Trump’s narrative today.At least until now, Trump has adamantly held aloof from the world-policing rhetoric of his predecessors. He claimed to have learned the lessons of failed nation-building. Last year he announced that the US wasfed up with Natoand with defending Europe. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump was cheered for calling an end to lecturing the world on how to behave. As faras he was concerned, “The so-called ‘nation-builders’ wrecked far more nations than they built.”Last week’s coup reeked of a massive U-turn. Trump said he intended to run Venezuela “with a group” and “transition” it to stability. He appeared to assume that the putsch would work, as it initially did, and require no further US force projection. We can only wait to see.However, Trump’s policy wizard,Stephen Miller, apparently envisages nothing less than a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe doctrine. The original doctrine declared the US responsible for guarding all the Americas from European colonisation. An earlier corollary under Theodore RooseveltpledgedWashington would commit, “however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power”.Trump’s corollary would appear to be to use national security to justify the overwhelming of Greenland, possibly Cuba and even Canada. Miller’s wife has reportedly shared a map of Greenlanddressed in the stars and stripes. This would in effect be a United States empire of the Americas, and clearly madness.The nearest Trump could come to justifying his Venezuelan enterprise would be an early election and the return of democracy to what, for me, is atruly wonderful country. But, so far, Trump has not mentioned democracy. He is a very different president, but in some ways he is just the same as many predecessors who have revelled in the possibilities and deployment of US might. Another Iraq beckons – a quagmire or worse. He’ll probably find George Washington’s isolationist instincts were right.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist and the author ofA Short History of America: From Tea Party to TrumpExplore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaOpinionDonald TrumpVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasUS foreign policyTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

We shouldn’t be surprisedTue 6 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 16.17 ESTShareAs 2024 ended and Donald Trump’s cabinet picks were rolled out, commentatorsscrambled to decidewhich one was the worst. Was it Matt Gaetz for attorney general? Or Pete Hegseth, for secretary of defense? Or maybe Robert F Kennedy Jr to lead the Department of Health and Human Services?Soon after, theWhite House crowedthat Trump had assembled “the greatest cabinet of all time”.Gaetzdidn’t even make it to a confirmation hearing. But the others did, most narrowly squeaking through on party-line votes.The result was what commentatorslabelleda “clown car cabinet”. Otherspointed outthe utter absurdity of the president’s choices.As professor Warren Blumenfeldwrote last February, Trump chose “a man who spreads vaccine conspiracy theories to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, a woman who cozies up to vicious dictators like Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad to become director of national intelligence, an election denier and someone with an enemies list who intends to conduct a massive Stalinesque purge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to run the FBI, (and) a woman who is a professional wrestling magnate to serve as secretary of education even though Trump wants to abolish the Federal Department of Education”.He went on to say that the president had nominated “so many other utterly unqualified candidates for other offices that they should more fittingly fall into the category of disqualified”. Robert Reich, former secretary of labor in the Clinton administration,joined him, saying that the cabinet “is filled with bottom-feeders, frauds, fanatics, and fools”.Whatever label we choose to apply, they led the United States through a disastrous year.In terms of their “expertise, competence, experience, operational effectiveness, ethical standards, scandals … and the ability for cabinet members to challenge the president without repercussions”, itis already clear that Trump’s cabinet ranks as the worst in American history.So bad has his cabinet’s performance been that, with less than 12 months of service, many have faced calls to resign.Donald Trump poses a threat to civilization | Robert ReichRead moreTake Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. From the start of her service, sheseems to have focused as much on the perks of her officeas on her performance.For example, aftermoving intothe home of the former Coast Guard commandant, where she lives rent-free, her departmentspent more than $200m of government funds to buynot one but two luxurious private jets for her travel needs and those of her staff.And as Politicoreports, even some Trump loyalists “are frustrated with how she’s managed the agency” and “fear she’s bungled the billions of dollars in new funding her agency received this year from Republicans’ domestic policy and tax legislation”. They think she is “unserious”.To be called “unserious” in a clown car cabinet is a pretty serious accusation.During an appearance on 11 December before the House homeland security committee, Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democratic member,summarized what many people think: “Rather than you sitting here and wasting your time and ours with more corruption, lies and lawlessness, I call on you to resign … Do a real service to your country and just resign – that is, unless President Trump fires you first.”Noem is not the only member of the cabinet whose performance in office has drawn such condemnation, and not just from Democrats.Recently, the Republican congressman Don BaconcalledSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth an “amateur person” who has done great damage to the culture of the military in this country. He has driven out senior military leaders,accusing them without evidence of being “woke”.In addition, he has made a series of management blunders. As the Atlantic’s Tom Nicholsputs it: “The halls of the Pentagon are apparently strewn with rakes these days, and Hegseth has managed to step on almost all of them, including security blunders, needless fights with the press, and envious, unmanly whining about the medals on the uniform of Senator Mark Kelly, a veteran of higher rank and far greater achievement than Hegseth himself. Like Trump, Hegseth thinks his job is to get even with people he views as enemies.”Additionally, hehas overseena dangerous transformation of the military’s mission, enabling it to shift its focus to patrolling American cities. The warrior culture that Secretary Hegseth seeks to instil in the military does not belong in Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Washington DC or any other part of the country. Recall Trump’sremarks about wanting to use American citiesas a training ground for the military. And who can have confidence in Hegseth’s maturity and judgment after his expletive-spikeddescription of the lesson of the incursion in Venezuelaand capture of Nicolás Maduro? Maduro, he said “effed around and he found out” about “the long arm of American justice”.Then there is health secretary Robert F Kennedy, whohas led a rollback in funding for critical medical research, including work aimed at finding treatments and cures for the most serious diseases. Kennedy,breaking a promise he madeduring his confirmation hearings, has brought his anti-vaccine fervor to the department he leads, filling critical positions with people whose views of vaccines turn scientific understandings on their head.Hehas, as Elizabeth Jacobs and James Alwine wrote, “all but destroyed the CDC. Having dismantled its ability to track and report disease outbreaks, he’s now making it a megaphone for anti-vaccine disinformation.” As if that were not enough, Kennedy led the charge torevoke $11bn in public health fundingfor cities and counties.And showing his Hegseth-like management style, soon after taking office, heblamedthe 82,000 people who work in the Department of Health and Human Services for a decline in Americans’ health. But in truth, withmoves like Monday’s rollback ofrecommendations for childhood vaccination, it seems that RFK is determined to lead the way in endangering the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the United States, including its most vulnerable people.Finally, I would like to mention attorney general Pam Bondi. Working at the president’s direction, shehas transformed the Department of Justice into an instrument of his revenge.Recall her responsiveness to the president’s publicly expressedwish that she initiate prosecutions of his political opponents, including the former FBI director James Comey and New York state attorney general Letitia James. Within days of his Truth Social post, both were indicted, although the indictmentswere later dismissed.By the time the attorney general leaves office, the department she leadswill have been changedin ways that will render it less independent, less professional, and more susceptible to political pressure.I could say more, but that is enough to give a taste of the damage done by Trump’s cabinet this year. Other presidents have assembled cabinets that have also not served the American people well. But none compares to what Noem, Hegseth, Kennedy, Bondi and their colleagues have already done.Scholarspoint to the cabinetsof Presidents Warren Harding and Ulysses Grant as among the worst ever assembled. Until this year, they led the way in corruption, incompetence and disregard for the wellbeing of the American people.However, as the new year begins, those cabinets will have to make room for the group assembled by Trump. And we shouldn’t be surprised by its dismal performance. After all, Trump valued loyalty, not capability in his cabinet choices.In the past, Americans may have been tempted to dismiss the significance of the people whom the president picks for cabinet posts, but this year, we learned a hard lesson about the damage they could do. In 2026, Americans must demand that Congress hold them accountable for that damage and be vigilant in trying to get them to prioritize the interests of the people.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsPete HegsethRobert F Kennedy JrKristi NoemPam BondicommentShareReuse this content"

It is time to safely experimentTue 6 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.38 ESTShareTheworldiswarmingfast– and our options to avoidcatastrophic harmare narrowing. 2024wasthe first full year more than 1.5C hotter than the 19th-century average. Emissions are still rising, with fossil fuel use expected to hit a new high in 2025. Permanent carbon removal technologies – often cited as a fix – are removing just tens of thousands of tonnes annually, almost nothing relative to the 5-10bn tonnes needed. Cutting emissions and scaling carbon removal remain essential. But they may not be enough.As suffering grows and ecosystems unravel, more people will ask: is there anything we can do to prevent these harms? The idea of reflecting a small fraction of incoming sunlight to reduce warming is not a new idea. In 1965, Lyndon B Johnson’s science advisers proposed it as theonlyway to cool the planet. Earth already reflects about 30% of incoming sunlight; raising that fraction slightly – say, to 31% – could strengthen the planet’s natural heat shield. But how?In 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted andsentabout 15m tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, cooling the planet by about 0.5C. That eruption became a natural experiment, and inspired the idea of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). Models suggest SAI could offset 1C of warming with about 12m tonnes of SO₂ per year – far less than we emit now unintentionally from industrial processes, but with far greater cooling effect.The Guardian view on adapting to the climate crisis: it demands political honesty about extreme weather | EditorialRead moreLet’s be clear: SAI is no substitute for cutting emissions. If deployed and then suddenly halted, the planet will experience rapid rebound warming. Poorly designed or uncoordinated interventions could shift precipitation patterns in catastrophic ways. But that’s exactly why research is needed – not to green-light deployment, but to understand whether SAI could ever be used safely, effectively and in the public interest.Some argue that the risks of misuse mean it shouldn’t even be studied. We disagree. Careful, open research can clarify whether a well-governed approach could reduce harm, particularly for the most vulnerable. It can also surface risks and failure modes early, making reckless proposals less likely to gain traction. In this sense, research acts as a guardrail – not a slippery slope.But how can we know if something is safe or too risky? We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Medicine solved the “too risky to test” dilemma 60 years ago by codifying phased clinical trials. A similarly structured, stage-gated programme for SAI can safely provide the evidence policymakers will eventually require.Right now we’re stuck in “pre-clinical”, or phase zero: lab work and computer models. These are great tools – they have helped correctly predict the risks of rising emissions – but we cannot build confidence in their predictions without verifying that they correctly capture key processes for SAI. How do aerosols form, evolve and disperse in the stratosphere? How do they interact with the environment? These are key factors to any robust assessment. What would similar phases as a clinical trial look like for SAI?Phase one would involve releasing a tiny amount of SO₂ – approximately 10 tonnes of SO₂ (a fraction of what many coal power plants emit in a day) – at the proper altitudes and carefully measuring its evolution using a suite of instruments: aircraft, ground-based and satellite. This amount would be far too small to affect the climate but would allow researchers to study how aerosols form and behave – still among the largest scientific uncertainties in the field. Comparing those observations to model predictions would offer an early test of key assumptions and help identify where current projections are robust – and where they need refinement.A potential phase two experiment could be 10 or 100 times larger – still orders of magnitude smaller than a “small” volcanic eruption like Mount Ruang, whichinjectedabout 300,000 tonnes all at once in 2024 and still hadno measurable impact on global climate.This would allow researchers to study how aerosols mix and distribute. How quickly do particles spread? How do they interact with stratospheric circulation? Are our models capturing that correctly? If not, what are we missing? Are we observing something totally unexpected? The observational capabilities required for these tests would also be critical to detect an unauthorized deployment.After researchers worldwide had the opportunity to peruse the data and draw their own conclusions, the evidence could be put to a decision: are governments interested to move forward with something that starts looking like a deployment? If yes, research would move into a phase three – akin to a post-licensure, phase four trial in medicine – involving small, deliberate cooling, perhaps about 0.1C over five years under constant observation and strict oversight. Such slow (and reversible) deployment, if coupled to a strong governance framework, would be the opposite of a rogue or reckless deployment.A polycrisis has shattered our world this year. But with care, we can put it back together | Elif ShafakRead moreThe world may never need to reflect sunlight. But if it does, the only way to make a future responsible decision about its use will be to generate real-world evidence, transparently,beforea crisis forces our hand. That means building the tools, rules and oversight mechanisms now, not later.We see the UK’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria)programas a strong first step in that direction. At the lab that one of us runs, a new Aria-funded project is developing the theoretical foundations to determine theminimumscale at which an outdoor experiment could meaningfully reduce key uncertainties – essential groundwork for any future research to be done safely and transparently. And at Reflective, the organization that one of us leads, we’re working to support open science, careful coordination and strong public accountability across the field.Outdoor research is not a slippery slope to deployment. It’s how we make sure that any future decision – whether to move forward, reject the idea entirely or refine it – is based on facts, not fear or wishful thinking. Done right, small-scale experiments can reduce both scientific uncertainties and political risks. The real danger isn’t asking the question. It’s waiting too long to learn the answer.Dakota Gruener, is the CEO of Reflective, a non-profit climate initiative accelerating the pace of sunlight reflection and Dr Daniele Visioni, is an assistant professor, Earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell UniversityExplore more on these topicsGeoengineeringIt's time to talk about geoengineeringClimate crisisClimate sciencecommentShareReuse this content"

That’s a tragedyMargaret SullivanIncreasingly, teens are given only parts of books, and they often read not in print but on school-issued laptopsTue 6 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.30 ESTShareReading fiction has been such a joy for me that my heart broke a little to learn recently that many schools no longer assign full books to high school students.Rather, teens are given excerpts of books, and they often read them not in print but on school-issued laptops, according to asurveyof 2,000 teachers, students and parents by the New York Times.The reasons are many – including the belief that students have shorter attention spans, and schools’ efforts to teach students to perform well on standardized tests.One factor is the Common Core, a set of standards adopted by many states in the US more than a decade ago. Given those standards, many schools use curriculum products like StudySync, which uses an anthology approach to introducing students to literature.The upshot is that many teens read far fewer full novels than in the past, teachers acknowledge. Some teachers, however, choose to rebel.“Many teachers are secret revolutionaries and still assign whole books,” said Heather McGuire, a survey respondent who teaches English in New Mexico.I cheer these renegades because I can’t imagine my life – or bringing up my own children – without reading books in print.One of my most cherished memories as a parent is taking my seven-year-old daughter to pick up our family’s copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire from a local bookstore the first day it came out. In the car, she had the hefty volume on her tiny lap and had begun racing through it.Books lead to a richer life. They also lead to a more successful lifeWhen we got home, her older brother – not entirely charitably – seized it from her hands, and I realized it might have been wise to invest in two copies. Somehow, we worked it out. But if kids must fight, let them fight over a book, I say.These days, my grown children still read for pleasure. I recently noticed one with Nora Ephron’s classic, Heartburn, and another reading Ian McEwan’s latest, What We Can Know.Of course, there’s nothing stopping today’s school kids from reading on their own, especially by taking advantage of school libraries or public libraries.But not every kid has been brought up with reading fiction as a part of everyday life. They might need that school assignment – perhaps of Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 or John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars or William Golding’s Lord of the Flies – to help them realize how rewarding reading a novel can be. Yes, start to finish.Put a copy of Claire Keegan’s haunting novella, Foster, in a teenager’s hands – it’s only 130 pages long – and concerns about atrophied attention spans might fade. (Foster was one of the books recommended in this intriguing Guardianarticleabout which books authors consistently give as gifts.)Then that teen might want to move on to something else by Keegan, or by another Irish author, or make some other connection.That’s how it works with loving books. One leads to another, making a daisy chain of interest, learning and enjoyment.I love that feeling of wanting to get back to my book, which I felt most recently with Stephen Becker’s Covenant With Death, a literary courtroom thriller published in 1964, which in turn followed my immersion in Lily King’s new novel, Heart the Lover.For me, it never ends, and I hope it never does.Books lead to a richer life. They also lead to a more successful life, as atwo-decade-long studyshowed. Kids who lived with books in their home – as few as 20 – benefitted significantly over those who didn’t, in areas like academic success, vocabulary development and job attainment.There’s something about having the actual physical book in one’s hands that I’m convinced makes a difference. That’s one reason that those measly book excerpts, read on a school-issued laptop, seem so terribly sad to me.There are charitable programs all over the country, including Reading Is Fundamental, that help to put printed books in the hands of children, and begin the formation of those all-important home libraries.If schools won’t do it – or believe they can’t – book lovers everywhere may need to step in.

But that’s not all.They threaten what we mean by civilization.The moral purpose of civilized society is to prevent the stronger from attacking and exploiting the weaker. Otherwise, we’d be permanently immersed in a brutish war in which only the fittest and most powerful could survive.This principle lies at the center of America’s founding documents – the Declaration of Independence, the constitution and the Bill of Rights. It’s also the core of the postwar international order championed by the United States, including the UN charter – emphasizing multilateralism, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.But it’s a fragile principle, easily violated by those who would exploit their power. Maintaining the principle requires that the powerful have enough integrity to abstain from seeking short-term wins, and that the rest of us hold them accountable if they don’t.Every time people or corporations or countries that are richer and more powerful attack and exploit those that are not, the fabric of civilization frays. If such aggression is not contained, the fabric unravels. If not stopped, the world can descend into chaos and war. It has happened before.Unfettered might does not make right. It makes for instability, upheaval, and warWe now inhabit a society and world grown vastly more unequal. Political and economic power are more concentrated than ever before. This invites the powerful to exploit the weaker because the powerful feel omnipotent.The wealth of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Charles Koch, and a handful of others is almost beyond comprehension. The influence of big tech, big oil, and the largest aerospace and defense corporations extends over much of the globe. AI is likely to centralize wealth and power even more. The destructive power of the United States, China and Russia is unmatched in human history.Trump – enabled by cowardly congressional Republicans and a pliant majority on the supreme court – has turned the US presidency into the most powerful and unaccountable agent of American government in history.Put it all together and you see the threat.A direct line connects Trump’s attempted coup five years ago to his capture of Nicolás Maduro last weekend. Both were lawless. Both were premised on the hubris of omnipotence.That same line connects to Trump’s current threats against Cuba, Colombia, and Greenland.You see much the same in Putin’s war on Ukraine. In Xi’s threats against Taiwan. In global depredation and monopolization by big tech and big oil. In Russian, Chinese, and American oligarchs who have fused public power with their personal wealth.But unfettered might does not make right. It makes for instability, upheaval, and war.History shows that laws and norms designed to constrain the powerful also protect them. Without such constraints, their insatiable demands for more power and wealth eventually bring them down – along with their corporations, nations, or empires. And threaten world war.Trump’s blatant lawlessness will haunt America and the world – and civilization – for years to come.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

My four-year-old is singing at the top of her lungs and charging around my parents’ house on a hunt for the perfect crayon. There is nothing particularly unusual about this scene except for the fact that the crayon in question was forGreta Thunberg. The world’s most well-known activist needed a writing tool and my daughter, O, was on the case. (Remember this crayon: it’s going to be important later on.)O, I should note, had absolutely no idea who Greta was. We’re not longtime chums or anything like that. Rather Greta was in London to support the Palestine Action-linkedhunger strikers. She needed somewhere to stay and my dad, who is a Palestinian refugee, and appreciative of anyone speaking up about the place where he was born but can’treturnto live in, keeps an open house for activists who need a bed or a meal. When the visit had been hastily arranged by a friend of a friend of my sister a couple days earlier, we’d tried to explain to O that Greta was a famous activist who tried to help people and the environment.“Does famous mean beautiful?” my princess-obsessed child asked. Oh dear, I thought, I have failed as a parent and a feminist.“No, it doesn’t. And remember being beautiful is not important – what’s important is being kind,” I said, trying to redeem some feminist points.“How dare you!” O replied. This has been her favourite catchphrase for a while now. I have no idea where she picked it up; probably from a kid’s show. I had thought nothing of it until the surprise Greta visit.“Please don’t say that while Greta is here,” I told O. I didn’t want her to think we were making fun of hermemorable rebuke. But once again, I failed at parenting: everyone knows that the best way to get a kid to keep doing something is to suggest they stop doing it.While Greta may be famous, the hunger strikers she was coming to support are definitely not; they have had very little mainstream media attention. Indeed, if you are reading this in the US, you may not have heard about them at all. So, in brief, eight activists awaiting trials for alleged offences relating toPalestine Actionhave been on hunger strike since 2 November, the anniversary of theBalfour declaration.This is where things get tricky: I’m not sure what I’m allowed to say about Palestine Action in this column without getting chucked in jail myself. Last July, you see, the British government took the extraordinary, and hugelycriticized, step of terming the group a terrorist organization on thesame levelas the Islamic State militant group. This is despite the fact that Palestine Action has killed nobody; its efforts are focused on trying to shut down weapons manufacturers enabling the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Even the government’s own intelligence assessment, a declassified version of which wasobtained by the New York Times, undercut its condemnations of the group, finding that most of their activities “would not be classified as terrorism” under Britain’s legal definition. Still, the British government has been very busy arrestingthousands– many of whom are elderly activists – for the “crime” of peacefully holding up a sign saying: “I support Palestine Action.”I’m also not sure what I am allowed to say about the Palestine Action activists who are in jail –many of whomare being held on remand over alleged criminal damage at an arms factory. Last time I tried to write about the Palestine Action prisoners, in acolumnabout how the UK has a free speech problem, a lot of detail was edited out because of legal sensitivities.I think the British government will allow me to say that the hunger strikers are now on thebrinkof irreversible damage and death. And I think I can safely say that they are striking, in part, because of theexcessivelypunitive conditions in which they are being held and to bringattentionto Elbit Systems, the Israel-based weapons manufacturer with several UK factories.Back to my famous houseguest now. I’d vaguely thought that Greta might turn up with some sort of security person in tow. She is, after all, a small woman who inspires extraordinary amounts of anger from some powerful people. Donald Trump hascalled her“crazy”; Dave Portnoy, the influential founder of Barstool Sports, has called for her to bebombed. US SenatorLindsey Grahamsimilarly suggested Israel should destroy the flotilla that Greta was on. But despite being highly recognizable and irrationally hated by many, Greta takes public transport everywhere with seemingly little regard for her safety. She took the train to my parents’ house carrying a backpack bigger than her body. Though it seems she hadn’t found space in the bag for a crayon.Once O had offered a selection of crayons and a piece of paper, Greta went off to make a sign. But not before my daughter had decided to scream “HOW DARE YOU!” at the top of her lungs. Luckily, Greta found this amusing.If you’ve been reading the news lately, you may have an inkling of what happened next. Greta wrote a sign saying “I support Palestine Action prisoners” and gotarrested. My daughter ended up seeing the video of this arrest and, let me tell you, trying to explain government overreach and the weaponization of anti-terror laws to a four-year-old is not the easiest task.“The thing is,” I told O, “the police didn’t like the words that Greta had written on the sign.” My daughter couldn’t quite get her head around this. She’s watched a lot of Paw Patrol, which is basically copaganda: a cutesy canine glorification of the police state. In her eyes, the police are always the good guys and only bad people go to jail. Now, however, the police were arresting the young woman who had been eating crumpets with her earlier that morning and she was very confused. As the video clearly shows, Greta was sitting very quietly doing absolutely nothing except holding a sign.“Did the police not like the crayon she used?” O asked. “Oh, of course not, sweetie,” we reassured her. “The crayon was perfect. And you can’t get in trouble for using a crayon.” Although as soon as I said that, I wasn’t sure if that bit was actually accurate. Was supplying a crayon to someone writing a sign in support of hunger strikers associated withPalestine Actionan offence in the UK now?There are an awful lot of people in the UK looking at horror as the US marches towards authoritarianism. And that horror is entirely justified; but Britons must pay closer attention to the horrors unfurling at home.I’m back in the US now and I can’t quite fathom what Britain, under the leadership of a former human rights lawyer, has become. A place where you can get arrested simply for holding a sign supporting an organization whose main purpose is targeting weapons companies. A place wherefreedom of speechand the right topeacefully protestis under sustained attack. A place where the government hasdone nothingmeaningful to respond to sustained warnings of complicity in genocide but works overtime to lock up people protesting that genocide. A place where it looks very likely that a protestermight soonstarve to death and it will make absolutely no difference to the ghouls in charge.As Greta (and my daughter) might say, how dare you, Sir Keir Starmer.

The communities that survive disasters aren’t the ones with the best emergency services. They’re the ones that have built resilience before crisis strikes.I know this from experience. My village of Cobargo on the New South Wales south coast was devastated during the black summer fires six years ago. Recently, at the SXSW conference in Sydney, I swapped experiences with Tim Cadogan, a first responder and the CEO of GoFundMe, wholost most of his home townof Altadena, California in the Los Angeles wildfires in January last year. Though thousands of miles apart, we are learning that strong recovery needs a level of community connectedness established long before crisis strikes.Here in Cobargo, we’re in preparation mode again. Hoses are rolled out. Fire pumps have been tested. Water tanks are filling. Go bags are packed and by the door. We’ve reviewed our evacuation plan with neighbours, charged batteries and prepped our 2-way radios that allow us to communicate when the network goes out. This is our rhythm now, the practical work of getting ready.Outskirts of Australian cities at risk of catastrophic fires on scale of deadly LA blazes, study findsRead moreBut these individual preparations only work because of what we have built together as a community after black summer. And this is the paradox of disaster preparedness that nobody talks about: you can’t build community resilience during a crisis. You can only activate what’s already there.The prevailing narrative around disaster preparedness focuses on individual action: stockpile water, have an evacuation plan, clear your gutters. These matter. But they’re not what determines whether a community survives intact or fractures under pressure.In Cobargo, what saved us wasn’t just physical infrastructure – it was social infrastructure. The links with our neighbours, the folk festival we’d been running for years with networks spanning the region. The cricket club, the Show Society, the P&C associations, the rural fire brigade, the surf lifesaving club – community organisations that provided the connective tissue that held us together when everything else was being torn apart.The hard truth is that climate change is making extreme weather more frequent and severe. And if you think this is only a problem for remote rural communities, look again.Altadena isn’t a remote village. It’s part of greater Los Angeles, home to 42,000 people on the urban fringe. The January 2025 fires didn’t respect the boundary between bush and suburb. They consumed neighbourhoods just minutes from major urban centres,destroying 13,000 homesin communities that many residents assumed were safely removed from wildfire risk.From flooding in Brisbane’s inner suburbs to heatwaves in western Sydney and storm surges in coastal regions,climate disasters are increasingly urban threats. Yet urban and suburban communities often lack the very attributes that help remote areas survive: strong social infrastructure. In cities, we’re surrounded by people but don’t always know our neighbours. We have more services but often less community cohesion. This makes us more vulnerable, not less, when disaster strikes.View image in fullscreen‘Community resilience can’t be imposed from above. It grows from the ground up’ … Zena Armstrong on her property outside Cobargo.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianReal preparedness is indeed about clearing gutters, having an evacuation plan, passport and birth certificates in hand, and enough bottled water. But it is also about having neighbours you can call at 2am. It’s about local organisations with the trust and capacity to support emergency response, coordinate immediate relief and manage long-haul recovery. It’s about communities that have longstanding habits of shared decision-making before those decisions become life-or-death.After black summer, Cobargo made a deliberate choice. Rather than just rebuild what was lost, we invested in strengthening the connections that would help us withstand the next crisis. We funded projects that brought people together. We created systems for collective decision-making. We have built networks of neighbours at the fire edge who prep together.We are investing in town-scale resilience. We have installed solar and battery power systems on our community buildings so they can operate when the grid goes down. We want to build a village microgrid that can maintain power, even in the event of a prolonged grid outage as happened in 2019. The 210,000-litre water storage tanks we purchased for our rural fire brigade are about ensuring our community has the resources to protect itself. When the fires came in 2019, we had no power or water. We won’t make that mistake again.Governments play a crucial role in providing support at scale, whether it be physical infrastructure, emergency services or institutional support. But policy must recognise that community resilience can’t be imposed from above. It grows from the ground up, through the steady, unseen work of neighbours helping neighbours, local organisations building capacity, and communities practising solidarity in ordinary times so it’s there in extraordinary ones.As we face down the threat of bushfires once again, some communities will emerge stronger because they invested in themselves before any crisis struck. This is true whether you’re in a small town or a sprawling suburb. The principles of community resilience don’t change based on population density.The next disaster is coming. The question is: will your community be ready? Not because you have the right supplies, but because you have the right connections. Not because you have a plan, but because you have one another.Start building that now. Before the next catastrophic fire day. Before the next flood warning. Before it’s too late.Zena Armstrong is a Cobargo resident, director of the Cobargo folk festival and founding member of the Cobargo Community Bushfire Recovery FundExplore more on these topicsBushfiresOpinionRural and regional AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

Grok, X’s AI chatbot, has been used repeatedly by usersin recent daysto undress images of women and minors. The news outlet Reuters identified 102 requests in a 10-minute period last Friday from users to get Grok to edit people into bikinis, the majority of these targeting young women. Grok complied with at least 21 of them.There is no excuse for releasing exploitative tools on the internet when you are sitting on$10bn (£7.5bn) in cash. Every platform with AI integration (which now covers almost the entire internet) is planning for the same challenges; if you want to enable users to create images and even videos with generative AI, how do you do so without letting the same people cause harm? Tech companies spend money behind the scenes that you’ll never see as a user to wrestle with this; they’ll do “red teaming”, in which they pretend to be bad actors in order to test their products. They’ll launch beta tests to probe and review features within trusted environments.With every iteration, they’ll bring in safeguards, not only to keep users safe and comply with the law, but to appease investors who don’t want to be associated with online malfeasance. But from the start, Elon Musk didn’t seem to act as if he thought digital stripping was a problem. It’s Musk’s prerogative if he feels that someone turning a Ben Affleck smoking meme into an image of Musk half-nakedis “perfect”. That doesn’t stop the sharing of non-consensual AI deepfakes from being illegal in many jurisdictions,including the UK, where offenders can be charged for sharing these images, or the creation of sexual images of children.One useful thing Grok has done this week is reveal how it has been programmed. When a user interrogated it as to why it had manipulated an image of the Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, so that she appeared in a bikini, itargued that it was satirebecause she had been speaking about a burqa ban. It went on to insist that itwasn’t a deepfake of a real photo,but an AI-generated illustration (wrong), and added that it aims to balance fun with ethics, “avoiding real harm while responding creatively” to requests.For someone who supposedly values humour, it is strange that Musk has tried to furnish a chatbot with it. Chatbots are misnamed in that they actually have no idea of how to speak – they generate text by predicting what is most likely to come next, using statistical patterns and data training as opposed to genuine insight. Grok’s excuses show its parameters for safety or for sticking to the facts have not been robustly tested; it has been programmed for entertainment.As the week has developed, Musk appears to have found the joke less funny himself. “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,”Musk threatened on 3 Januarywith what came across as all the gravitas of a garlic dough ball. Between 2023 and 2024, X dramatically reduced trust and safety staffing, and is over-reliant on user reporting. This means that many bad actors can still get away with illegal behaviour on the platform.Rather than acknowledge that X could help deal with the problem itself, Musk has lumped the responsibility of investigation on law enforcement and the blame on X’s users. Ofcom, as well as the European Commission, may well throw the book back at him if they investigate and find X’s policies lacking – but even then, Musk may well evade accountability, as currently appears to be the case with the€120m fine issued to Xover its blue tick badges.View image in fullscreenAI-generated image of Elon Musk in a bikini created by Musk using Grok and posted on X @elonmuskIllustration: @elonmuskOther AI agent tools such as ChatGPT and Meta AI prohibit non-consensual deepfake pornography and appear to enforce this, which raises the question: why can’t Grok? How the world chooses to police the platform for so flagrantly allowing crimes to be committed on it will prove once and for all whether figures such as Musk can operate with impunity. I am interested in seeing how the political right, who have enjoyedX bending in their directionsince Musk’s takeover, will react to this. Protecting women and children is a core tenet of conservative values, and rightwing voices in the US now face a moral test. In the coming weeks, we’re going to see if they are still willing to defend a US company in the name of free speech, even when it allows people to createsexualised content of children.From my vantage point as a former daily user,Xhas long felt inhospitable – and this week’s events are the latest in a line of digital abominations that remind me it was a good decision to move my output elsewhere. But an active, hostile environment normalising this behaviour still hurts us, regardless of whether we’re there or not, as these images will spread around the internet. The damage – the assault – marks us whether we’re still X users or not.Someone has to do something – and if international governments can’t motivate X to change, then maybe some of its investors can.xAI is burning through billionsfor its AI development, and will be guzzling data by allowing its users to generate images willy- nilly; respecting various international laws wouldn’t only be, er, more legal – but it’d be cheaper, too.Grok’s purpose is to maximise “truth and objectivity”, according to its own website, but today as I scroll its cesspit, all I’ve seen it maximise are a Swedish politician’s “knockers” at the request of an anonymous user. News reporting is now also charting a slew of manipulated bikini images of 14-year-olds. “We report suspected child sexual abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,” xAI’s acceptable use policy claims.

Now I’m in love with my midlife situationshipNatasha GinnivanBored, lonely and emerging from lockdown, a less-traditional relationship was just what I was looking forTue 6 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 16.11 ESTShareWe were just two midlifers in our 50s who met back in 2020 using a popular dating app. Bored, lonely and emerging from lockdown we jumped at the chance for an outing. We had our first date at a trendy, dimly-lit Japanese restaurant and bar in Sydney’s Surry Hills. By our second lychee martini, we became aware of some mutual connections that we knew and discovered that we had actually grown up in the same place.There was an immediate feeling of familiarity and a shared sense of humour that clicked without effort. We were in no rush for anything too serious. In fact, it would take another five outings, including antique-trawling for some 70s-inspired crockery, before things would develop into more of a romantic connection.You could say we’ve been dating ever since but, in modern parlance, I’m inclined to call it more of a “situationship” than a full-blown relationship because it’s not an “all-in” arrangement. I don’t think that is too uncommon these days – partnership norms have shifted over the past decade and some reports suggest that there’s even some kind ofrelationship recessionout there.Caroline felt she was doomed to dating failure. Learning to sit with sadness was part of overcoming her loneliness | Ahona GuhaRead moreThe Oxford dictionary now describes asituationshipas a romantic relationship in which the couple are not official partners. An example provided with this definition is “I’m trying to turn our situationship into something more serious”.I can identify with the definition part but not so much with the example part.This well-used term is usually associated with non-commitment and can mean different things to different generations. The word,situationship, has been on the rise since the early noughties to denote insecurity in a connection. However, I think the reason this label is a fit forourarrangement is that despite being “committed partners” we run separate households and keep our finances separate.I have my place in the mountains and he has his in the city. If there were a metaphor to describe a vehicle for riding through life, ours might be a vintage motorbike with a sidecar rather than a couple’s convertible or the winnebago of a family unit.We take trips and vacations together, however we also have individual holidays interstate or overseas. I am not particularly concerned when he announces that he’s got a few weeks’ leave and would like to travel somewhere on his own – I’m usually busy with weekendmarketsanyway, or a line up ofblogarticles to write in my downtime.We do Christmas celebrations separately but come back together for New Year’s Eve, birthdays and for beach holidays with games nights during the break.I concluded early on in our relationship that we would probably always be more like “committed companions” than a full-blown relationship of interdependence. Perhaps the plastic tub I keep my clothes in at his place was the best clue. At a younger age this may have sent me into a spiral of insecurity, however, at this stage of life, my attitude is more like meh – whatever works.It could just be a stage-of-life thing and, without drawing excessively on the psychoanalytics of it,attachment theoryalso probably has something to do with it. In addition, we both come from large families that we can fall back on for support in challenging times, which probably buoys the relationship in immeasurable ways.In terms of marriage, I’ve been there, done that, got the T-shirt. I was 24 the first time I tied the knot and 28 the second time. At about 40, with two kids, I became single again and was just nudging the “grey divorce” age bracket.This is how we do it: ‘After 50 years together, I’m more orgasmic than ever’Read moreExperts claim that thegrey divorcephenomenon is not a spike but a shift as women think, “if not now then when?”Menopause can alsoreframethe kind of relationship that works best for women. As relationship expertEsther Perelsays, “most of us will have two or three marriages/ committed relationships in our lifetime – some of us will have them with the same person”.A younger me may have dreamt of the ever-after of a long-term relationship with only one partner. However, the older I get, the more philosophical I become and I can see how relationships – failures and successes – have the power to transform us.Maybe there is something to be said for living apart but together as a couple.My current relationship, although less traditional, is probably the longest surviving one since my two marriages. Who knows, one day we might trade the motorbike and sidecar for the couple’s convertible or Winnebago and hit that open road of life together. Though, at the risk of sounding terribly Zen about it, until then I’m at peace with staying in the question.Natasha Ginnivan is a researcher of psychology and ageing.

Here’s how we surviveRobyn VinterUniversity undergraduates are forming northern societies, but in other circumstances we find different ways to be ourselvesTue 6 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 08.31 ESTShareOf course they weren’t being mean, but each time my university friends jokingly echoed my Leeds-accented “no” with a noise that is perhaps best approximated as “nerhhh”, I found myself undergoing elocution conditioning. Within a year, the identifying characteristics of my accent had gone, replaced with a sort of unplaceable, vaguely northern voice. It didn’t matter that we were at university inLeeds, my home city, where most of the population had a stronger accent than me; it was novel – and apparently amusing – to those who had come from the south.It’s now a familiar scenario. With an increasingnorth-south dividein university admissions, campuses in the north are teeming with southerners. That may be inevitable under the circumstances, but it can leave students from the surrounding areas feeling out of place only a few miles from where they grew up.It’s a feeling that York University’s northern students know even better than I do, and undergrads there have found a solution inresurrecting the university’s Northern Society, a club where northern students can feel at home. To some people that might seem an overzealous remedy to a problem that doesn’t really exist. But those who have experienced this subtle cultural discohesion will understand the desire to cling on to our identity and our roots. It’s far from easy being a northerner in spaces and places where the default identity is southern. Still, we survive.In ways many and varied. When I moved to London after university, I found myself further eradicating traces of the broad vowels my family and friends at home all had. I felt a need to blend in, to not stand out. A lot of this was subconscious, driven probably by various mean comments I had encountered during my lifetime, whether directed at me or not. Sometimes, the slights were indirect: hearing people put on a northern accent, for example, to do an impression of someone stupid or unsophisticated. Other times they were very direct, like all the comments about how “racist northerners” caused Brexit.View image in fullscreenMembers of the University of York’s Northern Society, 12 December 2025.Photograph: Colin McPherson/The GuardianI learned to smile while tolerating the complete absence of knowledge displayed by many southerners about anything outside the home counties. I learned to be rueful, or perhaps to swallow hard, as the discussion turned to politics and I encountered a grossly unfair and incredibly frustrating narrative about bigotry in the north. The fact is that the north is progressive and votes Labour in huge numbers at every election. For all the talk of the “red wall”, if we had been independent, there would have been no coalition government in 2010, no David Cameron, no Theresa May, no Boris Johnson, no Liz Truss, no Rishi Sunak. Say that again: no Boris Johnson, no Rishi Sunak.My home constituency at the last election was majority Labour, with the Greens in second and the Lib Dems third. Of course, there wereasylum protestsand mindless flag wavers in the north, but they were absolutely everywhere, including London,and notably Epping.‘Oh my gosh, they’re all from London and Cambridge’: York University’s northerners fight backRead moreThere is a danger we all recognise that the very act of proudly holding on to a northern identity is used against you: that you are dubbed a “professional northerner”. Southerners tend to do this. The so-called professional northerner mostly exists in the minds of southerners – and in spaces dominated by them. They are seen as old-fashioned, colloquial creatures, aggrandising of the north and fond of spouting deliberately obscure references that even other northerners don’t always get.Of course, the risk exists. There is a fine line between pride in the environment that made you and a sort of fetishisation of your authentic northern background (which can become more of a caricature the longer someone is out of the north). It can be easy to occasionally slip on to the wrong side of that line, especially in situations where you are feeling anxious about not fitting in, perhaps fearing judgment or outright dismissal. It can feel like the best way of surviving – getting ahead of the jokes and taking control back from the assumptions. But that is survival at a heavy cost.It is hard to pinpoint the northern culture we hold so dear: after all, we’re talking about arguably the most diverse part of the UK, home tomore than 15 million people– including all the southerners who have drifted up – but I think it’s fair to say there are characteristics that are not exclusive to but exemplify the north, such as openness, kindness, bluntness and good humour.When I think of the times I’ve laughed so hard I’ve been bent over double, clutching my sides in agony, a northerner has almost always been responsible. That is something worth holding on to – and I do.Robyn Vinter is north of England correspondent at the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Should we stop trying to make men more like women?Gaby HinsliffThe strong and silent masculine image is often derided, but why? Perhaps companionship via trains, golf or a quiet drink is enoughTue 6 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 07.18 ESTShareIt’s good to talk. Or so men are always being told, by everyone from mental health campaigners to the women they live with, bemused by the male tendency to spend all night in the pub with friends they have known for decades and yet come back utterly clueless about whatever is going on in each other’s lives. What can they bedoing, all that time? Why haven’t they asked how X feels about splitting up with his girlfriend, or how Y is coping with his father dying?To women whose own friendships revolve around an intimate and encyclopaedic knowledge of each other’s innermost feelings, intimacy based on never seemingly talking about anything that matters looks oddly empty and sad. No wonder, we think to ourselves, thatmore than a quarter of British mensay they have no close friends at all; that male loneliness is endemic, that they won’t go to the doctor until they are practically dying, thatmale suicide rates are higherthan female ones, that too many middle-aged men in particular seem to feel permanently angry for reasons they can’t articulate even to themselves. Bottling everything up does nobody any good.Yet according to theanthropologist Thomas Yarrow, that may be doing the merits of the strong and silent friendship an injustice. Prof Yarrow, who teaches at the University of Durham, wasvisiting a group of volunteersat a heritage steam railway in northern England as part of his research into nostalgia when he was struck by the closeness built up between these mostly older men. The four years he spent observing them have now been distilled into a study entitled “Rethinking male friendship and the value of personal reticence”, arguing that particularly for men raised in the era of the stiff upper lip,the value of friendshipsthat revolve simply around shared hobbies – “doing things together, often in companionable silence” – may be underrated.View image in fullscreenVolunteer railway staff waiting for the next train, North Yorkshire Moors Railway, Pickering, Yorkshire.Photograph: Robin Weaver/AlamyAdmittedly, that sounds disconcertingly like the way two-year-olds interact before their social skills are properly formed, playing alongside instead of actually with each other. But according to Yarrow, this muted model of friendship “isn’t bad or anachronistic, it’s just different”. In other words: just because it’s not your idea of a friendship doesn’t mean it doesn’t count, so leave these men in peace with their trains, their golf, their tinkering with classic cars, or whatever else allows them to spend time in the company of other men who can’t stand endless yapping either.Thankfully for anyone keen to avoid yet another culture war row about society becoming too feminised, Yarrow is explicitlynotarguing that public emoting is weak or harmful, and still less for turning the clock back. Rather, he is making the point that touchy-feely talk isn’t necessarily for everyone, and that more may be going on under the surface of some seemingly repressed friendships than meets the eye. Is he right?As a woman, I’m obviously no expert on what men talk to other men about. But as a journalist, all I can say after many years of trying to get interviewees to open up about sometimes awkward or intimate things is that while men are often more reluctant initially than women to talk, once they get going they are often astonishingly candid. A lack of visible emotion, in either men or women, is not to be confused with the absence of it.And while younger men raised not to be so ashamed of having feelings tend to be broadly better at expressing them, anyone who has ever sat in on a focus group or been to the football will know that older men are far from incapable of it. Rebrand soppy old emotions as more acceptably masculine “political opinions” or “following Arsenal”, and an awful lot of men will happily vent their anger, yearning, disappointment or pride until the cows come home.What is striking about Yarrow’s rail enthusiasts, meanwhile, is that for all their horror of talking about feelings, they were nonetheless still finding ways to communicate what looks remarkably like love and care. When one elderly volunteer failed to turn up for a few weeks and then came in struggling for breath, his friends noticed and were worried. But, the professor notes, they deliberately didn’t ask what was wrong: instead, they offered cups of tea, cracked jokes, tried to be discreetly supportive while keeping things normal. They were looking out for each other pretty much as female friends would do, except without ever acknowledging the elephant in the room.It’s not my idea of bonding, and it may not be yours. But if the real therapeutic value of having friends – the thing that keeps loneliness at bay, and the black dog from the door – is just knowing that someone else cares enough to walk through it all with you, does that always have to be put into words?Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The artist recalls their extraordinary partnership – and the day Kuti’s Lagos HQ burnedStevie ChickTue 6 Jan 2026 11.35 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShare‘There were flames everywhere. Soldiers with bayoneted rifles were dragging people out into the streets, staggering, naked and bleeding. Nobody knew if Fela was still inside the burning building.”Lemi Ghariokwu pauses. For much of our video-call, the 70-year-old artist has joyfully revisited his years as friend and confidant of Fela Aníkúlápó Kuti, the Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer whose legacy has been celebrated recently by both a high-profile podcast produced by the Obamas and a career-spanning box-set, The Best of the Black President, designed by Ghariokwu.I will electrify my fence. The next time they come, they will get a shock and think: 'This man is crazy!'His mood darkens, however, as he recalls the authorities’ assault onKuti’s Lagos HQ, the Kalakuta Republic, on 18 February 1977. For years, tensions had simmered between Kuti and Nigeria’s military junta, as the singer/bandleader chronicled injustice and corruption on records including Zombie, Expensive Shit and No Agreement. But the razing of Kalakuta marked a tragic inflection point in Kuti’s struggle against the government. It also initiated the unravelling of his friendship with Ghariokwu.View image in fullscreen‘Ideas were just flooding my brain’ … Ghariokwu.Ghariokwu had first crossed Kalakuta’s threshold three years earlier as an 18-year-old engineering student, accompanied by Kuti’s journalist friend Babatunde Harrison, who’d spotted Ghariokwu’s portrait of Bruce Lee hanging in a Lagos bar and deemed him skilled enough to illustrate the musician’s album sleeves. As he awaited his audience with the Black President, then mid-siesta, Ghariokwu absorbed his surroundings. Kuti had been gifted Kalakuta by his mother, revered pan-African activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, restyling it as a fiefdom-cum-commune for his followers, complete with recording studio and swimming pool. “Kalakuta was already notorious, because of Fela’s lifestyle; young people from all over the neighbourhood had eloped to live there. There were skimpily dressed women everywhere.”When Kuti finally awoke, Ghariokwu handed over the portrait of him that Harrison had requested. “Fela was groggy, his eyes were bloodshot, he was dressed only in his briefs, which hung down so his whole pubic hair was exposed. I was intimidated. He looked at the portrait and said, ‘Wow.Goddammit.’ He wrote me a cheque for 120 naira, four times what I’d charge for a portrait. But my spirit told me, ‘Don’t take the money.’ I told him it was a gift from the bottom of my heart, and he smiled, writing me a gate pass to visit Kalakuta whenever I wanted. It was the ticket to my destiny.”View image in fullscreen‘I cashed the cheque this time’ … Alagbon Close.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuThey met again a fortnight later, after Kalakuta had been raided by police for the first time and Kuti was hospitalised with a head-wound. “The room was crowded,” remembers Ghariokwu. If their previous meeting had acquainted him with the star, he now saw the steel beneath the playboy glamour. “With a police guard at the door, Fela spoke loudly about how the authorities had found it too easy to gain entry to Kalakuta. ‘I will electrify the fence, so next time they’ll get a shock and think, “This man is crazy!” And I’m going to write a song to lampoon the police.’ Then he saw me and called for me. ‘The artist!’”Kuti commissioned Ghariokwu to paint the sleeve for his next release, Alagbon Close, which railed against the regime’s dehumanisation of Nigeria’s people. “Alagbon Close was where Fela became a revolutionary against the system,” says Ghariokwu. “I didn’t simply illustrate the lyrics – my painting was more metaphysical. I depicted Fela breaking out of jail, in a celebratory stance, chains broken, the victory sign painted on the wall of Kalakuta because he’d triumphed over the evil police. When Fela saw it, again he said: ‘Wow.Goddammit.’ But I cashed the cheque this time.”Some of the 80 people living in Kalakuta were employed simply to roll spliffsKuti took the artist under his wing. “I was already a pan-Africanist,” Ghariokwu says. “But Fela taught me so much. He gave me books about African history, George GM James’s Stolen Legacy, Yosef ben-Jochannon’s Africa: Mother of Western Civilisation, the Autobiography of Malcolm X. His other graphic designers didn’t care about what he was preaching. I did, and that put me in a very advantageous position.”Kuti also wanted to open Ghariokwu’s mind to the powers of marijuana, but the teetotal artist was reluctant. “Some of the 80 or so people living in Kalakuta were employed simply to roll spliffs,” he remembers. “But I always refused. I took Fanta instead.” However, when Ghariokwu was assigned his second album cover, 1975’s No Bread, Kuti said: “How can my artist be drinking Fanta? You have to smokeigbó, to make your head correct.” Ghariokwu adds: “He was such a hero to me, a demi-god, I said, ‘OK’.”View image in fullscreen‘His marijuana was very potent’ … 1975’s No Bread.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuKuti would get his chefs to heat marijuana until it yielded its oil, bottling and storing it in his bedroom. “It wasverypotent. He put a drop on the end of a spoon, for me to lick. Within 30 minutes, I felt very hungry and I had this floating feeling. I went to the bathroom, and I could see my alimentary canal like the plumbing of a house, my urine travelling through pipes inside my body. I told Fela and his friends, and they all laughed at me.”Later that day, Kuti realised that Ghariokwu needed to go home. “He drove us in his Range Rover, and when we got to my parents’ place, kids in the street were shouting, ‘Fela! Fela!’ As I got out of the car, he hissed, ‘When you get inside,don’ttalk to your parents,don’tanswer any questions – just say “goodnight” and go to sleep. But when you sleep, meditate about the artwork.’ I awoke at noon the next day. Ideas were just flooding my brain. I forced in as many as possible.”The sleeve for No Bread presented a dizzying overload of images and metaphors: men fighting over food and money, women presenting their breasts, rats in sunglasses, empty petrol pumps, a balloon reading “Mr Inflation is in town”.“When Fela saw it, he jumped for joy, shouting, ‘You see?’ like I should always have been smoking marijuana. But I can’t handle intoxicants. So I analysed the inspiration I got from that high and used it as my style of composition from then on.”View image in fullscreenAcid satire … Ikoyi Blindness.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuGhariokwu remained teetotal, but his work continued to evolve over the next several years. On acidly satirical sleeves such as Ikoyi Blindness (lampooning a lawyer from the affluent Ikoyi neighbourhood), Yellow Fever (naked African women apply skin bleacher), Upside Down (colonial developers invade as children starve), Ghariokwu created a visual identity as unique asPedro Bell’s work for Funkadelic. “Fela treated me like one of his children, always receiving my work with ‘Wow.Goddammit.’ And, if he was particularly impressed, ‘MOTHERFUCKER.’ I was his youngest adviser, his comrade-in-arms. With two other friends, I formed the political youth wing of Kalakuta, Young African Pioneers. Fela could no longer use public transport, so we told him what was happening in the city, and that inspired his songs.”Ghariokwu was at home when a neighbour told him Kalakuta was on fire. He raced to the compound. “The raid was already in full swing. The police had grabbed Fela’s mum. I didn’t see her fall from the window.” Suspecting Kuti was hiding in a nearby warehouse, soldiers apprehended the owner. “They chopped his finger off with a machete, and he confessed immediately. Soon, they dragged Fela out into the street, naked and bleeding. They slashed his bodyguard’s stomach open with bayonets, so his intestines came out. Fela saw me and whispered, ‘Get my lawyer.’”Kuti went on tosue the government for $1.6m, and rebuilt Kalakuta and his nightclub the Shrine, which the soldiers had also razed, a block away. But Funmilayo never recovered from being thrown from the second-floor window. “Losing his mother was very traumatic for Fela,” says Ghariokwu. “On Coffin for Head of State, he sings, ‘They kill my mama, they kill my mama.’ He was crying from his soul. He felt so guilty: ‘If not for my troubles, she’d still be alive.’ He was never the same after that.”View image in fullscreenNixed … Johnny Just Drop’s back cover.Photograph: Lemi GhariokwuGhariokwu and Kuti disagreed over how to proceed in the aftermath of the raid. “We had to be diplomatic, we needed to sit down and negotiate,” says Ghariokwu. “Fela was having none of that, and my loyalty was questioned.” When he painted a young African in denim and platform shoes falling from an aeroplane for the sleeve of Johnny Just Drop, which satirised diaspora Africans believing they’re superior to their countrymen, Kuti nixed the cover (“I don’t want it to seem like I’m attacking the youth”) and told Ghariokwu to draw a bourgeois older man in a parachute instead. It was the first time Kuti had told him what to paint. Against his boss’s wishes, Ghariokwu had the label manufacture an expensive gatefold sleeve with Kuti’s preferred image on the front, and the rejected image on the back. “He was so angry,” he laughs. “‘You’ve hit me below the belt!’ I ran. The next day he cooled down.”But then Kuti rejected Ghariokwu’s next sleeve, for Sorrow, Tears and Blood. “Fela broke my heart,” says the artist, who had always enjoyed “100% freedom” in his work for Kuti. Ghariokwu walked away from Kalakuta, going on to complete more than 2,000 album sleeves for other musicians, and pursue a career in fine art. A decade after their falling out, he reconciled with Kuti, working on several more sleeves before the Black President succumbed to Aids in 1997.“Ours was a divine collaboration,” he says now, taking pride in how Kuti’s music – and his album artwork – helped spread African culture across the rest of the world. “A journalist once asked me if I was bored of always being tied to Fela, of living in his shadow,” he smiles. “But Fela is in the lineage of WEB Du Bois, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr, a fighter for the mental liberation of the African people. Fela cast a long shadow, and as a pan-Africanist, that’s a good place to live.”The Best of the Black Presidentby Fela Kuti is out nowExplore more on these topicsArt and designFela KutifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jude Law’s Vladimir film seems to have swallowed Kremlin mythsNatasha KiselevaIn The Wizard of the Kremlin, Jude Law plays Russia’s president as a cool, reluctant leader, a strategist who got the job because he was young, athletic and a spy. This is a creation far removed from the man himselfTue 6 Jan 2026 10.26 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 12.43 ESTShareLast year, speaking at the Venice film festival premiere of The Wizard of the Kremlin, based on a book about the rise ofVladimir Putin, actor Jude Law said he “didn’t fear any repercussions” over his portrayal of the Russian president. Law may be right, but not for the reason he thinks he is. The film aligns so closely with the mythologised version promoted by the Russian media that, domestically, it reads as a compliment rather than an affront.The Kremlin and Russia’s pop-culture machine have long collaborated to craft a made-to-measure version of Putin that is far removed from the man himself: a political superhero without age or mistakes, a perfectly calculated strategist, a former spy reframed as a Russian James Bond who always knows more than he reveals.One recent example is the TV series Chronicles of the Russian Revolution, released in October and directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, a Silver Lion winner and longstanding Kremlin supporter. Its main character is a fictional blue-eyed lieutenant colonel in the secret services, inexplicably chosen by the emperor’s inner circle and presented as the man who “saves” Russia from chaos, a role played by Yura Borisov, an Oscar nominee this year. Although the character is named Mikhail rather than Vladimir, the implication is clear: in this narrative, the saviour of Russia must be the familiar security officer.In Russia, the manufactured Putin has long eclipsed the real one. And yet western portrayals often end up reinforcing the same narrative rather than undercutting it. French director Olivier Assayas’s The Wizard of the Kremlin, based on Giuliano da Empoli’sbestselling satirical noveland adapted for screen by Emmanuel Carrère, in some ways sets out to subvert the Putin cult. In the film, which is released in French and Spanish cinemas this month, the Russian president is framed not as a cause but as a symptom, and the narrative shifts its centre of gravity towards spindoctor Vadim Baranov and the political machinery around him.View image in fullscreenThe implication is clear … Yura Borisov as Mikhail Prokhorov in Chronicles of the Russian Revolution.Photograph: Anastasia LyashenkoThe film does not present itself as a documentary or biopic. “What makes this film unique, and ultimately what fascinated me, was precisely that it showed the consequences of political evil, but also tried to portray its nature. How it works, its inner workings,” Assayas told Variety last year. Some characters appear under their real names, including Putin himself and the oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky. Others are fictional but clearly modelled on real figures. Baranov (Paul Dano) appears to be based on the political operative Vladislav Surkov. Dmitri Sidorov seems to represent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the businessman who spent 10 years in prison after clashing with Putin.The portrayal of Putin, however, resembles a Kremlin manual entitled A Short Guide to Romanticising the Leader. Putin is presented as having been chosen by Berezovsky and Baranov to stabilise the country, because he is “young, athletic and a spy”. Berezovsky and Baranov visit him in his office and all but beg him to become president. He replies that he would prefer to rule Russia from the shadows, since governments come and go and he seeks permanent power. This is the Kremlin’s export myth: the cool, reluctant strategist shaped by destiny. In reality, none of this ever happened.In fact, no one ever begged Putin to take the job. In cinematic terms, the presidency was effectively a casting call, and there was no shortage of candidates. At the centre of this process stood Berezovsky, one of the most influential oligarchs of the late Boris Yeltsin era, who expected to run the country de facto once a successor was installed. The shortlist he considered included Boris Nemtsov (murdered near the Kremlin in 2015), Sergei Kiriyenko (now first deputy chief of staff), former security service director Sergei Stepashin and several others.The journalist Roman Badanin, who has spent his career studying Putin’s biography and recently published The Tsar Himself, argues that Putin simply fitted the parameters Berezovsky was looking for. “Berezovsky was a political animal and wanted someone the public would understand, preferably from the security services,” Badanin told me. “The key was that the candidate could not be a communist, since they were at war with them at the time, and could not be a liberal either – the kind of guy with glasses and a good suit, who irritated voters and looked too pro-western. That ruled out half the contenders, but Putin was perfect: a loyal state servant.”Property developer Shalva Chigirinsky, a close friend of Berezovsky and a witness to the choice of Putin as successor, also believes that Putin was not selected for his leadership qualities.“In the summer of 1999, Borya [Berezovsky] told me they had settled on Putin,” Chigirinsky says. “I said, ‘Are you out of your mind? Who is going to vote for him? He can’t even pick a shirt in his size or tie a tie.’ Putin made no impression as a leader; he had no political charisma and ambitions. Borya explained that they didn’t need a strong candidate, they needed someone controllable, someone who would follow instructions. The key criterion was that the future president had to be manageable and loyal, so he wouldn’t turn on ‘The Family’.”The Family had emerged in 1995 and included Berezovsky, Yeltsin’s wife Naina, his daughter Tatyana and her husband Valentin Yumasheva, politician Aleksandr Voloshin and others. Their priority was self-preservation. Russian political history is full of predecessors being sidelined or destroyed, and Chigirinsky said Putin personally assured them he would protect their interests.View image in fullscreenThe shift to framing Putin as a ‘spy’ may have been triggered by Daniel Craig’s arrival as James Bond.Photograph: United Artists/Columbia Pictures/AllstarBoth Badanin and Chigirinsky agree that the image of Putin as a powerful KGB spy was constructed retrospectively and has little to do with reality. Even the claims about his “recruitment work” during his KGB years in Dresden from 1985 to 1990 do not stand up to scrutiny; most of these stories were added later as part of the wider mythology around him. As Badanin puts it: “He handled paperwork and technical tasks, not operations. In essence, he was a low-level clerk who spent 10 years in the internal intelligence system, not someone engaged in actual agent work.”In a strange intermingling of fact and fiction, the shift to framing Putin as a “spy” may in part have been triggered by Daniel Craig’s arrival as James Bond. His harder, more minimalist interpretation of 007 prompted Russian media and online audiences to draw visual parallels with Putin. By 2011, mashup posters replacing Craig’s face with Putin’s on Casino Royale artwork appeared on central streets in Moscow. Their origin was never officially established, and they were removed relatively quickly by municipal services, but the images were widely photographed and picked up by international tabloids, feeding the growing tendency to frame Putin as a Russian 007.The Wizard of the Kremlin review – Jude Law is Putin in adaptation of Kremlin spin doctor bestsellerRead moreBut if the parallels between Putin and Craig were always somewhat manufactured, the situation is different with Law, an actor who has been popular with Russian audiences across generations. The Kremlin will not miss the chance to frame his casting as a minor diplomatic triumph, much as it once framed the proposed invitation for Putin to meet Donald Trump in Alaska. The fact that the film shows none of the mass protests, the opposition or Alexei Navalny, despite covering events up to 2019, is a pleasant bonus for the propaganda.In Russian cinema and television, Putin is portrayed as an omnipotent figure who never appears on screen. His presence is instead signalled through portraits in the offices of governors and ministers or calls “from above”. Now, in Assayas’s film, he finally acquires a face.Natasha Kiseleva is an exiled Russian journalist based in GermanyExplore more on these topicsFilmVladimir PutinRussiaEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brace yourself for handwriting analysis, Jekyll and Hyde vibes and crucial slips of the tongueMichael HoganTue 6 Jan 2026 08.13 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 08.15 ESTShareIt’s the question on everyone’s lips. No, not “Why am I half a stone heavier and in dire need of an afternoon nap?” but “Who is the Secret Traitor?” And thankfully, we’re about to find out.The curveball new role has proved a gamechanging twist in BBC mega hitThe Traitors. Swishing around Ardross Castle in a red cloak, as opposed to the Traitors’ familiar green, the Secret Traitor’s identity is unknown to contestants and viewers alike. It hasn’t just stoked paranoia in the Traitors’ turret but enabled the audience to play along at home, turning us all into armchair sleuths as we try to crack the case.Now, thanks to the early banishment of Hugo the treacherous teddy bear, they’re to be unmasked – probably sooner than producers planned. Saturday’s episode ended on an agonising cliffhanger, with the Traitors about to meet their mysterious puppet master for the first time. On Wednesday evening’s edition, we’ll see who lurks beneath that scarlet hood.Here are the 10 top theories about who could be knock-knock-knocking on the conclave door …The Jekyll and Hyde theory: AmandaView image in fullscreen‘She has the skill set’ … Amanda alongside Jade in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PABookies’ early favourite for the Secret Traitor role was retired police detective Amanda. It’s easy to see why. She says she learned about being deceptive from the criminals she encountered during her career and was keen to be a Traitor: “I’ve tracked down baddies all my life. Now it’s time to be one.” Who better to go undercover? Amanda has mentioned her training in covert techniques and intelligence policing, so she has the skill set.She has even confessed: “My Jekyll and Hyde personality is my secret weapon.” Traitor Rachel fears her, describing Amanda as “dangerously smart”. Remember her uncharacteristic indecision during the throne-carrying mission? This could have been Amanda second-guessing herself and letting the mask slip. When Hugo was outmanoeuvred, his parting shot was to admit that Amanda was “better at this game than me”. This sowed seeds of doubt that it was Traitor-on-Traitor betrayal. Had he rumbled her at the last moment?The handwriting theory: Jade, Roxy, Fiona or JessieOne of the few tangible clues isthose scrolls left in the turret, listing options for the next murder. Maybe we shouldn’t read too much into them – they could disguise their handwriting or the names could be rewritten by a member of the production team – but compare them to the round table slates and your spidey senses might start tingling.The small, neat cursive looks fluid and feminine, probably right-handed, perhaps even slightly old-fashioned. The closest matches on the chalkboards appear to be those belonging to Roxy, Fiona and Jessie. However, the distinctive “J” on James’s name on the scroll resembled Jade’s banishment vote for Judy, also bringing her into the equation.The slip-of-the-tongue theory: EllieView image in fullscreen‘Very bright’ … Ellie in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherrySocial media lit up on Saturday with fans convinced that Ellie had accidentally given herself away. During herpost-round table interview, the 33-year-old said of her low-key approach: “Being more reserved can benefit you at the beginning but as the game goes on, people will question if you’re just sitting and watching as a kind of secret traitor.” Sound the klaxon! Alert the authorities!Was her wording just a coincidence? The Traitors had already floated Ellie’s name because she’s “very bright” but they don’t know the half of it. As the first psychologist to take part in the UK series – although she’s wisely hidden this info – who better to master the mind games of being a double agent?The library theory: JessieView image in fullscreen‘Slipped under most radars’ … Jessie in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAThe night before Royal Navy veteran Ben was murdered, he voiced his doubts about Ross and warned: “I’ll be up for murder if any of youse are a Traitor.” His name duly appeared on the hitlist and he was slain. In a rare occurrence, the Faithful actually followed the evidence and worked out who’d been within earshot in the library: namely Ellie, Jessie, James, Fiona and Stephen.The latter is a Traitor. James has been shortlisted himself. This leaves the three women in the frame – including Hull hairdresser Jessie, who has slipped under most radars. Hugo briefly wondered if Jessie was the Secret Traitor because she was so relaxed before bedtime. She admits people tend to underestimate her but insists: “I have it in me to be brutal and backstab.”Because of her stammer,Jessie might have felt more comfortable working alone. Nobody would see this one coming.The wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing theory: FionaView image in fullscreen‘Like Jane Tennison in a Miss Marple mask’… Fiona alongside Adam in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAA Welsh woman dialling up her ditzy side as the ultimate disguise? It’s a description that applied to Traitor Amanda in series one and might now fit Fiona. The Swansea diva has admitted “playing up to being dotty and clueless” before ominously warning: “Never underestimate a woman of a certain age.” Witness the way she teamed up with Amanda and Harriet to take down Hugo at the last round table. It was like Jane Tennison in a Miss Marple mask.There are scraps of circumstantial evidence.Not only is Fiona’s handwriting in the right ballpark but she was among the library trio present when Ben put a target on his own back. She “wasn’t interested” in getting an immunity shield during the portrait gallery mission. Rachel is starting to suspect Fiona as the Secret Traitor. So are some viewers. She jokingly mentioned owning a red bathing suit but does she have a cloak to match?The female theory: JadeSince hostClaudia Winklemanrightly took series two’s Traitors to task for exclusively recruiting males, producers have been scrupulously gender-aware. Because the three Traitors already selected – Stephen, Rachel and the now departed Hugo – were male-skewed, chances are the fourth choice would be female to restore equality. Indeed, when the Secret Traitor provided an all-male murder shortlist last week, the turret trio immediately agreed it must be a woman.This adds PhD student Jade to the list of potentials. She’s smart and strategic enough. She plays “a lot of social deception video games which are similar to The Traitors” and fancied being “a shark among the sheep”. Could she be the new Cat Burns?The family tree theory: RoxyView image in fullscreenIs Fiona as ditsy as she makes out, and will Roxy wreak revenge on her mum’s banishment?Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAThe nerve-jangling covert mission given to the surviving Traitors last time was to leave bloodied fingerprints on the framed family tree in the castle lobby, nominating their fellow players for murder. Complete it successfully and they’d get to meet the Secret Traitor at last. But was the family tree’s starring role a clue?Roxy and Judy came into the castle as secret mother-and-daughter. We’ve had covert parent-and-child relationships before (see Diane and Ross in series two) but one of the women being the Secret Traitor would add another level of intrigue. Roxy looked daggers at gardener James when he mentioned Judy as a potential Traitor, then was quick to put a coffin in his grave during the opening mission. His name duly appeared on the first shortlist. Having watched her adoptive mum fall victim to this year’s first banishment, there would be a certain satisfaction in seeing Roxy wreak revenge.The crime queen theory: HarrietView image in fullscreen‘She could play both sides’ … Harriet alongside Jack in The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAA former criminal barristerturned author of psychological thrillers, the role of Secret Traitor might have been built for bestselling writer Harriet. She “spends her life making up horrible ways to dispatch people on the page”, so was excited to “either commit murder or track down killers in the game”. As the Secret Traitor, she could play both sides. On the latest episode of companion show Uncloaked, eagle-eyed viewers spotted four framed photos on the wall: Hugo, Rachel, Stephen and Harriet. Why was she up there with three known Traitors?The logic theory: everyone elseOf those not yet mentioned, we can discount anyone who’s appeared on the hitlists, which rules out Maz, James and Reece. This leaves half a dozen of the younger males. Cocksure Sam has hogged camera time and flung accusations around. Rachel surmised that his boldness was a sign that Sam could be the Secret Traitor.The remaining possibilities are builder Adam, young pup Faraaz, personal trainer Jack, creative director Matt or thebeleaguered Ross.Although let’s face it, any of those would be disappointing reveals with shades of bungling Buckells from Line of Duty.The wild card theory: Claudia or AlanIt’s highly unlikely the Secret Traitor would come from outside the parameters of the game but hey, rules are there to be broken. Presenter Winkleman is already the game’s string-puller. Could she have extended her remit to include underhand treachery? The new-look cloak would coordinate nicely with her trademark red fingerless gloves.Another left-field candidate would be chaotic comic Alan Carr, winner of the inaugural celebrity series. The reigning champion starred in the first teaser trailer for this civilian series, handing over his cloak and telling successors: “You’ll never guess what Claudia’s got planned this time. It’s big. Good luck. You’re definitely going to need it.” A clue? Probably not but it would be enjoyably bananas if it was.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Actors slip into their anecdotage. Two of the best programmes in the rather arid TV Christmas schedules featured Judi Dench touchingly reminiscing about her love of Shakespeare. The great dame is also one of the glittering ensemble in TheTwelfth NightReunion, a one-off event conceived and hosted by Gyles Brandreth and recorded at the Orange Tree in Richmond, London, a year ago, where a group of actors share their memories of the play.Now available on YouTube, it is like an upmarket version of The Graham Norton Show with two heart-stopping moments.The format is simple. Each actor is invited to describe his or her first encounter with the play and their experience of being in it. Simon Callow vividly recalls the “melancholy magic” ofJohn Barton’s legendary 1969 RSC production. When cast as the drunken Sir Toby in a later National Theatre production, Callow reveals that he discovered “that the character was basically my father”. Dame Judi, Viola in the Barton version, describes a famous bit of comic business created by the Malvolio, Donald Sinden. In the garden scene, Sinden glanced at a sundial and then at his fob watch and realised the two showed different times. After looking up at the sun, Sinden effortfully heaved the sundial into a new position until it showed the correct Malvolio time.View image in fullscreen‘Like a Liverpool team of the 1970s’ … The Twelfth Night Reunion.Photograph: Danny KaanStephen Fry, Malvolio at Shakespeare’s Globe,in the West Endand on Broadway, rightly pays tribute to the play’s flawless structure and to Mark Rylance’s unearthly skill as Olivia. But Fry also reveals that he and Rylance had fierce arguments about the authorship of the plays and says that, although Rylance claims to keep an open mind, “his mind is so open his brain has left him”. Even Fry, however, concedes that he found the scene where Malvolio is imprisoned impossible to learn and was later told by Ian McKellen that every actor has the same problem and that Donald Wolfit concluded that Shakespeare could not possibly have written it.What emerges is everyone’s passion for the play and joy at being in it. Tam Williams, Viola inan all-male Propeller production, says that it’s like “a Liverpool football team of the 1970s” in that everyone has to be at the top of their game. Penelope Wilton describes how, when playing Maria, she countered a crudely bottom-smacking Sir Toby by adopting an increasingly upper-class accent until she sounded “like an announcer on Radio 3”.But while the film is full of fun, including one of the best Olivier stories I’ve ever heard from Robert Lindsay, it is only at the end that it touches the heart. The first moment comes whenJudi Denchperforms the soliloquy where Viola realises that Olivia has fallen in love with her. You can play that speech for comedy but there is an intensity of sadness to Dame Judi – especially on the line “What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!” – that makes you realise Viola’s sympathy for another victim of passion.The second moving moment comes when Stefan Bednarczyk, who was a piano-playing Feste in theOrange Tree’s Twelfth Night in 2024, gets the cast and audience to join together in singing the last few lines of the play: “A great while ago the world began / With hey-ho, the wind and the rain / But that’s all one, our play is done / And we’ll strive to please you every day.” Maybe it is because they evoke the transience of mortal things but those simple lines make the ideal ending to the greatest comedy ever written.The Twelfth Night Reunion is on YouTubeExplore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreTwelfth NightJudi DenchStephen FrySimon CallowWilliam ShakespearefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Robert Bresson, Theo Angelopoulos, Joe Weerasethakul, Lav Diaz, Lisandro Alonso; these are all great slow cinema practitioners. But surely no film-maker ever got the speedometer needle further back to the left than the tragicomic master Béla Tarr; his pace was less than zero, a kind of intense and monolithic slowness, an uber-slowness, in films that moved, often almost infinitesimally, like vast gothic aircraft-carrier-sized ships across dark seas.Béla Tarr, Hungarian director of Sátántangó and Werckmeister Harmonies, dies aged 70Read moreAudience reactions were often a kind of delirium or incredulity at just how punishing the anti-pace was, but – given sufficient investment of attention – you found yourself responding with awe, but also laughing along to the macabre dark comedy, the parable and the satire. A Béla Tarr movie gave you drunkenness and hangover at the same time. And people were often to be found getting despairingly drunk in his films.Tarr was like a cinematic Gogol, often working with co-director and editor Ágnes Hranitzky. And yet however bleak the vision, with all its squalor and wretchedness, in person Tarr was witty in an exuberant yet somehow deadpan way, droll and wisecracking, fiercely engaged with the world, unstinting in his criticism of the intellectual mediocrity of the far right in his native Hungary and elsewhere. WhenI interviewed him in 2024on the occasion of a big retrospective of his work at London’s BFI Southbank, we talked about his new vocation of teaching at his Sarajevo film school after he stepped back from film-making in 2011; he said he was most energised by his enthusiasm for young film-makers. He said: “My slogan is very simple: no education, just liberation!”View image in fullscreenWitty … Béla Tarr in 2024.Photograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty ImagesTarr’s death comes shortly after the Nobel prize for literaturewas awarded to novelist László Krasznahorkai, the Hungarian author whose dark, demanding and uncompromising vision most clearly coincided with Tarr’s own, and with whom Tarr at one point occupied a kind of parallel creative path with his near-legendary 1994 adaptation of Krasznahorkai’s novel Sátántangó, or Satan’s Tango. It is a film about a rural village whose inhabitants abandon their lives to follow a charismatic cult leader who has returned from the dead, a super-slow monochrome epic of dreamlike strangeness lasting a staggering seven-and-a-half hours. For years, this mesmeric film was only fitfully available at festivals and those who saw it had a haunted expression, a kind of filmic PTSD.Werckmeister Harmonies from 2000, adapted from Krasznahorkai’s novel The Melancholy of Resistance, was another vividly disquieting black-and-white journey; this was a mere two-and-a-half hours in length, but no less punishing and unforgiving. Again, it is a study of spiritual desolation, but also of the groupthink narcosis and inner stupor of fascism. In ways similar to Sátántangó, an entire community submits to the will of a sinister outsider, a “prince” who like a huckster or extremist leader arrives with a giant circus whose sole attraction is a giant dead whale – and the Melvillean echo is surely deliberate.Before these, his 1988 film fiercely and accurately entitledDamnationwas another Krasznahorkai adaptation, a black-and-white (and mostly grey) vision that bears comparison to Beckett and Tarkovsky. His final film, The Turin Horse from 2011 – co-written with Krasznahorkai – was a variation on Nietzsche, a speculation about what happened to the horse that Nietzsche embraced tearfully in the street in Turin because it was being whipped by a coach driver, the moment that triggered the great philosopher’s nervous collapse. Perhaps inevitably, Tarr and Krasznahorkai envisage the horse not staying in sunny, metropolitan Italy but somehow transplanted to the grim fields of central Europe where it is being worked terribly hard on a farm by the coach driver, and enduring almost as much hardship as caused Nietzsche to sob with pity in the first place.View image in fullscreen‘A super-slow monochrome epic of dreamlike strangeness’ … SátántangóPhotograph: Ronald GrantBut Tarr also loved thrillers and noirs (much of his conversation with me was taken up by his adoration of Hitchcock) and he directed The Man from London in 2007, adapted from a Georges Simenon novel which had in fact already been conventionally adapted as a thriller in 1947; characteristically it located the glacially paced spiritual horror beneath the ostensible excitement. A fugitive discovers a suitcase full of foreign cash but realises he can’t spend it without exchanging it and therefore fatally drawing attention to himself; it is a tantalus of longing, and a vivid symbol of our society, with its desire for money. A regular movie would make this the starting point for tension and jeopardy but for Tarr it was the moment to stare into that Nietzschean abyss that stares right back at you.I felt it bore comparisonto the contemporary artist Douglas Gordon’s ultra slo-mo24 Hour Psycho installation.Perhaps uniquely in the “slow cinema” canon, Tarr’s movies always had an element of sulphurous, acrid, bleak comedy; he himself said it was similar to the comedy to be found in the saddest work of Chekhov. His work is something to be borne alongside Shaw’s dictum: “Life does not cease to be funny when people die, any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh.” For Tarr, it was laughter in the dark, but the darkness itself had endless texture and complexity.Explore more on these topicsFilmBéla TarrHungaryEuropeLászló KrasznahorkaiFictioncommentShareReuse this content"

It’d be an absolute honour”, before adding: “I think, those kinds of things should be done by Brits not Yanks.”The questions came after rumours that Oasis had been courted for the role, with Gallagher’s brother, frontman Liam, responding to a fan on X asking about the rumours in December with: “It’s happening you wait till you hear it it’s the best BOND tune ever.”The singer-songwriter, who alongside his previously estranged brother completed Oasis’s highly anticipated Live 25 tour last year with 41 shows across 13 countries, also said he would be interested in portraying a “Mancunian villain” in the next instalment.The history of Bond theme songs stretches back to the first Bond film, Dr No in 1962, with every film since having its own unique song. The artist chosen to contribute the song tends to change from film to film, although some, such as English composer John Barry and Welsh singer Shirley Bassey, have had the job more than once.Despite the film franchise being a British institution, the official Bond theme is often sung by foreigners, with only 10 British bands, composers or artists having provided songs for the 25 films produced to date: Barry in 1962, 1963 and 1969, Bassey in 1964, 1971 and 1979, Tom Jones in 1965, Paul McCartney and Wings in 1973,Lulu in 1974, Sheena Easton in 1981,Duran Duran in 1985, Adele in 2012 and Sam Smith in 2015. American band Garbage, fronted by Scot Shirley Manson, also provided the music in 1999. Reaction to each song has been mixed, but the three most recent ballads from Adele, Smith and Billie Eilish each took home the Academy Award for Best Original Song.Little is currently known about any prospective future Bond films, with a replacement for long-time lead Daniel Craig, who exited the role after No Time to Die in 2021, still undecided andcreative control now in the hands of Amazon MGM Studios, meaning that the next film in the series will be the first without the creative input of Eon Productions, the long-time stewards of the franchise who had a hand in deciding who created each film’s theme song.Explore more on these topicsNoel GallagherOasisJames BondnewsShareReuse this content"

Another group flicks through racks of clothing, pulling out T-shirts that say “romance readers club” and “probably reading about fairies”.A poster on the wall, with tear-off tabs, invites visitors to take what they need: a love triangle, a love confession mid-dragon battle, a morally grey man or a cowboy.Half of the tabs have already been taken. This is a pop-up shop for bookish merchandise: visitors already know which tropes they want to go home with.I’ve come along with my sister, a devoted romance reader, and suddenly found myself amid a vibrant and rich fan community. The pop-up store is held by Books With Jess, an Australian small business that makes handmade book-themed merchandise. The event was advertised to the account’s 23,000 followers on Instagram, and many showed up: the queue outside the warehouse in Chippendale stretches down the block.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIt is one of many events that have sprung from Australia’s rapidly growing online book community. Booktok and Bookstagram, on the social media sites TikTok and Instagram respectively, have exploded since the 2020 pandemic and romance and romantasy – a blending of romance and fantasy – are the most popular genres.The core participants are women in their 20s and 30s who grew up with online fan communities.A genre of swords and soulmates: the rise and rise of ‘romantasy’ novelsRead moreOne such reader is Jess*, a 25-year-old secondary school teacher from Brisbane who began reviewing romance novels on her Instagram account in 2020.“I grew up in what we like to refer to as the Wattpad era,” she says, referring to a fan-fiction site. Much of the writing was “pretty terrible,” she says, “but a lot of it was quite romance based and I read so much of that.“Once I got to university I started reading a little bit more of romance … and I’ve been pretty much reading it ever since.”She now reads between 200 and 400 books a year. Her Bookstagram has allowed her to connect with other romance readers around Australia and overseas – including her new housemate.“We initially connected over Instagram and figured out that we were both teachers, both read the same stuff and we’ve met up in person a bunch of times and now we’re about to move in together next year as roommates,” she says.“I’ve got quite a few friends over in America, Germany and other places who all enjoy the same things so it’s really cool to have someone to talk to about that same passion.”The online community is a big drawcard of the genre, say cousins Aleyna* and Leyla*.

Outside breakthrough titles – such asromantasy smash hits A Court of Thorns and Roses and Fourth Wing– most romance readers rely on ebooks.If they want to browse the shelves, they journey to Sydney bookstore Romancing the Novel. The store’s 29-year-old owner, Scarlett Hopper, herself a romance author, says customers have often planned their day around their visit.Her favourite are those who haven’t picked up a book in years.“We’ve actually gotten men who don’t read romance but they want to dip their toes in, or they love to read fantasy and they’re like ‘Oh I’ve just read Fourth Wing’ … what can I get into next?” she says.* Surnames have been withheldExplore more on these topicsBooksRomance booksFictionSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Short ofChristopher Nolansigning on to the new Mr Men movie, I didn’t think much would throw the industry a loop as whenGreta Gerwigdecided to follow up bubblegum blockbusterBarbiewith …… a Narnia movie. More specifically, Gerwig – previously a skilled purveyor of achingly hip alt-indie comedy with Lady Bird, Frances Ha and Damsels in Distress – isrestartingthe Narnia series, which had got through three of CS Lewis’s series before Netflix took over the rights. To my mind, though, The Magician’s Nephew, Lewis’s origins/prequel to the Wardrobe/Caspian/Dawn Treader narrative, is the most interesting of the entire Narnia canon, with its Edenic fall, “deplorable word” and mystical apple. We know some of the cast: Emma Mackey is the future White Witch,Carey Mulliganthe terminally ill mother of one of the main kids, andDaniel Craigmightbe Aslan or mad inventor Uncle Andrew – or both, or neither. All eyes will be naturally be on Gerwig, but I have confidence she will pull it off in style.Andrew PulverDune: MessiahView image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet.Photograph: Warner Bros/Everett/ShutterstockFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Dune and the return of Madge: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026Read moreAfter claiming that he was going to focus on other projects and maybe even abandon Dune after two laborious half-book adaptations,Denis Villeneuve, inspired by howPart Twowas “received by cinephiles around the world” (LOL),fast-trackedDune: Messiah. The final chapter in the epic sci-fi trilogy is now due this December (though given that it’s slated to compete against the newest Avengers, that is likely subject to change.) And thank God for that – as the Guardian’sresident Dunehead, I must report that I have been counting down the days to Messiah since Zendaya’s heartbroken Chani fled the scene of her boyfriend’s genocidal freak metamorphosis via sandworm. It does not matter that Frank Herbert’s far weirder sequel may actually be, as some charged of the first book, unadaptable; that the plot devolves into resurrected zombie warriors and worm gods and requiredTimothée Chalametto shave his head. Villeneuve’s vision for the first two films – gloriously strange and wonderfully vast, from the infrared Black Sun to the desert mouse – is so commanding, so thrilling to behold on the big screen, that I simply trust he will land the spaceship and give us one more round of heady yet extremely hype-y interplanetary escapism in 2026.Adrian HortonThe MomentIt seems like an eternity since then, but a mere 18 months agoCharli xcxturned the summer lime green and dared us all to findour inner brat. Now, pop’s smudged-eyeliner princess promises to again dominate in 2026 – shehasan original soundtrack to a reimaginedWuthering Heightsarriving in February and this charming mockumentary popping out at the end of January. Detailing a wonderfully deranged alternate history of the artist’s 2024 rampage of a summer tour,The Momentwas reportedly born out of a confessional text of “word vomit” that the singer made to her music video collaborator Aidan Zamiri (directing his first feature film). The movie will hopefully channel the madcap energy of the delightfully cracked visuals that the pair put together for tracks 360 and Guess (with Billie Eilish), giving us all something that doesn’t lose its shine after an hour sets in. With a starring role fromAlexander Skarsgårdand a score from longtime Charli collaboratorAG Cook, the promise is there – hopefully it meets The Moment.Veronica EspositoA Place in HellView image in fullscreenMichelle Williams.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesBack at Sundance 2023, I was lucky enough to secure a seat for the world premiere of battle of the sexes thrillerFair Play, a question mark of a film that suddenly became popular enough to see crowds turned away at the door. It was the kind of communal experience I crave at festivals: an electric wave of audible anger and excitement, and as has become depressingly commonplace, one that very few people were able to replicate in the real world. It was bought by Netflix and so a juicy, glossily made crowd-provoker was dumped on smartphones, a fate that’s set to be avoided for writer-director Chloe Domont’s follow-up, another corporate thriller called A Place in Hell. The film, which starsMichelle Williams, Daisy Edgar-Jones andAndrew Scott, has been picked up by Neon, and while little is known about the plot (although the title suggests this time, the fight will be between two women), we at least know we’ll all get to see it on the big screen.Benjamin LeeFlowervale StreetView image in fullscreenAnne Hathaway.Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesIn the past 16 years, David Robert Mitchell has made just three feature films. It was probably the third of these, 2019’s hallucinatoryUnder the Silver Lake, that ensured these numbers would not continue to grow. Silver Lake, a dark rabbit-hole comedy of unsettling conspiracy brain, was a barely released bomb for A24, an embarrassment just as the company was finding its footing as the hippest indie studio of the new century. It’s also a terrific movie and only amplified my desire to see what Mitchell would do next. The most exciting thing about Flowervale Street, Mitchell’s fourth film, is that I’m still not sure what exactly that is. Supposedly it’s an uncharacteristically family-friendly project, as well as a bigger-budget movie than he has previously made. (It has held several different high-profile release dates and is now penciled into August 2025.) It definitely co-starsAnne HathawayandEwan McGregor. It may involve dinosaurs. But if it’s even remotely of a tonal piece with the eerie, evocativeIt Follows; lovely the Myth of the American Sleepover; or hilarious, unsparing Under the Silver Lake, it will be one of the most distinctive big-studio fantasies of the year.Jesse HassengerThe Adventures of Cliff BoothView image in fullscreenBrad Pitt.Photograph: Sony Pictures/Andrew Cooper/AllstarWuthering Heights, Michael Jackson and the ‘Trump effect’ – will 2026 see the end of the ‘woke’ blockbuster?Read moreQuentin Tarantino’s movies are playfully pulpy, indulgent and in your face with the writer-director’s verbosity, his personality dripping off every syllable.David Fincher, by contrast, favours cool, stealthy and cerebral; his trademark being what appears to be an invisible hand in complete control. Both are among the US’s most revered auteurs with styles so distinct you wouldn’t think they could exist in the same universe, which is why Fincher serving as the surrogate shepherding a Tarantino project to the screen is as tantalizing as it is confounding.Brad Pittbrought Tarantino’s script for The Adventures of Cliff Booth, a sequel toOnce Upon a Time … in Hollywood, to Fincher, when the former decided he didn’t want his 10th (and, as he insists, final) film to keep him in familiar terrain. (Or maybe he’d rather spend his downtime on podcasts,talking smackabout Paul Dano, while dwelling on what his curtain call will be.) Whatever the reasoning, I can’t wait to see Fincher’s bastardized version and what he makes of Pitt’s Cliff Booth, the Hollywood stunt man who doesn’t quite fit in with the old guard or the counterculture, his penchant for violence and alpha male swagger at delicious odds with his zen-like calm and curious taste for free love and LSD. Cliff Booth is a beautiful contradiction, which is what I’m counting on Fincher’s Tarantino project to be.Radheyan SimonpillaiI Love BoostersKeke Palmer.Photograph: Courtesy of NEONBoots Rileyhas a knack for writing stories that live on in my mind well after I’ve seen them play out on screen. I still wonder what became ofSorry to Bother You’s Equisapiens, and think about I Am a Virgo using a 13ft protagonist to personify the American fascination with Black genetic marvels from hardscrabble backgrounds. All the while, I’ve been holding space for Riley’s next brainteaser: I Love Boosters. Described as a “sci-fi heist comedy”, I Love Boosters follows a crew of professional shoplifters who go from boosting luxury goods to taking down a ruthless fashion designer.Keke Palmer,Demi Mooreand Sorry to Bother You leadLaKeith Stanfieldstar in what figures to be a trenchant, if trippy, commentary on the fashion industry and consumerism writ large – and the timing (read: this precarious economic moment) couldn’t be better.Andrew LawrenceDiggerPretty much nothing is known about the plot of this film, but it’s high on my most-anticipated list because of the people who made it.Alejandro González Iñárritudirected and co-wrote the film, and while I don’t always love his work – not The Revenant’s aggressive brutality, not Birdman’s scratchy solipsism, certainly not whatever Bardo is – they are nonetheless ornate, meticulously crafted objects worth contending with. But it’s the film’s star,Tom Cruise, who is the real draw here. It’s been nine years since Cruise did a non-franchise film, and even longer since he’s worked with a lauded auteur like Iñárritu. Cruise starring in a $125m, studio-backed dark comedy from an Oscar-winning director – alongsideJesse Plemons,Sandra Hüller,Riz Ahmedand more – sounds like something that would have happened 20 years ago, not in 2026. That’s pretty exciting.Richard LawsonUntitled Jesse Eisenberg musical comedyView image in fullscreenJesse Eisenberg.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesA Real Pain was the actual best film of last Oscars season; the best film of the season after this one is likely to be the untitledJesse Eisenbergmusical project. Bankrolled by A24 and set in “the high-stakes world of community theatre”, his third film as writer-director starsJulianne Mooreas a shy housewife who takes acting classes, gets into it, then goes full method and takes a job as the superintendent of an apartment building so she can better realise her performance. Paul Giamatti plays her unlikely mentor; Eisenberg has a bit-part, likewise Halle Bailey and Bernadette Peters. A leaked report from a test screening this summer said “what begins as an eccentric character study quickly shifts into a dark comedy – imagine Woody Allen’s version of Black Swan. The audience roared with laughter.” It’s not at Sundance – a bit odd, given how great a launchpad that proved forA Real Pain. Still, wherever this washes up, I’m in.Catherine ShoardExplore more on these topicsFilm2026 culture previewGreta GerwigCharli xcxTimothée ChalametAnne HathawayMichelle WilliamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But her career soon began to take off. She discusses provocation, perfectionism and telling people her secretsTue 6 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 6 Jan 2026 07.08 ESTShare‘Especially in this country, I think you needed me. You didn’t realise it but you needed me, to lift some of your own shame.”Katherine Ryan, the 42-year-old Canadian comedian who has made her home in the UK for nearly 20 years, has brought her newly minted fourth child, Holland, to the Guardian offices and the baby is lying in a little blanket-nest on the table. Ryan whips off her breast pumps so they don’t make an annoying sound, but I hadn’t noticed the noise, as I was distracted by how adorable the baby is. The first thing you notice is the awesome capability of this woman, who can fully beam maternal love while crafting sequential thoughts in whole sentences, and never get distracted by anything.The second thing you notice is what she’s famous for – a natural, unaffected ballsiness, a rejection of artifice and contradiction. When she sprang on to the UK alternative comedy scene in 2008,her provocation was that she was very good-looking and didn’t pretend not to know it. “Trying to be glamorous or pretty was seen as man-pleasing,” she recalls of the early 2010s, “which was the opposite of what a funny person would do. It was a trend to be self-deprecating. If you went on stage in a glamorous outfit with your little push-up bra and heels, like, ‘I think I’m stunning,’ that would be seen as really off-putting, but I did it because that’s what I liked.”Then there was her material, which she summarises breezily: “Women, especially, needed someone to come along and be like: ‘Hey, that’s OK. You can be a feminist and have a boob job and have been a bit of a slag for a while. You can be imperfect as a mother, as a partner and as a chooser of men. You can be someone who is afraid of men, but is confident enough to slag them off; you don’t have to be nice to them the whole time.’”View image in fullscreen‘If you went on stage in your little push-up bra and heels, that would be seen as really off-putting’ … Ryan performs at Latitude festival in 2015.Photograph: Matthew Baker/WireImageThe drumbeat to that is an insistence on what’s real: if you have your baby with you, you most likely have your breast pumps; if you have the jawline of a youngster, you’ve most likelyhad tweakments; if you want to lose weight, well, there are drugs for that. “I’m not on any yet, but I’ll think about them when I’ve stopped breastfeeding,” she says. It gets to the root of how female emancipation is conceived, which it strikes me hasn’t really changed in the past 50 years: liberation means looking great but never thinking about it; being universally desired, but never chasing the male gaze; having an impermeable sense of self which God forbid you would ever surgically enhance; and allied to all that, women, especially, are supposed to never think about money but nevertheless thrive under the relentlessness of late capitalist conditions. All of which is kept afloat by the majority of us bullshitting, most of the time.“For a long time people went: ‘What? She just speaks about things?’ But I’m not trying to be provocative all the time. My experiences, behaviours and mistakes, they exist in this space between pride and shame. It happened, I talk about it, and maybe reprieve comes out of the jokes. I love telling people secrets; I want people to tell me their secrets. I want to know mistakes people have made. I don’t know why I’m so thirsty for it, but I feel it like a bond.”Ryan grew up in Sarnia, Ontario, a place that was not especially affluent or urban and had a lively amateur dramatics musicals scene. Her dad ran an engineering company, her mother was in IT, and they expected a lot of her because she was sparky, a perfectionist. She wanted to escape from the age of about seven. “It was the kind of town where people are very happy to live next door to their parents and stay there for a long time and have each other’s children. When I go back now, all these kids look really familiar to me, because I grew up with both their parents.” But didn’t she marry (or rather, enter into a civil partnership with) her own high school sweetheart? She went back to Sarnia to film an episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, caught up with Bobby Kootstra, who she dated as a teenager, and now – six years later – they have three children together, plus Violet, now 16, who Ryan had raised until then as a single mother. “Right,” says Ryan. “Sometimes I think there’s another life where I haven’t done that, and it’s still just Violet and me, chic, cosmopolitan, portable. But we can’t fully escape where we came from, it turns out.”View image in fullscreen‘We can’t fully escape where we came from’ … Ryan with her partner Bobby Kootstra.Photograph: Adam Lawrence/UKTVShe did escape for a bit, aged 18, and moved to Toronto, which she loved. These were the Hooters years, which has been another source of controversy, not just that she worked – and enjoyed working – in a topless bar (except this is a misconception: “You would be fired for being topless; you’re not allowed to take your shirt off”), but also for a bit in one of her routines where she talked about giving a manager a blowjob in return for being allowed to go home early. It crossed so many red lines – what even was that? Exploitation? Sex work? Predatory behaviour? Unsisterliness (towards whoever it was who had to stay late so she could leave early)? Whatever it was, you definitely weren’t supposed to joke about it.Ryan was amazed that her fellatio sequence generated outrage – she liked the guy! She also wanted to go home early. But it cracked open something broader: a strategic absolutism around sex, a sense that the price of the #MeToo movement was performed chastity. “I’ve always found this interesting, in debates about sex, consent and exploitation, the people who don’t understand the nuance of it. Therefore ifthisis abuse, why isn’tthatabuse?” She brings up Donald Trump supporterscomparing his commentson grabbing women by the pussy to Beyoncé singing about sex in her song Formation. “Trump supporters said: ‘Well, how’s that different?’ I thought: ‘How is it similar?’”She would never have moved to London in 2008had it not been for her then boyfriend. “Everyone said: ‘Don’t go to London, they have rats there.’ And I hated it, because I was instantly poor.”View image in fullscreen‘I knew I had jokes’ ... Ryan performing standup at Brighton Centre in February 2025.Photograph: Sorcha Bridge/Getty ImagesShe got a job in sales, was diagnosed with lupus, which can sometimes make it difficult to get pregnant, and at 23, decided to try to have a baby. “When you’re first diagnosed with something – I was quite ill at the time – you go to the worst-case scenario. My rationale with my boyfriend was, we’ve had so many ups and downs, if we haven’t split up by now, we never will. Now I see how long life is, and how many things can change. But at 23, I couldn’t see it.” She managed to get pregnant and had Violet.The next bit sounds as white-knuckle as one of those 1980s John Cleese films. While on maternity leave, she would look after Violet in the day and try to break into standup in the evening, taking her daughter with her. She knew from her sales job that she had no problem winning people over, and she had faith in her quickfire wit from her time at Hooters; more than that, she says simply, “I knew I had jokes.” The whole circuit was shot through with sexism – she won the Funny Women award in 2008, just over a year after she’d started performing, a prize that was conceived in the context of a turgid, continuing debate about whether womencouldbe funny. All the bookers were male, the comperes would performatively forget her name, or apologise to the audience that they had a girl coming on next, because of political correctness. She says female standups were “discouraged from being feminine … I think we were doing our best just to be invisible or emulate what the boys were doing. Bookers would say, ‘Women will be jealous of you, men will be distracted by you.’ But that wasn’t true.”Yet she loved being the underdog. “If you could win an audience back from there, it really felt good,” Ryan says. And she started winning newcomer awards. Her agent suggested she do an hour at the Edinburgh fringe, and she put together a sort of cabaret, dressed in a pageant tutu, because she didn’t have the material for 60 minutes of jokes. “Critically, that was panned far and wide. Very fair, bad reviews. But I think people admired my balls from the start.”View image in fullscreen‘I love money. I also think it’s provocative to talk about that’ … Ryan in The Duchess.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/Netflix © 2020She is scrupulously vague about Violet’s father, and has landed on an origin story for her daughter. “I tell Violet that she was very powerful. She was like a star in the sky. She wanted to be born. And to be born, she had to bring us together, at that time, and I’m glad that she was powerful enough to make that happen.” But Ryan realised pretty soon that Violet’s father “wasn’t going to be beneficial to us, financially or logistically”. From that point on, at still only 25, Ryan just got her head down. “I was going home to a baby. I didn’t mess around, I didn’t stay out for drinks, I didn’t have flatmates. I’d had a youth already – I didn’t take drugs or do anything too wild back in Canada, but I went to the Playboy Mansion, I got to be a podium dancer, I got to work at Hooters, we had fake IDs at 14, we were having bush parties. I’d done all that. By the time I was in London, I thought: ‘Now let’s get serious.’” Besides, she felt she couldn’t go back to Canada as a single parent. “There was a time when I really felt shame about it. There was this sense that I had chosen badly; in heteronormative relationships, women are the gatekeepers of who gets to be a father.”When Violet was six months old, Ryan successfully auditioned for Victoria Pile’s semi-improvised TV sitcom Campus – she was the worst thing in it, she says now, but the money kept her afloat for the next two years, and she’ll take that as a win. Then she got a spot on 8 Out of 10 Cats, and “after that, the phone didn’t stop ringing”. The way she tells it, she almost manifested her career. “Armed with the knowledge that my daughter deserved a really great life, and that I had cocked up enough things for us that I had to make good fast, and I knew I had jokes, I would overwrite and overprepare for auditions. I would walk into those rooms completely believing that I deserved to be there, that I would make the show better and that I should be cast.”View image in fullscreen‘My daughter deserved a really great life’ … Ryan with her daughter Violet in 2025.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockRyan has also never observed the celebrity omertà around money, the collective fantasy that everyone’s just doing what they love and, oh, wow, someone just sent a cheque to lil ol’ me. “I love money. I also think it’s provocative to talk about that. When I madeThe Duchess for Netflix, the lead female character, who was not based on my life but was obviously inspired by elements of it, did pottery and was really rich. It was questioned by the production company, all the way along. ‘Why does the daughter have a horse? She can’t have a horse.’ I was, like: ‘Why not? My daughter has a horse.’ Anyway, they killed the horse. No horse.”Her latest show,Out of Order, which returns for a second series, is a comics’ ensemble piece that she co-hosts with the comedian Rosie Jones. In a concept that feels almost essence-of-Ryan, teams of comedians compete to place members of the public in the right order in categories such as “who earns the most?” and “who’s had the most one-night stands?”. It has been eye-opening for her to see the abuse Jones gets online: “Rosie’s got being a lesbian, being disabled and being a woman, and the type of people who are happy to vocally abuse her, from their work account, just goes to show why it’s so necessary to have her front and centre. The show has loads of contributors who are gender-fluid or disabled or some type of alternative, but at the core of it, it’s just so funny.”She’s interesting on politics, never overtly agitprop, instinctively countercultural. “I think comedians have always decorated the truth with little lies to make you laugh. Politicians decorate a lie with little truths so that you almost believe them. So I think we’re like the photonegative of each other, though all of us need an audience and need to be liked, we share that in common.” She believes the comic’s purpose is nobler. “The real provocation is just demanding that people stop bullshitting themselves and each other.”Katherine Ryan’s standup special First Born Daughter is available on SkyComedy.

This marathon concert, on what would have been his 95th birthday, celebrated them with warm affection.The music reflected Brendel’s own passions, skewing towards the classical repertoire. It began with Haydn’s Representation of Chaos from The Creation; but the evening’s punchlines came later. The orchestra, an ad hoc group of Brendel’s colleagues, proteges and friends, included leading orchestral and chamber musicians – and, in the case of Brett Dean, a composer reverting to his former viola-player persona. They were enthusiastically responsive to Simon Rattle’s conducting, leaning in to surges of sound or dropping back to the softest pianissimos.View image in fullscreenThe Takács Quartet, joined by Adrian Brendel (2nd from right), play Schubert’s Quintet.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouProceeds all went to theAlfred BrendelYoung Musician’s Trust, which gives students access to professional-standard pianos. This was no pushy fundraiser, though, and a general lack of speeches made the atmosphere less reverential; the music really did do the talking. So, too, did the presence of so many pianists who counted Brendel as a mentor. Imogen Cooper joined the orchestra and soprano Lucy Crowe in Mozart’s ariaCh’io scordi di te …; later, Tim Horton duetted with Brendel’s cellist son Adrian in an intensely felt performance of Liszt’s Elégie No 2, and Till Fellner and Paul Lewis teamed up for Schubert’s A minor Allegro, D947.View image in fullscreenThe music really did the talking: Lucy Crowe with Imogen Cooper at the piano for a Mozart aria, part of Alfred Brendel a Musical Celebration at the Barbican.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouThere was (seemingly) unplanned humour: some ongoing shtick involving the six pianists and their several piano stools, which apparently aren’t as interchangeable as you might think; and a moment when we weren’t sure whether we were applauding the arrival on stage of András Schiff to play JS Bach or the return to his seat in the audience of the evening’s doughty page-turner – a familiar face to Brendel’s London fans. And the musical comedy mostly worked too: not so much the obscure piece for “three left hands” by Mauricio Kagel that briefly united Rattle, Horton and Pierre-Laurent Aimard at the piano, but Brendel would have been delighted that the sold-out audience fell so eagerly into the trap of Haydn’s false ending to the finale of his Symphony No 90, not once but twice. A sequence of Brendel’s own drily humorous poems, interspersed with miniatures by Kurtág and Ligeti, came off thanks to the contrast between Harriet Walter’s delivery and Aimard’s controlled silliness at the piano.View image in fullscreenSurreal… a military-style band bookended the Brendel Celebration concert.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouIn surreal style, this sequence was bookended by a small military-style band – in scarlet coats, epaulettes and bearskin hats – playing two of Kagel’s Marches to Fall Short of Victory, shambolic in a very precisely written way. Perhaps it was equally, appropriately surreal that this flowed so well into the tense, tiptoeing darkness that opens Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No 3, the final work, with a solo performance by Lewis full of weight and conviction.View image in fullscreenAcceptance and thankfulness as well as loss: Simon Rattle at the Alfred Brendel a Musical Celebration concert at the Barbican.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouFor many, though, the evening’s highlight will have been the slow movement from Schubert’s C major Quintet, played by the Takács Quartet plus Adrian Brendel. It’s a piece in which there’s a sense that the melody is somehow missing, and it speaks sweetly but powerfully not only of absence, but of acceptance and thankfulness too. Here it said all those things eloquently, and more.Explore more on these topicsAlfred BrendelClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, on the flanks of Bickerton Hill, it is said that in the 18th century a heartbroken man calledJohn Harris of Handleylived as a hermit for several decades.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As locations to weather the storm of romantic trauma go, this – I mused as I stood above it on a crisp winter’s day – certainly takes some beating. Offering a panorama of nine counties of England and Wales from its entrance, I could spy the white disc of Jodrell Bank Observatory glistening in the sunlight, while the peaks and troughs of the Clwydian range appeared like a watermark in the distance.A map of places the walk on the Sandstone TrailI’d come here, not seeking solitude, but to meet up with Jose, an old friend I’d not seen for nine years, and to try a new walking package dreamed up by two Cheshire pubs along a prime section of the 34-mile (55km)Sandstone Trailbetween the villages of Tarporley and Malpas. The route follows theSandstone Ridge, an ancient landscape of escarpments and rolling hills, rising from the Cheshire Plain.View image in fullscreenA walker on the Sandstone Trail near Beeston Castle.Photograph: UK City Images/AlamyThe idea for the walk is simple: just because it’s winter doesn’t mean it has to be hard. Daylight hours are limited, the weather is less predictable, so why not stick to one 14-mile stretch, bookended with a comfy, warm room in each inn, and good food and drink – dinner on both nights and a cooked breakfast are included, as is an optional packed lunch. The pubs arrange the luggage transfer and a taxi when you finish to take you back to the start.We met in the Swan in Tarporley – a 16th-century coaching inn, where, in front of a roaring open fire, we caught up on old times, studied the walk map and enjoyed food made from ingredients farmed practically on the doorstep. As we tucked into the cheeseboard (Tarporley blue comes highly recommended), owner Woody Barlow told us how the idea was born in the summer when they held a charity fun run between the two pubs in memory of the late owner Si Lees-Jones.At this time of year, the trail has a lovely stillness about it – the woods and ridgelines look magical in the winter light“It was so successful, we began to think – these two pubs have always been popular with walkers, cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts, especially those doing the Sandstone Trail in sections,” he said. “Many were trying to organise accommodation night by night, but we realised we could offer something much more streamlined. Plus at this time of year, the trail has a lovely stillness about it – the woods and ridgelines look magical in the winter light.”I woke the next morning to the sound of rain on my window, but as I met Jose for breakfast – a hearty helping of eggs – the sky unexpectedly began to clear. Leaving the town, we followed country lanes, where the hedges bloomed with sloes. Acorns cracked under our boots. These nuts would once have been used for nourishing pigs before the start of medieval feasts – like those once held inBeeston Castle, the former royal fort built by the Earl of Cheshire on his return from the crusades in the 1220s, which filled the horizon.View image in fullscreenFog cloaks the trail high on the Sandstone Ridge.Photograph: George Pollock/AlamyWe cut through a muddy field, making a beeline for this landmark, then followed the Sandstone Trail waymarks over the Shropshire Union Canal at Wharton’s Lock. We reached the tall red walls of rubble-filled sandstone blocks and huge wooden doors of the castle, said to house treasure from Richard II.It was a tempting prospect, but with miles still to cover we made our way instead through the network of weaving pathways on Peckforton Hills, topped with towering red pines that give shelter from the icy wind but allow light to drop to the forest floor in dazzling spindles. Here we came across a Victorian castle folly built in the 1840s and now a hotel popular with wedding parties, but we were more taken with nature’s treasures in the form of sweet chestnuts on neighbouringBulkeley Hill. The bark of these old trees would have once been used by passing Romans to tan leather and the nuts were essential rations for legionnaires.The light emanating from the windows of the 300-year-old Lion pub welcomed us to our big finish nearly as warmly as the staffWe stopped here a while, enjoying our sandwiches from the pub on our first exposure to some of the tor-like sandstone that the ridge is named for, before soldiering on to our next summit – Raw Head on Bickerton Hill. At 227 metres (745ft), it’s not huge, but it is the highest point on the trail. We wandered through the forest talking about its history (its rocks were formed about 250m years ago in the Triassic period, and iron oxide has caused them to become banded in hues of red, terracotta and ochre, which cement the sand together) and our own past lives, discussing friends we once shared.As the sun hung ever lower in the sky, we still had some climbing to do on Bickerton Hill, home to the hermit’s cave. The area is replete with lowland heath, once used for grazing, thatching, and foraging. Bilberries still grow there.View image in fullscreenThe Lion in Malpas.Photograph: Phoebe SmithWe traced the edges of Maiden Castle – the remains of an iron age hill fort built between 500 and 600BC and still occupied when the Romans arrived in Britain – before descending to country lanes, where someone had kindly left a wheelbarrow of apples for hikers.The light emanating from the windows of the 300-year-old Lion pub welcomed us to our big finish nearly as warmly as the staff, who were suitably impressed with the distance we’d walked, making us feel like we’d had a proper adventure.Before we retired to bed we raised a glass – to the views, the hearty food and, of course, to heartbroken John Harris – in short, to our perfect winter walk.

What can Iuse instead?Jill, via emailCoconut milk brings silkiness and sweet richness to curries, and also mellows spices, so any substitute will likely change the nature of the dish. That said, if you really want to avoid the white stuff, Karan Gokani, author ofIndian 101, would simply replace it with vegetable stock. Another easy swap (if you’re not averse to dairy) is yoghurt, says John Chantarasak, chef and co-owner ofAngloThaiin London, which is handy, because “that’s normally hanging about in the fridge”.Not all curries involve coconut milk, however, and it’s these that perhaps offer a better solution to Jill’s conundrum. “Once you get past that idea, you go into two realms,” says Sirichai Kularbwong of Thai restaurantSingburiin London, by which he means wet and dry curries. The latter involve frying curry paste (“usually containing dried chillies”) and seasoning with fish sauce (“in Jill’s case, a vegan fish sauce”), tamarind and sugar. “The consistency of the sauce is never thin, and you pair it with root vegetables and flat beans, and eat alongside rice,” he adds. Meanwhile, a favourite wet curry that doesn’t call for coconut milk isgaeng om, made with “a simple curry paste of garlic, chillies and lemongrass boiled with good veg stock and seasoned with vegan fish sauce”. Veg-wise, to that base you’d typically add pumpkin, mushrooms, maybe pak choi.Sundays are often batch-cook days round at Chantarasak’s, and start with roasting a cauliflower or squash with oil, salt and perhaps some garam masala. Next, you need a sauce: “Sweat onions, garlic and ginger, then add fenugreek leaf, green cardamom and nuts [cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, say], and saute.” Blend the lot with water until smooth, then return to the pan, add some yoghurt and stir in the roast veg.Vivek Singh, founder and executive chef ofthe Cinnamon Collection restaurants, would also go for cauliflower: “It’s a staple in so many households, and you can go basic with the spices, or get quite involved with cardamom, a cinnamon stick, cloves and a bay leaf.” Either way, start by heating oil in a pan, then add the whole spices and let them crackle. “Add sliced or chopped onions and cook, stirring, on high heat for 12-13 minutes, until caramelised. If you have some ginger and garlic paste, add that now, along with ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, ground red chilli powder and salt.” Fry for 30 seconds, tip in chopped or tinned tomatoes and peeled and diced raw potatoes (plus carrots, if you fancy). “Fry for a few minutes, then add cauliflower florets and fry for two minutes. Cover, sweat on low for five minutes, take off the lid and stir, giving it some real elbow grease.” Pour in a cup of water, bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. “Add a sprinkle of garam masala and a crumble of dried fenugreek leaves, if you have some, then stir in chopped fresh coriander and a squeeze of lemon.” Don’t forget to serve with chapatis.Finally,a simple rasamis sure to cosset and hug, especially this month. “It’s a south Indian tomato and black pepper broth,” Gokani says, “and it’s brilliant just sipped from a cup.” And who couldn’t do with some of that right about now?Got a culinary dilemma?

Pat the drained chickpeas dry with kitchen towel, then tip them on to the lined sheet. Add the olive oil, salt and spices, toss well, then bake for 15-20 minutes, until crisp.For the salad, use your hands to mix all the ingredients in a bowl, gently massaging the parsley and red onion as you do so. You can do this a few hours in advance, or even the night before.For the aïoli, mix all the ingredients in a bowl and season to taste.In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the rösti. Put a generous glug of neutral oil in a frying pan on a low-medium heat, then spoon in half the rösti mixture and flatten into a circle. Leave to cook for five to seven minutes, until the edges crisp up and the base releases itself from the pan, then carefully flip and cook for another five to seven minutes on the other side, until golden. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the residual heat of the oven while you repeat with the remaining rösti mix. If you’re serving more people, or want an easier time flipping the rösti, make them smaller, but bear in mind that the cooking time per side will be shorter.To assemble, put the rösti on a platter, drizzle the mustard aïoli on top, followed by a sprinkling of the crisp chickpeas and a generous heap of the pickled salad. Save any leftover chickpeas or aïoli to use in salads or sandwiches.Ferment: Simple Ferments and Pickles, and How to Eat Them, by Kenji Morimoto, is published by Pan Macmillan at £22.

Three in 10 adults in the UK are thought to have hypertension – high blood pressure – but an estimated 5 million are unaware that they have it.Health campaigners said the findings should prompt ministers to take tough action to cut the amount of salt in food, including limits on how much can be added and fines to ensure compliance.Adults in England consume on average 8.4g of salt a day, 40% more than the government’s recommended maximum of 6g. The difference was equivalent to the salt in six bags of crisps, the BHF said. A 32-40g bag of salted crisps typically contains 0.38g of salt.“The government must step in to make the healthy choice much easier for families by giving manufacturers an incentive to take out excessive amounts of salt from our food,” said Stanford.Sonia Pombo, the head of impact and research at the campaign group Action on Salt, said: “Salt reduction is one of the simplest, most cost-effective actions any government can take to improve population health.“It requires minimal behaviour change from consumers because the vast majority of salt in our diets comes from the food we buy, not what we add at the table. That means the most effective action must focus on the food industry.“We need legally binding salt reduction targets across all food categories, with clear timelines and consequences for non-compliance, alongside fiscal levers such as a levy on foods that exceed maximum salt thresholds.”Compulsory front-of-pack labelling would also help consumers clearly identify products high in salt, she added.The Department of Health said it was cracking down on unhealthy food. A spokesperson added: “This government is taking strong action to tackle health problems caused by poor diet as part of our 10-year health plan, which will shift the focus of care from sickness to prevention.“We are restricting advertising of junk food on TV and online, limiting volume price promotions on less healthy foods, including those high in salt, and introducing mandatory reporting on healthier food sales.”Explore more on these topicsFoodHealthSnacksHealth policyEnglandNHSHeart diseasenewsShareReuse this content"
